HEADLINE: New World Bank Chief Says Aiding Africa Is His Top Goal

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
When he becomes president of the World Bank on Wednesday, Paul D. Wolfowitz says, Africa will be his top priority. 
 ''Nothing would be more satisfying than to feel at the end of however long a term I serve here that we played a role in changing Africa from a continent of despair to a continent of hope,'' he said Tuesday at his first news conference.
 To underline that commitment, he will travel to Africa in June.
 Mr. Wolfowitz becomes the 10th president of the bank, the world's largest development organization, at a time when experts are again asking basic questions about what works in pulling countries out of poverty. 
 One of the few things most development institutions agree on is the need for a large increase in development aid. The United Nations and the World Bank under James D. Wolfensohn, the departing president, have called for the world's rich nations to double the aid given to the poor.
 After meeting with most of the bank's own experts over the last two weeks and reading dozens of books on the debate, Mr. Wolfowitz said he was relieved to be taking over the institution at a time when people are willing to experiment and exhibit ''a certain open-mindedness.
 ''There's been a healthy change in the development approach,'' he said. ''It's no longer one size fits all.''
 Surveying the array of issues tied up in the goal of reducing poverty, Mr. Wolfowitz said he would emphasize finding solutions in partnership with the countries involved; ensuring that women have the same opportunities as men; restoring the bank's role of building structures like roads, ports and bridges in poor countries; and coordinating the bank's efforts with other donors and institutions. 
 ''The best approach is to put the people in developing countries in the driver's seat,'' he said, adding that this often requires humility and patience.
 He also singled out corruption as a major problem in development.
 ''Corruption is the biggest threat to democracy since communism,'' he said.
 Mr. Wolfowitz comes directly to the World Bank from the United States Defense Department, where he was the deputy secretary and involved with the Iraq war, with its divisiveness. He said he hoped to leave the Pentagon behind him in his new job.
 His arrival, however, has been greeted with a letter of protest signed by 303 groups from 62 countries. And he said he has had to convince skeptics within and outside the institution that he will not use the World Bank to pursue the foreign policy agenda of President Bush.
 ''I'll do that by being objective and credible,'' he said.
 Mr. Wolfowitz said, however, that it has been far more common for foreign officials to ask him if he could help them out with his special access to the White House or Congress.
 Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Wolfowitz for the position in March and he won unanimous approval from the World Bank's board. The United States has named all of the bank's presidents since its founding as part of the United Nations system, a practice that is coming under increasing criticism.
 Africa will dominate Mr. Wolfensohn's work over the next months. After returning from his trip, he will attend the annual meeting of the Group of 8 industrial nations in Scotland in July. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the host, has placed Africa at the center of that agenda, and Mr. Wolfowitz has closely studied the report that Mr. Blair's commission on Africa prepared for the session.
 The report's recommendations include abolishing many of the agricultural subsidies of rich nations, increasing aid to Africa by $25 billion and strengthening protection of the environment, policies that are at odds with the administration and many in Congress.
 His reading list also includes: ''Why Globalization Works,'' by Martin Wolf; ''The World's Banker,'' by Sebastian Mallaby; ''Development as Freedom,'' by Amartya Sen; and ''Voice for the World's Poor,'' a collection Mr. Wolfensohn's speeches.
 Added to that pile of reading material was a thick study released on Tuesday by the Center for Global Development, a nonpartisan institute, listing the five tasks it says Mr. Wolfowitz needs to accomplish.

HEADLINE: A Resounding Philharmonic

BYLINE: By JEREMY EICHLER

 BODY:
The most traditional way to observe Memorial Day weekend in Manhattan may be to flee the city, but for more than a decade the New York Philharmonic has been building its own holiday ritual: a free performance at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. Monday night's concert was its 14th such offering, tempting music fans to stay local, and consoling those with nowhere to go. 
 Bad weather has affected turnout in recent years, but not this time. Lines began forming four hours before the start time, orchestra officials said, estimating that 3,000 listeners were in the cathedral. 
 For the first time the concert was conducted not by the orchestra's music director -- Kurt Masur at first, Lorin Maazel more recently -- but instead by Xian Zhang, the Philharmonic's assistant conductor and a winner of the Maazel-Vilar conducting competition in 2002. She led a program consisting of Tchaikovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet'' Fantasy-Overture and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade.''
 Mr. Maazel's decision to relinquish the podium can be seen as a vote of confidence in Ms. Zhang, who made her subscription debut with the orchestra in January and is to lead it in six of the seven concerts in the parks this summer. But one also imagines that Mr. Maazel shed few tears in stepping aside on this particular occasion. The overly resonant acoustics of the cathedral make clarity of sound nearly impossible to achieve, and such working conditions could not have endeared the space to such a meticulous conductor. Still, you have to wonder about the message projected by Mr. Maazel's withdrawal from such a high-profile event on the Philharmonic's calendar. 
 Ms. Zhang did not seem too concerned with the acoustics. She led carefully paced and supple readings of both works, with a podium technique of grace and economy, and made few concessions to the echoes that reverberated long after a note had sounded. Unfortunately, certain sections of the music simply vanished, as when the strings in the Tchaikovsky tried to play quietly beneath the winds and brass. One could see the players' motion onstage, but for measures at a time it remained a silent ballet. 
 Other instruments seemed to love the space. Glenn Dicterow's violin solos in ''Scheherazade'' sounded warm and sweet, and at least from my seat, the French horn lines came with a special surround-sound effect, as if they were being played in unison by musicians in the audience. If only the Philharmonic could siphon off a bit of the cathedral's resonance and smuggle it back into Avery Fisher Hall. 
 For its part, the audience seemed more grateful than perturbed, receiving Ms. Zhang and the orchestra with a prolonged ovation.

HEADLINE: North Korea, Facing Food Shortages, Mobilizes Millions From the Cities to Help Rice Farmers

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, June 1 

 BODY:
To combat growing food shortages, the North Korean government is sending millions of city dwellers to work on farms each weekend, largely to transplant rice, according to foreign aid workers.
 ''The staff that work for us, the staff that work in the ministries, are going out to help farmers,'' said Richard Ragan, director of World Food Program operations in Pyongyang, referring to North Koreans who work for the program. Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, he said that in terms of food supplies North Koreans ''are inching back to the precipice.''
 ''It does happen every year,'' he said of the mobilization of workers to the fields, ''but the difference this year is that everyone is involved.'' 
 Gerald Bourke, a World Food Program spokesman, said Wednesday that on a recent visit to the port of Wonsan, ''We saw thousands of people who were marching out of the city.''
 ''Later, we saw them digging out irrigation canals,'' he said, speaking by telephone from Beijing. 
 A decade ago, up to two million North Koreans starved to death in one of the rare peacetime famines of modern history. The famine was caused by a cutoff in Soviet aid, a collapse of North Korea's industrial economy, and the reluctance of a highly xenophobic government to receive foreign aid.
 Now, with worldwide opposition to Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, foreign food aid is drying up.
 ''At end of June, I cut 2.5 million people off from their food rations,'' said Mr. Ragan, an American, referring to a group equal to 10 percent of North Korea's population. Unless new food comes quickly from the outside, the number of North Koreans receiving foreign food aid will plunge to 1.5 million in August, from 6.5 million people this spring.
 The World Food Program, the largest foreign food supplier to North Korea, has received only 6 percent of the 230,000 tons it needs this year, Anthony Banbury, Asia director for the United Nations agency, told a news conference in Seoul last Friday, according to Reuters.
 Referring to government rations, he said, ''What the government is able to provide the people now, these 250 grams a day, is a starvation ration.''
 About 70 percent of North Korea's population lives in cities, where the collapse of a state food distribution system and partial free market reforms have forced them to buy food at market prices. 
 Since August 2003, the market prices of rice and corn have increased fivefold, hitting 750 won per kilo of rice on Wednesday. 
 North Korean monthly salaries, which have not changed during that time, average about 2,400 won. The official exchange rate is 140 won to the dollar. The unofficial rate is 2,550 won to the dollar.
 Residents of smaller cities increasingly farm plots of marginal land on nearby hillsides. Only 18 percent of North Korea is considered suitable for farming.
 On April 11, the annual meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly approved two major policies for the year: increasing national defense against the United States and improving farm production.
 ''Agriculture is the main front in the socialist economic construction this year,'' Premier Pak Pong Ju said in a speech to the assembly, a rubber-stamp group that routinely approves legislation within a few hours, without debate.
 The state will spend ''29 percent more funds than the previous year on agriculture so that all efforts of the country can be directed to decisively solve the people's food problem,'' said the North Korean finance minister, Mun Il Bong. According to the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, ''appeared on the platform'' at the assembly meeting.
 The weekend mass mobilizations appear to be intended to help farms where machinery no longer works due to lack of parts or fuel.
 North Korea's economy has contracted by nearly 20 percent since 1990, when consumer prices are taken into account, according to a report released Tuesday by The Bank of Korea. The bank, a South Korean government institution, estimated that, in constant terms, North Korea's economy grew by 2.2 percent in 2004, and 1.8 percent in 2003.
 Foreign aid workers predict a summer of severe food shortages for North Korea's urban dwellers.

HEADLINE: Dollar Is Up Sharply Against Euro and Gains on the Yen

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply against the euro and climbed against the Japanese yen yesterday, as the yield of the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 3.98 percent, its lowest since October. Shares ended lower but still had their best month of the year.
 The main driver for the dollar against the euro was the vote in France on Sunday rejecting the proposed European constitution and the expectation that it will be rejected in a vote today in the Netherlands. In the aftermath of the defeat, President Jacques Chirac of France replaced his prime minister. 
 The sharp fall for the euro since Sunday and the jump for the dollar has surprised some currency analysts, who thought that the defeat of the constitution in France had been anticipated, based on polls ahead of the vote.
 ''It was a really big 'no,''' said Jeffrey Young, head of currency research at Citigroup Global Markets, referring to the 55 percent to 45 percent vote against the constitution. ''It really does create questions of how decisions are going to be made in Europe.''
 In afternoon trading, the dollar was up 2.1 percent from Friday, with the euro valued at $1.2312, its weakest since October. The dollar was up 0.5 percent against the yen since Friday, to 108.50 yen. The foreign exchange markets were effectively closed in New York Monday for Memorial Day.
 The dollar has now risen 10 percent against the euro this year, another surprise for many forecasters, who expected the dollar to tumble for the fourth consecutive year, particularly because of the record current account deficit of the United States.
 ''People have to decide whether they were wrong or if this is another temporary midcourse correction with the trend still the same,'' Mr. Young said.
 Mr. Young said that while he expected the dollar to rise some more in the near term, he is still forecasting that the dollar will fall and the euro rise to a value of $1.38 over the next 12 months. 
 Among other factors weakening the euro was a report yesterday that business sentiment in Europe had fallen to a 21-month low. 
 In the Treasury market, a report that the business index of the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago fell to 54.1 in May, a much bigger decline than expected, helped push Treasury prices higher and yields lower. Treasury prices and yields move in the opposite direction from each other.
 One reason for the rise in Treasury prices is that slower growth makes investors worry less about inflation. Another is that the new data supports the argument of those forecasters who say the economy, both in the United States and abroad, is weaker than is believed. 
 Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a report yesterday that he was now predicting that the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note could fall as low as 3.50 percent over the next year. His main reason is an expectation that a slowdown in China's economic growth will be a drag on growth in Asia and, in turn, a drag on global economic growth.
 In addition, he said, the slower growth and the resulting reduced pressure on commodity prices from oil to copper would temper inflationary expectations.
 Robert Kessler, the president of Kessler Investment Advisors, argued that with the Federal Reserve near the end of its rate-raising cycle, the general outlook for Treasury interest rates over the next year or so should be lower, not higher. 
 The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.98 percent, from 4.07 percent Friday, while the price rose 13/32, to 1015/32.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 7.28 points, or 0.6 percent to 1,191.50 while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 7.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,068.22. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,467.48.
 For the month, the Nasdaq was up 7.6 percent, its best monthly performance since October 2003. The S.&P. 500, up 3 percent, and the Dow, up 2.7 percent, had their best monthly performances since December. 
 Following are yesterday's auction for three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: New Jersey Takes Credit as Pfizer Breaks Ground on Center

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. 

 BODY:
Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, the makers of over-the-counter products including Zantac, Neosporin, Listerine and the Bengay patch, broke ground yesterday on a research and development complex that is being built with state incentives to keep and increase pharmaceutical jobs in the state.
 Observing that New Jersey is known as the nation's medicine chest for its concentration of pharmaceutical companies, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey joined Pfizer officials at their sun-splashed 175-acre campus here to trumpet the news of the $25 million in tax incentives the state has given the company. The building and an adjacent parking garage are the first steps in what the company said will be a $500 million capital program here. 
 The incentives are the first under the state's nearly year-old Business Retention and Relocation Grant program. Under the deal, the state will return to Pfizer for a year the state income taxes paid by each retained or new employee -- up to $1,500 -- who is connected with the expansion. The company will also receive sales tax exemptions on buying building materials, machinery, equipment and furniture connected with the expansion. Mr. Codey said the exemptions would help keep the 2,000 jobs now at the site.
 ''This groundbreaking is a symbol of our economy's strength and a reflection of New Jersey's dominance in the research and life sciences industry,'' said Mr. Codey, who observed that the state approached Pfizer about 18 months ago when it learned from trade publications that the company was considering relocation offers from other states for a planned expansion.
 Neither Mr. Codey nor Marc Robinson, the president of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, would say just how seriously the company had been considering those offers. But Mr. Codey said the incentives were necessary in a state that was good at attracting, but not always good at retaining, high-salary jobs. Citing the state's nearly two consecutive years of unemployment rates around 4.2 percent, a percentage point below the national average, he said the incentives were part of the proactive posture New Jersey must take to continue such trends.
 In addition to the 2,000 people employed here, Pfizer Consumer Healthcare employs another 3,000 at other locations in the state, including Basking Ridge, Parsippany, Bridgewater and Peapack. 
 In all, 14 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies have sizable presences in New Jersey, with 11 of them housing their global or corporate headquarters in the state. The industry directly employs 63,000 people in New Jersey and supports another 93,000 jobs indirectly. In 2003 the total pharmaceutical payroll for the state was $6 billion; the companies paid $213 million in sales and income tax. The HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, an industry group, estimated the industry's total impact on the state's economy in 2003 at $23 billion. The group said the average industry salary that year was $85,423. 
 Mr. Robinson, the company's president, said that as part of the expansion, the company was financing the widening to four lanes from two lanes of the nearly half-mile, north-south stretch of State Road 53, which bisects its property. It is also contributing to the state's rebuilding of the Route 53 interchange with Route 10.

 BODY:
INTERMINABLE security lines have become a routine part of air travel. The inconvenience seems a small price to pay for increased safety. After all, we tell ourselves, it's a burden all passengers share. 
 But this isn't quite true. At some of the busiest airports in the country, including ones in New York City, Miami and Los Angeles, passengers with premium-class tickets or upper-level memberships in airline clubs are now able to cut the line. 
 When they show their boarding passes and identification these passengers are directed into a separate luxury lane to be screened by Transportation Security Administration employees. The person checking boarding passes is often an airline employee. The security screening personnel and equipment are part of the federal agency and are financed in part by a flat fee added to the purchase price of your airline ticket.
 The agency exists because in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress no longer trusted the airlines with the critical job of balancing security and convenience. By administering special lanes for airlines' most favored customers, the agency is serving the wrong master. At Los Angeles International Airport for example, Transportation Security Administration representatives say that if an airline requests, the agency will provide a dedicated security checkpoint for its luxury lane, or allow them to escort those passengers to the front of the line while economy class passengers creep along behind them.
 It is not unheard of for the government to provide different levels of service based on graduated fees. But there is an enormous difference between a passport office offering say, express processing for an added fee -- the surcharge is a legitimate way to maximize both government revenue and quality of service -- and the Transportation Security Administration's providing an expedited service that encourages people to increase an airline's profit by buying a more expensive ticket.
 President Bush should insist that the agency start treating all the people that it was created to protect equally. The agency should take over boarding pass and identification screening in all airports and move passengers through security lines without regard to ticket class or airline club membership. 
 Increased security protects us all and the inconvenience it requires is a trial we all must share. No one should be able to buy his way out of it.

HEADLINE: New Urbanism in Denver

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Since 2002, more than 1,500 houses have sprouted on land here that was once covered by runways from the earliest days of jet travel, as a 7.5-square-mile mixed-use development rises at the former Stapleton airport, about a 15-minute drive east of downtown. 
 Ultimately expected to have a population of 30,000 when it is completed in about 2020, Stapleton is believed to be the largest project ever undertaken to fill in vacant or underused urban land. 
 Set against a backdrop of the downtown skyline and the Front Range of the Rockies, the project has been widely praised as a model of ''new urbanism.'' The houses, mimicking the style found in older, walkable neighborhoods here, are close together, with the garages in back and only the tiniest of yards. Front porches encourage passersby to stop and chat. About 1,100 acres have been set aside for parks. 
 ''From our perspective, it's one of the best examples of 'smart growth' in the Denver region,'' said Will Coyne, the land-use advocate for Environment Colorado, a nonprofit organization that often criticizes large-scale development.
 Homes at Stapleton are going up faster than anyone anticipated. Forest City Enterprises, the Cleveland-based company that was chosen in 1999 to manage the development of Stapleton, was required to buy 1,090 acres of the city-owned land in the first five years, a deadline it met in four. Residents can choose among about 20 home builders, with prices ranging from $100,000 or so for a condominium to more than $1 million for a house facing a park.
 The one weak spot has been some of the condominium housing intended for low-income families. Recently, the developer -- a local company without experience in affordable housing, according to Jackie Morales-Ferrand, the city's director of housing and neighborhood development -- defaulted on $4.7 million in city loans. Ms. Morales-Ferrand said the condos might have been too small and too expensive for the market. 
 An ambitious project like Stapleton requires a vast amount of financing, much more than can be generated from residential property taxes alone. So, to enter Stapleton from Interstate 70 is to be confronted with the very emblem of suburban sprawl, a conventional 750,000-square-foot big-box shopping center called Quebec Square with huge parking lots that can accommodate 5,000 cars, a Wal-Mart Supercenter, a Sam's Club warehouse store and a Home Depot. 
 Big-box stores are not mentioned in the Stapleton development guidelines that were issued in 1995, the year that the 66-year-old airport was replaced by a much larger one. The plan is full of lofty language about creating a community with a ''unique identity'' and a ''high-quality sustainable physical environment'' that ''accommodates a diversity of people -- ages, incomes, races, occupations and lifestyles.''
 Zac Ryon, a consultant for nonprofit organizations, who moved to Stapleton because he wanted ''the look of an old house with the closet size of a new house,'' says the community has attracted socially conscious residents who find the shopping center unappealing. 
 ''The bulk of my neighbors won't shop there,'' said Mr. Ryon, who is also a spokesman for Gaypleton, a group with a mailing list of 180 people that aims to represent the development's growing population of gay residents.
 A local research organization, the Front Range Economic Strategy Center, recently complained that Quebec Square had only a handful of local retailers and it criticized city policies that appeared to favor national chain stores. 
 But officials say that at Stapleton, as in many other large developments, the shopping center is being used to generate the tax revenue needed to transform the former airport. Another economic engine will be NorthField, a 1.1-million-square-foot outdoor regional mall being built north of I-70. It will include a Super Target Superstore, a Bass Pro Shop, a Foley's department store and a movie theater.
 Officials estimated in 1999 that it would cost $346 million to build the major roads, sewer mains, drainage facilities and parks. To pay for most of these improvements, the Denver Urban Renewal Authority is using an increasingly popular program known as tax-increment financing, or TIF, backed by bonds to be repaid through the additional property and sales taxes generated by the project. 
 The city agency has issued $275 million worth of these bonds for Stapleton, its largest such project by far, said Tracy M. Huggins, the executive director. A part of the incremental revenue will be used to reimburse the city for the additional burden on services.
 As a generator of tax revenue, however, retail is much more significant than housing. Hank Baker, a senior vice president at Forest City Stapleton, said that Quebec Square, which opened in 2002, brings in $8 million annually in property and sales tax, nearly seven times the amount from the project's first 1,000 homes. (An affiliated company, Forest City Ratner, is the development partner of The New York Times Company for its new headquarters in Manhattan.) 
 ''Residential development doesn't pay enough taxes to pay for the services it requires,'' said John J. Huggins (no relation to Tracy), the city's director of economic development. ''Retail development, especially large-format retail, is the most coveted kind for a TIF district.''
 As originally envisioned, Stapleton was to have 10 million square feet of office space. But so far, only 34,000 square feet have been built, with two small medical buildings under construction. There is no demand for new office space because of a high vacancy rate in the city -- 20.8 percent at the end of March, said Reis Inc., a New York research company.
 But major retailers were willing to open at Quebec Square before a single new home was built because they already had a critical mass of customers. Unlike communities built on undeveloped land, Stapleton is surrounded by mostly low-income neighborhoods whose residents were traveling beyond city limits to shop at stores like Wal-Mart, Mr. Gleason said. This demand helped city and community leaders reconcile themselves to Quebec Square, said Laura E. Aldrete, an urban planner who served as the city's project manager for Stapleton.
 Ms. Aldrete said that Quebec Square was likely to be supplanted eventually by a town center with greater density. For one thing, a $4.7 billion light rail system approved by the voters in November is expected to have a Stapleton stop. ''If you put the building blocks in today, you can begin to get a little bit comfortable with the idea that you're putting something suburban into an urban context,'' she said.
 Mr. Gleason said that future retail development at Stapleton would be more in keeping with the newer 58,000-square-foot East 29th Avenue Town Center, which has a mixture of local and national tenants.
 As Stapleton was being planned, said Mr. Huggins, the economic development director, it was not at all clear that the concept would work. But he said the project was attracting people who might otherwise have moved to the suburbs, adding to the sprawl. ''They've managed to create a true community and sense of place very, very quickly,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Teachers' Pay: A Start, Not a Panacea

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As a teacher for more than two decades, I'd suggest that the best way to address the imbalances in providing good teachers for desperately underserved areas is to offer special grants for teacher training that require graduates to dedicate three or more years of teaching in remote or economically strapped areas. 
 The experience will be profound and could make a 100 percent difference to scores of kids and families.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Offer Big Discounts Just for June

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 31 

 BODY:
General Motors will announce a major sales promotion for June that will offer customers the same discounts as G.M. employees for most of the company's 2005 model cars and trucks, people with knowledge of the plan said. 
 The strategy is expected to be announced on Wednesday along with sales results for May. It could lead to hundreds or thousands of dollars of additional discounts on some vehicles. 
 G.M. has led Detroit's price war since announcing its Keep America Rolling marketing campaign, which introduced zero-percent financing, to lure shoppers back after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But G.M.'s incentive offers have increasingly been failing to lure customers. Offering everyone employee discounts could mean great deals for consumers, but lead to slimmer per vehicle profits for G.M. and its dealers. 
 People with knowledge of the plan said it would allow consumers to buy vehicles at about 2 percent to 3 percent below the invoice price. One dealer, who asked not to be named, said that under such a plan, one could buy a Hummer H2 for about $50,000. The vehicle's current price after incentives, according to Edmunds. com, is $52,143. 
 The same dealer said the program could thin dealer profits on an average Chevrolet to between $400 and $500 from $700 to $800. 
 The plan was reported by The Detroit Free Press. 
 A spokeswoman for G.M., Deborah Silverman, said, ''We have nothing to announce today and we're not reacting to the press reports that are out there.''
 When told of the plan, David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, said the cost for G.M. would depend on how they alter other incentives. 
 ''It could be very expensive or they could quietly discontinue other rebates and have it not cost very much,'' he said. But it could address one of G.M.'s chief problems, that it has an excess supply of more than 100 days of all its S.U.V.'s and other light trucks and nearly a 160 day supply of its largest S.U.V.'s, Mr. Healy said. 
 ''Their inventory on the big S.U.V.'s,'' he said, ''is at least twice what it ought to be.''

HEADLINE: 2 Founders Are Arrested: A Fund Firm's Next Move

BYLINE: By Riva D. Atlas; Daniel J. Wakin contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
THE clock has started ticking for investors with Amerindo Investment Advisors, just days after the firm's founders, Alberto W. Vilar and Gary A. Tanaka, were charged with theft of client assets.
 Amerindo, which manages $1.2 billion, has said little since the two top executives were arrested Thursday and charged with stealing more than $5 million. The independent directors of a small mutual fund managed by the firm, the Amerindo Technology Fund, announced late yesterday that they had removed Mr. Tanaka as president and Mr. Vilar as chief executive. 
 The mutual fund is a small part of Amerindo, which manages investments for pension funds and other large institutions. Amerindo specializes in making concentrated investments in ''emerging technology stocks,'' according to its Web site. The firm managed as much as $8 billion before the technology bubble burst in 2000. 
 For the thousand or so investors in the mutual fund, the case against the two will be at the very least disruptive as directors seek new managers. But the nature of the accusations against them may raise more questions in the minds of some investors about the oversight of their money. 
 If convicted, Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Vilar could face a ban from the investment industry, securities lawyers said. Yet even if the two men are ultimately exonerated, for officials at firms that manage corporate and public pension funds there remains a legal obligation to assess the matter and act quickly. 
 ''The duties of an investment fiduciary are not consistent with the presumption of innocence,'' said Edward A.H. Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer. He is the president of the Center for Investment Management Investigations, a unit of the Benchmark Companies in Ocean Ridge, Fla., that investigates money management abuses on behalf of pensions.
 ''If anything, pension fund managers have to operate with a presumption of guilt,'' He said. Fund managers ''need to take immediate steps to determine whether the money being handled by this firm is at risk.''
 Under the circumstances, managers of pension funds have a duty to ''verify the location, control and value placed on employee assets,'' Mr. Siedle said.
 Investors with Amerindo, which has offices in New York and San Francisco, are a diverse lot including the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the Nature Conservancy, FedEx and the city of Stamford, Conn., according to a Standard & Poor's directory of pension funds and their investment managers.
 Several investors said yesterday that, despite some sharp ups and downs in performance, they were generally pleased with the returns.
 ''You have to keep in mind what they do and expect some volatility,'' said Mel Robertson, the chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System, which has $1.7 billion in assets and has been an investor with Amerindo since 1991. Mr. Robertson said he had not decided whether to withdraw Seattle's $23 million with Amerindo. 
 The city of Stamford had an average return of 11 percent on its investment with Amerindo since the end of 1994, a spokesman for the city said. Stamford made an initial investment of $5.5 million with Amerindo, ''the majority of which has been cashed out,'' the spokesman said. The mayor is seeking ''expert advice'' to determine what to do with the assets that remain with Amerindo, he said.
 Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar, which tracks investments, said investors in Amerindo's mutual fund may want to cut their losses rather than await a resolution of the case against Mr. Vilar and Mr. Tanaka.
 The Amerindo Technology Fund has seen its assets dwindle to $98 million as of the end of April, from a peak of $598 million in 1999, a year when the fund returned almost 249 percent, according to Morningstar.
 The technology fund's return fell 64.8 percent in 2000, and declined another 50.8 percent and 31.0 percent in 2001 and 2002. The fund rebounded the next two years, returning 85.1 percent and 23.8 percent in 2003 and 2004, but is down 22.4 percent through April of this year, according to Morningstar.
 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the independent directors of the mutual fund said they had ''rescinded any authority'' from Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Vilar ''to give any instruction with respect to the fund or its assets,'' and had named Dana E. Smith, the fund's chief compliance officer, as the acting president of the fund.
 The directors said they had begun a search for an interim manager or adviser to replace Amerindo as manager of the technology fund. They said they had asked the fund's auditors to conduct a review and had discontinued sales of the fund.
 A spokesman said yesterday that Amerindo would have no comment. 
 On Friday, the firm's lawyer, Eugene R. Licker, said the firm was cooperating with the investigation.
 Yesterday, lawyers for Mr. Vilar requested that the court delay until Friday a hearing to set bail. Mr. Vilar's lawyer, Frederick P. Hafetz, said the defense was trying to come up with an alternative to the $10 million bail set on Friday. Mr. Vilar, who has less than $10,000 in the bank, his lawyers said, will remain held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. 
 ''He vigorously denies the allegations,'' Mr. Hafetz said.

HEADLINE: Taking On a Giant (Whistleblowers Welcome)

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 31 

 BODY:
He's taken on the Bush administration, the war in Iraq and the Fox News Channel. He's forged alliances with grass-roots liberal groups like MoveOn.org, liberal research groups, even liberal churches.
 Yet Robert Greenwald, the producer and director of ''Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism,'' thinks his next documentary-cum-indictment will appeal to gun-toting Bush voters in the Bible belt as much as to the latte-drinking lefties who made his last movie a hit at house parties on both coasts.
 His new project? ''Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price.''
 The diminutive Mr. Greenwald, 61, is leading this assault on the retailing behemoth of Bentonville, Ark., from a converted hot-sheets motel in Culver City, Calif. There, where MGM executives once conducted their trysts, he and a dozen or so young producers and editors are compiling digital video from interviewing teams across the country, while spreading the word through advocacy groups and labor unions to invite whistleblowers to come forward. 
 Their plan is to depict what they and a growing number of critics perceive to be Wal-Mart's sins against society: unfair competition and erosion of the fabric of communities; exploitation of its American workers, and of the government welfare programs many rely on to supplement their wages and benefits; union busting; reliance on suppliers with sweatshops overseas; and environmental negligence -- among others.
 They also intend to show how the retailer exerts its outsized influence on American culture through the so-called ''Wal-Mart effect,'' by limiting the choices of products like clothing, music -- and movies -- that are available to consumers.
 ''Nobody else has a million and a half workers, nobody has 3,500 stores and one opening every day,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''You may say: I don't care, I don't shop at Wal-Mart, why should it affect me? Well it will, because it'll affect wages, it'll affect health care, it'll affect where your tax dollars go. There are so many impacts it has on all of us as citizens.''
 A Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Sarah Clark, whose responsibilities include ''reputation management,'' said she was unaware of Mr. Greenwald or his movie until she was contacted for this article. She noted later that a campaign against Wal-Mart affiliated with the grocery workers' union, which has tried for years to organize Wal-Mart workers, was promoting Mr. Greenwald's film project on the Web.
 ''It would be difficult to comment on a film we haven't seen, but we'd question the fairness of a documentary that is being tied to the Wake-Up Wal-Mart campaign,'' she said. ''Some of our critics are open-minded people who are genuinely concerned about issues and want to make the world a better place. We listen, learn and try to work with them toward common goals. Other groups simply pull publicity stunts to further their own narrow self-interest.''
 Mr. Greenwald is hardly the first to look for a dark side to the company that has become known to millions as a cheap source of staples and minor luxuries. Last November PBS's ''Frontline'' series showed ''Is Wal-Mart Good for America?,'' a 60-minute program produced by Rick Young and Hedrick Smith, a former correspondent for The New York Times. And last year The Los Angeles Times won a Pulitzer Prize for a series that investigated the retailer's practices and policies.
 Yet Mr. Greenwald, like his fellow muckraking documentarians Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock, promises to up the ante by putting the quest for impact squarely ahead of journalistic convention. He said he chose to discuss his project -- which has until now operated in secret -- on the eve of the company's annual shareholders meeting this Friday, for instance, in hopes of kicking up as much dust there as possible. 
 Asked whether his documentary would strive for fairness, Mr. Greenwald said he would offer top Wal-Mart executives the chance to be interviewed but did not see a reason to give them equal screen time. ''I don't feel an obligation, because they are spending $2 million a day now telling their side of the story,'' he said, asserting that Wal-Mart spent that much on public relations.
 Mr. Greenwald, who kept ''Outfoxed'' secret from the Fox network until just before its release, said he had kept his Wal-Mart project under wraps until now, and would not reveal details about his project until it is finished in a few months, lest Wal-Mart try to interfere through litigation or by intimidating workers from cooperating.
 Ms. Clark, the Wal-Mart representative, said the project's secrecy was a reason to doubt its credibility. ''We'd question anyone who was writing a book who would not come to us and ask us for our own facts,'' she said. ''And I'd certainly question the accuracy or the fairness of a documentary that didn't even contact us.''
 Mr. Greenwald said that some 15 current Wal-Mart workers who agreed to help had backed out for fear of retaliation by the company, ignoring his promises of anonymity in exchange for interviews or incriminating documents, videotape or e-mail messages.
 He added that he had lost two investors in the project, both of them Hollywood figures who Mr. Greenwald said backed out rather than risk Wal-Mart's rejection of their other films, as the company is the world's largest DVD retailer. But he refused to name them or any other investors, saying only that he had so far raised $700,000 out of a budget of about $1.6 million. He said he would raise the rest by the same means he hopes to distribute his finished movie: through a series of partnerships with like-minded organizations and by marketing over the Web.
 Mr. Greenwald did this successfully with his documentary ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War,'' for which the Center for American Progress, a Democratic research group, held press screenings in Washington, and which MoveOn.org advertised on its Web site for $29.95. This time, he has aligned with church groups, including the United Church of Christ, which is concentrated in the Northeast, Midwest and West; with the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, a trade group of gas station and convenience store operators; and with the National Education Association. Each for its own reasons had already set its sights on Wal-Mart, but now they are planning to screen Mr. Greenwald's movie in church sanctuaries, at school teach-ins and in the living rooms of small-business owners.
 Mr. Greenwald, who has another, more profit-oriented life as a maker of television movies like ''The Burning Bed'' and theatrical films like ''Steal This Movie,'' acknowledges that he has mainly preached to a partisan choir in his earlier documentaries, ''Uncovered'' and ''Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election,'' which he directed, and ''Unconstitutional: The War on Our Civil Liberties,'' which he produced.
 But he said he chose Wal-Mart as his next subject because he saw it as a mainly red-state company. And in thinking about how to appeal to a red-state audience, he said in an interview, he realized this could be a way to make common cause with the socially conservative base of the Republican Party.
 ''The social values people -- I think the economic issues that we're talking about absolutely are in sync with them,'' he said. ''To me, it's an anomaly or a contradiction that some of these folks are voting against their economic self-interest. But in the Wal-Mart fight, we're seeing that whether you voted for Bush or have an N.R.A. hat, or are all your life Republican, when Wal-Mart comes to town, they build or drive you out of business, or your neighbor, or they put a road where it used to be your front yard -- that's an equalizer.''

HEADLINE: The Five-Bedroom, Six-Figure Rootless Life

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: ALPHARETTA, Ga. 

 BODY:
Kathy Link is 41 with blond-streaked pigtails and, at 5-foot-9, straight as a spear. She is still in the red sun visor and tennis whites she wore leading her fitness class at the Forum Gym and winning at doubles afterward. Tucked by her seat is her color-coded itinerary. 
 Kaleigh, 8, is red. With school over this afternoon in late August, she has already been dropped off at her soccer practice blocks from home. Kristina, 11, is dark green, and Kelsey, 13, is yellow. Kristina must get to her soccer practice four miles to the north, and Kelsey to her practice 14 miles to the south. 
 Ms. Link (blue for work, light green for family and volunteering) surveys the clotted intersection at the mouth of her 636-house Medlock Bridge subdivision. After moving here four years ago and choking on traffic, she made a rule: ''Wherever I'm going has to be within one mile of the house,'' she said. But she breaks the rule two or three times a day, driving 10 and 15 times the one-mile distance. 
 She squeezes the wheel of her white, eight-seat, leather-upholstered 2003 GMC Denali S.U.V. ''Go, people,'' she pleads. Her knuckles go white. Twice she taps the horn. A timid driver in a gray van three cars ahead tiptoes into the Atlanta-bound avalanche along Highway 141. Ms. Link impatiently pulls abreast, saying, ''I have to see who she is.'' 
 A rookie ''relo,'' she decides, someone newly relocated to Alpharetta and to its traffic. She herself is a veteran relo, having moved three times in the past 10 years to help keep her husband's career on track. She admits she is beginning to feel the strain of her vagabond life. ''It's like I'm on a hamster wheel,'' she says. 
 Ms. Link and her husband, Jim, 42, a financial services sales manager for the Wachovia Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., belong to a growing segment of the upper middle class, executive gypsies. The shock troops of companies that continually expand across the country and abroad, they move every few years, from St. Louis to Seattle to Singapore, one satellite suburb to another, hopscotching across islands far from the working class and the urban poor.
 As a subgroup, relos are economically homogenous, with midcareer incomes starting at $100,000 a year. Most are white. Some find the salaries and perks compensating; the developments that cater to them come with big houses, schools with top SAT scores, parks for youth sports and upscale shopping strips.
 Others complain of stress and anomie. They have traded a home in one place for a job that could be anyplace. Relo children do not know a hometown; their parents do not know where their funerals will be. There is little in the way of small-town ties or big-city amenities -- grandparents and cousins, longtime neighbors, vibrant boulevards, homegrown shops -- that let roots sink in deep.
 ''It's as if they're being molded by their companies,'' said Tina Davis, a top Alpharetta relo agent for the Coldwell Banker real estate firm. ''Most of the people will tell you how long they'll be here. It's usually two to four years.'' 
 The Links bought their first home 15 years ago in what was then the master planned community of Clear Lake City, Tex., now a part of Houston. In 1994, they moved to the old Baltimore suburb of Severna Park and three years later to Pittsford, N.Y., near Rochester. In another three years they bought a five-bedroom, four-bath home here, 25 miles north of Atlanta, where Mr. Link started work at an office of the First Union Corporation, which became part of Wachovia.

The Population Sprawls
 Still inching along, Ms. Link passes strip malls. She goes by the gym, chiropractors, nail shops, colonnaded stucco banks, hair salons, 16-pump gas stations, self-storage lots, Waffle Houses, a tanning place and a salon that tattoos on lipstick and eyeliner so they will not fade in the pool.
 She dodges the orange barrels of road-widening crews spreading asphalt in a futile effort to keep up with a north Fulton County population that has swelled to 273,000 from 170,000 in the 90's, a decade when the city of Atlanta barely grew, to 416,000 from 394,000. Sidewalks start and stop. No one dares ride a bicycle or walk a dog. She crosses over Georgia 400, the clogged artery that pumps hundreds of thousands of commuters into Alpharetta's glass and brushed-metal office parks and, an hour's drive south, into downtown Atlanta. 
 She passes developments that from the air look like petri dishes of tadpoles, each head a cul-de-sac. In new subdivisions, signs in fancy script trumpet ''price points,'' to show relos where to roost: Brookdale, $300's; Wildwood, $400's; Wolf Creek, $300's to $500's; Quail Hollow, $500's; Inverness, $600's to $800's; White Columns, $700's to $1.5 million; Greystone, $900's to $4 million.
 The Hispanic landscaping crews are out with old Ford pickups tugging eight-foot flatbed trailers. They trim the edges of spongy Bermuda grass lawns and attack the grubs, fire ants and weeds. Toys and even garden hoses are tucked out of sight lest the subdivision homeowners' association issue warnings and fines. Garage doors, all motorized, must stay shut. 
 After dropping off Kelsey and Kristina, Ms. Link has to double back and pick up Kaleigh and take her to golf. She will wait for Kelsey to finish soccer before picking up Kristina and taking her to cheerleading practice. Another mother will have to retrieve Kristina so that Ms. Link can be home when Kaleigh's math tutor comes.
 Jim (orange) cannot help. He is gone two to five days a week, to Boston, New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Dallas and most often Charlotte. Monday and Tuesday, the itinerary says, ''Jim in meetings, Charlotte.'' For Wednesday, it says, ''Jim in meetings, Philadelphia.''

A Different Segregation
 Today's relos are the successors of itinerant white-collar pioneers of the 1960's, like the computer salesmen for whom I.B.M. meant I've Been Moved. They are employees of multinational industry: pharmaceutical salespeople, electronic engineers, information technology managers, accountants, data analysts, plant managers, regional vice presidents, biotechnologists, bankers, manufacturers' representatives and franchise chain managers.
 They are part of a larger development that researchers are finding: an increasing economic segregation. A Brookings Institution analysis of census data last year reported that the percentage of people living in affluent or poor suburbs in 50 metropolitan areas increased from 1980 to 2000, and the percentage living in middle-income areas declined. 
 Just how many relos there are is hard to determine. The tide rolls with corporate fortunes and the global economy, and relos are not singled out in census statistics. But in a survey from March 2002 to March 2003, the Census Bureau said that about three million people moved to another county, state or country because employers had transferred or recruited them. 
 With the spread of global industry's new satellite office parks, the relos churn through towns like Alpharetta; Naperville, Ill., west of Chicago; Plano, Tex., outside Dallas; Leawood, Kan., near Kansas City; Sammamish, Wash., outside Seattle; and Cary, N.C., which is outside Raleigh and, its resident nomads maintain, stands for Containment Area for Relocated Yankees. 
 Converging on these towns, relos have segregated themselves, less by the old barriers of race, religion and national origin than by age, family status, education and, especially, income. Families with incomes of $100,000 head for subdivisions built entirely of $300,000 houses; those earning $200,000 trade up to subdivisions of $500,000 houses. Isolated, segmented and stratified, these families are cut off from the single, the gay and the gray and, except for those tending them, anyone from lower classes. 
 Unlike their upper-middle-class kindred -- the executives, doctors and lawyers who settle down in one place -- relos forgo the old community props of their class: pedigree and family ties; seats on the vestry and the hospital board; and the rituals, like charity balls. Left with the class's emblematic cars, Lily Pulitzer skirts and Ralph Lauren shirts, their golf, tennis and soccer and, most conspicuously, their houses, they have staked out their place and inflated the American dream. 
 ''What is the American dream?'' said Karen Handel, chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission in Alpharetta. ''It's to have a house of your own, the biggest house you can afford, on the biggest lot you can afford, with a great school for your kids, a nice park to spend Saturday afternoon with your kids in, and deep in amenities that get into the trade-offs with traffic.'' 
 More so than the classes below and above them -- the immobilized poor of old cities and rural backwaters, the factory-bound working class and the old- and new-money rich -- this is a fluid, unstable group. Those who lose jobs or decline promotions to let the children finish high school where they currently are sometimes relocate in place. They call the midnight movers to haul them to cheaper subdivisions, or seize the equity gains on their homes to move up. 
 The Link house stands on a cul-de-sac, up a slight rise with tall young oaks raining acorns over a small front yard and a curtain of cedar and pine bordering the back. It is three stories tall, with beige stucco walls and wide fieldstone panels flanking a varnished oak front door with leaded glass. 
 The house has a two-story family room hung with folk art, a room for guests that holds the girls' upright piano, a master suite upstairs with a bathroom with a wide white vanity on each side of the door and a Jacuzzi enclosed in pinkish marble tiles. Three blocks away are the tennis courts, the pool, two soccer fields and the two-story community clubhouse. 
 Alpharetta may be deep in Dixie, but its accent is not. Of the 30,000 people who live in the Links' census tract, 75 percent were born outside Georgia. Six percent are black, and 12 percent are Asian. Fewer than 3 percent are over 65; fewer than 2 percent are poor or unemployed. 
 Two-thirds of the adults have had four or more years of college and earn more than $100,000 a year, twice the American family average. Their homes are worth an average of $400,000, twice the national average, and they have nearly twice as many rooms as the average house. ''Everybody here is in the top 10 percent of what they do,'' Steve Beecham, a home mortgage broker, said, ''or they desire to be in the top 10 percent.'' 
 In politics, Republican candidates are shoo-ins. Few Alpharetta lawns sprouted campaign signs in November because the area's four contenders for the state legislature and a new candidate for Congress were all Republicans and ran unopposed.

Just Passing Through
 When the Links began house-hunting in early 2000, Mr. Link said, ''school was No.1.'' After settling on the best school districts, he said, ''we looked within price points.'' At their $300,000 limit, all they could afford in a good district near Atlanta was a three-bedroom, two-bath ranch-style house. ''I wanted four bedrooms, two and a half baths and a basement,'' Ms. Link said, ''and I had to have a yard.'' 
 The house the Links eventually bought in Medlock Bridge, built in 1987, has 3,900 square feet and 1,100 more in a basement with a wall of windows facing the backyard. There is a recreation room with a bar, and a fifth bedroom. ''The basement is approximately the same size as my parents' entire house,'' Mr. Link said. The Links paid $313,000 and took an 80 percent mortgage. 
 Pleased though they have been with the house, the Links never considered it permanent. 
 At the dishwasher one evening last September, Ms. Link said, ''Jimmy has been saying, 'This travel is killing me.' I'm shocked we're still here. Every home we went to, I said, 'Could you sell this house?' I did not think we would be here four years. Early on, I told Jimmy, 'Wherever you choose to work, we will make a life.' 
 ''Jimmy's the one making the money. I want him to be happy and successful. Every area you move into, you buy into the lifestyle. Alpharetta is very big on tennis and soccer. We chose to participate in that.'' 
 Ms. Link's favorite place was Pittsford, an affluent apple-pie town outside Rochester with a congenial mix of transient families and long-settled ones. ''Up there each town has its own little village and one main street where you can walk and ride your bike and get someplace safely,'' she said. Kelsey and Kristina started school and soccer there. Ms. Link became a certified personal trainer and began volunteering. She joined the Junior League.

Creating the Illusion of History
 The actual city of Alpharetta covers only 23 square miles in the northern half of Fulton County, but many subdivisions in adjoining unincorporated areas, like Medlock Bridge, carry Alpharetta ZIP codes. The city has no real core, although it has a small downtown with a Main Street, City Hall, some restaurants, a Methodist and a Baptist church, two beauty parlors, a variety store, a new gift shop called Everything Posh and a cemetery. 
 Just off Main Street, flanking an alley between two small parking lots, a pair of white wooden arches proclaim ''Historic Downtown.'' But they lead only to the back walls of stores. Nearby is the Alpharetta Historical Society, housed in a 100-year-old Queen Anne house. The house is a relo. A truck brought it up from Roswell in 1993. 
 ''Illusionism is something that people have enjoyed for centuries,'' Diana Wheeler, the director of community development, said. ''We're creating new applications. It's a matter of how it's carried out. It's a quality issue. You convert the illusion into something that has value to you. Maybe solid columns held up roofs, and hollow columns create the illusion they do. People will go to great lengths to impress others.''
 Tim Bryan builds illusions, designing million-dollar houses of at least 4,500 square feet. Mr. Bryan said clients ''want it to look like a house that's evolved over a century, to appear to have been lived in for 100 years or more, with the look of having been added onto.'' To achieve the look, a Bryan house may have a section of brick and next to it one of stone, then one of cedar shake.
 With their price-pointed subdivisions, developers create pecking orders. ''We're all busy looking down on each other,'' said Neal Martineau, 74, a retired advertising man who last summer was getting ready to move from just outside Alpharetta to West Virginia. '''I'm better than you are and I'm going to show you.' It's a kind of bullying. It's architectural bullying.'' 
 ''I'm faking it here,'' Mr. Martineau said. ''I have property that does not have enough meadow to feed a horse, but I call it a horse farm.'' 
 ''The car may be the most visible sign of status,'' he said. ''My Mercedes is indicative of who I am. I am also a bit of a fraud. I probably shouldn't have a Mercedes, but I'm happy to wear a Mercedes. It's a way I have of making myself feel important, to have someone look at the best car on the road and know I'm in it.'' 
 One result of Alpharetta's subdivision-dotted terrain is the isolation of families from people unlike themselves. Zoning and planning are partly responsible, and so is the traffic. Except for the commute to work, the orbit of Medlock Bridge residents consists of the schools, the community pool, the tennis courts, the clubhouse, the shops along Medlock Bridge Road and the St. Ives Country Club right across from the subdivision. 
 Atlanta seems so far away. ''We haven't been to any cultural events or sporting events as a family because it's an all-night event,'' Mr. Link said. People shop on the Internet. Rather than go to the car wash, they can call Tony Lancaster, who comes around in his van and brings the water, too. ''Anything a shop can do, I can do mobile,'' Mr. Lancaster said. 
 Their seclusion helps keep the neighborhood safe, which is important to the Links. ''We'll get a little rash of golf clubs stolen,'' Mr. Link said. ''Mailboxes have been hit or bent. We'll see where cars have gotten keyed. But that's about it.'' 
 ''The good thing about it is that it is a very comfortable neighborhood to live in,'' Mr. Link said. ''These are very homogenous types of groups. You play tennis with them, you have them over to dinner. You go to the same parties.'' 
 ''But we're never challenged to learn much about other economic groups,'' he said. ''When you talk about tennis, guess what? Everybody you play against looks and acts and generally feels like you. It doesn't give you much of a perspective. At work, diversity is one of the biggest things we work on.''
 Alpharetta employers say that the $250,000 starting point for a detached, single-family house freezes out their secretaries and technicians, janitors and truck drivers, cashiers and data clerks. The prices exclude the city's own teachers and firemen. Of Alpharetta's 365 full-time city employees last fall, 112, or less than a third, lived in the city. Of 74 police officers, just the chief and two sergeants lived here. 
 House cleaners, like Linda Bates, live 30 or 40 miles away. Ms. Bates works for Unlimited Cleaning Services, a company that supplies housekeepers with a checklist of the clients' requirements. A client may never speak to the cleaner or get the same one twice, and that is all right with Ms. Bates. 
 ''If I have to be at a house at 8:30, I will leave my house at 7,'' she said. ''We just clean the house and go, like the air-conditioning man. I never bother personal things. I never answer the telephone. I don't like being there when they get there.''

Adjusting to Differences
 Kathy Link came from Highland Park, an old planned community of what are now multimillion-dollar homes four miles north of downtown Dallas. Jim Link grew up in a Houston subdivision, Bellaire, in a house where his parents have lived for 34 years. They went to Texas A&M University in College Station, met at a student pub where Mr. Link tended bar and married three years later, in 1988. She found work as an editor for an aerospace company. Mr. Link went into the insurance and mutual fund business, and from there he made the switch to banking.
 Hardy, trim and darker toned than his wife, in disposition still the affable bartender, Mr. Link mans the beer cooler at holiday parties at the Medlock Bridge clubhouse. Ms. Link is more reserved. Her tennis doubles partner's high-five is a slap. Hers is a tap. Often as she leaves the court one mother or another stops her and, taller than most, she settles an arm over the woman's shoulder as they walk. She pretends to have the time. 
 The Links agree on most things. In November, they voted for President Bush. They splurge on their children's sports and tutoring and piano lessons and deny them computers and televisions in their rooms and cellphones. 
 But her family was better off than his, and every now and then their views diverge on money. When he sees the occasional $140 charge for having her hair highlighted, she said, ''he cringes.'' 
 ''Kathy's goal for college for the kids,'' he said, ''is like her mother's was for her, that they not have to work.'' He worked, and it is fine with him if his children do.
 Ms. Link is happy in the $45,000 Denali that they financed. He is happy with the 2000 green Ford Taurus he bought used from CarMax for $10,000 in cash. 
 They are clear of the troubles with credit card debt that built up after Kelsey and Kristina were born. Mr. Link earns something over $200,000, with bonuses based on the strength of the economy and his sales staff's success. Ms. Link earns around $4,000 from personal training and fitness instruction and plans to build on that as the children get older. 
 They have about $100,000 equity in the house and about $10,000 in college funds they started for the girls last year. 
 ''We do all the basic stuff out of salary,'' Mr. Link said. ''Bonuses are free for everything else, like extra saving, big vacations and major repairs on the house.'' Bonuses last year bought the family their first ski trip, a week after Christmas in Steamboat Springs, Colo. 
 For all their moving, the Links try to carry on an upper-middle-class tradition of volunteering and knitting community ties. Barely settled in Medlock Bridge, Mr. Link ran for the board of the homeowners association and won. The board then made him president and, in effect, the mayor. He paid the $15,000 initiation fee for the family to join the St. Ives Country Club. 
 Ms. Link joined a neighborhood group to play bunko, a social dice game favored by Alpharetta women, many of whom think of it as an excuse to get together and have a few glasses of wine. She began editing the subdivision's newsletter and set up an e-mail chain that reaches 350 Medlock Bridge homes. She spends two hours on Tuesday mornings at a Bible study meeting. 
 And she has bored into the schools. She became a vice president of the elementary school PTA and took on its newsletter. She is a room parent for Kaleigh's third-grade class and organizes science projects there. At her kitchen computer command post, she tracks the girls' reports and test scores on school Web pages. Kelsey's October report showed a 97 average, but then she got a 78 on a Spanish test. In a week, she had a tutor. 
 ''The women are like the rulers,'' Kelsey said on a drive with her father during a weekend soccer tournament in Columbus, Ga. ''They have the big cars. The dads have the little cars and just go to work.'' She said her mother thought that her father was too relaxed on the road. 
 Mr. Link said, ''Kathy becomes impatient with me when I'm going 70 in a 65 zone.'' 
 ''No, Daddy,'' Kelsey said. ''It's when you're going 60.'' 
 Lately, Ms. Link's frenzied schedule has been grinding her down. Early last summer she gave up bunko. In August she dropped her PTA jobs and the community newsletter. In October, she was asked to lead a fund-raising drive for Kristina's cheerleading squad and said no. ''I had never done that,'' she said.
 But something else always seems to come up. She resumed editing the community newsletter because her successor gave it up. In November she learned of a school redistricting plan and shook her e-mail chain to mobilize opposition. 
 All her activity began creating tension at home. On the sidelines of one of Kristina's soccer games in October, Mr. Link said: ''The single biggest thing to change is, Kathy has to be more judicious about how she volunteers. She would never give up Bible study. But she's now playing in three or four tennis leagues.''
 She agreed. ''I volunteer way too much,'' she said. 
 ''It doesn't mean you shouldn't be involved,'' he told her, ''but it doesn't mean you have to be the leader.''

Unexpected Challenges
 The Links are the first to say they have not really found a way to make their Alpharetta life work. They found good schools, safe streets, neighbors they like and a big house and a yard. But they did not count on the grueling traffic, on how far away everything seems, on how much is asked of volunteers to sustain the community, or on the stresses of a breadwinner's travels. They have no deep connections here, no old friends, no parents to sit for their children. 
 Ms. Link thinks about Highland Park, with her Presbyterian church and easy access to Dallas. She thinks about Rochester. ''In Rochester,'' she said, ''everything fell into place.'' In Alpharetta what weighs on her is just the daily grind.
 ''We haven't found a church,'' she said. ''We went church shopping. I would find places my children liked and I didn't or that I liked and they didn't. We found one, but it's a half-hour drive away. We don't have that kind of time.''
 ''It's all here,'' she said, ''but it's an hour drive away. Here it's like, 'Get the heck out of my way.' It's like go, go, go. We're just going, going, going. I call it drowning. It's when you can't see the top of the water.'' 
 ''In Rochester,'' she said, ''you could go to festivals and street fairs, and museums and farms and pick your own apples and not have a death grip on your child.'' 
 ''In Rochester I had two best friends,'' she added. ''I don't have a girl best friend here in Alpharetta. There's no one person I can call up to confide in. I called up one girl, and I scared her.''

Exploring a Change
 In the summer of 2003, Jim Link and Wachovia considered some organizational changes that might have led to a move for the family, but nothing came of them. Last summer the discussions resumed, and in September he was promoted. Starting Nov. 1, he became national sales manager for a broader range of the bank's money management services than he had been selling. 
 ''It rounds me out,'' he said, folding laundry in the family room and watching a Georgia Tech football game on television.
 Whether to leave Alpharetta was left hanging, he said.
 But they decided that the moving should stop for a while -- nine years, at least, from the time Kelsey starts high school until Kaleigh finishes. With his BlackBerry, laptop and access to the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, Mr. Link could do his new job from here. Wachovia leaves the choice up to him but tells him that moving to Charlotte should help his career.
 ''I told my boss, 'If you're willing to fund a full relocation package, I'm willing to do it,''' he said.
 Back home from the family ski trip to Steamboat as the year ended, the Links seemed to be leaning toward one more move.
 ''I will remake myself to be a better mother and a better wife,'' Ms. Link said. ''I've paid my dues.'' 
 Mr. Link said: ''We would try to be closer and more plugged in to the city. Kathy would continue volunteering, because that's how she gets involved. We would require that the kids be involved in something.'' 
 They were not telling friends, or the girls. Once word got around, they feared, teachers and coaches would start writing the girls off. Kelsey had figured it out. As they packed for Steamboat, Ms. Link said, ''she asked, 'Are we moving?' Jimmy couldn't lie. He said, 'It looks like it,''' and told her to keep mum. 
 They worry about Kristina. The shyest of the three girls, she was slow to take to Alpharetta. Then she bloomed. In her special-education reading class, she got 100's all fall and in January moved to a regular class. She won her soccer team's Golden Boot award for scoring the most goals. 
 The Links called in Tina Davis, the real estate agent. Afternoons when the girls were in school, Ms. Link searched the Internet for homes and schools in Charlotte and found that it, too, was a sea of new subdivisions. The average commuting time is 24 minutes, the same as Atlanta. 
 Then she found Myers Park, a prosperous, close-in community of 8,700 where most of the houses are more than 60 years old and 10 minutes from downtown. She found the Myers Park Presbyterian Church. 
 ''It's like the one I went to in Highland Park,'' she said.
 Mr. Link got home on Feb. 9 after three days in Phoenix. He found a long e-mail message from Wachovia. ''We got our paperwork,'' the relocation package, he said. 
 They told the girls after school. Kelsey took it easily, sad only that she would not be going to Northview High School with her friends. Kaleigh beamed, then frowned about losing friends and teachers. 
 Kristina was in the kitchen with Ms. Link when Mr. Link came in. 
 ''Your dad's got something to tell you,'' Ms. Link said. 
 ''We're moving to Charlotte,'' he said. 
 Kristina paused. She would be leaving Rebecca, a friend of five years 
 ''I hate you,'' she said. ''When?'' 
 ''In June,'' he said. 
 ''What about soccer?'' 
 She would keep playing here through May, they told her, and then get onto a team in Charlotte. She brightened a little. 
 That night Mr. and Ms. Link went to dinner at Sia's, their favorite restaurant, just across Medlock Bridge Road. 
 ''I'm happy,'' she said. ''It's finally over. For four years, it's been when, when, when.'' 
 She told Jim: ''I'm wired to settle in wherever we move and make a life for you and the family. But I still want a one-mile radius. I'm not going to do another Alpharetta.''
 By Kristina's 12th birthday on April 16, pale green buds had broken out in the oaks in front of the Links' house. A landscaping crew was setting pink and white petunias into the new pine straw mulch around the shrubs. Inside, floors had been sanded and the master bath retiled in beige limestone. ''Finished basement,'' the red headline on Tina Davis's sign out front said. 
 Mr. Link left early that day to take Kelsey to a soccer game 30 miles away. Ms. Link and Kristina watched Kaleigh's Green Gators near home. 
 ''Go, Kaleigh!'' Ms. Link shouted. ''Get in the middle, Kaleigh. Go!'' 
 On the sidelines, a father turned to her. 
 ''Kathy, what's this I hear you're leaving?'' 
 ''We are,'' she said. 
 ''Work stuff?''
 ''Wachovia,'' she said. ''Charlotte.''
 ''We're going to miss you,'' he said.
 ''It's kind of bittersweet,'' she said. ''We want to be there nine years, but you never know.''
 In May, the Links sold their house in Alpharetta for $420,000 and bought a Cape Cod in Charlotte for $627,500. It is half the size of the one in Alpharetta, but it is in leafy old Myers Park. The Myers Park Country Club, the Presbyterian church and top-rated public schools are less than a mile away.
 On a visit last week, the girls got library cards. They tried out for a soccer club and all three made the cut. They will move in July.

ABOUT THE SERIES
This is the eighth in a series of articles examining the role of social class in America today. A team of reporters spent more than a year exploring ways that class -- defined as a combination of income, education, wealth and occupation -- influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of unbounded opportunity.

HEADLINE: ABC Finishes Its Ad Sales As NBC Lags

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ABC seems anything but lost or desperate when it comes to selling commercial time ahead of the fall season.
 ABC, owned by the Walt Disney Company, said yesterday that it had become the first of the six large broadcast television networks to complete selling most of the commercials during its prime-time programs scheduled for the 2005-6 season.
 ''We saw absolutely no reason to wait,'' said Mike Shaw, president for sales and marketing in New York at the ABC Television Network unit of ABC.
 As a result of the robust ratings gains ABC scored in the 2004-5 season with series like ''Lost,'' ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Grey's Anatomy,'' as well as interest in new fall series like ''Commander in Chief'' and ''Invasion,'' Mr. Shaw said that the network was able to achieve solid gains in what is known as the upfront market. 
 ''We're very, very comfortable with where we ended up,'' he added.
 As ABC finishes its upfront sales, most other broadcasters are anywhere from a quarter to half finished with their own selling. The main exception: NBC, which is still in talks with agencies and advertisers.
 NBC is hoping to charge slightly more for commercial time than it did during the 2004-5 season, when it fell to fourth place from first among the viewers advertisers most covet, ages 18 to 49. Advertisers and agencies, however, are so far unwilling to pay more and are reluctant to make deals.
 ''Discussions are ongoing,'' said Liz Fischer, a spokeswoman in New York for NBC, part of the NBC Universal division of General Electric. She declined to elaborate.
 ABC's estimated sales total of $2.1 billion in regular nonsports programming compared with an estimated $1.6 billion for comparable shows in the upfront market last year and was somewhat higher than what most analysts and agency executives had forecast. Most projections were for ABC to sell $1.8 billion to $2 billion after the presentation of its fall schedule on May 17.
 In the case of the network's three big returning prime-time hits -- ''Desperate Housewives,'' ''Lost'' and ''Grey's Anatomy'' -- ''the response to and desire for those was huge,'' Mr. Shaw said. As a result, ABC was able to charge a little more than double compared with what it charged a year ago for 30-second spots, he added.
 For instance, if an advertiser agreed last spring to pay $150,000 for a commercial in the first few episodes of ''Desperate Housewives'' last fall, the rate for the coming second season of the series will be something like $315,000.
 Mr. Shaw said he was pleased with how ABC was able to attract many more advertisers than last spring in categories like financial services, luxury automobiles and technology, which are seeking to reach wealthier viewers. NBC has in recent seasons made much of its appeal to such affluent audiences, and networks like ABC and CBS are eager to cut into that lucrative market.
 To those who might question why ABC moved so quickly and did not hold out for higher prices, Mr. Shaw said he was ''very, very comfortable'' with the strategy the network pursued.
 ''In discussions with customers,'' he said, ''we read the marketplace and the total spending the marketplace was able to support. It was our read to be the first one in, to accommodate all the demand in all the day parts.''
 In other words, in a broadcast TV market that most analysts and agencies predict will be flat or up only slightly, agreeing now to take in 31.3 percent more revenue than last year was worth the risk that demand might intensify further. The estimates are that the upfront market for all six broadcasters for 2005-6 will reach $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion, compared with $9.1 billion to $9.3 billion last year.
 The strength or weakness of the upfront market, held each spring and summer before the fall season starts, is often scrutinized for signs of the health of the overall advertising economy. It has also become a guide to the ability of traditional broadcast TV to fend off competition from older rivals like cable networks as well as newer competitors like the Internet, video games and podcasters.
 The gains ABC made in the upfront market are good news for broadcast network television, Mr. Shaw said.
 Among the other broadcasters, CBS and its sibling, UPN, both owned by Viacom, have passed the halfway mark in selling the commercial time they plan to in the upfront market and are achieving increases of 4 percent to 6 percent, on par with ABC, in a measurement called cpm, or the cost to reach each 1,000 viewers.
 The estimates are that CBS may take in $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, compared with an estimated $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion last spring, and UPN may take in $350 million, compared with an estimated $325 million last spring.
 WB, owned by Time Warner and the Tribune Company, has sold almost a third of the inventory it plans to sell, at cpm increases of 2 percent to 3 percent. It is estimated that WB will sell about $675 million, or about even with the estimate for last spring.
 Fox Broadcasting, owned by the News Corporation, is beginning to make some deals, at slight cpm increases. Estimates call for Fox to sell about the same as it did in the upfront market last year, about $1.6 billion.
 Some executives at media agencies said they questioned NBC's strategy of asking for some kind of increase, particularly given ABC's strategy to take the money and run. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as influencing the course of the negotiations as they continue.
 NBC led the upfront market last year, with sales estimated at $2.9 billion. But because of its ratings decline in the 2004-5 season, it is estimated to be likely to take in much less, with projections ranging from $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. 
 ABC sold in the upfront market about 80 percent of the total inventory of commercials it will run in prime time during the 2005-6 season. The rest of the inventory is sold as the season unfolds in what is called the scatter market. In the upfront market last year, ABC sold about 75 percent to 80 percent of its total prime-time inventory.
 In the last few days, Mr. Shaw said, ABC also sold an additional estimated $600 million in commercial time during 2005-6 sports programs like ''Monday Night Football'' and coverage of National Basketball Association games. That was about what had been predicted for those and about the same as in the upfront market last year.
 ABC has also completed selling most of the commercial time that will be available in its daytime, late-night and news programs in the coming season, Mr. Shaw said, totaling an estimated $800 million.

HEADLINE: Web Brokers Are Talking About Merger

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, May 31 

 BODY:
The Toronto-Dominion Bank confirmed Tuesday that it is in talks about a potential transaction involving its online brokerage, TD Waterhouse USA, and the Ameritrade Holding Corporation.
 While neither company offered details about the talks in their brief jointly issued statement, Toronto-Dominion has been looking for a merger partner for the United States operations of TD Waterhouse since 2003.
 The statement followed a report in The Financial Times that Ameritrade was close to taking control of TD Waterhouse in a transaction worth $2 billion to $3 billion. 
 Like other online brokers, TD Waterhouse has been buffeted by declining prices and lower volumes. During its most recent quarter, TD Waterhouse said its average daily trading volume was down by 16 percent.
 Brenda Lum, the managing director of financial institutions at the Dominion Bond Rating Service in Toronto, said a merger would help the performance of TD Waterhouse.
 ''It's a very scalable type of business that takes costs lower the bigger you get,'' she said.
 This is not the first time that Toronto-Dominion has appeared to be on the verge of consolidating TD Waterhouse with another company. Last year it announced a merger with E-Trade Financial worth 10 billion Canadian dollars. That deal collapsed, however, largely because Toronto-Dominion wanted to control the resulting company.
 Then in early May, E-Trade made a $5.5 billion offer for Ameritrade, which is based in Omaha, but was turned down, again partly over questions of control.
 Toronto-Dominion's chief executive, W. Edmund Clark, said last week that merging TD Waterhouse with another company could provide ''significant and mutually advantageous economics.''
 If a merger is successfully negotiated, Ameritrade would gain about two million brokerage accounts in the United States, giving it a total of about 5.7 million. TD Waterhouse also has about 140 retail branches in the United States.
 On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Toronto-Dominion's stock rose 1.39 Canadian dollars, to 53.59 Canadian dollars a share, or $42.67. Ameritrade shares rose 47 cents, to $14.86.

HEADLINE: For White House, There Is Business as Usual After French Vote

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
The White House took a public position of benign aloofness on Tuesday to France's vote against a draft constitution for Europe and the Continent's political disarray, saying Europe's future was for Europe alone to decide.
 But behind the scenes there was considerable debate about what the vote meant for the relationship between the United States and Europe, and a feeling among policy experts that the more significant development was the weakened position of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany and President Jacques Chirac of France.
 The setbacks for those leaders, the experts said, will have far more lasting effects on dealings with Europe on issues like Iran and the Middle East than will the debate over European integration.
 ''When the fog clears, you will see that in fact the European Union remains exactly as it was,'' said John Bruton, the European Union's representative in the United States and a framer of the proposed constitution. 
 Officials noted that with or without a constitution, Europe and the United States would continue their relationships in trade, finance, diplomacy and security. 
 Washington will still deal directly with France, Germany and Britain in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear ambitions; with the same European Union leaders in talks over the Middle East; and with the same competitors in trade disputes.
 ''I can't think of anything substantive that it changes in terms of the relationship between the European Union and the United States,'' said P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for the British Embassy. 
 Still, one senior administration official said the vote was worrisome because it made Europe more unpredictable, even, he said, as some factions in the administration could see it as checking the growing powerhouse across the Atlantic. Although Mr. Bush has repeatedly spoken of his desire for a strong Europe, some administration conservatives have seen a unified and independent-minded Europe as an unwelcome counterweight to American interests.
 The economic ties with Europe, and with its various nations and national industries, are considerable and complex. Europe and America are deep in the latest round of global trade talks with developing nations. Their negotiations over subsidies to their giant, competing airliner companies broke down this week and appear headed toward litigation before the World Trade Organization.
 ''On the one hand, we have a genuine desire for a strong Europe,'' said a senior administration official. ''But on the other hand, we have understandable concerns about the changes that the proposed constitution would have for foreign policy making.'' The official asked not to be identified because he did not want to be cited as expressing an opinion about other governments.
 At a news conference on Tuesday, President Bush was not asked about the French vote and did not bring it up, but there were public comments from Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, who said, ''We support the ultimate goal of the Europeans deciding how they want to move together,'' and from Frederick Jones, the National Security Council spokesman, who said, ''The president's position on a strong Europe has been quite clear.''
 But Republican analysts said the undermining of Mr. Chirac, who could be replaced by Nicolas Sarkozy, leader of the Union for a Popular Movement, was not unwelcome at the White House. Nor was it an unhappy development, they said, that Chancellor Schroder recently called for early elections and could be replaced. Mr. Schroder and Mr. Chirac actively opposed Mr. Bush on Iraq.
 ''I think deep down they probably regard this as an opportunity,'' said William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, who has close ties to conservatives in the administration. 
 ''Their great opponents in Europe, Chirac and Schroder, have had terrible setbacks,'' he said. ''And there's now a chance for fresh thinking in Europe, and that fresh thinking could be more pro-American and more open to something like Bush's view of the world.''

HEADLINE: Ferrer Says City Should Close School at Old Industrial Site

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer called on the Bloomberg administration yesterday to shut down a potentially contaminated Bronx high school, in an effort to focus his campaign on the school system, an area where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is considered vulnerable.
 The city's Department of Education opened the school, the Soundview Educational Campus, in 2004 on part of a site that had been used for decades by a defense contractor, Loral Electronics, despite an environmental assessment done for the city that had showed levels of mercury, chromium, lead, arsenic and other toxic substances much higher than state standards allow.
 The environmental report indicated that the contamination would pose a hazard only during the construction of the school, but Mr. Ferrer's mayoral campaign challenged that view, charging that the report was altered and rushed to allow an existing building to become a school. 
 ''This is not the way we should be building New York,'' said Mr. Ferrer, a Democrat and a former Bronx borough president. Standing on Story Avenue outside the school, which has 1,000 students, he added, ''This is not the way we should be building a strong and hopeful future for all of our children.'' 
 Mr. Ferrer also said that the city granted a zoning change for the property, in an area designated for industrial use, based on a request that did not specify the levels of pollutants found in the soil and groundwater.
 Bloomberg administration officials denied that they had acted improperly or put anyone in danger at the school and said that they had followed all of the procedures recommended by an environmental consultant to make the site safe.
 ''We would never expose any of our children, teachers or staff to unsafe learning or working conditions,'' a deputy schools chancellor, Kathleen Grimm, said in a statement. ''The school was opened after we thoroughly tested the site. The school was safe when it opened and continues to be safe today.'' City officials worked with representatives of the community, teachers and state environmental and health officials to address all of the concerns, Ms. Grimm continued.
 The school is next to an industrial area where trucks idle and frequently stir up plumes of dust. Although students and staff at the school have not fallen ill, Mr. Ferrer said it was too early to know what the effects might be.
 In addition, Mr. Ferrer said, Bloomberg officials failed to include local residents, who are overwhelmingly black, in the planning process for the school, a potential civil rights violation. 
 But a Bloomberg administration official said that because the school was created through a lease conversion, the city was not required to undergo a public review, although officials said they had worked with the community in planning for the school.
 The Bloomberg campaign has also begun running its first two English-language radio advertisements. One features former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who introduces himself as a ''tour guide'' for Mr. Bloomberg's economic plan. The ad emphasizes projects outside of Manhattan -- in the Bronx, Staten Island and Queens -- in what appears to be an effort to combat the perception that his tenure has been Manhattan-centric. 
 The other features former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who applauds Mr. Bloomberg for continuing the drop in crime for which Mr. Giuliani had become known. ''He did the impossible,'' Mr. Giuliani said in the ad. ''He improved on the crime reduction.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign also trumpeted the endorsement of three fire unions, but the biggest fire union, the Uniformed Firefighters Association, which has been sparring with the mayor over emergency response rules, is not among those that have endorsed him.

HEADLINE: Costs of Shutting Down Base Are Focus of Groton Tour

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., May 31 

 BODY:
Gov. M. Jodi Rell and members of Connecticut's Congressional delegation, who are fighting to keep open the historic Naval submarine base here, expressed cautious optimism after touring the facility Tuesday with members of an independent federal commission considering whether the base should be closed. 
 Four of the nine members of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, including its chairman, Anthony J. Principi, visited the base and asked questions of Navy staff members. The Pentagon has proposed closing the base as part of a nationwide restructuring that would include shutting down 33 major bases. The commission, known as BRAC, will recommend to President Bush by Sept. 8 whether to adopt the Pentagon plan. 
 On Tuesday, state and federal elected officials along for the tour and briefing said the commissioners questioned Navy officials on issues ranging from the cost of relocating the base's training school, to quality of life in the area for base employees and their families, to the importance of the close relationship between the base and a large private contractor, Electric Boat, which builds and repairs submarines just south of the base on the Thames River.
 ''Their questions are very much: 'Are we saving money? Are we actually going to produce the results that the Department of Defense claims? Would we in fact be better off if we did something else?''' Mrs. Rell told reporters afterward. ''And again, those kinds of questions, while the Navy has to give data and a factual response, I thought boded very well for us.''
 The possible base closing has brought together political leaders in both parties. Mrs. Rell, a Republican, joined Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, and Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican whose district includes the base, on the tour. Representative John Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford, also attended.
 The BRAC commissioners did not speak to reporters Tuesday, but were expected to hold a news conference Wednesday morning after hearing again from state officials and members of a coalition fighting to keep the base open.
 So far, state officials have shaped their argument around military and economic issues. They say that the Pentagon has underestimated the environmental cleanup costs of closing the base, that a closing could devastate the local economy and that the Pentagon has not properly weighed the military value of the base's proximity to Electric Boat.
 Their argument expanded somewhat Tuesday, with Mr. Dodd and Mr. Simmons floating the possibility that the Navy could realign its submarine operations at Groton, rather than close them entirely. Mr. Dodd said commissioners expressed interest in the base's relationship with Electric Boat.
 ''There's real concern about breaking up the synergy,'' he said. Mr. Dodd also said that he asked Navy officials Tuesday what it would cost to relocate the base's training school alone and that he was given a rough estimate of $700 million to $750 million. ''I think the commission was frankly sort of startled at that number,'' he said.
 The officials said some commission members echoed their frustration that the Pentagon had yet to release a more detailed explanation of its decision-making process. Mrs. Rell said she expected the information to become available as soon as Tuesday evening.
 The Pentagon has said closing the base would take 8,460 military jobs out of southeast Connecticut, the largest job loss of the 33 major bases it has proposed closing. The base's personnel and 18 submarines likely would be transferred to Naval bases in Kings Bay, Ga., and Norfolk, Va. The Pentagon says the closing would save $1.6 billion over 20 years.

HEADLINE: Slots Plan in Pennsylvania Suffers a Blow

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Pennsylvania's ambitious plan to use gambling revenues to reduce homeowners' property taxes by nearly $1 billion a year appeared on the brink of collapse yesterday after only one-fifth of the state's 500 school boards voted to participate. 
 The plan, the signature initiative of Gov. Edward G. Rendell, called for using revenues from as many as 61,000 slot machines -- the most of any state east of Nevada -- to be used largely to reduce local property taxes. It would also make it more difficult for participating school boards to enact future property-tax increases. 
 But the potential loss of taxing power seemed to give many school boards second thoughts, education officials said, though uncertainty about slot machine revenues and moral concerns about gambling were also factors. ''There were a lot of unanswered questions,'' said Thomas J. Gentzel, executive director of the Pennsylvania School Boards Association, which brought an unsuccessful lawsuit to give districts more time to review the program. 
 The tepid response left Mr. Rendell, a Democrat who guided the plan through the Republican-controlled legislature last year, searching for a solution. ''Obviously I'm disappointed,'' Mr. Rendell told reporters yesterday in a telephone news conference. ''We have to look for another vehicle to give Pennsylvanians property-tax relief. It would be inequitable to allow people in just one-fifth of our districts to get property-tax relief.''
 But with the legislature just weeks from adjourning for the summer and Mr. Rendell preparing to run for re-election next year, many legislators and political analysts said that the school boards had dealt a blow to the governor and that there would be little bipartisan support for tackling new legislation soon. ''He'll take a hit for this,'' said G. Terry Madonna, professor of public policy at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. But Mr. Madonna said Mr. Rendell could recover from the setback if the legislature approved new measures to reduce property taxes before the 2006 election. 
 Under the complex property-tax reduction plan that the governor hammered out with legislative leaders, homeowners in school districts that agreed to participate would have their property taxes reduced by an average of $330 each once revenues began flowing, possibly in 2007. Districts were required to decide whether to participate by May 30.
 Participating districts would be required to increase local income taxes by one-tenth of 1 percent -- a provision intended to make school financing more progressive. The program would also place restrictions on boards' powers to raise taxes, requiring them to hold referendums for increases above an inflation-related index. The plan also provided for exemptions under which districts could increase taxes without voter approval, including sudden influxes of students, emergency construction needs or new federal or state requirements. 
 Pennsylvania is the only state where school boards are virtually unfettered in their abilities to increase property taxes, said Michael Griffith, an analyst with the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit group in Denver. Mr. Rendell blamed the legislature yesterday for giving local boards too much power over the plan's fate. ''It probably was a flawed concept to allow the people whose power you are restricting to vote on this,'' Mr. Rendell said. 
 Some lawmakers are now calling for legislation that would require school districts to participate in the program. Others want to place restrictions on districts' powers to raise taxes but scrap the tax-relief program. Still others said they thought the legislature could support using gambling revenues solely for education programs. 
 But Mr. Rendell's re-election bid is likely to only complicate the debate. ''We have a political side to this, where a governor who touted property-tax relief is entering his re-election cycle,'' said State Representative Douglas G. Reichley, a Republican from the Allentown area. ''There may be some who want to take a second look at how quickly we do those things.''
 James H. Broussard, chairman of Citizens Against Higher Taxes, a state group, said many conservative groups refused to lobby for the program, even though they supported its tax-reduction provisions, because they did not want to promote gambling or Mr. Rendell. 
 ''There were a lot of Republicans who support cutting taxes who said, 'Let's sit here and see what he can do with this,''' Mr. Broussard said. ''They felt it would make Rendell look stupid next year if it failed, since this was his big scheme.''
 Mr. Rendell made property-tax reduction a centerpiece of his 2002 campaign. But he rejected suggestions that Republicans would hold up new legislation just to hurt him in next year's election, and said they would be punished at the polls if they did.
 ''The people want this,'' Mr. Rendell said. ''I don't think the legislature will want to take responsibility for not resolving it before we go into the election of 2006.''

HEADLINE: Russia Tycoon Given 9 Years On Tax Charge

BYLINE: By C.J. CHIVERS and ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 31 

 BODY:
A Russian court convicted Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the embattled tycoon and founder of the Yukos oil company, on criminal charges Tuesday and sentenced him to nine years in prison, bringing to an end the most closely watched trial in Russia since the Soviet Union collapsed.
 The verdict and the sentence carried the feel of conclusions long ago foregone. The Kremlin has portrayed the oil magnate and his company as self-interested tax cheats with little respect for either the law or the state. 
 But his supporters said any number of Russia's ''oligarchs'' could have been charged with the same crimes, which they said were routine business practices here in the 1990's. They characterized the trial as the selective prosecution of a rival and a statement of Kremlin power meant to frighten independent businessmen, dissuade political opponents, regain control of strategic assets and squelch public dissent. 
 Western governments have followed the proceedings as an indicator of whether Russia is stepping off a path toward democracy and a fair business climate as it continues to emerge from decades of Soviet rule. Speaking from Washington, President Bush expressed concern about the case just hours after the sentences were handed down. 
 ''Here, you're innocent until proven guilty, and it appeared to us, at least people in my administration, that it looked like he had been judged guilty prior to having a fair trial,'' Mr. Bush said in an appearance at the Rose Garden. ''We're watching the ongoing case.''
 Mr. Khodorkovsky, 41, had been the wealthiest man in Russia until he publicly challenged President Vladimir V. Putin, in part by supporting opposition political parties. Using Yukos as a platform, he had also pushed for more oil sales to the West and private pipelines to China. 
 He was arrested by masked men at gunpoint late in 2003. After an 11-month trial, he and his longtime business associate, Platon A. Lebedev, were found guilty by a panel of judges on six of seven charges, including fraud, embezzlement and corporate and personal tax evasion. There was no jury. The reading of the verdict lasted 12 days.
 Mr. Khodorkovsky, who has already spent 19 months in pretrial confinement, will be eligible for release in 2012. Mr. Lebedev was given the same sentence. Prosecutors had asked for maximum sentences of 10 years.
 The court also ordered the two men to pay just over 17 billion rubles, or about $613 million, in taxes and fines. A third defendant, Andrei Krainov, was convicted and given a suspended sentence of five and a half years.
 The conclusion of the verdicts were read just before 1 p.m. in a small crowded courtroom. After the judges handed down the sentences the chief judge, Irina Kolesnikova, asked if the two men understood, according to pooled reports of the journalists allowed into the room. 
 Mr. Lebedev's tone was biting. ''Any normal person would not understand a word you have just said,'' he said. 
 Mr. Khodorkovsky was pale and expressionless. His wife, seated near the gray metal cage in which he has appeared for much of the past year, quietly sobbed, dabbed her eyes and was comforted by his father and mother. 
 As word of the verdicts rippled outside the court, pro-Yukos protesters, kept several blocks away from the court entrance by a contingent of guards, began chanting, ''Not guilty!'' and ''Shame!'' 
 Another group of demonstrators, this one pro-government, was almost silent. In interviews, several did not seem to know why they were there. They refused to say who had arranged the protest but said they had been bused in, suggesting they were stand-ins.
 Variously regarded in Russia as a victim of Kremlin vindictiveness and a ruthless and unsavory insider who amassed his almost uncountable fortune on insider deals, Mr. Khodorkovsky had come to represent contradictory visions of Russia's future. 
 For the business and political elite looking toward a more Western capitalist economy, he was a visionary entrepreneur who transformed Soviet-era oil assets into Yukos, a profitable and efficient crude producer that at one point was Russia's largest private oil company. 
 At its height, Yukos employed more than 100,000 people and pumped more oil than Libya. And as his company's market share grew, Mr. Khodorkovsky emerged as a player on the world's energy stage, meeting with Western politicians and giving millions of dollars to philanthropic causes here. 
 But for Russians, many of whom survive on salaries of $250 a month, Mr. Khodorkovsky was a polarizing figure, embodying the worst transgressions of post-Soviet privatization. Like many other Russian billionaires of today, he became wealthy practically overnight in the 1990's by winning prize state assets for pennies on the dollar, often through rigged auctions. 
 He also had a streak of boldness, which appears to have been his undoing. Mr. Putin, a former head of the Russian domestic intelligence agency that succeeded the K.G.B., met in 2000 with Russia's wealthiest billionaires and warned them away from politics in exchange for amnesty in their murky business deals. Mr. Khodorkovsky largely ignored the advice. 
 His trial at first focused on the 1994 privatization of an obscure fertilizer plant, Apatit, although government prosecutors and judges on Tuesday decided not to rule on that particular deal, citing an expired 10-year statute of limitations.
 The sentences end for the moment the rout of Mr. Khodorkovsky, several of his associates, and the Yukos oil company, which lost its core asset in an auction last year that was widely criticized as Kremlin-rigged. 
 Just after the verdict, prosecutors issued a statement saying more charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky are expected. They did not offer any details. The defense lawyers for both men said they would appeal within 10 days, the limit under Russian law. 
 There was public silence from the Kremlin in the hours after the verdicts were read.
 Metal barriers, police officers with batons and troops with automatic rifles ringed the courthouse. Cellphones outside the courthouse were jammed.
 Mr. Khodorkovsky's defense lawyers and supporters have said since his arrest that the case against him was largely driven by political motivations and Kremlin pique, a post-Soviet update of the Communist Party's infamous show trials.
 A battle to shape the public's perception of the verdict began immediately after the sentences were made public. Yukos released a statement declaring the cases ''a gross travesty of justice produced by a judicial system that has not only been content to be maneuvered to destroy Mikhail Khodorkovsky, but also is intent on bringing down Yukos.''
 Representative Tom Lantos of California, the ranking Democratic member of the House International Relations Committee, appeared outside the court. ''This political trial, tried before a kangaroo court, has come to a shameful conclusion,'' he said. ''The conclusion of this trial was predetermined politically.''
 Mr. Lantos said he would reintroduce a motion to exclude Russia from the Group of 8 industrial nations, a proposal the White House has previously opposed. 
 The denunciations by Yukos and Mr. Lantos were joined by voices throughout Russia's small opposition, but were also met by unequivocal statements of support for the verdicts from men in Mr. Putin's circle.
 Sergei Mironov, the speaker of the upper house of Parliament, a body seen as largely obedient to Mr. Putin, said the verdicts were exactly as expected.
 ''I would not have understood it if the court had acquitted Khodorkovsky,'' Mr. Mironov told the Interfax news agency. ''Then I would have become doubtful about the prosecutor general's office.''
 Mr. Khodorkovsky, in a statement read outside the courthouse by Anton Drel, one of his lawyers, said he vowed to continue to speak out from prison and would underwrite foundations supporting poetry, philosophy and prisoners in Russia.
 Now possibly the world's wealthiest convict -- the Russian edition of Forbes magazine estimated his net worth this year at $2 billion, well below the $15 billion of the previous year -- he also made clear his feelings about the case.
 ''I know that my conviction was decided in the Kremlin,'' his statement said. ''Some in the president's entourage insisted that only an acquittal would inspire society's trust in the authorities. Others believed I should be put in prison for a long time to deprive me of any capacity to fight for freedom. 
 ''To the first group, I would say thank you. And I would like to inform the others that they have not won. I will fight for freedom.''
 His mother, Marina, then spoke. ''We lost our son the day Putin came to power,'' she said. ''We know who these people are, these K.G.B. people. How could our country elect such a person from this organization?''

HEADLINE: Europe Strikes Back in Plane Dispute

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER and ELIZABETH BECKER; Paul Meller reported from Brussels for this article and Elizabeth Becker from Washington.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 31 

 BODY:
The European Union will countersue the United States at the World Trade Organization in the long-simmering dispute over government subsidies to their respective aircraft makers, the European trade commissioner said Tuesday. 
 Months of efforts to settle the differences bilaterally all but evaporated late Monday when the office of the United States trade representative said it would file a case against Europe for subsidizing Airbus, a rival of Boeing in passenger and cargo aircraft. On Tuesday, the United States made good on that pledge.
 ''I am disappointed that the U.S. has chosen this confrontation with Europe,'' Peter Mandelson, the European trade representative, said at a news conference at the European Commission headquarters. ''It will be hard fought on both sides and, I can assure you, Europe's interests will be fully defended.'' 
 The tit-for-tat legal action would be the biggest and most complicated trade dispute ever to face the W.T.O., Mr. Mandelson said. The dispute over billions of dollars in subsidies received by both companies in the last 13 years may harm global talks to reduce trade barriers, he warned. 
 The world's two biggest trading blocs will be distracted now by ''a grudge fight between two companies competing for share of a global market that is big enough for both of them,'' he said, when they should be channeling their energies into making the current global trade round a success.
 The Bush administration initiated its lawsuit against the European Union on Tuesday, contending that subsidies to Airbus are illegal under W.T.O. rules. The United States argues that the government support Boeing receives, including the billions of dollars for research and development, fall within the W.T.O. rules, while the European loans for research and development do not because the support takes the form of noncommercial loans.
 American officials say that the risk for any new plane's success or failure falls on the European taxpayers who underwrite the loans, not the European airline industry. 
 Richard Mills, the spokesman at the office of the United States trade representative, said of Europe's decision to sue: ''We're not surprised. It's been clear for some time that litigation would mean two cases.''
 ''We want to see an end to subsidies,'' he said. ''That's been our consistent position. We're comfortable having the W.T.O. decide because we think we'll prevail and because that's what the W.T.O. is there for, to help settle trade disputes.''
 The European Union and the United States reached a bilateral agreement in 1992 on how to subsidize and support their large civilian aircraft industries. Since then, the W.T.O. was created and Airbus became a competitor with Boeing in the global aircraft market, making it more difficult for the sides to reach a new agreement now that the old one has expired.
 Mr. Mandelson had recently offered to reduce the amount of initial aid for the latest prototype by Airbus, the A350 jet, by about a third as a way to get talks going with Washington, but the United States insisted on the full elimination of aid. But, under W.T.O. rules, Airbus is free to seek and receive aid while the dispute is examined. 
 The breakdown in bilateral talks with the United States follows a similar hardening of positions between Europe and China over the surge in imports of textiles to the European Union since the beginning of this year.
 Last Friday, the European Commission started formal procedures to try to curb the sudden rise in Chinese textile imports. Over the weekend the Chinese government announced that it would abandon plans to impose tariffs on its textile exporters, after Europe's decision to pursue formal action.
 Mr. Mandelson's office said it was surprised by the move by China. Similarly, late Monday his spokeswoman, Claude Veron-Reville, said the commission found the decision by the United States to go to the W.T.O. over Airbus subsidies ''surprising and disappointing.''
 Pascal Lamy, who was appointed to the top W.T.O. post last week, spent the last five years as Europe's trade commissioner, and the dispute over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing started gaining momentum in the final months of his tenure in Brussels. Some lawyers fear that the United States may argue that under Mr. Lamy, a former advocate for Europe, the W.T.O. cannot be neutral.

HEADLINE: Trump Group Selling Parcel For $1.8 Billion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A consortium of Hong Kong investors and Donald J. Trump are selling a stretch of riverfront land and three buildings on the Upper West Side for about $1.8 billion in the largest residential sale in city history and in the latest example of a rocketing housing market.
 The Extell Development Corporation and the Carlyle Group have a tentative deal to buy a major swath of developable land at the onetime railroad yard between 59th and 72nd Streets, which has been turned into a luxury enclave known variously as Riverside South and Trump Place, according to real estate executives who have been briefed on the deal. The 77-acre property embraces what will be a 21-acre public park that slopes down to the Hudson River.
 The deal comes as the average condominium price in Manhattan has soared to more than $1.2 million and as developable land has become increasingly rare, even as some economists worry that a housing bubble will soon burst. 
 Extell, which is building the 60-story Orion condo tower on 42nd Street and owns the W Hotel in Times Square, is buying the three rental buildings at the site, as well as lots to build eight more apartment houses and nearly 3,000 apartments.
 The deal also includes a five-acre parcel between 59th and 62nd Streets that real estate executives said could be rezoned for an additional 1,500 apartments. There are four condo buildings at the site that are not part of the deal. 
 It is unclear whether any new buildings on the site will bear Mr. Trump's name in characteristic gold letters.
 Real estate executives said that the new buyers would have to pay the developer for using his name.
 ''I think the potential for this site is huge, because in the aftermath of Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, the redevelopment of the Far West Side is happening at an extremely rapid rate,'' said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a residential broker.
 The sale price was a huge number, Ms. Packes added. ''But at any given point in time, when land and buildings change hands, people always question the potential rise in value,'' she said.
 Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, declined to comment. Paul Davis, chief executive of Hudson Waterfront Associations, which represents the Hong Kong investors in New York, was unavailable for comment yesterday.
 Longtime critics of Mr. Trump and his project welcomed his departure yesterday.
 ''Even though they're paying an exorbitant price in this overheated market, we hope the new owners will be more responsive to the community,'' Madeleine Polayes, a leader of the Coalition for a Livable West Side and a longtime opponent of Mr. Trump and his project, said through a spokeswoman. ''Can we get the name changed from Trump Place to something else?''
 If it is completed, real estate executives said, the deal should be a windfall for the investors and Mr. Trump, who acquired the land for less than $100 million a decade ago during a real estate recession.
 There is little question that the market is hot once again. Last year, the 15-story Mayflower Hotel near Lincoln Center and a vacant lot next door sold for $401 million to a group with plans to build a large apartment tower. And in April, a group led by Kent Swig paid $418 million for the 50-story, 845-unit Sheffield apartment house on 57th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
 The former freight yard property has a long and tortured history as the largest parcel of undeveloped land in Manhattan. Mr. Trump first gained control of the defunct freight yard in 1974. Unable to build, he sold the property to another developer, who also made little progress. Mr. Trump regained control of the property in 1982 and later proposed building Television City, a wall of skyscrapers along the waterfront, including a 150-story tower, the tallest in the world. 
 But that project came under intense criticism from city planners and civic and neighborhood groups and the proposal died in 1987.
 With the city in a deep recession in 1991 and Mr. Trump laboring under enormous debts, the developer redesigned the project with his onetime opponents, the Municipal Art Society and five other civic organizations, creating a 21-acre public park along the water and pulling the buildings back to a newly created extension of Riverside Drive.
 To solve his financial problems, Mr. Trump brought in a group of Hong Kong and Chinese investors in 1994, who bought a $300 million mortgage on the land for $82 million. The investors had hoped that construction would start within a year, but continuing opposition from community groups and some elected officials, including Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, delayed the project until 1997.
 But since the project started, the apartments have sold and leased well. Real estate executives said that two condo buildings nearing completion were already sold out. Earlier this year, the partners sold a small site to the Atlantic Development Corporation to build about 300 subsidized apartments.

HEADLINE: The Peacemaker

BYLINE: By Olle Wastberg. 
Olle Wastberg was consul general of Sweden to New York City from 1999 to 2004.

DATELINE: Stockholm 

 BODY:
TODAY I will send a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee nominating the former mayor of New York City, Rudolph W. Giuliani, for the Nobel Peace Prize. As a former member of the Swedish Parliament I have the right to submit nominees -- in the past I nominated Elie Wiesel, who won in 1986 -- and I selected Mr. Giuliani because I believe that he has, through his political efforts, saved more human lives than most people alive today.
 Mr. Giuliani took office in 1994, when the city was rife with gang violence, rundown neighborhoods, robbery, graffiti and litter. The police had lost the daily battle against serious crime. The mayor brought with him a policy of rethinking the fight against crime -- a policy that proved to be effective even after he left office: a quick comparison of crime rates collected by the Police Department in 1993 with those from last year show that murders went down by 76.2 percent; rapes by 41.1 percent; robberies by 74.2 percent; assaults by 57.5 percent; burglaries by 77.3 percent; grand larcenies by 45.7 percent; and car thefts by 84.5 percent. 
 Or, in more human terms, it would appear that over the last 12 years the policies Mr. Giuliani put in place have spared New York perhaps 10,000 murders, 15,000 rapes and 800,000 robberies. This is clearly a humanitarian accomplishment of great magnitude.
 In my letter to Oslo, I stress that the Giuliani administration's crime policy was unique in two ways. First was its concentration on crime prevention rather than arrests. I was invited to several statistics-review meetings in which the mayor and his commissioners examined crime trends with the Police Department's top officers. Interestingly, these police chiefs were primarily held responsible for the number of crimes reported rather than for the percentage of crimes solved. A chief who did not keep crime statistics low risked losing his job. The other unique contribution was the campaign against so-called quality-of-life crimes. The theory is that if an area becomes rundown, if young men are allowed to urinate against walls, if graffiti proliferate, then the public's sense of security will deteriorate. The need for security guards and surveillance cameras increases, and society as a whole becomes more closed. The trust necessary in a modern society requires vigilance against such crimes that disturb the peace. 
 Thus, for example, the Police Department's successful effort under Mr. Giuliani to reduce robberies and graffiti in the subway was based on catching turnstile jumpers. The theory was that a person who planned to spray-paint subway cars or rob passengers would not buy a ticket. Stopping the jumpers thus cut down on other crimes. New York's quick recovery as a tourism destination after Sept. 11, 2001, despite the remaining terrorist threat, can be attributed to awareness that New York had become one of the world's safest cities.
 Is all of this solely to Mr. Giuliani's credit? No, far from it. His policy was based on the scientific work of the sociologists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, who also served as mayoral advisers. Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, William Bratton, played a central role. But it is Rudy Giuliani who personified the policy, took significant political risks and consistently supported a considerably demoralized police force.
 Mr. Giuliani's detractors like to claim that his crime-prevention program unduly harmed racial minorities and increased tensions among the city's ethnic groups. This perception is largely false: most victims of crime in New York were and are members of minority groups; gang violence among Wall Street bankers is a rare thing. The people who suffer most from an ineffectual police force are poor people in bad residential areas, and they gained the most from Mr. Giuliani's successes. 
 Another common objection is that ''crime just moved somewhere else.'' This, too, is not true. The number of reported crimes decreased more or less consistently in all 123 police districts. And while the substantial drop in the use of crack and other drugs since the early 90's may be attributable to many factors, including AIDS and the nation's economic boom, there is no denying that police intervention was a major one.
 The Nobel Peace Prize long ago freed itself from the directives of Alfred Nobel's will, in which the focus was on contributions of the international peace conferences of that time. It now often goes to people like Mother Teresa and last year's winner, Wangari Maathai, who have made humanitarian contributions. The civic actions symbolized by Rudolph W. Giuliani deserve equal recognition.

HEADLINE: Bush Hints He Will Withhold Other Papers on Bolton

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
President Bush criticized Senate Democrats on Tuesday for ''stalling'' a vote on John R. Bolton's nomination as ambassador to the United Nations, and indicated that he would not grant them access to intelligence documents they have demanded to see before allowing the confirmation to go ahead.
 Mr. Bush's statements, at a news conference in the Rose Garden, suggested that he was intent on winning the battle over Mr. Bolton on his own terms when the Senate reconvenes next week, rather than negotiating a deal with Democrats and some Republicans who have been advocating a compromise. 
 Democrats delayed a vote on the nomination on Thursday night, saying they wanted access to classified information about Mr. Bolton's conduct that the administration has refused for weeks to provide.
 ''Now in terms of the requests for the documents, I view that as just another stall tactic,'' Mr. Bush said, ''another way to delay, another way not to allow Bolton to get an up or down vote.''
 Democrats gave no indication they would back down. ''Mr. Bolton's fate lies with the president,'' said Jim Manley, the spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. ''If he agrees to turn over the requested information about his nominee, then Mr. Bolton will get his up or down vote. The Senate is entitled to the information. It's really that simple.''
 President Bush's comments came on the day the White House and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice marked the second anniversary of the White House program to slow nuclear proliferation, in which Mr. Bolton was a key player. The targets of the program include North Korea, Iran and Syria. 
 Mr. Bush said, ''We've got a lot of work to do with the North Korean,'' apparently referring to Kim Jong Il, the president, ''because he tends to ignore what the other five nations are saying at times.'' The United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia have been engaged in more than two years of talks aimed at persuading the North to end its nuclear arms program. 
 He added at another point: ''It's either diplomacy or military. And I am for the diplomacy approach.''
 Mr. Bush, whose poll numbers have been slipping as he faces difficulties with his agendas at home and abroad, used the news conference to try to regain the initiative. He hailed what he called a strong economy, and called on Congress to act soon to pass his energy bill, approve a free-trade agreement with Central America, hold down the growth in government spending and move ahead to remake the Social Security system.
 ''Again, things don't happen instantly in Washington, D.C.,'' he said, dismissing a question about whether he had lost momentum.
 Asked how he would select a nominee for the Supreme Court, Mr. Bush sounded as if he expected to make such a selection, though he did not allude specifically to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who has been under treatment for thyroid cancer. He said that he was ''obviously going to spend a lot of time reviewing the records of a variety of people,'' and that he looked forward ''to talking to members of the Senate about the Supreme Court process.''
 On foreign policy, he said that he was pleased with the progress being made in Iraq, despite the recent surge of violence there, and that Britain, France and Germany were making progress in persuading Iran to abandon its nuclear program. He reiterated his commitment to seeking a diplomatic solution with North Korea over its nuclear activities, and dismissed as ''absurd'' a new report from Amnesty International, the human rights monitoring organization, that the United States had established a ''gulag'' at Guantanamo Bay and ''thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights.''
 The United States, he said, ''promotes freedom around the world'' and fully investigates allegations of improper behavior toward prisoners in a transparent way. The Amnesty International report, Mr. Bush said, struck him as being based in part on ''allegations by people who were held in detention, people who hate America.'' 
 He said the United States would be ''watching the ongoing case'' of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the Russian oil company executive who was convicted Tuesday and sentenced to nine years in prison in a fraud and tax case that was widely seen as an effort by the Kremlin to intimidate a potential rival to President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Bush offered no criticism of Mr. Putin, and said the focus by the United States would be on ''how the appeal will be handled.''
 Asked about the killings of scores of people this month by government forces in Uzbekistan, an American ally in the fight against terrorism, Mr. Bush said he expected all nations ''to honor human rights and protect minority rights.'' He said he had asked the Red Cross to investigate what had happened there, but stopped short of criticizing the government of President Islam A. Karimov.
 The 51-minute session with reporters was the latest in a string of monthly news conferences Mr. Bush has held since Election Day. 
 He dodged or deflected a number of questions, like whether he would be willing to back off his call for investment accounts in Social Security if doing so would lead to a bipartisan agreement. He deviated little from his standard responses on a variety of issues, including Iraq. Asked whether the increase in violence meant the insurgency was getting more lethal, he pronounced himself ''pleased with the progress'' in Iraq, including the installation of a democratic government; expressed confidence in the ability of the Iraqis to develop their own security; and said the insurgents were being driven to greater violence by the prospect of seeing democracy take root.
 Mr. Bush said the relationship between the United States and China was ''very complex,'' and ''Americans ought to view it as such.'' He said that Americans ought to look at China as ''an economic opportunity,'' but that Beijing had to be pressed at times to abide by international trade rules and to take a role as a partner in efforts to deal with North Korea and battle terrorism.

HEADLINE: Beyond Viagra Politics

BYLINE: By MATT MILLER. 
E-mail: mattmiller@nytimes.com; Matt Miller is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Maureen Dowd is on book leave.

 BODY:
In recent days, governors of both parties have swung into action to deny state-subsidized Viagra to known sexual offenders. Who says our leaders aren't taking on the tough issues and speaking truth to power? 
 Still, it does get you thinking. What if leaders in each party actually did tell their supporters some truths they needed to hear -- and thereby exposed the charades each side relies on to wangle the support of half of the half of Americans who bother to vote? Take a dose of truth serum and fantasize with me. 
 Our Republican truth-teller would start by admitting what President Bush was still denying in his press conference yesterday: that the G.O.P.'s perennial attack on ''big government'' is a con. Republicans know that just seven programs make up 75 percent of federal spending: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, military pensions, civil service pensions, defense and interest on the debt. That's ''big government.'' Republicans aren't cutting a dime of it. In fact, under Bush, they've called for big increases. Interest on the debt alone will double under Bush's plan (and on Social Security, recall, he's trying only to slow its growth). 
 And this is before you toss in everything from NASA to the national parks to the National Institutes of Health, not to mention student loans, farm subsidies and homeland security. These things take up a good chunk of the quarter of the federal dollar that's left, and Republicans vote for them every day.
 The ''big government'' hoax would become even clearer if Republicans admitted a related truth: today's epic budget deficits are caused mostly by Bush's tax cuts, not, as the president insisted again yesterday, by some spending binge. Here's how we know. Federal spending under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush averaged 22 percent of G.D.P. Under Bill Clinton it averaged 20 percent. Bush's plan (despite his spending increases) would keep spending around 20 percent in the years ahead. 
 As you may have noticed, 20 is less than 22. Bush is operating government at a smaller level than did previous Republican presidents. Today's historic red ink is due to the fact that revenues have dropped from over 20 percent of G.D.P. when Bush took office to under 17 percent today. 
 Wouldn't it be nice if elected Republicans would say out loud what one told me privately: that it's lunacy to think we can keep revenue this low as we start to double the number of seniors on Social Security and Medicare in a few years? Truth-serum Republicans would explain that talk of endless tax cuts in this context amounts to a shocking case of collective denial. 
 Truth-telling Democrats would come clean on their own charades. Imagine a Democrat declaring that the party must stop pretending that mandates on business (for health coverage, say) are ''free'' ways to get social results Democrats like -- when such mandates impose costs ultimately borne by workers or consumers. 
 And imagine if Democrats said it was time to stop scaring seniors about the G.O.P.'s nefarious plans for Medicare. Truly ''new'' Democrats would instead teach party activists something different: that the enemy of liberal causes a decade from now will not be the evil heirs of Newt Gingrich, but Medicare itself. That's because every dollar spent on soaring Medicare bills that isn't needed for quality care (in our wasteful health system) is a dollar that liberals won't be able to spend on a poor child. 
 Imagine a Democrat who explained that this is what the trade-offs will sound like before long -- by way of urging Democrats to take the lead on slowing the growth of these programs, rather than condemning Republican efforts to do so. 
 There's more, of course, but this gives you a feel for how different our politics would sound if we moved beyond Viagra politics and got serious about our problems. All it would take is enough of us rebelling against a perverse culture in which ''political courage'' is oddly defined as ''telling the truth.'' After all, if we don't make the world safe for our leaders to do the right thing, who will? 
 ''I like a look of agony, because I know it's true,'' wrote Emily Dickinson. It may not be agony citizens are looking for, but common sense tells them that the ratio of fact to flimflam has reached depressing lows. It may take a jolt to the system more powerful than the one Viagra delivers to rouse us from the torpor of charades-as-usual. Then again, now that Deep Throat has been unveiled, maybe anything is possible.

HEADLINE: Fear and Rejection

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Forgive me for making a blunt and obvious point, but events in Western Europe are slowly discrediting large swaths of American liberalism. 
 Most of the policy ideas advocated by American liberals have already been enacted in Europe: generous welfare measures, ample labor protections, highly progressive tax rates, single-payer health care systems, zoning restrictions to limit big retailers, and cradle-to-grave middle-class subsidies supporting everything from child care to pension security. And yet far from thriving, continental Europe has endured a lost decade of relative decline. 
 Western Europeans seem to be suffering a crisis of confidence. Election results, whether in North Rhine-Westphalia or across France and the Netherlands, reveal electorates who have lost faith in their leaders, who are anxious about declining quality of life, who feel extraordinarily vulnerable to foreign competition -- from the Chinese, the Americans, the Turks, even the Polish plumbers. 
 Anybody who has lived in Europe knows how delicious European life can be. But it is not the absolute standard of living that determines a people's morale, but the momentum. It is happier to live in a poor country that is moving forward -- where expectations are high -- than it is to live in an affluent country that is looking back.
 Right now, Europeans seem to look to the future with more fear than hope. As Anatole Kaletsky noted in The Times of London, in continental Europe ''unemployment has been stuck between 8 and 11 percent since 1991 and growth has reached 3 percent only once in those 14 years.'' 
 The Western European standard of living is about a third lower than the American standard of living, and it's sliding. European output per capita is less than that of 46 of the 50 American states and about on par with Arkansas. There is little prospect of robust growth returning any time soon. 
 Once it was plausible to argue that the European quality of life made up for the economic underperformance, but those arguments look more and more strained, in part because demographic trends make even the current conditions unsustainable. Europe's population is aging and shrinking. By 2040, the European median age will be around 50. Nearly a third of the population will be over 65. Public spending on retirees will have to grow by a third, sending Europe into a vicious spiral of higher taxes and less growth. 
 This is the context for the French ''no'' vote on the E.U. constitution. This is the psychology of stagnation that shaped voter perceptions. It wasn't mostly the constitution itself voters were rejecting. Polls reveal they were articulating a broader malaise. The highest ''no'' votes came from the most vulnerable, from workers and the industrial north. The ''no'' campaign united the fearful right, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen with the fearful left, led by the Communists.
 Influenced by anxiety about the future, every faction across the political spectrum found something to feel menaced by. For the Socialist left, it was the threat of economic liberalization. For parts of the right, it was the threat of Turkey. For populists, it was the condescension of the Brussels elite. For others, it was the prospect of a centralized European superstate. Many of these fears were mutually exclusive. The only commonality was fear itself, the desire to hang on to what they have in the face of change and tumult all around. 
 The core fact is that the European model is foundering under the fact that billions of people are willing to work harder than the Europeans are. Europeans clearly love their way of life, but don't know how to sustain it. 
 Over the last few decades, American liberals have lauded the German model or the Swedish model or the European model. But these models are not flexible enough for the modern world. They encourage people to cling fiercely to entitlements their nation cannot afford. And far from breeding a confident, progressive outlook, they breed a reactionary fear of the future that comes in left- and right-wing varieties -- a defensiveness, a tendency to lash out ferociously at anybody who proposes fundamental reform or at any group, like immigrants, that alters the fabric of life. 
 This is the chief problem with the welfare state, which has nothing to do with the success or efficiency of any individual program. The liberal project of the postwar era has bred a stultifying conservatism, a fear of dynamic flexibility, a greater concern for guarding what exists than for creating what doesn't. 
 That's a truth that applies just as much on this side of the pond.

HEADLINE: The Economy: On One Hand, But Then ... 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Manufacturing is weakening, but housing is thriving. The prices of raw materials are rising more slowly. 
 Economic and industry reports issued yesterday sketched out an uneven patchwork of performance, with different sectors blowing hot and cold. They added up to an overall economic picture that still shows an economy growing at a strong pace but not so fast that inflation could creep substantially higher. 
 Stock and bond prices were buoyed by the data, which bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve might soon stop raising short-term interest rates. 
 Those hopes were reinforced when Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told CNBC that the Fed is in ''the eighth inning'' of the tightening cycle and the ninth is ''coming up'' at the next Fed meeting at the end of June.
 ''I think there's room to tighten a little bit further and then we'll see,'' Mr. Fisher went on. 
 Not everybody is equally sanguine. With data indicating both strength and weakness, there was space for skepticism about the benign outlook on prices. ''We have a very robust housing market, construction, housing starts and consumer spending are all on the strong side,'' Joseph Abate, a Lehman Brothers economist, said. ''It's hard to argue the end of the tightening cycle. We'll probably go into extra innings.''
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.9 percent yesterday, or 10.72 points, to 1,202.22. And the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.88 percent, its lowest level since March of last year. 
 The case for weaker growth and lower inflation was made by manufacturers. The Institute for Supply Management reported that its index of the manufacturing sector fell to 51.4 percent in May, its lowest level since June 2003. Numbers above 50 mean manufacturing is still growing. But after 24 consecutive months of growth, Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the institute's manufacturing survey committee, said, ''The sector is losing momentum.''
 Car companies had a bleak May. Sales at General Motors declined 5.4 percent. Ford posted a 2.7 percent sales drop, and some of its top brands, like the Escape and Explorer S.U.V.'s, fell by 35 to 40 percent -- hurt by customers' shift away from gas guzzlers as gasoline prices rose.
 Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a business research group in Arlington, Va., said weaker sales of automobiles and some other consumer goods were slowing production up through the supply chain -- affecting everybody from auto parts makers to steel manufacturers to weavers of textiles for car seats. ''The momentum really stops when there's an inventory swing,'' Mr. Meckstroth said.
 Weaker manufacturing appears to be reducing commodity prices after a year of hefty increases. The Institute for Supply Management's price index slowed sharply in May, with purchasing managers reporting falling prices across a range of commodities, from energy to steel to ferrous scrap. ''It's the first sign of a break in the inflationary cycle,'' Mr. Ore said.
 Mr. Meckstroth argued, however, that manufacturing growth is just decelerating somewhat from its rapid pace in 2004 -- hindered by the recent strengthening of the dollar. High energy prices have also contributed to the slowdown by denting consumer spending. 
 But with other sectors still showing red-hot growth, there appears to be little risk of a substantial economic slowdown.
 Notably, housing -- which has been the main pillar of support for consumer spending, stimulating large swaths of the economy -- keeps growing at breakneck speed. The National Association of Realtors' index of pending home sales, a leading indicator for housing, jumped to its highest level on record in April, 3.6 percent higher than in March. 
 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reported housing prices gained 12.5 percent in the first quarter, compared with the period last year. The price of homes in Nevada, the hottest market in the country, rose by 31.2 percent. 
 The housing market continues to support economic growth. The Census Bureau reported that construction activity rose 0.5 percent in April over March, driven by a 0.8 percent increase in private construction. 
 Moreover, according to David A. Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, housing supports about 20 percent of total economic output, affecting everything from furniture to appliance sales. Its impact outstrips manufacturing's 12 to 15 percent slice of the nation's gross domestic product.
 ''It's unbelievable, isn't it? There is no weakening in sight right now,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''All the stars are aligned.''
 And as mortgage rates follow Treasury bond yields on their way down, manufacturing's reported weakness may help keep the stars in alignment.

HEADLINE: A 28-Year Love Affair With a Pair of Stylish Siblings

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
ARCHITECTURAL historians ordinarily specialize in a region, an era, a style. Stephen M. Salny may be the only member of his profession to focus on just a brother and a sister.
 For 28 years, Mr. Salny, 50, has been studying David Adler, a country house architect who practiced near Chicago from the 1910's to the 1940's, and Mr. Adler's sister and collaborator, Frances Elkins, an interior designer who worked for Hollywood moguls and Midwestern industrialists. Mr. Adler was a traditionalist, producing houses mainly in a Georgian or Mediterranean vein, while Mrs. Elkins frequently juxtaposed antiques with crystal moldings, ebony floors and avant-garde furniture by Jean-Michel Frank and Alberto Giacometti. Mr. Salny sometimes speaks of ''David and Frances,'' and in the present tense. 
 ''Short of exhuming bodies, I dig as deep with research as I can,'' he said while steering this reporter through his disorientingly cluttered office just outside Baltimore. (''I hope this article makes me out to be an eccentric,'' he said.) Copies of floor plans, correspondence and clippings about Mr. Adler and Mrs. Elkins spilled out of file cabinets and onto the teal carpet. ''I want copies of everything I find out about in an archive,'' he said. ''If it's a chewing gum wrapper, I want it.''
 Mr. Salny's latest book, ''Frances Elkins: Interior Design'' (Norton, $65), comes out next month. He has interviewed hundreds of people who knew his subjects or lived in the houses or just admire their work from afar.
 The fan club now includes Nan Kempner (she grew up in an Elkins-designed home in San Francisco), Robert A.M. Stern and Albert Hadley. ''Frances Elkins stands up there with Elsie de Wolfe, Syrie Maugham, Ruby Ross Wood,'' said the interior designer Rose Tarlow. ''There was so little information about her until recently, I always wanted to know more.''
 Some Modernists are drawn to the siblings' work. Peter Reed, the senior deputy director for curatorial affairs at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, often visited his grandmother's stone Georgian mansion in Lake Forest, Ill., designed by Mr. Adler and Mrs. Elkins. ''It had a formality yet a comfort achieved through the palette and materials,'' Mr. Reed said. 
 Mr. Salny has no formal degree in architecture or history, and has a full-time job running apartment complexes that his grandfather built. Since 1977, he has invested some $230,000 researching minutiae about the brother and sister. he said.
 ''I just had this intuitive love affair with the houses as soon as I saw them,'' he said. ''I just recognized their quality.'' 
 Richard Guy Wilson, a professor of architectural history at the University of Virginia who occasionally writes about Mr. Adler and Mrs. Elkins, said that Mr. Salny was ''very unusual'' for his razor-narrow focus and lack of formal training. Mr. Wilson added, ''It's been a major contribution, his bringing attention to Adler and Elkins.''
 Mr. Salny first noticed houses designed by the pair while driving around the Chicago suburbs as an economics student at Lake Forest College. He persuaded two dozen homeowners to let him tour their properties, and wrote a 76-page independent study paper analyzing the designs. His paper gave skeleton biographies for the siblings, and he has been filling in details ever since.
 Mr. Adler and Mrs. Elkins grew up in Milwaukee, where their father was a prosperous clothing manufacturer. Mr. Adler graduated from Princeton in 1904 and studied architecture in Paris and Munich. His sister, whose education ended in high school, traveled with him to Europe. He designed 45 houses for clients who included heirs of department-store, mimeograph and steel fortunes. His sister married a Philadelphia polo player, Felton Elkins. They moved to Monterey, Calif., in 1918, and soon divorced. She supported their daughter first by decorating houses for friends and then hotels, clubs and stores.
 Clients and colleagues told Mr. Salny that Mr. Adler, who lived outside Chicago and died in 1949, had been meticulous, reserved and a good listener. He didn't approve of his sister's roster of flashy Hollywood clients, like Edward G. Robinson and David O. Selznick. Mrs. Elkins, who traveled east to work on projects with her brother, was vivacious and chic, usually dressing in Chanel. She was also imperious.
 ''She'd tell clients how to set their dinner table, what china, silver, glassware, and linens to use,'' Mr. Salny said. ''And the only flowers she allowed were pink and red carnations.''
 Mrs. Elkins, who died in 1953, collaborated with her brother on a third of his projects, and they traveled together on European furniture-buying trips. ''He was a huge influence on her, but then she'd push the envelope,'' Mr. Salny said. While stocking Mr. Adler's paneled rooms with tiered end tables and Regency bedsteads, Mrs. Elkins would suggest mirror wallcoverings and zigzag metal inlays on dark floors. She favored Steuben moldings around fireplaces, lacquered tables by the French Modernist Jean-Michel Frank, and sconces that the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti modeled after human hands. Mr. Adler, Mr. Salny said, accepted the avant-garde work ''because it had a classical streak.''
 The interior designer Mark Hampton once described a 1929 library Mrs. Elkins lined in goatskin as ''the most boldly stylish room I have ever seen in this country.'' That library, at the former home of the MoMA curator Peter Reed's grandmother in Lake Forest, remains intact. (It is the only Adler-Elkins collaboration that survives; three other interiors by Mrs. Elkins remain largely unchanged, as well as all but seven of her brother's houses.)
 Mr. Salny has visited the library ''at least 30 times,'' he said. It inspired his own home, a two-bedroom condo in Baltimore. His walls and carpet are in shades of tan, and the upholstery is sage, chamois or celadon green. Abstract prints by Ellsworth Kelly and Helen Frankenthaler hang near tiered end tables.
 ''I think Frances would be flattered,'' he said. ''But I'm sure she'd have her own ideas about what should have been done.''

HEADLINE: 2 'No' Votes in Europe: The Anger Spreads

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 1 

 BODY:
Some are calling it a divorce; others, a disenchantment. Whatever you call it, the French ''non'' on Sunday and the Dutch ''nee'' on Wednesday have clearly left the European Union's proposed constitution a dead letter for now, frustrating the efforts of Europe's leaders to move to the next stage of integration. 
 The impasse could stall efforts to develop common foreign policies and push the euro, a potent symbol of unification, into a downward spiral. 
 But there is something at stake here far broader than the constitution itself, which the Dutch rejected emphatically on Wednesday, 61.6 percent to 38.4 percent, according to unofficial results. [Page A10.] 
 There is a disaffection, perhaps even a rebellion, against the political elites in France, Germany and Italy. 
 The governing parties of the left and the right are saying the same things to their people: that painful, free-market economic reforms are the only path toward rejuvenation, more jobs, better futures. And the people, who have come to equate the idea of an expanded Europe with a challenge to cradle-to-grave social protections, are giving the same answer: We don't believe you. 
 A French lawyer and commentator, Nicolas Baverez, who once wrote a book titled ''The Fall of France,'' called the French vote ''an insurrection, a democratic intifada,'' that reflected the ''despair and fears of the French in front of the decline of their country and the inability of their leaders to cope with the crisis.'' 
 The repercussions of this uprising will be felt widely. 
 ''I think there's a revolt against the establishment that leaves governments from Great Britain to France to Germany to Italy singularly weak,'' said Charles Kupchan, an associate professor of international relations at Georgetown University and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, ''and that spells trouble for Europe and it spells trouble for an America that will be looking to Europe for help on many different fronts.''
 The public disaffection is different in each country, and more than economic matters are involved. Europeans are worried, among other things, that the rapid enlargement of the European Union, especially the prospect of Turkey's membership, will leave them more vulnerable to uncontrolled immigration, especially by Muslims. There is a sense, palpable in the Netherlands, that the whole European enterprise is controlled by unresponsive, unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats in Brussels who have it in their power to rob countries of their national identities.
 But in France, Germany and Italy, already beset by high unemployment, the worry that free-market reforms will only make matters worse predominates. A week before the French rejected the constitution, Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, called early elections, after local defeats had left him essentially without the authority to govern. Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has promised reforms but failed to deliver them, out of concern for mass discontent.
 The paradox here is that if the political elites and most economists are right in saying that free-market reforms and more competition are essential for these nations to match their economic competition, then the ''democratic intifada'' could rob the faltering core of Europe of the very means it needs to rejuvenate itself.
 ''Old Europe lacks confidence and is therefore defensive, trying to freeze things rather than look forward, feeling that any change is bad,'' Mark Leonard, a specialist on European Union affairs at the Center for European Reform, said in a telephone interview. ''It's a toxic brew of failure to build support for reform, terrible economic circumstances and elites that are tarnished and shop-soiled.'' 
 It would make things a bit too simple to depict public distrust of politicians in Europe these days as purely resistance to economic reform. Indeed, in Germany most people seem to accept the idea of reform, at least theoretically. The nub is that Germans are more strongly attached to a countervailing idea -- that even as a country enacts reforms, it has a responsibility to protect people against their effects.
 ''We do need more liberalism,'' said Janis M. Emmanouilidis of the Center for Applied Policy Research in Munich. He was speaking of economic liberalism in the European sense, meaning greater reliance on free markets, reduced benefits and less government protection for the work force.
 ''The problem is that you don't have that kind of tradition in France or Germany,'' he continued. ''The intellectual elites in Germany argue in favor of economic liberalism in a couple of newspapers, like Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Suddeutsche Zeitung. But the rest of the elite looks at this from the standpoint of solidarity, of how you uphold solidarity in the face of reform.''
 This explains what might seem a paradox in the German situation: namely that in repudiating Mr. Schroder because they do not like his reform program, the Germans are turning to the conservatives' candidate for chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is likely to enact even tougher reforms than Mr. Schroder did. Of course, it does not help that unemployment keeps rising, to 12 percent now, just as Mr. Schroder's reforms have started to take a real bite out of the public welfare.
 In the view of many analysts, Mrs. Merkel will have a grace period in which to enact her program, during which Germany will have a real chance to lift itself out of its stagnation. The risk is that if the conservatives' reforms do not show results fairly quickly, the political pendulum will swing against her just as it has swung against Mr. Schroder. 
 In France, too, those who favor liberal reforms say there is one figure who may have the convictions and the political skill to carry them out: Nicolas Sarkozy, who is expected to be reappointed interior minister and is a likely candidate for president in the next elections, in 2007.
 But Mr. Chirac himself seems to have reacted to the crushing defeat he suffered on Sunday by reaffirming his attachment to what he called the ''French model,'' which seemed a coded way of putting tough reforms on the back burner, as he has done at similar moments in the past. 
 ''There is a gap between what reality demands and what the French people want,'' said the political philosopher Pierre Hassner. ''The elites weren't courageous enough to explain things.'' 
 In this sense a great part of the problem, many here say, is that French leaders themselves seem to be uncertain about the need for reform, or at least are inconsistent. ''Chirac is a victim of his own contradictions,'' said Guy Sorman, a French commentator and a rare proponent of free-market liberalism in France. ''He said, 'I am for Europe but against liberalism,' but this is completely absurd because people understand that Europe is a liberal construction.''

HEADLINE: Putting a White House Annual Report to a Test

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
EACH February, the Council of Economic Advisers issues ''The Economic Report of the President.'' The report, which can be found at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/eop/, contains useful economic statistics as well as essays by the members of the council.
 This year's report, as usual, reflects the priorities and interests of the administration and is worth reading for that alone. The ostensible audience is Congress but the essays are generally accessible and are often assigned reading for college economics classes.
 This year's report is particularly noteworthy because it was written by N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor and the council's chairman at the time. Mr. Mankiw is the author of a best-selling introductory economics textbook who is known for his clear writing. In addition to the standard ''state of the economy'' discussions, there are essays on tax reform, immigration, property rights, the information economy, H.I.V./AIDS and international trade.
 The report is supposed to provide an ''accurate assessment of the consensus professional views of economists.'' Recently The Journal of Economic Literature asked five economists to review the report, posing the question, ''Does the discussion in the E.R.P. in fact accurately summarize what we as economists know?''
 Space precludes a detailed discussion of all the reviews, so I will focus on the examination of the chapter on property rights by Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Although Mr. Gruber generally finds the discussion in the chapter to be fair, he disagrees with some of the conclusions. Economists have a saying, ''De gustibus non est disputandum,'' which I like to (mis)translate as ''It's disgusting not to dispute.''
 The chapter points out that property rights help to solve three problems: the tragedy of the commons, which involves overuse of unowned resources; the lack of incentives to invest in unowned resources; and the difficulty of transferring nonowned resources, making trade problematic.
 The first example the report gives to illustrate the benefits of property rights is homeownership, citing studies that find that areas with high rates of homeownership have lower crime rates, more educated residents and other positive social indicators.
 But, as Mr. Gruber points out, the question of cause is unclear. Does homeownership cause lower crime rates, or do people prefer to buy houses where crime rates are lower? Does homeownership result in higher income, or is it just that those who have higher income can afford houses?
 The report fares better with its next example: tradable permits for sulfur dioxide emissions. When this program was introduced by the first Bush administration in 1990, it was widely criticized by environmentalists. 
 But the program is now considered a success, credited with reducing the costs of meeting 1990 sulfur dioxide targets by at least half. 
 But Mr. Gruber argues that ''it is when the chapter tries to extend these lessons from goods markets to service markets that it runs into trouble.'' 
 For example, he argues that the report paints too rosy a picture of voucher programs for school choice. Although there is some recent work indicating that students who use vouchers to move to small private schools improve their performance, there is still debate about what happens to those left behind.
 The report cites one study that finds that both those who move and those who do not benefit from vouchers. But this is only one study; other studies find a negative impact over all on student performance. Thus, according to Mr. Gruber, the ''jury is still out.''
 Mr. Gruber also criticizes the president's proposed privatization of Social Security, arguing that ''the fundamental reason that the Social Security program exists is to prevent myopes from undersaving for their retirement; how can those same myopes be trusted with the much more difficult decision of portfolio optimization?''
 The chapter tends to extol the virtues of privatization, ignoring privatization programs that have not worked out. For example, Mr. Gruber points to the guaranteed student loan program, arguing that it has been a failure.
 Rather than making loans directly to students, the government offers a subsidy to banks in the form of guaranteed repayment. Remarkably, banks are not required to bid for the right to issue these loans, and a result has been both an inefficient mechanism for student aid and a windfall for banks.
 Mr. Gruber concludes that the chapter offers an ''excellent exposition of the case for property rights'' but that policies that work well for goods may work less well for certain kinds of services.
 The report is certainly correct that property rights should be one of the first places to look for solutions to the problems that bedevil public programs. But they should not be the last place, or the only place, to look.

HEADLINE: Virtually Unprotected

 BODY:
When the East Coast and Midwest were hit by a blackout in 2003, the first fear of many people was that terrorists had attacked the electricity grid. It turned out not to have been terrorism, but the fears were well founded. Experts have long warned that the nation's power, transportation and communications systems are vulnerable to ''cyberattacks'' that could devastate the economy and cause huge damage to life and property. Now a new government report has concluded that far too little is being done to close these gaps. 
 After Sept. 11, 2001, a group of leading scientists sent a stern warning to President Bush about the danger of a computer-based terrorist attack on the nation's infrastructure. They called for the creation of a major Cyber-Warfare Defense Project, modeled on the Manhattan Project, to prevent, detect and respond to potential attacks. ''Fast and resolute mitigating action is needed to avoid national disaster,'' the scientists warned.
 Power grids, water treatment and distribution systems, major dams, and oil and chemical refineries are all controlled today by networked computers. Computers make the nation's infrastructure far more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. A well-planned cyberattack could black out large parts of the country, cut off water supplies or worse. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that in 2003 a malicious, invasive program called the Slammer worm infected the computer network at a nuclear power plant and disabled its safety monitoring system for nearly five hours.
 Despite the warnings after 9/11 -- and again after the 2003 blackout -- disturbingly little has been done. The Government Accountability Office did a rigorous review of the Department of Homeland Security's progress on every aspect of computer security, and its findings are not reassuring. It found that the department has not yet developed assessments of the threat of a cyberattack or of how vulnerable major computer systems are to such an attack, nor has it created plans for recovering key Internet functions in case of an attack. The report also expressed concern that many of the department's senior cybersecurity officials have left in the past year. Representative Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat who was among those who requested the G.A.O. report, said last week that it proved that ''a national plan to secure our cybernetworks is virtually nonexistent.''
 Protecting the nation from a potentially devastating cyberattack is not easy. The technological challenges are considerable -- even major technology companies have trouble defending themselves against hackers. The number of potential targets is enormous. And because many of the targets are in private hands, the Department of Homeland Security has to work with entities that may be reluctant to follow the government's lead.
 But overcoming these obstacles should be a high priority. One of the lessons of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington was how much damage a few men with simple weapons, like box cutters, could do if they targeted a point of maximum vulnerability. In a well-planned cyberattack, a single terrorist with nothing more than a computer and Internet access could do an extraordinary amount of harm from half a world away.

HEADLINE: Hormone Dose May Increase People's Trust In Strangers

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
In a finding that may someday benefit the socially manipulative as well as the socially awkward, Swiss researchers are reporting that doses of a natural hormone significantly increased the level of trust that people placed in strangers who were handling their money. 
 Scientists have long known that the hormone used in the study -- oxytocin, which circulates widely in the body during childbirth and lactation -- prompts warm relations and mating in other mammals. 
 But they say the Swiss study, which appears in today's issue of the journal Nature, is the first to show that a simple administration of a hormone in humans can consistently alter something as socially sensitive as trust. The new finding could help researchers not only understand the biological system underlying social judgments but also perhaps correct it when it goes awry, as in conditions like social phobia or autism, scientists say. 
 In the study, the participants played an investment game with anonymous partners. Those who were given oxytocin invested more money with the partners than did those who did not receive the hormone, the researchers found. 
 Dr. Ernst Fehr, a professor of economics at the University of Zurich and the senior author of the paper, said, ''Most experts were very pessimistic'' that the study would find anything of significance.
 But he said that the clear results should ''induce a new wave of oxytocin research in humans.''
 ''I have the hope that this research will lead to clinical applications in psychiatric disorders that are associated with a lack of trust,'' he said. 
 Neuroscientists who were not involved in the study said any hopes for new treatments or fears of abuse of the hormone were premature. 
 ''One always wants to see something like this replicated, and we understand very little about how this oxytocin system works,'' said Dr. Antonio Damasio, a professor of neurology at the University of Iowa, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. ''But this is a very elegant, simple and plausible finding, and is significant because it joins cognitive processes to an underlying biological regulation.'' 
 The oxytocin nasal spray used in the study is not available in the United States; it is prescribed in Europe and elsewhere for inducing contractions or stimulating lactation, according to Novartis, which makes the product. 
 In the study, the Swiss researchers had 178 male college students play a simple investment game. Investors began the game with an allowance of 12 monetary units, of which they could send 12, 8, 4 or none to an unseen, anonymous ''trustee.'' The amount was tripled before being transferred to the trustee, who then chose how much of this income to share with the investor. 
 In previous experiments using this game, economists have shown that investors are guarded with their money at first, increasing their investments only after seeing evidence that their partner is playing fair. The oxytocin study did not allow for this adjustment: Investors knew that they would be dealing only once with four different partners. 
 Yet those who inhaled oxytocin before playing the game invested an average of 10 monetary units, 17 percent more than did players who got a placebo spray. In the oxytocin group, 45 percent invested all their money, compared with 21 percent in the placebo group.
 Neuroscientists, including the Swiss researchers, argue that oxytocin is not so much a trust serum as a kind of brain messenger that primes animals to overcome their natural aversion to others. It allows for what they call ''approach behavior,'' that push to walk up and to a stranger and say hello.
 This may be an especially important ability in people with autism. Whether oxytocin or other hormones could affect such behavior is unclear, but the oxytocin study suggests it is worth investigating. 
 ''To put it succinctly: I believe that oxytocin may help those people who have a pathologically low trust level,'' Dr. Fehr said in an e-mail message. ''But you cannot induce a pathologically high trust level in normal people by giving them oxytocin.
 ''If I abuse your trust once or twice, you are not going to trust me a third time even if I give you a high dosage of oxytocin,'' he said.
 The prospect of used-car dealerships infusing the air with oxytocin to increase sales is also far-fetched, Dr. Fehr said. ''The half-life of oxytocin in the air (in a spray) is just two or three minutes,'' he said. ''Thus you would have to administer a permanent rainfall of it. This looks impossible to me.''

HEADLINE: 80 Years of The New Yorker To Be Offered in Disc Form

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The New Yorker, the weekly magazine that started as ''a hectic book of gossip, cartoons and facetiae,'' as Louis Menand once wrote, and has evolved into a citadel of narrative nonfiction and investigative reporting, will publish its entire 80-year archives on searchable computer discs this fall.
 The collection, titled ''The Complete New Yorker,'' will consist of eight DVD's containing high-resolution digital images of every page of the 4,109 issues of the magazine from February 1925 through the 80th anniversary issue, published last February. Included on the discs will be ''every cover, every piece of writing, every drawing, listing, newsbreak, poem and advertisement,'' David Remnick, editor of the magazine, has written in an introduction to the collection.
 The collection, which will also include a 123-page book containing Mr. Remnick's essay, a New Yorker timeline and highlights of selected pages from the magazine, is being published by the magazine and will be distributed to stores by Random House. It will have a cover price of $100, although it is likely to be sold in many bookstores and online for considerably less. The magazine also plans to issue annual updates to the disc collection, and it expects a first printing of 200,000 copies. 
 While innumerable neurotic New Yorker fanatics have saved piles of the magazine in closets or basements, the few easily accessible archives of the magazine's contents have been on microfilm or in bound volumes in public libraries. But those media hold little attraction for younger readers, Mr. Remnick said, and too frequently go unused. ''Students who rely on Google as a turbo-charged Library of Alexandria feel no more eager to use microfilm than they do to pick up a protractor and a needle-nosed compass,'' Mr. Remnick states in his introduction.
 The project is an amalgam of technology, stealth, insurance considerations and economics that was first discussed more than seven years ago. It was overseen, and long kept secret, by Edward Klaris, general counsel for the magazine, and Pamela Maffei McCarthy, its deputy editor. In early 2004, two staff members drove two copies of each issue of the magazine to Kansas City in a rented truck to have them digitally scanned. 
 The magazine's card catalog, which over time has come to include more than 1.5 million index cards containing citations and cross-references to articles and which forms the backbone of the search function on the discs, was scanned at the magazine's office in Manhattan after discussions with the publication's insurance company found the catalog to be ''irreplaceable and beyond value,'' Mr. Remnick said.
 It was only recently that digital technologies evolved to allow for the high-resolution reproduction of small type, making the project feasible, Mr. Klaris said. Digital videodiscs were used rather than CD's, he said, because much more information can be stored on each DVD. The DVD's are for use only in a computer drive, however, and will not work on a television DVD player.
 A user of the disc is presented with each page of the magazine, which can be displayed singularly or in pairs, and the viewer can flip from page to page through each issue. Alternatively, a user can search on any disc for an author, artist, title or subject or by key words, and then move to the appropriate disc to view the material. Copies of the cover images can also be viewed in close-up detail or in thumbnail collections.
 The collection also has one other important feature, which allows a reader to page through each magazine by flipping directly to the cartoons. As Mr. Remnick admits, ''Ninety percent of our subscribers say they read the cartoons first, and the rest would be lying.''

HEADLINE: Airbus Says Its New Flagship Jet Will Be Delayed

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 1 

 BODY:
Airbus, in the middle of an escalating trans-Atlantic trade battle with Boeing, ran into trouble on two other fronts on Wednesday, pushing back the delivery of its flagship A380 superjumbo jet and delaying the expected announcement of a new chief executive.
 Airbus confirmed that it would push back delivery of the A380 to its first set of customers by as much as six months. The delay, which Airbus said was a result of industrial and design modifications to the plane, could force it to pay steep penalties to those airlines.
 It is the first blot on the image of the A380, a 555-seat behemoth, which had a smooth initial flight in April. The A380 is intended to be a competitor to the Boeing 747 and its success is crucial to Airbus in the contest for dominance of the commercial aircraft market. 
 The controlling shareholder of Airbus, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS, also put off plans to promote the No.2 official at Airbus, Gustav Humbert, to chief executive.
 The delay in that announcement, which was expected by Wednesday, indicated that the French and German owners of EADS had not yet settled months of intrigue over which side would exert more control over Airbus.
 Taken together, the problems have cast a shadow over Airbus less than two weeks before the Paris Air Show, which is expected to showcase the A380 as a triumph of European industrial collaboration.
 ''The A380 delay is serious,'' said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. ''It might suggest a problem with the weight of the plane, and therefore with the economics. Lateness itself isn't a problem; performance is.''
 Airbus declined to specify what modifications the A380 needed, but insisted the plane was aerodynamically sound. Barbara Kracht, a spokeswoman at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, said, ''There has hardly been any new airliner in history that was delivered on the date that was set when it was launched.''
 Analysts seemed less troubled by the internal moves at Airbus, noting that it was a perennial French-German drama that would be patched up. ''This too shall pass,'' Mr. Aboulafia said.
 Mr. Humbert, a German engineer, is still expected to succeed Noel Forgeard, a Frenchman who will become joint chief executive of EADS. But the main shareholders, notably DaimlerChrysler and the French government, are still haggling over power-sharing arrangements that the Germans fear will favor the French, according to an executive close to the talks.
 The dispute could be resolved this week, this person said, but the wrangling has left Airbus in limbo at a critical time.
 While Airbus has opened a sizable lead over Boeing in the total aircraft market, it risks losing ground in the midsize segment, where Boeing has booked 266 orders for its new fuel-efficient jet, the 787.
 Airbus has not yet disclosed orders for its rival jet, the A350, a plane with 245 to 285 seats, and executives at the company have acknowledged that their sales job has been complicated by the trade dispute between the United States and the European Union over subsidies.
 Washington and Brussels filed lawsuits at the World Trade Organization on Tuesday, accusing each other of giving billions of dollars in illegal development aid to their respective companies. The moves came after negotiations to settle the standoff collapsed in acrimony over the weekend.
 While both manufacturers will come under scrutiny at the W.T.O., some analysts said the litigation favored Boeing in the short term because Airbus was in the process of trying to secure more than $1 billion in aid from France, Germany, and Britain to develop the A350. Though Airbus is not barred from pursuing aid while the case proceeds, Washington's legal offensive is likely to put further subsidies under a harsh light. 
 Airbus insists it could build the plane without state funds. The company said it would announce ''triple digit'' orders for the A350 in Paris. But some analysts are skeptical, and potential customers may be reluctant to commit themselves to buying it without a financial security blanket.
 ''Boeing is attacking at the very moment when its opponent is weakest,'' said Jim Eckes, a consultant at Indoswiss Aviation in Hong Kong. Speaking of Airbus, he added, ''They're under tremendous pressure when the Paris show opens to have a good story, and they're suffering from this management turmoil.''
 Mr. Eckes agreed that most new aircraft projects, whether from Airbus or Boeing, have suffered delays. The trouble, he said, was that Airbus stuck to its promise of on-time delivery, even when rumors of a delay began circulating in January in Germany, where the plane's fuselage is built.
 Airlines that have ordered the A380 reacted cautiously to the news. But in a few cases, their testiness came through.
 Geoff Dixon, the chief executive of the Australian carrier Qantas, said in a statement, ''This is disappointing, given that we have met all of Airbus's deadlines for Qantas specifications.'' The airline, he added, would seek ''compensation from Airbus in line with the terms of its contract.''
 Emirates, the carrier based in Dubai that is by far the biggest customer for the A380, with orders for 45 planes, said it was worried about the effect of the delay on its ambitious growth plans. But it said it was too early to draw conclusions because it did not have a new delivery schedule from Airbus.
 Singapore Airlines, which was to be the first carrier to take delivery of an A380, in the second quarter of 2006, now will not receive its first plane before the fourth quarter. Airbus is customizing the layout of the plane for each airline, which officials said had added to the delay.

HEADLINE: Expo Week Arrives, And Books Are Back

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The publishing industry is notoriously gloomy when it comes to looking into the future: business is perpetually in decline, a result of huge author advances and shrinking numbers of readers.
 But as editors, authors, publishers and booksellers gather in New York this week for the marketing whirligig known as BookExpo America, there is actually plenty to celebrate. Sales of general-interest books are thriving, in sharp contrast to recent downturns in other communications and media businesses, including Hollywood, where movie attendance is in its third straight year of decline; recorded music, in which sales have fallen for four of the last five years; and network television, which has steadily lost viewers.
 In fact, for all the talk about the death of ''old media'' -- that is, printed material like books -- and the ascendancy of the new, digitally fueled media that rule the airwaves and cyberspace, Americans still spend more buying books than they do going to movies or buying recorded music, video games or DVD's. 
 Consumer spending on books rose 8 percent, to nearly $21 billion, in the three years that ended in December, according to a recent report by the Book Industry Study Group, a publishing trade group, pushing the industry's sales back above the levels reached before the stock market decline helped to lead the country into a recession in early 2001. 
 While the growth has been greatest in the retailing of books to consumers, sales by publishers to wholesalers and to bookstores have also risen by 7 percent over the last three years, to nearly $12 billion. 
 The rebound has been fueled largely by the expanding popularity of religious-themed books like ''The Purpose-Driven Life'' and the ''Left Behind'' series of novels, as well as a new breed of mega-best-selling novels, some with religious overtones, like ''The Da Vinci Code'' and ''The Five People You Meet in Heaven.''
 ''We've never been quite as glamorous as the movie business or the music business,'' said Jack Romanos, president and chief executive of Simon & Schuster Inc., which as part of Viacom Inc. has corporate siblings in aspects of those businesses. ''But I would characterize our business in total as being very stable. I think it has rebounded from the decline we saw after 9/11,'' while some formats, like hardcover books, ''are doing better than we would have thought.''
 BookExpo America, a trade show produced by a division of the publishing company Reed Elsevier, attracts more than 30,000 booksellers, publishers, authors and agents who view it as a way to promote new writers and hear about new books for the fall and holiday seasons.
 While much of the industry's attention is focused on big author advances and high-profile promotional campaigns, the publishing business continues to produce the occasional surprise hit -- like ''French Women Don't Get Fat,'' which burst onto best-seller lists earlier this year, surprising even executives at its publisher, Alfred A. Knopf.
 On the doom-and-gloom side, a survey of Americans' reading habits by the National Endowment for the Arts, released last year, found that only 47 percent of the adult American population reported reading literature in 2002, down from 54 percent 10 years earlier. But those results are difficult to interpret. ''Literature'' was not defined, for example, and the percentage of adults who reported reading a book of any kind was nearly 57 percent, down from 61 percent 10 years earlier.
 And some literary novels have sold quite well recently. The biggest-selling book so far this year at Barnes & Noble, the country's largest bookstore chain, is not a diet book or self-help manual, but ''The Kite Runner,'' a 2003 novel by Khaled Hosseini that examines the effects of the Taliban's reign in Afghanistan. 
 Positive signs for publishers and booksellers have been strongest in religious books, whose sales rose 17 percent in 2004 alone, to $3.8 billion, according to the study group's report, titled Book Industry Trends 2005. Albert N. Greco, a Fordham University faculty member who helped to conduct the study, noted that a big reason for the growth in religious books was the migration of titles from Christian bookstores to the big chains and to mass-market retailers like Wal-Mart.
 In fact, Steve Riggio, chief executive of Barnes & Noble, cited growing sales at mass-market outlets as a sign of the industry's strength.
 ''If you look at the book business over the last decade, you don't really see years of double-digit growth, but you don't see years of significant decline, either,'' he said. ''It's a steady, stable business.''
 Not all parts of the book business are booming, of course. Sales of mass-market paperbacks -- the inexpensive, pocket-sized thrillers and mysteries that are staples of airport newsstands and beach blankets -- are in sharp decline. 
 And while sales of books have risen when measured in dollars, the total number of books sold has declined -- by 3 percent over the last three years and 9 percent over the last five years, to 1.9 billion books in 2004. (Both the unit and dollar figures include sales of general fiction and nonfiction books for adults and juveniles. They exclude professional books and textbooks and books published by university presses.)
 Sales can rise in dollars but decline in number of books, of course, if the average selling price of the books grows. That has been the case, although the industry has not raised prices significantly for several years. When ''Primary Colors,'' the novel by Joe Klein that was published anonymously in 1996, topped the New York Times fiction best-seller list, its cover price was $24. Last week, three of the top five books on the fiction best-seller list had a cover price of $24.95.
 Not surprisingly, Mr. Riggio of Barnes & Noble said he thought it was time for publishers to consider raising prices. 
 ''I'm not asking for publishers to start raising prices 10 percent,'' he said, ''but perhaps a little price inflation in the coming years would not have a deleterious effect on unit sales.''
 Sales of some books, particularly the biggest best sellers, have been fairly volatile over short periods in the recent past. Borders Group, the second-largest bookstore chain, reported last month that sales of best sellers declined 30 percent in the first quarter of 2005 when compared with the same period a year earlier, contributing to a quarterly loss for the company.
 But while Barnes & Noble also reported some volatility in sales of best sellers, its results have been more stable. This week, Barnes & Noble's stock price rose to its highest level since November 2001.
 Some publishers have also suffered from sales volatility related to best sellers. HarperCollins, part of News Corporation, reported that its sales and earnings fell in the most recent quarter. One reason, said Jane Friedman, chief executive of HarperCollins, was lower sales this year of ''The Purpose-Driven Life,'' by Rick Warren, the California pastor, which has sold more than 22 million copies since 2002.
 ''Give me a 'Purpose-Driven Life' any year, and I'll be happy to take a down quarter,'' Ms. Friedman said.

HEADLINE: Fewer Friends In High Places For This Lobby

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and ELIZABETH BECKER; Alexei Barrionuevo reported from Chicago for this article and Elizabeth Becker from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 1 

 BODY:
At the Ferrara Pan Candy Company, confectioners of everything from gummy bears to red hots, rail cars used to deliver three million pounds of sugar a week to its bustling plant just outside America's candy capital here.
 Today, the trains bring only half as much, barely enough to fill the factory's 65-foot sugar silos. That is largely because Ferrara, in an effort to avoid the high cost of government-protected American sugar, has been moving some of its century-old operations to Canada and Mexico.
 The reason for this decade-long shift can be traced to global economics and the domestic sugar industry, which is fast being branded as a spoiler nationally and internationally. ''Big Sugar'' is in trouble not only here in Chicago, where it is losing some of its customers, but also in Washington, where it is losing some of its longtime political allies. 
 Rightly or wrongly, the sugar industry is being blamed for an assortment of evils: undercutting the American food industries that rely on sugar, fighting global diet guidelines that aim to improve children's health and curb obesity, and, most recently, for hurting the chance for passage of the Bush administration's top trade priority, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, known as Cafta.
 ''More and more people have begun to realize that this is an indefensible program from a trade policy standpoint,'' said Clayton K. Yeutter, a former United States trade representative and agriculture secretary, who is now senior adviser to the Food Trade Alliance, which represents companies in food processing, retailing and restaurants that are lobbying in favor of the agreement. ''Beneath the surface one can sense that the house of cards has begun to shake a bit.''
 With its old hardball tactics and the flamboyance of some of its barons, sugar's powerful lobby has long been a legend in Washington. The industry's leading family, the Fanjuls of Florida, lead a luxurious life and are large donors to both Democrats and Republicans. 
 Now, with Cafta stalled in Congress, the Bush administration has singled out sugar as the chief spoiler. In one of the rare instances of a food lobby turning against one of its own, big agribusiness is siding with the administration against sugar. 
 ''Sugar is fighting to maintain its program to the detriment of the rest of agriculture,'' said Bob Stallman, the president of the American Farm Bureau federation.
 For the moment, the sugar industry appears poised to chalk up another victory by defeating Cafta. While that would surprise few in Washington, it could ultimately prove to be a hollow victory.
 Democrats, who are united in opposition to Cafta, say the Bush administration is using sugar as a scapegoat. ''Sugar isn't the reason this could be going down,'' said Representative Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who is leading the fight against the trade deal. ''Sugar is only on the margins.''
 Indeed, the Congressional Hispanic caucus announced its opposition to Cafta last week, citing fear of job losses as the chief reason.
 Still, as American agribusiness depends more and more on foreign markets, sugar is the one commodity that keeps foreign competition at bay by relying on an outdated quota system, raising sugar costs for consumers by about $1.9 billion a year, according to the Government Accountability Office. Among other things, the system protects sugar beet and cane farmers by preventing imports of less expensive sugar from Brazil and other parts of Latin America that would undercut domestic prices. 
 By contrast, farmers who grow corn, wheat, cotton, rice and soybeans are supported by $19 billion in taxpayer subsidies, a system that has less impact on consumers and is generally easier -- though not always -- to defend in trade negotiations. Phillip W. Hayes, spokesman for the American Sugar Alliance, rejects the charge that his industry opposes free trade. Rather than the slow dismantling of the American program through bilateral negotiations, domestic sugar producers say they want all countries to end their sugar subsidies at once in a global trade agreement.
 ''If everyone laid down their subsidies,'' Mr. Hayes said, ''then we would give up our sugar program.''
 The sugar industry in the United States is blessed by geography and a single-minded focus on defending the quota program. Much of the American sugar program resides in Florida, home of cane growers that produce about a quarter of the nation's sugar. Cane sugar is also an important part of Louisiana's economy. Sugar beets are grown in North Dakota, Minnesota and other northern states that have consistently lobbied their lawmakers to oppose any threats to the program.
 Despite its small size, accounting for just 1 percent of American farm receipts and 61,000 direct jobs, sugar is the single largest agricultural donor to political campaigns.
 The Fanjul family, descendants of a Cuban sugar baron who was forced out after the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, operates the nation's largest cane-growing and refining operation through the Flo-Sun Company, based in Palm Beach, Fla. While Alfonso Fanjul Jr. donates to the Democrats, his brother, Jose Fanjul, contributed more than $200,000 for George W. Bush's re-election effort.
 Cafta, an economic pact with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, would eliminate most tariffs for American goods into those countries and enshrine the duty-free status of most goods coming from those countries. 
 Sugar makes up only a fraction of the deal and would lead to opening up the American market to 1 percent more sugar from Central America, or, in the words of administration officials, only one teaspoonful a week per person.
 Ambassador Allen F. Johnson, America's chief international agricultural negotiator, said that the changes would be so small that there was nothing in Cafta that was a threat to the sugar industry. He suggested that the sugar lobby was short-sighted, risking its relationship with the administration ahead of legislation that would determine the billions of dollars in federal money to be divided among farmers into the next decade for crop subsidies, conservation and other agricultural programs.
 ''It is not in sugar's interest to be seen as the one holding us back,'' he said, ''especially one year before the farm bill is to be debated.''
 Mr. Hayes, the sugar industry spokesman, said this was the first time the American industry had been publicly isolated in a political debate. ''We're a little confused about being singled out by agribusiness for hurting trade and by the administration that says we are hurting democracy and the country's strategic interests,'' he said. ''That has never happened before.'' 
 In part, that may be because sugar's traditional sway over the confluence of money and politics is slipping. The sugar lobby gave $3.2 million during the 2004 elections, down from $3.4 million in 2000. The latest contributions were 6 percent of the $54.5 million given by agribusiness as a whole, though sugar's giving was the largest for a single commodity.
 The sugar lobby is accustomed to responding fiercely to challenges, but those victories are harder to come by these days.
 The sugar industry pressed the Bush administration two years ago, for example, to object to a scientific report that linked high sugar intake to obesity. The study, jointly conducted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricultural Organization, recommended limiting sugar to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. 
 The administration pushed for an independent review, and sugar producers rallied support from groups around the world. They said the science in the report was flawed and that it overstated any potential link between sugar and obesity.
 Andrew Briscoe, president of the Sugar Association, pointed to several other studies that found that sugar was not a health hazard. He also noted that even as obesity in the United States has increased, per capita consumption of sugar has fallen. Much of the decline was because sugar has been replaced in many foods by lower-cost corn syrup.
 ''Any policy targeting sugar is very misguided,'' Mr. Briscoe said, ''and will certainly not address the growing concern with obesity.'' 
 But despite an effort that not only challenged the report on its merits but also involved threats from the administration and Congress to reduce American financial support for the W.H.O., the institution made only modest changes to the report, retaining the 10 percent recommendation.
 ''In the case of sugar it was pure lobbying and not based on science,'' said Derek Yach, the former executive director for noncommunicable diseases at W.H.O. and now a professor at Yale University. In 2003, the sugar lobby challenged a follow-up policy developed by W.H.O., objecting to any specific recommendations on limiting sugar use. This time, sugar interests raised the stakes, bringing in lobbyists from the Grocery Manufacturers of America, whose members include Coca-Cola and Nestle. 
 But in January 2004, European food companies, led by Nestle and Unilever, reversed course. ''They had enough of the kind of heavy-handed lobbying that the U.S. sugar producers were doing,'' Mr. Yach said. The grocery association also did an about-face. Ultimately, sugar lobbyists were successful in one pivotal respect: in the final compromise reached last May, the organization agreed to remove a footnote in the report referring to the scientific report's 10 percent recommendation. But the report still recommends limiting sugar levels to prevent obesity. 
 At least as troubling to sugar interests, the World Trade Organization last year said the European Union's sugar subsidy program harmed developing countries and violated global trade laws. Although the European program differs from the American quota system, it put the sugar industry on notice that its days of manipulating the global market were coming to an end.
 To be sure, the sugar industry still has plenty of influence. It successfully lobbied to water down references to sugar in new American dietary guidelines released in January and helped eliminate any reference to sugar in the 2005 ''food pyramid'' recommendations. 
 While it fights these battles, the sugar industry's worst nightmare could be a growing split with its best customers. Ferrara Pan Candy was among the first to move operations over the border, setting up a plant about a decade ago in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Ferrara later added plants in Juarez, Mexico, and two in Canada near Toronto. 
 ''It was sugar that forced us to move over the border,'' said Salvatore Ferrara, the company's chief executive. His Italian grandfather started Ferrara in 1908. 
 Tougher competition from South American candy makers and global pricing power now wielded by a handful of mass merchants like Wal-Mart have led other companies to move as well, including Brach's Confections and Kraft Foods, which relocated its Life Savers plant from Michigan to Canada in 2002.
 Sugar industry officials contend that candy companies move abroad because of the higher labor and health care costs in America rather than higher-priced sugar.
 Mr. Ferrara disagreed and said that labor represented only 3 percent to 6 percent of the total cost to make a piece of candy, while sugar can represent 30 percent to 70 percent, depending on the product. He said he now paid on average 15 cents a pound for sugar in Canada and Mexico versus 27 cents to 28 cents a pound in America.
 Imported candies, meanwhile, have flooded the American market. Nonchocolate candy imports made up 35 percent of the American total last year, up from 11 percent in 1996.
 Mark Puch, chief executive of Primrose Candy, another Chicago company, said Walgreen's pharmacy failed to renew a $2.5 million contract that Primrose had five years ago to make Starlight mints, choosing instead a cheaper Brazilian product. After steadily losing sales, Mr. Puch began, focusing on sugar-free candy and chewy caramels that use corn syrup. After a plan to set up a shared plant in Canada with Mr. Ferrara fell though, Mr. Puch and his brother set up an operation in China, which opened two months ago. It will soon quadruple Primrose's capacity.
 Mr. Puch hopes it is not too late. ''I was a little naive,'' he said. ''I always thought there would be some type of sugar reform.''

HEADLINE: Sales Off Again at Ford and G.M; 2 Foreign Rivals Up

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 1 

 BODY:
Even though General Motors and Ford Motor continued to have difficulty selling cars, they did narrow their losses last month. Toyota and Nissan, meanwhile, continued to post healthy sales gains.
 For the industry, sales of cars and trucks in the United States were down slightly, to about 1.5 million vehicles. According to Wards AutoInfo Bank, Americans bought 0.3 percent fewer vehicles than they did last May. 
 Sales at G.M. were down 5.4 percent compared with May 2004. At Ford, they were down 2.7 percent. By contrast, sales at Toyota increased 7.8 percent over last May, and Nissan was up 15.5 percent.
 As the disappointing sales numbers rolled out of Detroit on Wednesday afternoon, General Motors and Ford, the nation's two largest automakers, both announced discount programs that they hope will help rid inventories of excess vehicles. Both companies also said they would make fewer vehicles in the third quarter than they did last year. G.M. will trim production by 9 percent, and Ford by 2 percent.
 General Motors on Wednesday said it would offer its employee discount, which can reduce the invoice price of a typical vehicle by hundreds of dollars, to all customers on nearly all models until July 5. G.M., which already offers some of the highest incentives in the industry, will allow customers to apply the employee discount on top of any other incentives. 
 Ford said on Wednesday that it would raise incentives on some of its slower-selling models like the Explorer and Expedition sport utility vehicles and the Focus sedan. On the Expedition, Ford will offer no-interest financing for up to five years and $5,000 cash back. Previously, Ford offered a $4,000 rebate on the Expedition.
 Some industry analysts said they thought the latest incentives would serve only to compound a major problem that G.M. and Ford face in competing with Asian auto companies -- that they rely too heavily on discounts to sell cars.
 John Casesa, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, questioned G.M.'s chief industry sales analyst, Paul Ballew, on the logic of the automaker's new discount campaign. ''It seems hard for me to understand how that could possibly be economical for you,'' Mr. Casesa said during a conference call on Wednesday afternoon.
 Mr. Ballew responded, ''When you do the math, you'll find it to be a good, compelling offer to the consumer while trying to strike the right balance from a financial standpoint.''
 According to preliminary data from Edmunds.com, G.M. actually spent less on incentives per vehicle last month compared with the same month a year earlier. In May, G.M.'s average incentive was $3,611 a vehicle compared with $3,923 in May 2004. Ford slightly increased its incentive spending from May last year, to $2,942 from $2,927.
 Those figures far outweigh incentive spending by Japanese automakers, which Edmunds estimated to be $1,068 last month.
 The Chrysler division of the German automaker DaimlerChrysler, which was the only American automaker to post a sales increase, topped both Ford and G.M. in incentive spending last month with an average of $3,991, according to Edmunds. That is a 20 percent increase over May 2004. Chrysler appeared to be unmoved by G.M.'s discount program. During a conference call on Wednesday, Chrysler's senior vice president for sales, Gary Dilts, said, ''Bring it on'' when asked how the program might affect Chrysler's sales.
 Chrysler continues to be Detroit's best performer, with sales up 6 percent over last May. While sales dipped at both G.M. and Ford, their declines appear to have tapered off somewhat. In April, both companies had wider losses than they did last month, with G.M.'s sales down 7.7 percent from the previous April and Ford's sales down 5 percent. 
 In addition, Toyota and Nissan's sales gains have narrowed since April when both were up more than 20 percent. In April, Toyota's sales increased 21.3 percent, and Nissan's jumped 27 percent. For Honda, Japan's third major automaker, sales slipped 7.6 percent last month compared with a gain of 13.6 percent in April.
 Nissan was more than happy with its 15.5 percent rise last month. Jed Connelly, senior vice president for sales at Nissan's North American operations, said, ''It's a good place to be in.''

HEADLINE: When Betting on Russia, Kremlin Is the Wild Card

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 1 

 BODY:
This week's guilty verdict for Russia's oil billionaire Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky capped a long-running tale that rocked the country's financial elite, upset foreign investors and prompted criticism from the White House. 
 Now investors are turning to the future, and wondering whether the case could be repeated.
 A court here on Tuesday sentenced Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former chief of the Yukos oil company, and an associate to nine years in prison on charges ranging from embezzlement to corporate and personal tax evasion. The two men were ordered to pay over $600 million. 
 President Bush said afterward that the trial's outcome was a concern and that he would be watching the appeals closely.
 The Yukos events could produce death rattles: the prosecutor general's office plans money-laundering charges against the two men. And the oil company, which lost billions of dollars of public market value, may step up litigation against the Russian government. 
 But the question now is whether the Kremlin will want a role in sectors other than oil and gas. 
 Consumer goods -- like food, clothing, electronics and other retail items -- are so far of no interest to the Kremlin. Russia's economy is expanding, forecast to grow 5.8 percent this year, down from 6.7 percent last year. Steady underlying growth has benefited foreign companies like United Technologies, which sells air-conditioners; consumer products giants like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble; and even staffing companies like Kelly Services.
 Foreign auto sales soared to almost 340,000 cars in 2004, up more than 70 percent from 2003, according to Ernst & Young.
 But sectors like oil and gas, military gear, diamonds, precious metals and mining operations, which the Kremlin deems ''strategic,'' could present pitfalls for investors, whether through increased government ownership or higher taxation.
 ''Will the state be heavily involved only in oil and gas, or elsewhere? No one knows,'' said James Fenkner, chief strategist at Red Star, a Russia-dedicated hedge fund. ''For instance, Russian metals companies don't yet have a tax system similar to Russia's oil and gas sector,'' which draws more money into the federal budget as prices rise.
 ''That could change,'' he said, ''but nobody knows where the government is going to draw the line -- what is strategic and what isn't.'' 
 In oil and gas, the Kremlin is a kingmaker -- putting state companies in the driver's seat for choice projects; foreign oil companies expect to be restricted to minority stakes under a proposed law governing subsoil resources.
 Russia's natural resources minister, Yury Trutnev, indicated this week that the oil companies Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco had a good chance of winning a minority share in a big project, the Sakhalin-3 concession. 
 The two companies, however, had already won -- and lost -- the right to lead the Sakhalin-3 consortium when the government revoked their license last year. Sakhalin-3 has since been designated a strategic field and is thus subject to new laws. The Russian state oil company Rosneft will probably get the majority stake, analysts said. 
 ''The license revocation and re-tendering reverses the previous situation, where Exxon Mobil was the operator and Rosneft the junior partner,'' a UFG analyst, Stephen O'Sullivan, wrote in a note to clients. ''Rosneft will probably be the operator, with the Western companies as the minority partners -- which may have been the aim of the process all along.''
 For portfolio investors, the bellwether for Russia is no longer Yukos, once the stock market's darling, but Gazprom, the state's natural gas monopoly. The company, the world's largest gas producer, is a widely held stock, and is expected to liberalize ownership rules for foreign investors. 
 But Gazprom has generated increased scrutiny from investors like William Browder, a Gazprom shareholder through his Hermitage Fund. Mr. Browder is publishing a 70-page report Thursday which contends the company's costs and debts are bloated, while earnings and production are not growing as quickly as they should. 
 In the first nine months of 2004, Gazprom's revenues grew 24 percent, to $23.9 billion, and net income rose just 6 percent, to $4.3 billion. Operating costs ballooned 29 percent, to $17.3 billion. Gazprom has increased borrowing to finance new gas fields and pipelines, and had total long- and short-term debt of $20 billion as of last September.
 ''Gazprom is being run more like a government ministry than a profit-maximizing business,'' said Mr. Browder in an interview. His firm is seeking a seat on Gazprom's board at the annual general meeting on June 24.

HEADLINE: Shares Climb, but Advance Fades a Bit Late in the Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks moved higher yesterday as investors were encouraged by economic news, but a late-session rise in oil prices limited Wall Street's gains. Bonds rallied, keeping the yield on the 10-year Treasury note below 4 percent.
 Data from the Institute for Supply Management indicated that the manufacturing sector was continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace, and a component within the index that measures prices paid by purchasing managers suggested that inflation remained in check. 
 That, combined with an influx of capital amid questions about the future of the proposed European Union constitution, added up to good news for United States markets, said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisers.
 ''The Fed has told us they will continue to raise rates at a measured pace,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''but each decision will be made on the basis of existing or current conditions. And current conditions tell me that it's not a sure bet the Fed will raise rates at their June 30 meeting. It's good news. But look: whenever there's a lot of money chasing securities, prices are going to go up, and right now you have a lot of capital flowing in from Europe.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.39 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,549.87, rising as much as 123.51 before giving up some of its gains as oil prices surged more than $2.60 a barrel. Broader stock indicators also moved sharply higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 10.72 points, or 0.90 percent, at 1,202.22. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 19.64 points, or 1 percent, to 2,087.86.
 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted several minutes before the market closed because of network communication problems.
 Bonds continued to build on Tuesday's rally; the yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 3.89 percent, from 3.98 percent late Tuesday. The price, which moves opposite to the yield, rose 26/32, to 101 31/32. The euro slid to its lowest level against the dollar in eight months as voters in the Netherlands joined France in rejecting the European Union constitution. Gold prices rose.
 In company news, shares of Google climbed $10.73, or 3.9 percent, to $288, after analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston raised the target price for the stock to $350 a share from $275 a share. Piper Jaffray raised its target price for Google to $300 on Tuesday.
 School Specialty, the educational products distributor, gained $7.78, or 20 percent, to $47, on news that it would be acquired by Bain Capital Partners, a private equity group, in a deal worth about $1.5 billion.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 1.41 billion shares, compared with 1.48 billion at the same point Tuesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.786
High Rate: 2.740
Coupon Yield: 2.784

HEADLINE: At Chocolate Factory, Details Are Messy

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: FULTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Deep inside a cavernous chocolate-manufacturing company here, the plant manager Jerry Lamphere, walked around a corner and into darkness. The lights were off in some areas, he explained, to help save on the electric bill.
 Other sections were empty of machinery -- large open rooms instead of the humming production lines that had made this plant a key part of the Nestle chocolate empire and left the smell of chocolate in the air for 104 years. But when it closed the plant, Nestle auctioned the equipment rather than sell it intact to a competitor.
 Earlier this spring, the reopening of this plant was hailed by United States Senator Charles E. Schumer and state officials as a victory for a battered upstate region where the loss of nearly 500 jobs was deemed more than this city of 12,000 people could bear. The local paper, The Fulton Daily News, cheered the reopening with the headline ''How Sweet It Is.'' A photo showed Senator Schumer, who helped broker the deal, nibbling a truffle. Thousands of dollars in federal assistance was bestowed on the small venture company that took it over, and a huge loan is in the offing. 
 But life at the plant is not quite as sweet as it appears. The new owners have struggled with their inexperience, tensions between investors, turmoil in the Ivory Coast cocoa market and concerns about internal business practices. Instead of finding joy and security, workers are left with more uncertainty.
 Just to walk around the plant is to sense the problems, as well as the potential for success. Besides the large dark and empty areas, there were also places where the lights were on, machines were in place and several dozen people were at work. Some were managing production lines for crisping rice or roasting cocoa beans. Some were shipping packages of cocoa butter to food suppliers. In a kitchen laboratory, a chocolate technologist, Paul Dederich, was experimenting with recipes over several souped-up KitchenAid mixing stands.
 Three executives of the new company, New York Chocolate and Confections, were on hand but out of sight, huddled in a closed office away from the production lines. They admitted that if a manufacturing problem had arisen, they would not have known how to handle it, anyway. In interviews, they said they were relying heavily on the former Nestle employees, especially Mr. Lamphere, to keep the plant running.
 The company's management is one of the issues that concerns the investment group behind the venture.
 ''A lot of my investors have called me several times, very, very unhappy,'' said Hausmann-Alain Banet, a former economics professor at the University of Michigan and chief investment officer of Lion Capital Management, a San Francisco investment bank that owns 20 percent of New York Chocolate. 
 When Nestle closed this plant two years ago, it ended an era for Fulton, which is about 30 miles northwest of Syracuse. 
 ''It wasn't just the 500 jobs,'' Senator Schumer said in an interview. ''The town almost thought it should fold up its sidewalks and die.''
 Dr. Banet, in a phone interview from San Francisco, said he had thought that the sprawling plant, customized machinery and experienced work force offered a great opportunity for his investors. He also saw that the plant held potential for Ghana, Brazil and Ivory Coast, the world's three main cocoa producers, which were looking for ways to make their economies less vulnerable to the fluctuations of the commodities market.
 Ivory Coast was already creating a consortium of cocoa farmers called the Fonds de Regulation et de Controle, guided by the government's agriculture department. 
 The consortium eagerly teamed up with Lion Capital, establishing majority ownership -- 80 percent -- and control of the company. Lion Capital provided most of the business expertise, especially regarding American laws, as well as a financial guarantee to creditors, officials said. Dr. Banet declined to say how much Lion Capital invested.
 Another entrepreneur, Richard M. Duffy, was eyeing the plant as a way to help him manufacture a low-carbohydrate chocolate bar. The two groups competed for the plant and equipment.
 From the onset, the economic development experts working on a deal knew that the Ivory Coast group had little experience in manufacturing. Though wealthier than its African neighbors, the country is not industrial, and certainly does not have the heavily regulated factories of the United States. 
 Nonetheless, Senator Schumer favored the Ivory Coast group because he said it had more of an incentive to make the business a financial success.
 The deal set, the consortium enlisted an Ivory Coast government official, Jean-Claude Amon, who received a master's degree in business from Syracuse University in 1972, to run the company. 
 Company executives insisted that New York Chocolate would grow, hire hundreds of more workers, produce its own chocolate line and perhaps one day outperform Nestle. But the company had problems from the onset. It had to recover production equipment that was lost at auction, especially to the other entrepreneur, Mr. Duffy. And last fall, just as they were trying to get off the ground, a violent uprising in Ivory Coast sent the chocolate market into turmoil and drove up cocoa bean prices. More recently, questions have been raised by Dr. Banet about the two advisers that the African consortium paired with Mr. Amon. Dr. Banet said he found that Yalle Agbre, the treasurer, was not handling the company's money according to American business standards -- paying bills late and drawing from a personal account, IC Management Inc., to pay for plant expenses. 
 Because Lion Capital was essentially a co-signer for the company's obligations, it found its credit rating suffering, Dr. Banet said, and that has upset investors. He said he had related his concerns to the president of Ivory Coast, and requested an audit of New York Chocolate's finances by an independent American firm.
 The company's chief executive officer, Mr. Amon, said he had faith in Mr. Agbre and welcomed the audit.
 The other adviser to Mr. Amon is Kemakolam Comas, who was initially hired as a lawyer for the company but introduced himself to a reporter as the chocolate company's ''secretary general.'' A native of Ivory Coast, he began practicing law in the United States in 1997, but had his New York State license indefinitely suspended by the state's Appellate Division last January. Dr. Banet was among those who had complained about him to state officials, saying Mr. Comas acted without authority when he removed Dr. Banet from the board of directors of New York Chocolate last year. 
 According to The New York Law Journal, three clients of Mr. Comas's also complained, charging that he took money but did not perform the legal services promised. The court said that Mr. Comas did not respond sufficiently to a committee investigating the charges, and they determined that he had abandoned his practice. 
 Since Mr. Comas's license was suspended, he has continued to work for the company but says he only translates legal documents from English to French, the language of Ivory Coast. His future with the company will be taken up at the next board meeting, Mr. Amon said. 
 Mr. Amon acknowledged ''bumps in the road.'' 
 ''But those problems are behind us,'' he said. ''All of this took a lot of time. But internal disputes cannot jeopardize the future of the company.''
 The company obtained an $850,000 loan from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, and it is also planning to seek a $1 million state grant to help it expand.
 L. Michael Treadwell, executive director of Operation Oswego County, an economic development agency that helped New York Chocolate get its loan, said the company had ''in the high seven digits'' in a bank account, was up to date on its tax payments and had the benefit of an experienced and dedicated group of employees, the former Nestle workers.
 ''Things seem to be falling into place,'' Mr. Treadwell said.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders and Worker Productivity Show Strength

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2 

 BODY:
Orders to factories advanced by 0.9 percent in April, the fastest in five months, while worker productivity at the start of the year was better than originally thought, according to economic reports released Thursday. But labor costs have risen sharply over the last six months, another report said.
 The Commerce Department said factory orders rose by 0.9 percent in April as demand for durable goods posted a 1.9 percent gain, the first increase in four months, led by autos and aircraft. Those gains offset a 0.2 percent decline in orders for nondurable goods, items not expected to last three years. 
 The Labor Department reported that productivity went up at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first quarter, revised upward from an originally reported gain of 2.6 percent. But the cost of labor per unit of output jumped at an annual rate of 3.3 percent. That followed a revised increase of 7.7 percent in labor costs in the fourth quarter, which was the biggest surge in more than four years.
 ''This is seriously bad news for the Fed -- costs appear to be spiraling rapidly -- and it strongly argues for substantially higher interest rates,'' said Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, which is based in Valhalla, N.Y.
 But other analysts were not as concerned, noting that the big fourth-quarter surge reflected end-of-the-year bonuses and should not result in widespread wage pressures.
 ''The one-time nature of the payouts suggests that there is little inflationary implication from these numbers,'' a Merrill Lynch economist, Sheryl King, said.
 In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 25,000 last week, the biggest weekly increase in 14 months. 
 Labor Department analysts blamed temporary layoffs in the auto industry for the increase, which pushed total claims to 350,000 last week.
 While the jump in jobless claims was the biggest one-week gain since late January 2004, analysts noted that the auto layoffs were temporary and said solid gains in employment were still expected.
 They predicted that Friday's jobless report would show the unemployment rate holding steady at 5.2 percent, with 180,000 jobs created last month.

HEADLINE: The Price of Gold

 BODY:
If you could improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the world's most destitute people with a program that might -- just might -- temporarily reduce the profits of the global gold industry, most people would probably think it is worth doing. Even most members of Congress. That's why it has been so disturbing to see gold producers strong-arm Congress and the White House into blocking just such a desperately needed measure. 
 Poor countries need debt relief. Some African governments spend three times as much on debt service as they do on health care. They could be using the money to train nurses, eliminate school fees and fight AIDS. More debt relief is needed, and a deal needs to be sealed at the summit of the Group of 8 industrial countries in July.
 A real solution has been postponed because the wealthy countries can't agree on how to finance it. But Britain offered a good answer: have the International Monetary Fund sell about $12 billion of its gold reserves, which have a total market value of about $43 billion. That would cover debt owed the fund, which accounts for 30 percent of the interest payments owed over the next 5 to 10 years by the affected countries. The fund could sell more gold to cancel debts owed the World Bank and other banks.
 This is the simplest and least painful solution. It would not require new contributions or hurt lending to middle-income countries, and it is the only one that has any hope of support from rich countries. But the United States has veto power over gold decisions in the monetary fund, so this idea needs approval from Congress -- and the mining industry has blocked a vote. In January, a letter opposing the sale of I.M.F. gold was signed by 12 senators from Western states, including the Democratic leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. The letter argued that the sale could drive down the price of gold. A similar letter was signed in March by 30 members of the House.
 Because few lawmakers spend much time thinking about the I.M.F., the letters --sparked by lobbyists from the National Mining Association and gold mining companies -- persuaded the leadership that the gold proposal would not pass, even before it came up for discussion. The Bush administration, apparently unwilling to take on a Congressional fight, began in April to oppose gold sales outright.
 The gold industry is worried about a pricing hit that probably would never happen. In March, the monetary fund concluded that gold prices would not be affected, as it could sell the gold over several years while at the same time asking central banks to sell less. Gold-producing poor countries endorse I.M.F. gold sales. The president of the World Gold Council said recently that he would give them conditional support. Congress needs to debate the issue, not allow a special interest to deny help to hundreds of millions of poor people. President Bush should spend the political capital to push this good idea through the Republican-controlled Congress before the July summit.

HEADLINE: On the Cushy Trail Of Lewis And Clark

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

 BODY:
IT wasn't Lewis and Clark who caught my attention in Fort Benton, Mont., a faded farming town along the tree-lined Missouri River, but a border collie named Shep. A statue in the heart of town pays homage to this noble-looking dog, whose story of loyalty ends as a cautionary tale.
 In 1936, Shep's master, a sheepherder, died, leaving Shep disconcerted. As a train pulled out with the body, the story goes, Shep whined on the platform. Each day thereafter he trotted down to the train station expecting to find his returning owner. Some five years later, growing wobbly and hard of hearing, Shep failed to get off the tracks and was clobbered by a train. Even faithfulness, it seems, should have limits. 
 Shep's story fires the imagination, but I was in Fort Benton on the trail of Lewis and Clark, honoring their much larger story with many other travelers in the bicentennial years of their expedition by retracing part of their 8,000-mile route. Unlike Shep, I was more than willing to jettison absolute faithfulness. In a single long weekend, I sped across some 800 miles that occupied Lewis and Clark for six months. And rather than worrying about bears, bugs and blizzards, I bivouacked in three fine historic hotels, all embodying the optimism of empire engendered when the explorers returned with their report on what lay beyond the maps. 
 Meriwether Lewis and William Clark along with the Corps of Discovery and a Shoshone teenage mother named Sacajawea were slogging out Year 2, after a winter in what is now North Dakota, when they reached a rocky promontory near Fort Benton. Lewis climbed it and wrote: ''I thought myself well repaid for my labour; as from this point I beheld the Rocky Mountains for the first time.''
 I beheld the same view -- visible from many places along the Rocky Mountain front: the land erupting into fantastic shapes, from buckskin-colored cliffs and buttes to saw-tooth indigo peaks. Nearby, on sites where Lewis and Clark camped in 1805, re-enactors would be pitching tents for a 34-day national celebration that started last Wednesday, the only event this spring of the 15 scheduled along the long Lewis and Clark route for the 2004-2006 bicentennial. 
 I decided to spend my night in Fort Benton at the Grand Union Hotel, built in 1882 as an island of elegance on a rough-and-tumble frontier and now elegant again after a restoration in the late 1990's. Easterners began migrating to Oregon and Washington a few decades after Lewis and Clark returned home with their electrifying report of their trip, but it was not until the 1860's that settlers came to the interior Indian country of Montana, lured by gold and oceans of grass. In the 1870's, mining camps boomed, and so did Fort Benton, the last stop for steamboats coming up the Missouri from St. Louis (farther on, the water was navigable only for shallower craft like the small riverboats used by Lewis and Clark).
 The Grand Union, a stout, three-story red-brick structure in the heart of town, offered travelers lodging and fine dining. Trappers, army officers, cowboys, buffalo hunters, missionaries, miners and other fortune seekers mingled in its restaurant and corridors. It was in disrepair until 1997, when two Montanans, James and Cheryl Gagnon, began restoring it. Now the Grand Union has refinished woodwork and new appointments, and bustles in the summer, when canoeists come to Fort Benton and patrons fill the Union Grille, with its high-backed booths and a deck overlooking the river. The tender, perfectly caramelized steaks, I was assured by the chef, Clayton Arakawa, are from cattle raised nearby. 
 Seen from the tall window of my room, the streets of Fort Benton below were tame, the bustle of a 19th-century outpost replaced by the quiet pace of a wheat-farming town. But hope for the next boom is alive, as locals rehabilitate buildings for future travelers.
 LEWIS and Clark pressed on, encountering the timber-draped foothills of the Rocky Mountains and an optical illusion -- as they moved upriver, the mountains seemed to slide apart to admit them. They called it the Gates of the Mountains, and now tour boats leaving from a point 15 minutes north of Helena, Mont., ply the Missouri daily in summer, recreating the illusion for passengers on 105-minute rides. As the river slices through a narrow, pine-tree studded limestone canyon filled with mountain goats, bald eagles and other wildlife, scenes come into view that are not visible from any roadway. The boats also pass by Mann Gulch, where 13 firefighters were killed in a wind-whipped wildfire in 1949. Granite markers have been placed where the bodies were found. 
 The explorers pushed deeper into the cordillera, following the Lolo Trail, an ancient Indian highway through a dark, dense forest -- much of it old growth. In the Bitterroot Mountains, the toughest part of the journey, trails were clogged with downed timber, the whiskey was long gone, and an early autumn storm dropped several inches of snow. The food ran out, and they killed one of their colts. ''Hunger made us all think that it eat delecious,'' Lewis wrote. Now the mountain crossing is on Highway 12, a snaking two-lane ribbon of asphalt that I followed along the purling Lochsa River in Idaho. 
 Rugged mountains gave way to hills in central Idaho, and as Idaho became Washington, the rolling dun-colored hills looked like the folds of skin on a Shar Pei. Rural scenes rushed by. I saw a woman decorating a white roadside cross with flowers and a grain elevator covered with the variegated poetry of love in graffiti form. My day ended in Walla Walla, a green oasis on dry plains. The expedition reached near here in mid-October 1805, a respite after the dry, cactus-studded desert of eastern Washington. Farther downriver, they traded thimbles and brass wire for 40 dogs to eat. 
 I had dinner in the dark paneled restaurant at the Marcus Whitman, a recently remodeled 1920's hotel in the heart of downtown that was named for a missionary who, with his wife, Narcissa, arrived in 1836 to tell the Indians about ''the white man's book of Heaven,'' as the tribes called the Bible. Unable to bridge the cultural differences, the Whitmans were killed in 1847 by members of the Cayuse tribe who thought their children had been cursed with measles.
 The restaurant has a nice selection of wines -- I chose the hotel's recommended red, from one of the many wineries near Walla Walla, and again had a steak (this was the West after all). The hotel, like Walla Walla itself, is a product of proximity to the Columbia River and the abundant natural resources that Lewis and Clark described on their return east. I looked over the overstuffed chairs and old-fashioned front desk in the massive, ornate lobby, and my roomy and luxurious suite on an upper floor had a big view of the Blue Mountains. Walla Walla, named for a tribe that greatly impressed Lewis and Clark (it means ''many waters'') is a busy city of 40,000 that has historic buildings, shady parks, a vibrant downtown and the espresso bars that are a necessity for any town that aspires to hipness. The Marcus Whitman makes a great base for exploring the city on foot. 
 THE first view of the Columbia River is 30 miles west, where Washington and Oregon come together. Two roads follow the river. While Interstate 84 on the Oregon side is much faster, I chose the winding, two-lane Highway 14 on the Washington side for its incredible views. Soon the Oregon desert ended, and Mount Hood appeared through the clouds, an indication that Portland was near.
 The explorers, in a hurry to get to the Pacific before winter, had navigated choppy rapids of the Columbia that they would otherwise have trekked around, but they were forced to portage at Celilo Falls, a cataract where Indians from all over would come to fish. It was inundated when the Dalles Dam was built in the 1950's. 
 The Governor Hotel in downtown Portland was my last overnight stop. Its older part was built in 1909, when the city was still flush with the pride from the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, which celebrated the city's role as a Pacific outpost of America's economic empire. The Governor, which was last redone in 1999, has historical photographs of local Indian tribes and giant sepia murals depicting the Lewis and Clark saga. 
 A two-hour drive the next morning ended at the coast, where a stinging wind whipped the Pacific into a froth of whitecaps. ''Great joy in camp,'' Lewis wrote as a broad expanse of water appeared to the explorers in late 1805. ''We are in view of the Ocian, this great Pacific Ocean, that we have been so long anxious to see.''
 Whoops, it was only the broad, slack estuary at the mouth of the Columbia. After the weather held them back a few more days, the expedition finally reached the ocean on Nov. 18. With no good wintering spot in evidence, the explorers backtracked and made a miserable camp on a spot on the southern bank of the Columbia that they named Fort Clatsop for the Clatsop Indians. They didn't set out on their return trip until March 1806. 
 As I toured the reconstructed fort and imagined a winter in its dark, damp low-ceiling rooms, I recalled the comforts of the Governor, with its heavy linens, and the pleasure of my lingering breakfast there of scrambled eggs and lobster -- over multiple cups of coffee and a thick Sunday newspaper. The only thing I'd been missing was a loyal dog to scratch behind the ears.

HEADLINE: New York Faces an Olympic Reality: Sites Can Become White Elephants

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The fates of the 2012 Olympics and the proposed West Side stadium have become so intertwined that it sometimes seems as if all the Summer Games would be played at the railyards on West 33rd Street.
But Olympic planners say there is great deal more at stake for the city as a whole, and for the outlying region. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said that the vote on the stadium scheduled in Albany today is crucial to the city's bid; the International Olympic Committee will begin its selection process on July 6.
 If the city succeeds in winning the Olympics, it will mean changes in many neighborhoods around the city, where Olympic planners envision many of the sporting events taking place.
 Planners have proposed restoring the dilapidated 369th Regiment Armory, at the north end of Fifth Avenue, to its Art Deco splendor. The armory, in a parklike setting on the Harlem River, would be used for boxing matches. 
 Directly across the river in the Bronx, the $76.5 million Bronx Olympic Velodrome and Arena would rise on the shoreline near the crumbling Bronx Terminal Market.
 In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the $144.6 million Olympic Aquatic Center would be built on a 35-acre parcel along the East River that was once home to rusting piers, factories and warehouses.
 Leaders of the city's bid committee, NYC2012, say the Olympics would provide a singular opportunity to build projects around the five boroughs that the city could never afford on its own: athletic fields and equestrian centers, recreation areas along the waterfront, world class training centers and exhibition halls for elite athletes. They estimate that the Games would result in the creation of 900 acres of new parkland.
 ''The Games will provide a catalyst to get new facilities built and the existing ones improved,'' said Jay Carson, a senior adviser to NYC2012. ''Given the numbers of people and the ethnic diversity in New York City, there's a built-in constituency, a hometown crowd, for every sport. But New York currently lacks adequate facilities for the sports.''
 Some of these projects would probably be welcomed by their neighborhoods, while others seem a more difficult fit. Still others may prove far more costly to build than anyone now imagines. If the city wins the Games, the armory, the velodrome and the aquatic center would all be part of what Olympic planners describe as the athletic legacy that would remain for all New Yorkers long after the 16 days of Olympic contests are over.
 But the legacy of these projects in other Olympic cities is mixed, and skeptics have raised questions about whether some of New York's would become costly white elephants after the Games are over and the athletes have moved on. Would the Bronx velodrome or the Staten Island equestrian center really stay popular after 2012, and would the city be willing to pay for their upkeep?
 In Barcelona, Spain, the 1992 Games helped revitalize the city's waterfront, but in Athens, site of the 2004 Olympic Games, the fencing, hockey, softball, kayak and canoeing facilities are silent and empty. Though the soccer stadium in Athens continues to draw competitive teams and large crowds, the roof at the basketball field house leaks and the water at the rowing center in Skoinias has turned brackish and brown. Maintaining the Olympic facilities there could run as high as $100 million a year, according to newspaper reports in Greece and elsewhere.
 The situation is only modestly better in Sydney, Australia, where the government spends $46 million a year maintaining the sites of the 2000 Olympic Games. The velodrome and the equestrian and shooting centers require steep subsidies. Even the former Olympic stadium is in dire financial straits, according to a report in The Sydney Morning Herald. And the Olympic mountain bike track in western Sydney has been closed because there were so few users. 
 ''In Athens they built so many facilities that are underutilized today,'' said Robert A. Baade, a sports economist at Lake Forest College who worked with the Greek government to evaluate the impact of the Games. ''It's the same thing in Sydney. The problem is commonplace. I don't know how New York escapes the same sort of fate.''
 Olympic advocates in New York say they have taken great pains to learn from the mistakes in other cities, and that they plan to preserve sports sites by linking them to sports associations on a lasting basis. Instead of concentrating many of the sites in a single Olympic park outside the city, which often makes them difficult for people to use, planners say they have tried to select disparate locations in the city's five boroughs, hoping to increase the chances that they will be embraced by their neighborhoods after the Games are gone.
 Andrew Winters, the committee's director of planning and design, noted that no sport is foreign in New York City, where there are large immigrant communities from virtually every country in the world. In Athens, he said, softball is an oddity, making repeated use of the baseball diamond unlikely. 
 Planners say they have already proposed long-term uses for the sites after the Games, hoping, for example, to persuade universities to base their rowing programs in the flat water courses to be built at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens, while turning the whitewater course there into a retail concession. The Staten Island equestrian center could be used by the city's many horse enthusiasts, they say, although it would duplicate a similar site at the home of the United States equestrian team in Gladstone, N.J.
 Deidre Murphy, a road cyclist who competed in the 2000 Olympics, said there were hundreds of cyclists in New York who would be interested in using the Bronx velodrome, which would be the only enclosed bike track outside of California. 
 Responding to skepticism about the long-term financial needs of the projects, Mr. Winters of NYC2012 acknowledged that government subsidies were required to keep open velodromes in Europe, where indoor tracks are far more popular than in the United States. So, he said, the Bronx velodrome has been designed so that sections of the track could be removed, allowing badminton, volleyball and other sports to be played on the infield, and broadening its appeal. 
 ''In New York City there's just a tremendous undersupply of facilities, given the enormous number of school-age children,'' said Richard Kahan, a founder of Take the Field, a group helping to rebuild school athletic fields in the city. ''There's so much unfulfilled demand for any kind of facility that anything we build will be intensely used.'' 

Where, When, If?
The city's plans for the 2012 Olympics include these sites:

Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens: Water polo center, archery field, whitewater center, regatta center.

Near Yankee Stadium: Velodrome, baseball field and boxing arena.

Williamsburg Waterfront: Aquatics and beach volleyball centers.

Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn: Gymnastic center.

Baker Field: Hockey center.

Pelham Bay Park: Modern pentathlon center, shooting center.

Central Park: Triathlon center.

Gateway Park: Sailing marina.

St. George, Staten Island: Softball field.

Fort Wadsworth: Road cycling course.

Fresh Kills Park, Staten Island: Mountain and motocross courses.

Greenbelt Park, Staten Island: Equestrian center.

(The plan also includes these training sites: Inwood Hill Park, Randalls Island, William Bryant High School, Long Island City High School, La Guardia Community School, Aviation High School, Long Island City YMCA, Harry Van Arsdale High School and Eastern District High School.)

 La Tourette Park on Staten Island, home to a golf course and ball fields, would be developed into an equestrian center for the Games, and for the city's horse enthusiasts.

Broadway

'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and on-stage alterego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffle of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. (Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'BFE' Julia Cho's insightful drama about the agonies and comforts of isolation centers around a 14-year-old Asian-American girl (Olivia Oguma) who feels she isn't beautiful. The main characters force themselves to reach out to others, but all fail in some essential way (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Anita Gates)

'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)

'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Jason Zinoman)

* 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Reopening Thursday at the Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.(Neil Genzlinger)

'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Oliver Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce Irish (2:30). Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. In repertory with ''Score.'' (Anne Midgette)

'TABLOID CALIGULA' Three excellent performances set off Darren Murphy's dark comedy, about a London thug hooked on Alexander the Great, in which the author has a lot of fun with language and the art of storytelling (1:30). Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200.(Andrea Stevens)

'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Preyskyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Citigroup Center, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444.(Genzlinger)

'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters, affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, (212)239-6200. (Gates)

'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'DAY IN THE LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE' Talent and passion are overcome by banality in the first musical by the Broadway actor Josh Walden, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, choreographed the show, and directed. While the music and dance show occasional flair, the same cannot be said of the lyrics or book, a cliched exhuming of the secrets behind 1950's facades (1:00) . Flamboyan Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4080. (Horn)

'KNOCK ON WOOD' Thanks to Steven Spielberg and Bob Dole, the bar is fairly high these days for war stories, and Samuel Calderon comes nowhere near clearing it with ''Knock on Wood,'' a monologue about his perfectly ordinary service in the Israeli military during the Yom Kippur War. He sees a few moderately distressing sights, his friend is injured, and that's about it (1:30). 13th Street Repertory, 50 West 13th Street, (212)352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'MARATHON 2005, SERIES A' A long, too often dreary evening of plays by a pair of Tony winners, John Guare and Warren Leight, and a pair of actress-playwrights, Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and Leslie Lyles. Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros contribution, ''The Airport Play,'' is the briefest and, perhaps not coincidentally, the best of the bunch (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212)352-3101 (Isherwood)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about a girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking play (starring Tim Daly), but unfortunately, there are no characters in it you can believe in. Loosely based on a true story, this timely drama is about a girl who has been in a coma for several years and her brother who plans to disconnect her breathing ventilator and allow her to die (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'IVANOV' Jonathan Banks staging of the Chekhov classic Ivanov with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 17 Lexington Avenue, at 23rd street, (646)312-4085, closing tomorrow. (Jonathan Kalb)

'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the pair (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'MORTAL LADIES POSSESSED' Linda Marlowe's admirable but difficult one-woman show is based on a 1974 collection of Tennessee Williams's short stories. The adaptation is sometimes awkward and the transitions hard to follow, but she captures the characters' pathos and fragility nicely (1:20). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)

* 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics is badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer, Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, closing on Thursday. The show is in repertory with ''Songs From an Unmade Bed.'' (Midgette)

'UNCLE JIMMY'S DIRTY BASEMENT' This strange brew of Catskills humor, heavy metal and filthy-minded puppets has developed a cult following downtown, and its bizarre band rocks out to some of the most bombastically silly songs since Spinal Tap's ''Big Bottom.'' But when the music stops, the show meanders without an involving story (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)477-5288, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)

'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

'DOMINION PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST' (R, 115 minutes) The solemn, high-minded attempt to redeem ''The Exorcist'' franchise is the movie equivalent of retrieving the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from the trash and presenting them as art; the ingredients still stink. (Holden)

* 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

* 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)

'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creep show, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)

'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in. (Dargis)

* 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)

'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)

* 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)

'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)

* 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)

'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)

'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)

'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)

'SAVING FACE' (R, 91 minutes) The amiable romantic comedy examines the lives of three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York exudes a palpable love for its characters but ends up betraying its hard-headedness with instant, feel-good solutions to their problems. (Holden)

'SEQUINS' (No rating, 88 minutes, in French) In this decorous trifle from France, the young actress Lola Naymark stares into space with moist, empty eyes, tossing her red hair like a pony fretfully swishing away late-summer flies. Ms. Naymark's enviable hair, with its springy curls and poetically inflamed color, accounts for much of this film's visual enchantment and interest. (Dargis)

'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)

* 'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Dana Stevens)

'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)

RYAN ADAMS (Tomorrow) Ryan Adams keeps changing his mind about whom he's emulating; he's gone from Van Morrison to the Replacements. With his new band, the Cardinals, his songs are kindly and lovelorn and he's in a Grateful Dead mood, ready to jam. 7:30; Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732)238-5500, $25. (Jon Pareles)

BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA (Monday) After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys, but gray-haired eminences of gospel quartet singing. Led by Clarence Fountain, they proclaim their reverence in close harmonies and gutsy improvisations that leap heavenward. They perform Monday as part of Jazz at Lincoln Center's That's Entertainment spring benefit gala also featuring Lyle Lovett and Wynton Marsalis. 7:30 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, 212258-9961, $1,000. (Pareles)

B.B. KING (Monday) The great bluesman B.B. King and his latest guitar called Lucille can, on a good night, summon all the tribulation and joy and resilience of the blues.

BLANCHE (Thursday) This Detroit band's debut single featured the White Stripes frontman Jack White (who also covered a Blanche song as a B-side to his single ''I Don't Know What To Do With Myself''). Both bands share an idealization of a pre-modern sound. Blanche's acoustic goth Americana meanders the foothills of an imagined Appalachia. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $12. (Laura Sinagra)

BLUE MERLE (Wednesday) This Nashville group's folk-rock is best when it opens into jam-band expanse. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, $12, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)

THE CORAL (Thursday) This British band's psychedelic pop has yet to find the glorious meeting of newfound structure and early chaos it would need to take listeners by storm. Still, the amiable lads seem to be gesturing toward trendy punk-disco these days, which isn't a bad move . 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)

COWBOY JUNKIES (Tomorrow) Nearing the 20-year mark, this soporific alt-country group nurtures a base of vaguely alienatied yuppy fans still intrigued by the band's relatively safe journey to country's dark side, and the sibling tension between its singer, Margo Timmins, and her guitarist and songwriter brother, Michael. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $35. (Sinagra)

ROBERT CRAY BAND AND MARCIA BALL AND JEREMIAH LOCKWOOD ((Tonight) Robert Cray, who brings convincing passion to songs about a tortured conscience, meshes blues with Memphis soul. Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time. 8:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212) 777-6800, $32.50. (Pareles)

DICK DALE (Tomorrow) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960's. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. 7 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144, $20.50, $25.50 at the door. (Pareles)

DAVE'S TRUE STORY (Tonight) Easy-swinging jazz, bossa nova, Steely Dan pop and touches of country are wrapped around existential ruminations in the songs of Dave's True Story. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $15. (Pareles)

ELECTRELANE (Tonight) The spacey European art-pop favored by this British band, played on vintage analog equipment and influenced by 1970's German electronic rock, hasn't been in vogue since the late 90's, but the group plays it with verve, often subverting its music's sheen with messy garage-rock heft. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $15. (Sinagra)

JOHN FOGERTY (Wednesday) The Creedence Clearwater Revival's songwriter, guitarist and singer's wild-eyed wail and the distilled twang of his guitar remain undiminished, the sound of a mythic backwoods Southland where barefoot girls dance in the moonlight. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $75. (Pareles)

THE FUTUREHEADS, HIGH SPEED SCENE, PITTY SING (Monday) Vying with Bloc Party for the mantle of least derivative dance-punk revival band, the Futureheads' reverence for the music of polestars like XTC and Wire extends beyond sonic mimicry, adding nuance to pro forma punk panic. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20. (Sinagra)

THE FUNKY METERS (Tonight and Thursday) The Funky Meters include Art Neville on keyboards and George Porter Jr. on bass from the Meters, the band that was the cornerstone of New Orleans funk.

Tonight at 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $30, $35 at the door.

GRADA (Wednesday) Though they play their guitars, fiddles, flutes and bodhrans in the traditional Celtic style, this young Dublin group has set itself apart by composing original music, innovating on Irish, Breton and Eastern Eurpoean styes while staying recognizably within the forms. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26 Street,Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $15, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)

JUCIFER (Thursday) For a two-member group -- Amber Valentine on guitar and vocals, Edgar Livengood on drums -- Jucifer makes a mighty noise with its songs about death and desolation. Its blasts its way through power-chorded mayhem, slow or at punk speeds, topped by Ms. Valentine's airy voice. 9 p.m., with Shellshag and Godsgun opening. Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Pareles)

JURASSIC 5 (Tuesday) Reaching back to rap's old school era of simple funky beats and sing-along choruses, this nostalgic California group was popular in the late-90's when hip-hop fans tired of Puff Daddy's sampling of whole songs and mainstream rap's increasingly money-grubbing aesthetic. 11 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $25.50, $27 at the door. (Sinagra)

KEANE AND REGINA SPEKTOR (Tuesday) Keane is a piano-drums-vocals band that piles on one hooky melodic flourish after another as if to distance ifself from the artiness of its main influence, Radiohead. The music of the bill's opener, The Russian-born singer-pianist Regina Spektor, goes down less smoothly, bringing punk immediacy into a caberet setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and unhinged melodrama. 7:30 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, (212)465-6741, $39.50 and $29.50. (Sinagra)

KEREN ANN (Thursday) This Dutch-Javanese, Russian-Israeli chanteuse Keren Ann applies her velvety voice to jazz-inflected, rainy day urban valentines. Her lolling shows that the strongest memory of a visited place is often the homesickness endured there. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236, $13, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)

THE KILLERS, LOUIS XIV (Tomorrow) Maybe it's their Las Vegas roots, maybe it's the singer Brendan Flowers' glam charisma or maybe its their simple nostalgic perference for the MTV version of the 80's over their peers' more complicated recollections. Whatever the reason, the Killers are the pop smash of the neo-New Wave boomlet. 5:30 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, $32.50, $35. Sold out.(Sinagra)

AMOS LEE (Tomorrow) After touring extensively with the like-minded Norah Jones, this Philadelphia singer-songwriter now headlines in support of his new album of soothing acoustic folk-soul ruminations. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

LOSERS LOUNGE: THE CURE VS THE SMITHS (Tonight and Tomorrow) A true treasure, the city's tireless pop tribute outfit takes advantage of the current post-punk revival and ongoing adoration of the mope-rock heros Morrissey and Robert Smith, both of whom offer endless options for loving parody and stylistic license. 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $17, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

LUCERO (Tuesday) The Arkansan Jim Nichols's convincingly weathered singing, an earthy growl that fits nicely in the groove of his band's wistful, ragged road rock. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $13, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)

STEPHEN MALKMUS (Tuesday) The abstract poetic songwriting and quirky, blazing guitar work of the former Pavement frontman are still worth checking out. Recent work has increasingly seemed geared for cultists, while moving closer to universal topics like family, aging and commitment. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, East Village, (212)777-6800, $22.50, $25 at the door. Sold out. (Sinagra)

MARAH WITH NICK HORNBY (Sunday) Marah's articulate songs are doused in greasy, sweaty, exuberant rock.

M.I.A., DIPLO (Tuesday) With her remix-friendly slogans and readymade radical chic, the British Sri Lankan Maya Arulpragasam has become an emblem of global beat matching and post-colonial shakedowns. The clever Philadelphia hip-hop producer Diplo is responsible for her popular underground mix ''Piracy Funds Terrorism'' (Hollertronix), which lays her vocals on music as diverse as 80's new wave and Brazillian baille funk. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20. Sold out. (Sinagra)

RAUL MIDON (Tuesday) Raul Midon's percussive guitar syncopations and supple, high-flying tenor, both akin to Jose Feliciano's style, have wowed audiences in his regular Joe's Pub appearances.

(Pareles)

JUANA MOLINA (Thursday) The reveries of this Argentinean songwriter stem from her acoustic guitar picking, her hushed voice, melodies with the simplicity of lullabies and rustling synthesizer backdrops that fill the songs with mystery. 9:30 Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8777, $15. (Pareles)

TRAVIS MORRISON (Sunday) This singer-guitarist's former band, the Dismemberment Plan, played virtuoso fusion-rock. Its transcendent quality was the anguished, cutesy break-up lyrics, written and sung, by Mr. Morrison. Though artier and more pretentious on his own, he manages to remain winsome. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Sinagra)

STEVIE NICKS AND DON HENLEY (Tomorrow) Most will come out to this show to see the Fleetwood Mac star Stevie Nicks, who continues to fascinate though her vocal range has narrowed, edging those rich lows into raspier territory. One assumes that she and Don Henley of Eagles fame will perform their hit 80's duet ''Leather and Lace.'' 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., Garden State Parkway Exit 116, (732)335-0400, $26 to $126. (Sinagra)

OLD 97'S, BOBBY BARE JR. (Thursday) Having grown out of their smart-aleck phase long ago, the Old 97's were swerving toward slickness before to their latest release. The songwriter Rhett Miller is still writing near-genius tunes though he often resorts to mere craft. The Nashville songwriter Bobby Bare Jr. shares the bill. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, East Village, (212) 777-6800, $25.(Sinagra)

GRAHAM PARKER & THE FIGGS (Tonight) Emerging from England just before the arrival of punk-rock, Graham Parker used the sturdy structures of soul and 1960's rock as he spat out angry, articulate songs that chafed against dishonesties large and small. These days, he's less furious and more cranky, but he's still holding the world around him to high standards. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $20. (Pareles)

SAM PREKOP (Tonight) One of the Chicago musicians who pioneered mid-90's jazz and electroinc post-rock music, the singer and guitarist Prekop is a smooth, if overly genteel singer, and fluid player. His group The Sea and Cake benefited from his light touch, and wistful vocals. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)

IKE REILLY (Sunday) This St. Paul rocker's visceral, outlandishly catchy 2001 album, ''Salesman and Racists'' (Universal), captured a certain kind of in-the-cups cockiness and bar-clown wit that almost made the listener overlook its macho nudges and winks. Mr. Reilly and his band tear it up live. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)

DUKE ROBILLARD (Tomorrow) Duke Robillard, a guitarist and singer, founded Roomful of Blues in 1967, and in his solo career since leaving the band he hasn't forgotten the suave swing of vintage jump blues; he also played lead guitar on Bob Dylan's album ''Time Out of Mind.'' 7:30; Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155, $18, $22 tomorrow.

(Pareles)

XAVIER RUDD (Monday) An Australian songwriter who has been working the jam-band circuit, Xavier Rudd plays jazzy, syncopated guitar as he broods, something like Dave Matthews with an occasional toot of a didjeridu. 8:00 p.m., with Kyle Riabko opening.

SPOON, THE CLIENTELE (Wednesday and Thursday) The Austin indie standout Brit Daniels's latest album, ''Gimme Fiction'' (Merge), is a tougher nut to crack than 2002's nearly flawless jitter-rock ''Kill the Moonlight'' (Merge), but live his tight group listens to each other, as the vibe swings from slacker angst to caffeinated bravado. 7 p.m., Webster Hall,125 East 11th Street, East Village, (917)577-2499, $18, $20 at the door. Sold out. (Sinagra)

WOLF PARADE, RICK MOODY VS.

Sold out (Sinagra)

LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III (Sunday and Monday) Mr. Wainwright has had topical songs commissioned by NPR in the past, but he saves his sharpest barbs for himself, confronting middle age and mortality without letting himself off the hook.

'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Run on enthusiasm and a shoestring, the tiny Amato opera company mounts a modest production of the Donizetti classic.

Classical Music

CHIARA STRING QUARTET (Sunday) The composer George Rochberg, who died on Sunday at age 86, had planned on attending this performance of his Piano Quintet, played by the Chiara Quartet with Simone Dinnerstein.

COUNTER)INDUCTION (Tonight) Over the last few seasons this energetic young new-music band has offered some inventive and beautifully played programs. Its concert tonight, called ''Big Science,'' explores the interaction between performers and computers, and includes Mario Davidovsky's ''Synchronisms No. 2,'' for electronic tape and chamber ensemble, as well as works by Tristan Murail, Eric Moe, Bernhard Gander and the group's two resident composers, Douglas Boyce and Kyle Bartlett. 8 p.m., Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212)645-2800, $12 suggested donation. (Allan Kozinn)

PHILIP GLASS (Tonight and tomorrow) Godfrey Reggio's three polemics about modern life are available on DVD, but there is much to be said for seeing them on the big screen, with the Philip Glass Ensemble accompanying them with some of Mr. Glass's best work. ''Koyaanisqatsi'' (''Life Out of Balance'') was performed yesterday, but ''Naqoyqatsi'' (''Life as War'') is to be shown tonight and ''Powaqqatsi'' (''Life in Transformation'') concludes the cycle (albeit out of order) tomorrow. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500, $40 tonight, $35 tomorrow.

LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and Sunday) Avery Fisher Hall may seem a bit of a comedown for the proud residents of the acclaimed Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, but Esa-Pekka Salonen and the orchestra will presumably cope gamely in two programs of works by Ravel, Mussorgsky, Ives, Shostakovich and John Adams. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 2 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $35 to $68. (Oestreich)

Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30. p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $22 to $90. (Kozinn)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC ENSEMBLES (Sunday) In this series of concerts, players from the orchestra explore chamber music terrain both familiar and less so. This weekend, it's Schubert's much-admired ''Trout'' Quintet and a Sextet by Krzysztof Penderecki. 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $28. (Eichler)

GEORGE PERLE'S 90TH BIRTHDAY CONCERT (Tuesday) Those who assume that music steeped in 12-tone technique is by definition complex and forbidding should listen to the bracing and witty works of George Perle, whose 90th birthday will be celebrated in a concert by a stellar group of musicians, including the pianist Horacio Gutierrez, the violinist Curtis Macomber and the soprano Lucy Shelton. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $25; $10 for students. (Tommasini)

RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Thursday) You can usually count on the Riverside Symphony to present involving performances of adventurous programs, and this program looks to be no exception. Haydn's ebullient Piano Concerto No. 4 in G is paired with a Neo-Classical contemporary work that looks back to Haydn: Honegger's Concertino for Piano and Orchestra. Shai Wosner is the soloist. The New York premiere of David Crumb's ''Vestiges of a Distant Time'' and Mendelssohn's ''Italian'' Symphony frame the program. George Rothman conducts. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)751-6200, $25 and $45; half-price for students. (Tommasini)

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Smith)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)

* QUEEN SOFiA SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Nunez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquin Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)

* STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)

UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. (Kimmelman)

GEORGE CONDO His latest sculptures are gnarly heads and busts, vehemently modeled in clay and cast in gaudy gold bronze, that bring the droll nastiness and lush physicality of his more satirical paintings fully into three dimensions. Skarstedt Fine Art, 980 Madison near 78th Street, (212)737-2060, through June 10. (Smith)

HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson)

* RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)

Galleries: 57th Street

DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)

EMILY NELLIGAN AND MARVIN BILECK: 'CRANBERRY ISLAND, DRAWINGS AND PRINTS' Using only charcoal and eraser on ordinary letter paper, Emily Nelligan has for more than 50 years focused on a tiny part of Maine called Great Cranberry Island, one of several specks off the coast near Mount Desert. Restricting her palette to reticent blacks, whites and grays, she conveys the spirit, changes and constancies of a pure, unsullied wilderness. Marvin Bileck, her husband, has concentrated on the island's factual here-and-nowness, rendering piled-up rocks, tangles of trees, deep woods and their tweakings by nature in meticulous drawings and etchings. She's a wizard at mood, he's a master of specifics. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, through June 17. (Glueck)

Galleries: Chelsea

DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)

SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through June 25. (Johnson)

ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)

NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree branches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)

James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)

JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through June 18. (Johnson)

STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotum-like coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)

ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)

JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black and white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger than life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 Eleventh Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, through June 18. (Johnson)

REUBEN NAKIAN: 'TERRA COTTAS, 1955-1983' The large semi-figurative bronze sculptures of Nakian (1897-1983) often figure in the history of Abstract Expressionism, but this well-selected exhibition suggests that he should be best remembered for his small terra cottas -- fraught with Classical themes, sexual energy and fast-working bravura.

HEADLINE: Study on Special Education Finds Low Graduation Rate

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
Most students who are enrolled in special education classes in New York City are failing to earn regular high school diplomas, according to a study released yesterday by a nonprofit group that monitors the school system.
 About 111,000 students who received special education services left the system from 1996 to 2004, and of those students, 13,672 -- or 12.3 percent -- graduated with Regents or local diplomas, according to Advocates for Children, the nonprofit group that issued the report, ''Leaving Empty-Handed.'' In addition, 12 percent received an alternative certificate, an Individualized Education Program diploma.
 ''The graduation rates are grim and mean that most of the city's students receiving special education services are leaving school with no options for college, employment or independence,'' said Jill Chaifetz, the executive director of the group. 
 Ms. Chaifetz and Elisa Hyman, the group's deputy director, said the findings underscored what they saw every day: longstanding failures to serve vulnerable children.
 ''This is a huge number of kids,'' Ms. Chaifetz said. ''They can have a future. But what we are providing is the opportunity to fail.''
 The report also found that the city's special education graduation rate ''lags dismally'' behind that of other parts of the state and across the nation. In the 2002-3 school year, for instance, the percentage of special education students receiving regular diplomas was 12.8 percent in New York City, 26 percent in New York State and 31 percent nationally.
 The Department of Education vigorously disagreed with the group's conclusions, contending that its efforts to overhaul the special education system were beginning to produce measurable results.
 For example, it cited test scores released on Wednesday for the third, fifth, sixth and seventh grades showing that the number of special education students scoring at Level 1, or ''not proficient,'' dropped in mathematics from 61.4 percent last year to 53.1 this year. In English, this year 43.2 percent of students were not proficient, compared with 58.1 percent last year.
 ''No one has more aggressively tackled the long-neglected area of special education services for our children,'' a spokeswoman for Chancellor Joel I. Klein, Michele McManus Higgins, said in a statement. ''And yesterday's news about the remarkable gains in achievement by our special education students, in both math and English, strongly suggests that we are on our way to improved graduation rates for these students.''
 In fact, the study notes, the percentage of special education students graduating with Regents or local diplomas has increased over the last four years, to 15.96 percent from a low of 9.14 percent in 2000. 
 In addition, Ms. Higgins said, this year the department selected dozens of troubled schools to receive grants for improving their special education services. She also said that 58 high schools will begin accepting groups of special education students for the first time in September, and that they have received grants to develop services for these students and have arranged summertime professional development for staff members. 
 Special education students' disabilities vary from depression, anxiety and mild impediments in speech and hearing to more severe learning disabilities and retardation. 
 Last June, the state set a goal of having 80 percent of special education students graduating with a local, Regents or high school equivalency diploma by 2010. 
 Slightly more than 12 percent of special education students who left school in the last eight years received an alternative certificate, an Individualized Education Program diploma. But that diploma is not equal to a Regents or a local diploma, and is not accepted in many cases by colleges, the armed forces or vocational training programs.
 The report also found significant disproportions in graduation rates by race and sex. White and Asian special education students were, on average, twice as likely to graduate as black and Hispanic students. And girls were more likely than boys to finish school.
 ''In a broader context, 12 percent is certainly shockingly low,'' said Christopher Swanson, a senior researcher for the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy research organization based in Washington. Mr. Swanson has researched special education graduation rates nationally.
 ''It's important not to jump to conclusions that just because a student has an I.E.P. that they are unable to take a normal course of study with modifications or to graduate,'' said Mr. Swanson, referring to the specialized curriculum for such students. ''Just because these are special education students, we shouldn't write them off as not being able to graduate.''

HEADLINE: Fields Swiftly Apologizes to Ferraro for Remark by Her Campaign Strategist

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Mindful of the political harm that a single gaffe can cause a mayoral candidate, C. Virginia Fields quickly apologized yesterday to Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 vice presidential nominee, for a swipe at her by Ms. Fields's campaign strategist.
 The strategist, Joseph C. Mercurio, had shrugged off Ms. Ferraro's endorsement of Fernando Ferrer, another leading candidate for the Democratic mayoral nomination, by telling The New York Times of Ms. Ferraro, ''I had to spend a few minutes remembering who she was.'' 
 The comment surprised and angered Ms. Fields, according to her aides, and she called Ms. Ferraro yesterday to apologize.
 Ms. Fields also issued a public apology, aides said, because she worried that the remark might alienate female voters and donors. Aides added that she also wanted to avoid the problems of Mr. Ferrer, who has tumbled in the polls after offering explanations but not an apology to those upset with his remark this spring that the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was not a crime.
 In her statement, Ms. Fields offered her ''strongest and sincerest apologies to Geraldine Ferraro for the off-handed comments'' by Mr. Mercurio.
 ''I have the utmost respect for Ms. Ferraro and all that she has accomplished in the political and professional arena, particularly for women,'' she said. Choosing words her aides use to describe her own candidacy, Ms. Fields added: ''She is a pioneer and leader, who has paved the way for countless women in politics and in elected office. I admire her intellect, determination and courage.''
 The Fields camp had also sought the endorsement of Ms. Ferraro, a former Queens congresswoman, hoping she would help rally women behind Ms. Fields in the Sept. 13 mayoral primary.
 Ms. Ferraro was traveling yesterday, but her assistant said she appreciated the apology.
 Reached yesterday afternoon, Mr. Mercurio appeared initially unaware of his candidate's apology, and requested a copy of it from a reporter. An hour later, he replied with his own statement, which, he said, he had cleared with Ms. Fields.
 ''As a political consultant who worked on Ms. Ferraro's successful first congressional race, and as an Italian-American who was proud to see her as the first Italian-American on a national political party's ticket, I was very disappointed to see her endorse against a strong candidate who has a shot at becoming the first woman mayor of New York City,'' Mr. Mercurio said.
 Asked if he was apologizing to Ms. Ferraro, or retracting his original remarks, Mr. Mercurio said he would have no further comment.
 At a forum for the Democratic mayoral candidates yesterday, Mr. Ferrer found himself defending his proposal to resurrect a city tax on stock trades to raise $4 billion for New York's public schools.
 In what provided the only sparks in the forum, sponsored by the Citizens Budget Commission, Norman N. Mintz, an economist and commission trustee, challenged Mr. Ferrer to explain why such a tax would not ''cause the stock transfer business to move across the river.''
 As Mr. Ferrer began explaining that businesses had a stake in city children receiving a better education, Mr. Mintz reacted dismissively, causing Mr. Ferrer to protest, ''Forgive me, let me just answer your question.''
 ''You're not, that's the point. It's not responsive,'' Mr. Mintz said. 
 Mr. Ferrer eventually parried the suggestion that Wall Street firms would leave town to avoid the stock transfer tax by recalling past incidents of brinkmanship between City Hall and the financial services sector: ''I remember when the Stock Exchange threatened to move across the river if it didn't get a billion dollars in joint subsidies from the state and the city. Do you remember that? I do. It didn't, and it didn't.''

 BODY:
More than two years after the fall of Saddam Hussein, Iraq remains a complex mix of tragedy and hope. To give a sense of the ebb and flow, the chart below shows data for three key months: May 2003 (the first full month after the fall of Baghdad), June 2004 (the last month before the Coalition Authority gave way to the interim Iraqi government) and May 2005. 
 Many Iraqis today are wealthier than they were before the invasion, with more bustle in the streets and a new stock market that is trading billions of shares a month; yet by other measures, like electricity availability and the unemployment rate, Iraq's economy appears weaker than it was during the Baathist reign. 
 Much has been made, rightly, of the intensification of the insurgency. Last month's toll on United States troops was well above the average for the last two years, and was the deadliest yet for Iraqi security forces. Still, Iraqis are providing authorities with far more tips on insurgent activities than even a few months ago. And most people remain optimistic about the future. Even Sunni Arabs, who provide the largest pool of recruits for the insurgency, seem slightly more hopeful than a year ago. This optimism is welcome, because with security conditions poor and the economy a mixed bag, the fledgling political process has increasingly become Iraq's main good news -- and main hope.

HEADLINE: Bush S.E.C. Pick Is Seen as Friend To Corporations

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2 

 BODY:
In Republican and business circles, William H. Donaldson has been viewed as the David Souter of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a disappointingly independent choice who sided too frequently with the Democrats. 
 President Bush, hearing complaints about Mr. Donaldson's record from across the business spectrum, responded on Thursday by nominating Representative Christopher Cox, a conservative Republican from California, as a successor whose loyalties seem clear. And unlike the Supreme Court, where Justice Souter has a lifetime appointment, the S.E.C. provides the White House with an immediate opportunity to tip the balance of the five-person commission in a more favorable direction.
 Mr. Cox -- a devoted student of Ayn Rand, the high priestess of unfettered capitalism -- has a long record in the House of promoting the agenda of business interests that are a cornerstone of the Republican Party's political and financial support. 
 A major recipient of contributions from business groups, the accounting profession and Silicon Valley, he has fought against accounting rules that would give less favorable treatment to corporate mergers and executive stock options. He opposes taxes on dividends and capital gains. And he helped to steer through the House a bill making investor lawsuits more difficult. 
 That measure, which Congress adopted over President Bill Clinton's veto, was hailed by business groups, which say it has reduced costly and frivolous cases.
 It has also been criticized by consumer and investor organizations. They say its adoption in 1995 contributed to an unaccountable climate that fostered the big accounting scandals at companies like Enron and WorldCom a few years later.
 Mr. Cox's legislative record was cited on Thursday by President Bush as a primary qualification. 
 ''As a champion of the free-enterprise system in Congress, Chris Cox knows that a free economy is built on trust,'' the president said in the Roosevelt Room, as he introduced the third man in his tenure to lead the commission. 
 Mr. Cox, following in the tradition of other nominees to major government jobs, declined through a spokesman to comment about his record or his plans for the agency while awaiting Senate confirmation proceedings. 
 Appearing beside Mr. Bush on Thursday, Mr. Cox, 52, praised the commission as ''one of the best-run agencies in the federal government.''
 ''During my time as a securities practitioner,'' he said, ''I was consistently impressed by the high caliber of professionals who regulate corporate finance and our markets. It will be an honor, if confirmed, to join this exceptional team.''
 Representative Cox has both fierce supporters and detractors. But both sides agree that the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon become a very different place if, as expected, he is swiftly confirmed to become the agency's 28th chairman. 
 Under Mr. Donaldson, a Rockefeller Republican whose credentials on Wall Street and corporate America led some to believe he would be a cautious caretaker, the commission responded to a wave of business scandals through a series of restrictive regulations and tough enforcement cases.
 On the big votes, he often broke ranks with the commission's two Republicans, Cynthia A. Glassman and Paul S. Atkins, who complained repeatedly that the rules and enforcement cases promoted by Mr. Donaldson and the two Democrats were unnecessary and overly burdensome.
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, which will hold a confirmation hearing soon, said he strongly supported Mr. Cox. Once Mr. Cox joins the commission, he said, Ms. Glassman and Mr. Atkins will almost certainly no longer find themselves in the minority.
 ''I have long thought that the lack of consensus on a number of big issues was very troubling, with 3-to-2 votes, and especially with a Republican chairman slipping from the two other Republicans on several big votes,'' Senator Shelby said in a telephone interview from Turkey. ''Under Chris Cox as chairman, you are probably not going to have much of that. Chris Cox is superbly qualified for the job and he will make an outstanding chairman.''
 William Lerach, a prominent shareholder lawyer in San Diego who a decade ago found himself on the losing end of the political battle over investor lawsuits, agreed that the Republicans on the commission will now be more unified. But as a result, he argued, the policies it sets could be devastating for investors. 
 ''I would expect that Cox will use his authority for an across-the-board assault on investor protection,'' Mr. Lerach said. ''In my experience with him, I found him to be virulently anti-investor and unrestrained in his desire to gut the securities laws. It's hard to think of a worse choice for the S.E.C. This is a world-class payback to the corporate world.''
 Mr. Lerach recalled that the final legislation Congress adopted to restrict investor lawsuits, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, was much milder than the legislation Mr. Cox first proposed. That bill had significantly raised the standard of proof for investors and had included a provision forcing the losing party in such lawsuits to pay legal fees, a provision that some experts said would have effectively killed most investor lawsuits. 
 Ultimately, lawmakers adopted the Senate version of the measure, which did not include those provisions.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democratic member of the banking committee, said he wanted to learn more about Mr. Cox's views before deciding how to vote on him.
 ''Donaldson achieved a good balance,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''The question is whether Cox sees the need for balance. If he sides with somebody like Atkins, who doesn't believe in regulation at all, then we will have trouble.'' 
 One issue that is certain to arise is whether Mr. Cox will feel obligated to Wall Street and the business groups that have been among his most important political contributors.
 Since 1989, his campaigns have raised more than $6 million, with more than $2 million coming from business political action committees, according to federal election reports analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research organization that favors tighter controls on campaign contributions. The list of top 20 industries contributing to his campaigns includes securities and investment, which have given him over $256,000; law firms, which have given $364,000; and accountants, which have given over $207,000.
 Marc E. Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, one of Wall Street's lobbying groups, praised the appointment. ''He has a particular sensitivity to costly and unnecessary regulation,'' Mr. Lackritz said. ''He understands that the increased costs of regulation put an unnecessary tax on investors.''
 But Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said that Mr. Cox's record was not encouraging to her. She said she was particularly concerned that his close ties to Silicon Valley would lead him to take steps to roll back a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires management to assess the effectiveness of internal financial controls and report on weaknesses.
 ''I expect he will be extremely activist,'' Ms. Roper said, ''and will rework the agency in his own image.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Cox has been consistent throughout his career. He served at the White House under President Ronald Reagan and was elected to the House in 1988 after working in California at the law firm of Latham & Watkins, specializing in venture capital and corporate finance.
 After graduating from the University of Southern California, he received degrees from both the law school and the business school at Harvard. 
 Over the last 16 years in the House of Representatives, Mr. Cox has played a central role as one of the strongest pro-business voices. 
 But his advocacy for some interests also caused him some trouble. Early in the first term of President Bush, Mr. Cox withdrew his name before it was formally put forward by the White House for a federal appeals court seat on the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, because the slender Democratic majority in the Senate had threatened a bruising confirmation battle.

HEADLINE: A Race To The Top

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Paul Krugman is on vacation.

DATELINE: Bangalore, India 

 BODY:
It was extremely revealing traveling from Europe to India as French voters (and now Dutch ones) were rejecting the E.U. constitution -- in one giant snub to President Jacques Chirac, European integration, immigration, Turkish membership in the E.U. and all the forces of globalization that are eating away at Europe's welfare states. It is interesting because French voters are trying to preserve a 35-hour work week in a world where Indian engineers are ready to work a 35-hour day. Good luck.
 Voters in ''old Europe'' -- France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy -- seem to be saying to their leaders: stop the world, we want to get off; while voters in India have been telling their leaders: stop the world and build us a stepstool, we want to get on. I feel sorry for Western European blue collar workers. A world of benefits they have known for 50 years is coming apart, and their governments don't seem to have a strategy for coping. 
 One reason French voters turned down the E.U. constitution was rampant fears of ''Polish plumbers.'' Rumors that low-cost immigrant plumbers from Poland were taking over the French plumbing trade became a rallying symbol for anti-E.U. constitution forces. A few weeks ago Franz Muntefering, chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party, compared private equity firms -- which buy up failing businesses, downsize them and then sell them -- to a ''swarm of locusts.''
 The fact that a top German politician has resorted to attacking capitalism to win votes tells you just how explosive the next decade in Western Europe could be, as some of these aging, inflexible economies -- which have grown used to six-week vacations and unemployment insurance that is almost as good as having a job -- become more intimately integrated with Eastern Europe, India and China in a flattening world.
 To appreciate just how explosive, come to Bangalore, India, the outsourcing capital of the world. The dirty little secret is that India is taking work from Europe or America not simply because of low wages. It is also because Indians are ready to work harder and can do anything from answering your phone to designing your next airplane or car. They are not racing us to the bottom. They are racing us to the top.
 Indeed, there is a huge famine breaking out all over India today, an incredible hunger. But it is not for food. It is a hunger for opportunity that has been pent up like volcanic lava under four decades of socialism, and it's now just bursting out with India's young generation. 
 ''India is the oldest civilization, the largest democracy and the youngest population -- almost 70 percent is below age 35 and almost 50 percent is 25 and under,'' said Shekhar Gupta, editor of The Indian Express. Next to India, Western Europe looks like an assisted-living facility with Turkish nurses.
 Sure, a huge portion of India still lives in wretched slums or villages, but more and more of the young cohort are grasping for something better. A grass-roots movement is now spreading, demanding that English be taught in state schools -- where 85 percent of children go -- beginning in first grade, not fourth grade. ''What's new is where this movement is coming from,'' said the Indian commentator Krishna Prasad. ''It's coming from the farmers and the Dalits, the lowest groups in society.'' Even the poor have been to the cities enough to know that English is now the key to a tech-sector job, and they want their kids to have those opportunities.
 The Indian state of West Bengal has the oldest elected Communist government left in the world today. Some global technology firms recently were looking at outsourcing there, but told the Communists they could not do so because of the possibility of worker strikes that might disrupt the business processes of the companies they work for. No problem. The Communist government declared information technology work an ''essential service,'' making it illegal for those workers to strike. Have a nice day.
 ''This is not about wages at all -- the whole wage differential thing is going to reduce very quickly,'' said Rajesh Rao, who heads Dhruva, the innovative Indian game company. It is about people who have been starving ''finally seeing the ability to realize their dreams.'' Both Infosys and Wipro, India's leading technology firms, received more than one million applications last year for a little more than 10,000 job openings.
 Yes, this is a bad time for France and friends to lose their appetite for hard work -- just when India, China and Poland are rediscovering theirs.

HEADLINE: Commerce Secretary Warns China on Patent Violations

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 2 

 BODY:
Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez warned on Thursday that without solid enforcement of patent and trademark rights in China, trade tensions with the United States would increase. But a group of Chinese business students he met with here seemed to have only one thing on their minds: textile quotas. 
 At the start of a three-day visit to Beijing, Mr. Gutierrez took a tough line on protection of intellectual property. In a speech to American and Chinese businesspeople, he said the time for negotiations on China's lax enforcement of copyrights and patents had ended. ''Promises in principle eventually need to lead to results,'' he said, ''and we believe it is about that time.'' 
 But later in the day, students pressed the subject of textiles and the recent American decision to impose new quotas on Chinese clothing after a more comprehensive system of global quotas expired at the beginning of the year. 
 ''We have already given them 10 years to prepare,'' said Ding Zheng, a textile company manager and business student who attended the meeting. He referred to the period American textile makers had to get ready for the end of the quota system and an inevitable rise in Chinese exports. ''I think it's their fault,'' Mr. Ding said of the American companies.
 ''Maybe you're right; they should have prepared themselves,'' Mr. Gutierrez replied. ''But we're only dealing with the fact that the market was disrupted.'' 
 With the end of the global quotas, Chinese exports of shorts, trousers, underwear and other garments have surged. Exports of cotton trousers to the United States rose 1,500 percent in the first months of the year. 
 Under an agreement that China signed upon joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, a provision allows for ''special safeguards'' against Chinese exports when they cause ''market disruption.''
 The new American quotas still allow 7.5 percent growth in Chinese textile exports to the United States.
 ''In this case, there was a market disruption,'' Mr. Gutierrez said, ''and that's very hard to explain to the textile person in China who lost his or her job, and I know that. But the reason we did it is that it was so fast and so big,'' he said of the export surge. 
 The growing dispute over textile exports is one of several contentious subjects dogging trade relations between the countries. Mr. Gutierrez did not bring up the matter of China's fixed-rate currency, though it is a point of considerable tension. 
 Washington has accused Beijing of holding down the value of the currency, the yuan -- which has traded in a narrow band at a rate around 8.28 to the dollar for the last decade -- enabling a flood of cheap Chinese exports. Some in Congress have proposed legislation to punish China if it does not revalue the currency.
 American, European and Japanese companies and industry groups complain as well that Chinese officials do little to enforce the many intellectual property laws on their books, and the American industry groups have pressed the Bush administration to consider filing suit at the W.T.O. unless enforcement improves. An assistant secretary of commerce, William H. Lash III, estimates that Chinese intellectual property violations cost companies more than $60 billion a year.
 Mr. Gutierrez will meet with top Chinese economic officials during his three days in Beijing.

LENGTH: 1767 words

HEADLINE: New Free Site May Affect Time Warner Decision on Troubled Unit 

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL and GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Last month, America Online convened a meeting broadcast on the Web to its 14,000 employees. The purpose was to show off the free Internet portal that it is about to introduce at AOL.com, the third attempt in three years to offset AOL's steady loss of subscribers. 
 Before the unveiling, Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner, AOL's parent, spoke. ''AOL is not for sale,'' he said, according to two people who were in the audience. 
 ''AOL is not for spinout,'' he added. ''AOL is for keeps.'' 
 But a few days later, Mr. Parsons was quoted as saying that he was, in fact, open to spinning off some AOL shares to the public. Then Barry Diller, an established Internet bargain hunter, said publicly that he had been interested in adding AOL to his holdings last year, but had turned up his nose at hints that the price would be $20 billion.
 Whether or not AOL is about to be cast off, its reversal of fortune is striking. Five years ago, when its merger with Time Warner was announced, America Online alone was valued at $164 billion. Now, as it sets out to reinvent itself, its place within Time Warner is in question. 
 The merger has long since become a symbol of the misbegotten assumptions and skewed calculations among old and new media at the height of the technology bubble. And as Mr. Parsons's varying statements indicate, what to do about AOL is a pesky puzzle. 
 The new portal will offer sections on news, sports and business, much as Yahoo does, along with some original programming, like music videos, and an emphasis on interests like women's fitness. The challenge is how to create a free Internet site compelling enough to attract traffic and advertising -- with much of the content it previously reserved for paying customers -- without hastening the demise of its subscription business. 
 AOL thinks its risks are low because few of its members join simply for the content, and some of its specialized content will still be reserved for subscribers. In any case, if the payoff is a bigger share of the resurgent Internet ad market, it calculates that a further loss in subscribers is a risk worth taking. 
 Almost from the time of the merger -- in which AOL was, lest it be forgotten, the acquiring party -- the online service has been in decline, dragging down Time Warner's share price. Some analysts say AOL is now worth just $8 billion, even as Internet companies like Google and Yahoo have surpassed it as hot properties. 
 Any day now, Google's market value, currently $80 billion, could pass Time Warner's $81 billion value. Google's annual sales last year came to $3.2 billion, against Time Warner's $42 billion, but investors see Google as the future, and Time Warner and AOL as the past.
 AOL has also been a drag on Time Warner's reputation as the Internet unit went through three years of criminal and civil investigations of its accounting practices. Those cases were resolved in recent months through settlements that cost the company $510 million and forced it to restate past revenue. Related shareholder lawsuits remain outstanding.
 All the while, AOL has kept shrinking -- to 21.2 million subscribers in January from 26.5 million in 2002 -- as the dial-up customers it brought online shift increasingly to high-speed access from their phone and cable companies. 
 Now, with the free portal, Mr. Parsons is about to embark on the most fundamental effort yet to revive AOL. 
 If AOL's latest attempt to tap into the booming online ad market works, it could provide a much-needed source of growth. If not, it may be tempting to simply jettison the online service -- which many Time Warner executives blame for the evaporation of much of their retirement savings -- before its value falls any further. 
 Mr. Parsons declined to comment for this article. But Donald Logan, the chairman of Time Warner's media and communications group, which includes AOL, said the company was committed to keeping the online unit.
 ''We have never put AOL up for sale,'' he said. ''There is nothing going on and no thought of doing anything other than making AOL work.''
 When Mr. Parsons says AOL is for keeps, he may well be saying that he has no other choice. For now, there is probably no prospective buyer willing to pay Time Warner more for AOL than it is worth to keep. AOL still sends its parent nearly $1 billion in cash each year and, largely through cost-cutting, has remained highly profitable. Moreover, any sale would most likely bring large capital-gains taxes.
 Mr. Parsons evidently harbors some hope that if AOL can find a path toward growth, it may again add some pizzazz to Time Warner's stock, which has lingered under $20 for three years. (The shares were above $46 when the merger closed in 2001, already in retreat from the $73.75 price when the deal was announced.) 
 But if AOL is to provide a boost, it will have to find a way to rival the investor appeal of companies like Yahoo and Google, said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. 
 ''The question remains, How does AOL fit into that new world?'' he said. ''Is there a place for AOL in the Internet? How long do you keep spending to reinvent AOL? Or do you just harvest the cash out of the dying Internet access business?''
 All this puts no small amount of pressure on Jonathan Miller, the chief executive of the AOL unit, based in Dulles, Va., to make the latest turnaround strategy work. When he was hired in mid-2002, Mr. Miller talked of a future for AOL as a hub for online shopping and transactions, which he argued was a more reliable business than advertising. 
 But he quickly realized that his principal mission was to stem the rapid defection of AOL subscribers to faster Internet service offered by cable and telephone companies. 
 Mr. Miller spent several years and many hundreds of millions of dollars building a $15-a-month product called AOL for Broadband that included content like music videos and services like antivirus protection, but not the actual Internet access. It succeeded in retaining five million AOL members who might otherwise have canceled their service (and lost their AOL e-mail addresses). But it largely failed to draw new customers.
 So AOL, which virtually invented Internet advertising, has spent more than a year playing catch-up with rivals like Yahoo and MSN. It has just finished replacing its own publishing system so it can take ads in the same standard Internet format as other sites. And Michael Kelly, a longtime Time Warner executive brought in to run ad sales, has started to repair AOL's reputation on Madison Avenue. 
 ''Their sales force is now very focused and very competitive,'' said Greg Smith, executive vice president and director of media practice at Carat Interactive, an online buying agency. ''They are much more willing to work with you.''
 Now those sales efforts are focused on the elaborate Internet portal planned at AOL.com, a site that has been largely used by its paying members to check their e-mail while at work, executives of AOL say. AOL.com will draw much of its content and its tone from the AOL service, with its flashy headlines, big photographs and instant polls. 
 But AOL will not give away those aspects of its paid service that its research shows are most appealing: special features for children with access controls for their parents, Spanish- language pages, protection against viruses and spam, and e-mail addresses at AOL.com. (The free service will offer e-mail at AIM.com.) 
 Of course, AOL's Internet service, which costs $23.90 a month, is facing ever more competition from low-price dial-up providers and even some broadband providers. This week, SBC Communications started offering high-speed Internet service to new customers at $14.95 a month. 
 AOL hopes to leapfrog its rivals by using the latest technology in its new portal, particularly with video. The site will begin public tests this month and should be generally available by the end of the summer. AOL will try to draw traffic to the portal from its assorted free properties, including Netscape, Mapquest, Moviefone and most important, the AOL Instant Messenger chat system. Collectively, those services are used by more than 50 million people a month who are not AOL members. 
 AOL also hopes that by moving its content outside its members-only service, its pages on many subjects, as diverse as musicians and diets, will be indexed by Google and other search engines.
 ''My biggest problem is the walled garden,'' said Mr. Kelly, who runs all of AOL's Web properties in addition to ad sales. ''The world can't see the good stuff we do every day.''
 By sometime next year, if ad dollars are flowing in and investors start to bid up Time Warner shares, the bet will have paid off. 
 If AOL.com is doing well but Time Warner shares are still flat, Mr. Parsons may be interested in selling a partial stake in America Online to the public. This sort of spinout in theory would let investors put an independent value on AOL and allow the online unit to make acquisitions with its own stock.
 The questions will be tougher if Mr. Miller's portal flounders as badly as AOL for Broadband has. 
 If Mr. Parsons is then inclined to sell, not many media or technology companies would have the combination of resources and need to spend $8 billion or more for a shrinking Internet service business. Microsoft is the most logical buyer because it could fold in its own Internet service, but pursuing a business with little growth potential is hardly Microsoft's style. 
 AOL's huge audience, and especially its instant-messaging franchise, would be of some appeal to Yahoo and Google, but such a deal would sharply curtail their earnings growth. Mr. Diller's company, InterActiveCorp, does not shy from complex deals, but Mr. Diller likes to buy things on the cheap and Mr. Parsons does not want to look as if he was taken advantage of. 
 In theory, a private equity firm might be the perfect buyer for a shrinking AOL. Michael Gallant, an analyst with CIBC World Markets, said that AOL's pretax operating profit could well double if a buyer simply wanted to cut marketing and product development costs and squeeze every last dollar out of its existing customers. 
 ''The business is easily worth $15 billion in the slash-and-burn scenario,'' he said. 
 Roger McNamee, an experienced technology investor, said that ''seems like an obvious deal-in-waiting, given the disastrous results today.'' Still, he said, the financing for an AOL buyout would be tricky. 
 In the end, he said, ''AOL is worth more to Time Warner than it is to a private equity firm.''

HEADLINE: Last Defense Witness Testifies in Federal Tobacco Trial

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2 

 BODY:
After eight months, hundreds of witnesses, thousands of documents and hundreds of millions of dollars in costs, testimony in the government's conspiracy case against the nation's leading tobacco companies ended on Thursday as the defense called a final witness. 
 Before leaving federal court for the day, government lawyers told Judge Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court that they would know on Friday whether they would seek to offer a short rebuttal, which might involve a few more witnesses.
 Judge Kessler, who is hearing the nonjury trial, has told both sides she would like closing arguments next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. She is giving each side six and a half hours for their final remarks. Keeping that schedule would not be possible if she allowed more witnesses. 
 In any event, lawyers for both sides said on Thursday that they would be prepared to proceed with their summations next week. David Bernick, a lawyer for the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, a unit of Reynolds American, said he spent part of the day writing an outline for his closing, even as the final witness, Dennis W. Carlton, a University of Chicago professor who is an industrial economics consultant, testified.
 Along with Reynolds, the defendants in the lawsuit are Philip Morris and its parent, Altria Group; British American Tobacco; Lorillard Tobacco; Liggett Group; Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A.; and the Tobacco Institute. 
 The companies could be forced to pay billions of dollars if Judge Kessler agrees that they have engaged in fraud for more than 50 years, hiding the adverse health effects of smoking, as the government contends. If the judge rules for the tobacco companies, the Justice Department will lose an investment of more than $130 million and six years spent preparing for and prosecuting the case.
 Testimony during much of the trial has focused on the liability phase, as the government has tried to prove that the companies acted in such a way to violate civil racketeering laws. That would require proof that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy; that a separate enterprise carried out the conspiracy; and that any remedies be forward-looking, intended to prevent and restrain any future misconduct.
 The last few weeks have been devoted to establishing appropriate remedies, should Judge Kessler decide that the government has proved its case. This, in effect, is the money phase, despite an appellate court's ruling in February that the government's effort to seek $280 billion in past company profits did not comply with the provision about forward-looking remedies.
 A series of experts in tobacco economics have testified. Government witnesses have argued for national programs to help reduce smoking that would cost the companies billions of dollars to support. Company witnesses have contended that none of the programs would satisfy the racketeering statutes, and, as Mr. Carlton testified, that a simple court injunction would have a greater effect in restraining the companies.
 Mr. Carlton, who said he earns millions of dollars a year as a consultant and witness, spent much of the day being questioned by Renee Brooker, a Justice Department lawyer.
 Mr. Carlton said he believed the remedies offered by four government witnesses were all flawed -- by not addressing specific misconduct on the part of the companies; by not showing how they could prevent misconduct; and by not addressing ''potentially adverse effects'' a remedy might have on competition. 
 Ms. Brooker tried to demonstrate that Mr. Carlton had only superficial understanding of the experts' work. He admitted that he had limited knowledge of a number of peer-reviewed studies that tended to support the remedies that the government witnesses had proposed.
 The lawyers also wrangled over Mr. Carlton's suggestion that if the companies raised the prices of their most popular brands to help offset the financial impact of remedies, it might ''have the perverse effect of actually increasing smoking,'' especially by young people.
 Customarily, as prices rise, consumption falls, but that is not necessarily true when it comes to cigarettes, Mr. Carlton said. ''If the price goes up as a result of a remedy,'' he said, ''some youths are going to switch to discount cigarettes and, therefore, they could smoke more.''

HEADLINE: European Union Leaders Seek to Calm Nerves After 2 Defeats

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and PAUL MELLER; Mark Landler reported from Frankfurt for this article and Paul Meller from Brussels.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, June 2 

 BODY:
European leaders have not properly explained to their people why their countries need radical economic change, two top European officials said a day after the European Union was tipped into crisis by the second rejection of its proposed constitution.
 The European commissioner for economic affairs, Joaquin Almunia, attributed the hostility of voters in France and the Netherlands, who rejected the constitution by wide margins on Sunday and Wednesday, to a basic communications gap between the public and its leaders.
 ''Some of the leaders have adopted very important reforms,'' Mr. Almunia said in an interview here. ''But public opinion has not received a clear explanation of why the reforms are necessary, and why you can expect that in a normal period of time, there will be positive results.'' 
 The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, echoed that sentiment at a news conference in Frankfurt, saying that Europe's governing elite faced a ''pedagogic challenge.'' 
 ''We have to explain as well as possible to the people of Europe that we all would be better off,'' he said after announcing that the bank had left its benchmark interest rate unchanged.
 With the political future of the European Union in some disarray, Mr. Trichet and Mr. Almunia were trying to fill a potential vacuum: reassuring people and companies, as well as foreign investors, that the Continent's economic integration -- symbolized by its common currency, the euro -- remained on track.
 Both dismissed as absurd suggestions that the monetary union might rupture as a result of the ''no'' votes.
 ''The single currency and the monetary union is a reality that will last forever,'' Mr. Almunia said. Mr. Trichet said a breakup was as plausible as California or Alaska abandoning the dollar.
 The euro stabilized against the dollar in trading on Thursday, settling in New York at $1.2273. That snapped a three-day drop that had knocked off 3 percent of its value since the French referendum on Sunday.
 Few economists express fear that the euro will crumble anytime soon. But the European Commission, the European Union's day-to-day executive arm, which is responsible for enforcing fiscal discipline in the 12-nation euro zone, faces a difficult task in maintaining the momentum for change in this environment.
 David Brown, chief European fixed-income economist at Bear Stearns in London, commented, ''With consumer and business confidence on the ropes, German economic growth hitting a brick wall, the French recovery stalling and Italy in recession, Europe appears to be on its knees.'' 
 Mr. Almunia said he was confident that European leaders would recommit themselves to the Stability and Growth Pact, the agreement that limits national budget deficits of European Union members. Half the euro zone's nations are violating the pact, which has been watered down.
 He said the French and Dutch ''no'' votes reflected a mixture of grievances, some domestic and political rather than economic. But the European struggle to be competitive in a global economy -- a process that has led to calls for cutbacks in generous social welfare systems -- was clearly a central issue.
 If there is a lesson to be learned from the antipathy of the voters, Mr. Almunia said, it is that people need to see a long-term economic gain in return for accepting short-term pain.
 Referring to Germany, where changes in the labor market have been deeply unpopular, he said, ''It's very difficult to reap all the results of the reforms that were needed in a couple of years.'' 
 A question is whether politicians will react to the latest eruption of public anger by abandoning market-oriented change. After losing a state election last month, largely because of his labor measures, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder moved up Germany's national elections to September.
 Mr. Schroder's conservative challenger, Angela Merkel, is thought to have free-market instincts. But with a comfortable lead over the chancellor in the polls, she has not felt obliged to offer details of how she might overhaul Germany's labor market or health care system.
 In France, the prospect for big changes dimmed, after President Jacques Chirac appointed the former foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, as prime minister, replacing Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
 Mr. de Villepin, analysts said, is likely to embrace protectionist policies to mollify voters angry at France's high unemployment and scared by what they see as an influx of cheap labor from Eastern Europe.
 ''Classical national response mechanisms are asserting themselves,'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies.
 Mr. Gros said there was a dangerous divergence in the economies of European countries, with some -- notably Italy and Portugal -- losing export competitiveness and running big budget deficits. As growth in these countries falters, he said, their governments will feel tempted to loosen public finances further, which could undercut the stability of the monetary union.
 ''We face an era of inter-European trouble,'' Mr. Gros added. ''The one person who can provide an anchor is Trichet.''
 So far, the central bank has resisted pressure to loosen its monetary policy. While Mr. Trichet acknowledged that European economies had slowed markedly, he said the conditions did not warrant a change in rates, which have remained at 2 percent for two years.

HEADLINE: If It Feels Like Las Vegas, It Must Be Atlantic City

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLL

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
When she came to Atlantic City for the Memorial Day weekend, gambling was not the first thing on Marianela Jove's mind. It was not the second, third or fourth thing, either.
 ''First thing I did was go shopping,'' Ms. Jove, 30, of Bloomfield, N.J., said while drinking her second mojito of the evening and smoking a cigar. ''Now it's drinks, then a good dinner and dancing at a club. Maybe I'll hit the tables after all that.'' 
 She is one of a growing number of 20- and 30-somethings who are coming to Atlantic City as its 12 casinos reach out to younger people with disposable incomes who want to do more than just play slots and table games.
 In doing so, Atlantic City is taking its cue from Las Vegas -- a popular destination for young and old -- where the city's casinos pull in about $4 billion annually from nongaming sources like restaurants, shows and retail stores. That is compared with about $400 million a year in Atlantic City. 
 Atlantic City wants to get in on the action. In late 2003, the city's slogan was changed from ''America's Favorite Playground'' to ''Always Turned On,'' a less-than-subtle wink and nod to the many happenings around town.
 ''Atlantic City is really popping, it is the epicenter of the Jersey Shore, and if the city does well, you'll see the ripple effect up and down the shore,'' said Curtis J. Bashaw, the executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, which predicts that $5 billion will be spent on new and expanded hotels, restaurants and retail space here over the next five years.
 And, as Ms. Jove discovered, in its new incarnation, Atlantic City is no longer just about gambling.
 High-end stores like Brooks Brothers, Burberry and Louis Vuitton have set up shop or plan to within the year. Restaurants like Red Square at the Tropicana Casino and Resort, complete with a 12-feet-tall statue of Lenin at the front door, serve $200 caviar appetizers and Kurobuta pork and give vodka drinkers a choice of more than 100 brands on a frozen bar.
 At Brulee, a dessert restaurant at the Tropicana, those who won big at the casino -- or have cash to spare -- can indulge in a $1,000 chocolate hazelnut brownie topped with gold leaves and served with a 1996 Quinta do Noval port served inside a St. Louis crystal atomizer. So far the restaurant has only served one.
 ''That was an exciting night,'' said the pastry chef Jemal Edwards. 
 This new Atlantic City can be hard to imagine, given the 11-square-mile city's image as run-down, economically depressed and the daily destination of hundreds of buses carrying elderly day-trippers who spend hours at the slots. 
 Even competitors agree that the youth revolution taking place here began with the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa. When it opened its doors less than two years ago, the Borgata immediately separated itself from the pack. It discouraged children as guests, offered high-end boutiques, set up dance clubs on the casino floor, courted top entertainment and installed showers for two in each guest room.
 ''When the Borgata opened, it was a ray of light that Atlantic City needed,'' said Barry Gutin, who owns parts of several restaurants in the city. ''Now, because of them, there is a flood of light and you can see the city changing, becoming younger.''
 Seeing that the Borgata's formula worked, the other casinos are following suit. Resorts, the first casino here in 1978, recently opened its new tower, where rooms are equipped with large showers, and door signs forgo the traditional ''do not disturb'' with the more provocative ''rendezvous in progress.'' 
 Resorts made its first major step last weekend into the youth arena when it opened a 64,000-square-foot concert site and nightclub on the sand. Nikki Beach, part of a Miami-based chain of nightclubs, offers patrons a chance to rent canopy beds for $100, then pay for bottle service with the liquor starting at about $150 and going as high as $800.
 ''It's all about image,'' said Mike Penrod, the owner of Nikki Beach. ''We want young, good-looking people who care about fitness and fashion to come here. It's not what Atlantic City seems to be used to, but that will change.'' 
 Mr. Penrod said bouncers at the club's entrance would have an eye for the look the club wants to maintain. Those who do not have ''it'' will probably not be allowed inside. 
 Eric Franco, 31, and Dafne Karatzas, 29, arrived from Queens and happened upon the club in the early afternoon. They wound up spending more than seven hours lounging on a ''sun bed'' drinking Coronas and eating fresh fruit.
 ''If they keep adding stuff like this there won't be a need for Vegas,'' Mr. Franco said.
 The club, however, did not take off in the way owners and organizers had hoped. First, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection levied a $50,000 fine against the club because it opened without formal authorization on its beachfront permit. Then, an opening-night party with acts like Blue Oyster Cult and Lou Gramm of the rock group Foreigner drew only about 125 people. The next night, when the rapper Ja Rule took the stage about 11:30, only about 350 people were in the audience, making the site, which can hold more than 3,000, feel empty.
 The scene at the opposite end of the boardwalk was much different. At the Quarter, a 200,000-square-foot entertainment complex that has a Vegas feel and a $275 million price tag, people were lined up at 2 a.m. to pay a $20 cover charge to get into several nightclubs that rock until the sun comes up. 
 ''It's no longer like A.C. circa 1980 when people would go out in sweatpants,'' said Maureen Siman, a Tropicana spokeswoman. ''It's a new A.C.''
 Even veteran customers like Tom Omensetter, 77, of Philadelphia, were impressed.
 ''I don't mind the changes, change is good,'' he said. ''Just as long as they keep the games, I'll be happy.''

HEADLINE: Japan Squeezes To Get the Most Of Costly Fuel

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; Petra Kappl contributing reporting for this article from Frankfurt, Wayne Arnold from Singapore and Alyssa Lau from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 3 

 BODY:
Surging oil prices and growing concerns about meeting targets to cut greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels have revived efforts around the world to improve energy efficiency. But perhaps nowhere is the interest greater than here in Japan.
 Even though Japan is already among the most frugal countries in the world, the government recently introduced a national campaign, urging the Japanese to replace their older appliances and buy hybrid vehicles, all part of a patriotic effort to save energy and fight global warming. And big companies are jumping on the bandwagon, counting on the moves to increase sales of their latest models.
 On the Matsushita appliance showroom floor these days, the numbers scream not the low, low yen prices, but the low, low kilowatt-hours. 
 A vacuum-insulated refrigerator, which comes with a buzzer if the door stays open more than 30 seconds, boasts that it will use 160 kilowatt-hours a year, one-eighth of that needed by standard models a decade ago. An air-conditioner with a robotic dust filter cleaner proclaims it uses 884 kilowatt-hours, less than half of what decade-old ones consumed.
 ''It's like squeezing a dry towel'' for the last few drips, said Katsumi Tomita, an environmental planner for the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, maker of the Panasonic brand and known for its attention to energy efficiency. ''The honest feeling of Japanese people is, 'How can we do more?'''
 A number of other affluent countries with few domestic energy resources of their own are responding in similar ways.
 In Germany, where heating accounts for the largest share of home energy use, a new energy saving law has as its standard the ''seven-liter house,'' designed to use just seven liters of oil to heat one square meter for a year, about one-third the amount consumed by a house built in 1973, before the first oil price shock. Three-liter houses -- even one-liter designs -- are now being built.
 In Singapore, where year-round air-conditioning often accounts for 60 percent of a building's power bill, new codes are encouraging the use of things like heat-blocking window films and hookups to neighborhood cooling systems, where water is chilled overnight.
 In Hong Kong, many more buildings now have ''intelligent'' elevator systems in which computers minimize unnecessary stops. Parking restrictions encourage bus and rail transit, and authorities are also pushing hybrid cars equipped with engines that shut down when idling.
 Other countries, including the United States, the world's largest energy consumer by far, have lagged behind, but even American consumers are starting to turn their backs on big sport utility vehicles and looking at more fuel-efficient cars in response to higher gasoline prices. 
 But Japan is where energy consciousness probably reaches the highest levels. The country has the world's second-largest economy, but it produces virtually no oil or gas, importing 96 percent of its energy needs.
 This dependence on imports has prodded the nation into tremendous achievements in improved efficiency. France and Germany, where government crusades against global warming have become increasingly loud, expend almost 50 percent more energy to produce the equivalent of $1 in economic activity. Britain's energy use, on the same measure, is nearly double; the United States nearly triple; and China almost eight times as much.
 From 1973 to today, Japan's industrial sector nearly tripled its output, but kept its energy consumption roughly flat. To produce the same industrial output as Japan, China consumes 11.5 times the energy.
 At JFE Holdings, Japan's second-largest steel company, plastic pellets made from recycled bottles now account for 10 percent of fuel in the main blast furnaces, reducing reliance on imported coal. Japanese paper mills are investing heavily in boilers that can be fueled by waste paper, wood and plastic. Within two years, half of the electricity used in the nation's paper mills is to come from burning waste.
 Many easy steps were taken after the oil shocks of the 1970's. Now Japan is embarking on a new phase. Billions of dollars are being invested to reach a 2012 target of reducing Japan's emission of global warming gases to 6 percent below the 1990 level. These gases are released by burning oil, coal, and, to a lesser extent, natural gas -- sources for about 81 percent of Japan's energy.
 As host nation for the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases, Japan takes its commitment seriously. But it faces a big challenge. Figures released last month show Japan was 8.3 percent over the 1990 level for the fiscal year ended March 2004.
 ''We are now at the stage where we only save energy by investing in equipment,'' Mr. Tomita said of Matsushita's effort. ''If we can collect money in three years, we invest.''
 With the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, introducing its national campaign two months ago to meet the Kyoto targets, business is booming for energy service companies and consultants who advise companies on cutting energy bills.
 But Japan's flattening of industrial energy consumption has not been matched in the transportation and residential sectors, where energy consumption has more than doubled since 1973, roughly pacing Japan's economic growth over the period. 
 Japan may be a mass transit nation, but now there is also a car for almost every Japanese household. Since 1970, the number of buses in Japan increased 23 percent, the number of trucks doubled, and the number of passenger cars increased more than sixfold, to 56 million.
 With personal use accounting for the bulk of April's $6.4 billion bill for imported oil, Tokyo is trying to encourage greater efficiency by pushing fuel taxes even higher, lifting the pump price for gasoline to $4.70 a gallon, the highest in a decade.
 During the 1990's, Japan's average fuel consumption per mile fell 13 percent. But since then, with more Japanese driving bigger cars, fuel efficiency growth has stalled. 
 Japan finds hope in the history of its refrigerators, which have doubled in size since 1981 as their energy use per liter has plunged 80 percent.
 In hopes of working the same engineering magic on cars, Japan has extended its minicar tax breaks to hybrid cars -- fuel-efficient vehicles that rely on a combination of a gasoline engine and an electric motor. Hybrid sales, while still relatively low in Japan, are growing fast. And in this environment, Toyota and Honda have become the world leaders in hybrid technology.
 ''We're entering the age of hybrid automobiles,'' Hiroyuki Watanabe, Toyota's senior managing director for environmental affairs, recently told journalists at the 2005 World Exposition Aichi, in Nagoya. ''I want every car to have a hybrid engine.''
 The next energy-savings battleground is the home front. 
 After $1.3 billion in subsidies, about 160,000 homes have solar power systems. Solar power remains two to three times as expensive as the electricity supplied to households. But homeowners say that with time, the ''free'' electricity pays for the high installation costs. And the government is willing to devote taxes to the effort, preferring to spur rural employment through solar power installations to help reduce payments for foreign oil, coal and gas.
 Although residential subsidies may be phased out, a Japanese government plan calls for increasing solar power generation 15-fold during this decade. 
 Japanese companies, notably Sharp, Kyocera, Mitsubishi and Sanyo, produce about half the world's photovoltaic solar panels, a roughly $10-billion-a-year market. With large commercial projects like a 4,740-panel generator going online at a filtration plant in Nara last month, Japan produces more than the combined total of the next biggest, Germany and the United States.
 Prime Minister Koizumi is a political conservative who believes that saving oil starts at home. Visitors to his official residence here walk past a boxy hydrogen fuel-cell generator, a prototype installed by Matsushita in April to power the residence and educate the nation's leadership.
 ''Fuel cells are the key to the door of a new era in which we utilize hydrogen as an energy source,'' Mr. Koizumi told Parliament in 2002. ''We intend to put them into practical use within three years, either as power sources for automobiles or households.''
 His government has set goals for cutting power consumption even further for the four main household appliances: televisions, 17 percent; personal computers, 30 percent; air- conditioners, 36 percent; and refrigerators, 72 percent. Engineers have been attacking the problem of the power used by appliances on standby, a drainage that can account for 5 percent to 10 percent of a household's energy consumption. 
 Still, while energy efficiency is seen as a patriotic act, many consumers in Japan are reluctant to part with working appliances, made with the Japanese ingenuity and attention to detail that ensure they will last for decades. 
 ''The problem we are facing is over how much we induce consumers to trade in their appliances for more energy-efficient ones,'' Hajimi Sasaki, chairman of the NEC Corporation, a major appliance maker, said in April at a news conference billed as ''Proposals Aimed at Overcoming Global Warming.''
 ''I drive a hybrid car, and last fall I put heat-cutting film on some of our windows,'' he said. ''And I intend to buy a new refrigerator.''

HEADLINE: Pickled Piglets and Other Curiosities, in Exile

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

DATELINE: SEYMOUR, Conn. 

 BODY:
It's getting hard for an honest freak to make a living in New York. This is both a cultural and economic fact.
 It is also the plight of Johnny Fox, a professional sword swallower and expert in sleight of hand, who until this winter was the impresario behind the Freakatorium, a museum of sideshow curiosities at 57 Clinton Street on the Lower East Side.
 In January, Mr. Fox's rent went up and he had to close. Now he has moved his wonders to a farmhouse in Connecticut where the only thing they collect these days is dust. 
 His narwhal tusks stand in the attic near a loose pile of taxidermic heads. His elephant's-foot liquor chest sits in the living room, seen by no one but himself.
 His two-headed turtle lives downstairs in the basement with a sleepy boa constrictor. Out in the garage -- forgotten -- are Tom Thumb's vest and Sammy Davis Jr.'s glass eye.
 ''I'd love for this stuff to be in New York,'' said Mr. Fox, a sinewy and black-haired man of 52. ''New York needs this kind of stuff, but who supports it anymore?''
 It is a hard question to answer. Mr. Fox discovered that his Freakatorium was not the tourist destination he had hoped it would be. Even with its relatively modest $5 admission fee, it drew only 5 to 15 visitors a day. 
 When his rent increased in January to $2,400, more than double what he was paying when he opened in 1999, he could no longer make ends meet. Worse yet, it seems his collection is out of step in the current culture of New York. He has tried his best to find a new location, but has so far had no luck.
 He was turned away by the owner of a 42nd Street video arcade and made to feel unwelcome at the smut shops. No theater will permit him to set up his collection in its lobby. There have been no takers for his offers, no answer to his pleas.
 He has even thought of changing the roguish name of his establishment to cater to a different clientele.
 ''I figured we could call it the Chamber of Wonders, not the Freak-atorium,'' he said. ''Freak sometimes has a stigma to it. We could do something family-inviting.'' 
 Even at its height, the Freakatorium was never meant to be a profit center. It was rather Mr. Fox's chance to earn a living while sharing his obsessions with the world.
 Those obsessions, he points out, began in childhood when he used to watch his uncle entertain the family with gruesome party tricks like sticking needles into his thumb. At age 10, he said, he used to come down from the family home near Hartford to visit an aunt in New York and spend long afternoons at Hubert's Museum on 42nd Street to gape in awe at the flea circus and the freaks.
 His own initiation to the sideshow arts began in the late 1970's when, after several lean years performing magic tricks in restaurants and bars, he met the great Tony Slydini, an Italian sleight-of-hand artist known in magicians' circles as the Master of Misdirection. Mr. Slydini, who came to New York City after decades on the vaudeville circuit in Argentina, helped Mr. Fox perfect his coin tricks and his use of cup and ball. 
 A magic act was quickly put together, centered on the swallowing of swords. Mr. Fox claims to have swallowed 16 -- a record, he says. He used to eat fire, too, until he learned that the chemicals seeped into one's liver.
 ''No good,'' he stoically explained.
 These days, as his pickled conjoined piglets sit in storage, Mr. Fox busies himself with a series of jobs that are literally odd. He swallows swords at arts and music festivals across the country. He works at tattoo conventions. He even takes the occasional consulting job, advising fellow artists on the proper way to eat sabers or hang themselves from hooks.
 He has also taken on a curiously domestic project for a sideshow performer -- restoring his house. There is, after all, wainscoting to install on the staircase and a claw-foot tub to put in the bathroom down the hall.
 Still, in the back of his head, there remains the dream of reopening the Freakatorium. It does no one any good if the carvings lovingly made by the feet of Charles Tripp, the Armless Wonder, gather cobwebs on a lonely basement shelf.
 He has occasional thoughts of taking his collection on the road, packing up the shrunken heads and furry fish and heading off to Mexico. But he has a deep conviction that his curiosities are essentially a New York phenomenon. As Mr. Fox explains, there is a long tradition of freakdom in New York. 
 He sees himself, in fact, as a distant heir to men like John Scudder, who in the early 19th century opened Scudder's American Museum on lower Broadway as New York's first public showplace for the fantastic and absurd. In 1841, Mr. Fox says, Phineas T. Barnum bought the place and established his own museum with everything from bearded ladies to educated seals.
 Mr. Fox wants to continue in that vein, wants to teach New Yorkers that the comic book and cartoon heroes they grew up with are, in fact, direct descendants of early freaks like the Sacred Hairy Family of Burma or JoJo the Dogface Boy.
 ''I want to let people see that the characters they love are not just concocted,'' he said. 
 But such ambitions require two things New York tends to keep to itself: real estate and money. 
 ''If a guy like me wants to give something to the city, all I need is someone to say: 'Hey, I like what you're doing. This is something that the city really needs.'''
 Mr. Fox was downstairs in the basement with boxes that were labeled ''head-hunter carvings,'' ''freak posters (small)'' and ''neoprene suit.''
 He paused for a moment and glanced around the room.
 ''Of course,'' he said, ''I haven't found that person yet.''

HEADLINE: St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn Is to Close After Years of Losses

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA; Matthew Sweeney contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The last Roman Catholic hospital in Brooklyn, St. Mary's, announced yesterday that it planned to close after years of heavy financial losses, the latest casualty in New York State's shrinking hospital industry. 
 St. Mary's, which serves many poor and uninsured patients in Bedford-Stuyvesant, is the third hospital controlled by the St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Centers to close in a little over a year. Its future had long been in doubt. Over the past three years, St. Vincent's gave St. Mary's $62 million just to cover operating costs, and in the first four months of this year, the hospital had an estimated $3.6 million operating loss, St. Vincent's officials said. 
 Roughly 930 of the hospital's 1,100 employees will lose their jobs, the officials said. Leaders of New York's main health care worker's union, 1199/S.E.I.U., said they were troubled by the closing and pledged to help find new jobs for the workers.
 The hospital, which has about 250 beds, plans to keep open some outpatient clinics.
 Bernadette Kingham-Bev, a senior vice president at St. Vincent's, said the decision to close the hospital was made only after every alternative had been explored. She said St. Vincent's had been negotiating with Kingsbrook HealthCare System, which runs a nearby hospital, to absorb St. Mary's into its operations. But those talks foundered when an analysis showed that St. Mary's would need $10 million annually to cover operating losses and capital needs.
 For the neighborhood, the impact of the closing is most likely to be felt in urgent care. Last year, St. Mary's had about 36,000 emergency room visits, compared with 10,500 overnight stays by patients. Such a pattern is not unusual in neighborhoods with large uninsured populations where people turn to emergency rooms for all their health needs. But it proved economically unsustainable for the hospital, because a large proportion of patients were unable to pay for their care. 
 In the past week, only 10 operations were performed on patients who were staying in the hospital, a very small number considering the cost of staffing and equipping operating rooms.
 Ms. Kingham-Bev said St. Vincent's was working with state officials and other hospitals to ensure that the emergency care needs of the community would be met, although no solution had been found. 
 James R. Tallon Jr., the president of the United Hospital Fund, a Manhattan-based philanthropic and research group, said the closing of St. Mary's was another example of the difficult and unaddressed challenges facing the state's hospital system.
 ''Can its loss be accommodated by other facilities?'' Mr. Tallon asked. ''Probably yes. But there is a broader chronic financing problem of those kind of hospitals.'' 
 This week, Gov. George E. Pataki announced appointments to a committee that is charged with identifying hospitals that are the best candidates for closing as a way of restoring financial stability to the industry.
 New York state hospitals have lost money for each of the last five years, leading to a rare consensus among industry leaders and politicians that something needs to be done. Before St. Mary's announced its closing, 12 other state hospitals had shut down in the past 27 months and more are expected to close in the coming year.
 However, Mr. Tallon said closing hospitals and lowering the number of beds was not enough to restore the hospitals to financial stability.
 ''I think we are at the early stages, because we are still asking the bed- closing question,'' he said. ''But you don't get to a solution until we get inside the broader question of how hospitals are paid, how much they are paid and for what services they are paid.''
 In the meantime, he said, poor and uninsured communities are likely to suffer the most. 
 Last night, outside St. Mary's, which is 123 years old, workers expressed sadness and anger. ''It's depressing,'' said Mary Adderley, 60, an administrator who has worked at St. Mary's since 1966.

HEADLINE: Help! My A.R.M. Is Moving

BYLINE: By M.P. Dunleavey. 
M.P. Dunleavey writes about personal finance for MSN Money.

 BODY:
WHEN I bought my house a few years ago, I did not have enough for a 20 percent down payment. The nice man at my lending institution recommended what is called an 80-15-5: taking out an 80 percent mortgage and a 15 percent home equity loan, and putting down 5 percent in cash. 
 Voila! Who knew it could be so easy to buy a house? I signed lots of papers but did not read them closely. For a while everything was fine. Sure, making two monthly payments instead of one was a bother, but it seemed a small price to pay for the privilege of owning a home. Then, recently, I noticed that the price of that privilege was rising. The interest rate on the second loan, a happy 5.5 percent a year ago, is now an ominous 8 percent. 
 Yes, I knew I had two different loans, and that one was fixed for 30 years, whereas the home equity line of credit -- which the nice man called a Heloc-- was not. I guess I never connected all the dots, or the percentage points for that matter. Maybe I imagined that the proximity of the larger, fixed loan would be a stabilizing influence on the little Heloc. Boy, was I wrong. Little Heloc, now looming larger every day, comes from a place I had not paid much attention to -- the slippery world of adjustable-rate loans.
 While adjustable-rate loans are increasingly popular, they are mind-numbingly complex. Diane St. James, a mortgage counselor in Allentown, Pa., runs a business just helping people sort through the options. While she points out that adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.'s, are ideal for some, ''there are many people who don't understand what they're getting into.''
 No wonder. If you think particle physics is complicated, try asking your lender to explain how an adjustable-rate loan works. Quarks and gluons have nothing on the proliferating breed of hybrid A.R.M.'s, option A.R.M.'s, interest-only A.R.M.'s and something from another galaxy called a Libor A.R.M. (It's actually an A.R.M. with a British accent, and is based on the London interbank offered rate.) 
 The immediate appeal for borrowers is that A.R.M.'s and their ilk have much lower monthly payments than fixed-rate loans, at least to start. Given the soaring cost of real estate -- the median resale price of a house in the United States reached a record $206,000 in April -- these loans have become wildly popular.
 According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, A.R.M.'s made up a third of all new mortgages at the end of 2004, compared with less than 5 percent in 1990. Home equity borrowing also jumped by 80 percent, from $492 billion in 2000 to $881 billion in 2004, according to the Federal Reserve.
 ON one level, this is just supply and demand doing their thing. As Javier Silva, senior research associate at Demos, a research and advocacy group, explained: ''Prices have gone up so high that a lot of people can't afford to get into the market -- so lenders have responded with these products,'' he said, stressing the popular loan world euphemism. Today, there are over a hundred of these multilayered products, many of them adjustable rate, he added, ''but all they do is lower the monthly payment; they don't lower the cost of the mortgage.'' 
 That fact is often not obvious to borrowers until they find themselves stuck with some unpleasant realities. Take me, for example. The terms of my home equity loan are a nightmare. With my head in the clouds of homeownership, I've now learned, I signed up for a loan with a rate that is pegged to prime plus 2 percent, and that can keep rising until it reaches a cap of 18 percent.
 Even sweeter, all the payments I've been making have been interest only -- which means that at the end of the 10-year term, I'll still owe the roughly $14,000 that I borrowed in the first place. Oh, and I can't replace it with a lower-rate loan without a $500 prepayment penalty.
 Federal regulators are worried enough about how lax terms for loans have become that in May they released new guidelines to restrict home-equity borrowing. They plan to tighten the criteria for new mortgages soon as well. 
 That's great, but someone should pay for a series of public service announcements: the Borrower Beware campaign. After going around in circles with various banks trying to find a way out of my Heloc, what did my lender suggest? That I could get a better rate by borrowing an extra $12,000. That would leverage me up to 90 percent of the current inflated value of my home. For a minute, I actually considered it.

HEADLINE: Hiring Brakes Sharply After Big April Gains

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3 

 BODY:
Job creation slowed to a crawl in May, the Labor Department estimated on Friday, but the unemployment rate edged down to its lowest point since September 2001. 
 The nation added 78,000 jobs in May, about half the pace of the previous three months and the smallest monthly increase in nearly two years. 
 The report, weaker than most Wall Street analysts expected, rekindled talk of an economic slowdown, as well as speculation that the Federal Reserve may stop raising interest rates sooner than anticipated. 
 But analysts cautioned that the month-to-month job numbers often bounce wildly and are much less meaningful than the average pace over six months or a year. 
 The reluctance to hire in May was partly a rebound from the torrid pace in April, when employers added 274,000 people to their payrolls. 
 ''The economy has slowed from its strong pace, but the data have been so strange and volatile that it is unclear what its true condition is,'' said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. 
 Over the last year, the nation has added an average of 180,000 jobs a month. That has slowed to about 158,000 jobs a month since February, a trend that economists say is in line with other indicators of slower but continued economic growth. 
 If anything, the report highlighted the erratic and often sluggish job growth. Last month was the first time that the number of private-sector jobs rebounded to exceed the number that existed when the recession began in March 2001. 
 ''Underlying the jagged nature of monthly job growth over recent months is employers' unwillingness to shed their caution regarding the strength of the recovery,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center research group in Washington.
 Job growth stalled in retailing; temporary-help agencies; leisure services; and business and professional services -- all areas that had been big sources of new employment over the last year. 
 Manufacturing companies shed another 7,000 jobs in May, and have eliminated 67,000 jobs since August. The results highlighted what has apparently become a permanent decline in factory employment as a result of rising productivity and increased outsourcing of production to low-wage countries. 
 Manufacturers have sharply scaled back expectations, partly in response to problems at General Motors and Ford Motor. The Institute for Supply Management's monthly barometer of manufacturing activity dropped in May to its lowest level in two years and is close to a level associated with a contraction in production. 
 Only a few industries added significant numbers of workers. One was health care, a sector that has been expanding faster than the overall economy for years. It added 26,000 jobs in May. 
 The other big area was home construction, which added 20,000 jobs and provided further evidence of the economy's dependence on a housing boom. 
 ''Companies are unsure, and they are taking a breather with the labor market,'' said Jeffrey A. Joerres, chairman and chief executive of Manpower, the temporary-help company, based in Milwaukee. ''When they want to clamp down because of a soft patch, they can do it in three to four days.'' 
 But there were other indicators that the labor market continued to expand. The unemployment rate edged down to 5.1 percent in May from 5.2 percent in April, even as greater numbers of people entered the work force. 
 The Labor Department's other measure of job growth -- the household survey, which is based on interviews at about 60,000 homes -- showed a surge of 360,000 jobs in May and nearly 600,000 jobs in April. 
 Most analysts, including those at the Federal Reserve, consider the household survey less reliable than the so-called establishment survey, which is based on data from 400,000 work sites. 
 Hourly wages for production and nonsupervisory workers climbed about 3 cents an hour, to $16.03. They have risen about 2.6 percent in the last year. 
 That was less than the rate of inflation, suggesting that workers still have limited bargaining power. But overall employment costs are rising more rapidly, partly because of rising costs for health insurance and other benefits and partly because of increased hiring. 
 On Thursday, the Labor Department estimated that unit labor costs, the cost of labor to produce a dollar's worth of production, increased 3.3 percent in the first quarter. 
 ''When you peer through the fog of volatility in these data, the labor markets are continuing to improve,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. ''The economy is fine.'' 
 Despite the unexpected hint of economic weakness, analysts said the jobs report was unlikely to affect the Federal Reserve's strategy of gradually raising short-term interest rates. 
 The Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to 3 percent from 1 percent since June 2004, and it is all but certain to raise the rate another quarter-point at its next policy meeting, on June 30. 
 But most Fed officials have continued to signal that interest rates are still below the ''neutral'' level that would prevent a resurgence of inflation. 
 Consumer prices, excluding food and energy, have climbed slightly more than 2 percent in the last year. Perhaps more important, employment costs have risen sharply, largely because of higher costs for employee health insurance. 
 Fed officials consider labor costs an important indicator of looming inflation, and they have made it clear that they are more worried about inflation than about slower economic growth. 
 ''We do not expect Fed officials to alter their broadly upbeat view of the labor market on the basis of this report,'' wrote economists at Goldman Sachs in a note to clients on Friday.

HEADLINE: With Luck, Al Capone Slept Here

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
George Washington may not have slept there, but your house could still be historically significant. It might once have been home to a stalwart suffragist, or perhaps the hideout of an infamous crook. Or maybe the facade is an excellent example of period architecture. 
 Many properties and even entire neighborhoods qualify as local, state or national historic landmarks. And it is probably worth the rigmarole to apply. A historic designation not only lends cachet and a measure of protection against demolition but often confers tax breaks and lifts property value. 
 ''It's not an easy thing to do,'' said Martha Ross, whose home in Long Beach, N.Y., was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March. ''I felt like I was back in high school. I had to write and write and write,'' she said, to document why her 1909 Mediterranean-style house merited recognition.
 Ms. Ross also had to provide reams of source material, like copies of the original deed, photos, old newspaper articles, maps and detailed architectural drawings. Her home was one of the first built in what was then billed as the Riviera of the East by William H. Reynolds, the politician and wheeler-dealer who also developed Coney Island. 
 But Ms. Ross does not regret the countless hours she spent working on her application. ''I can't wait to hang the plaque out so everyone can see,'' she said. ''It's such an honor.''
 It could also preserve her home and increase its value, said Paul Lusignan, a historian with the National Park Service, which administers the National Register. Even without a notifying plaque, he said, ''A listing on the National Register raises public awareness and appreciation, which will make the site harder to alter or destroy and can ultimately make the property more valuable.'' 
 Indeed, studies show that properties that have historic designations appreciate at a faster rate than comparable properties that do not. 
 ''We've seen near universal results that places with an official designation end up with higher property values,'' said Edward Coulson, a professor of economics at Pennsylvania State University. How much higher depends on the locale, but Mr. Coulson said the range is 5 to 20 percent.
 Real estate experts say this is generally true whether the property is listed on the National Register or has an easier-to-come-by state, county or municipal historic designation. A listing on the National Register is usually more difficult to obtain because the proposed structure or neighborhood must have national rather than just regional or local historic significance.
 But while a National Register listing and most state historic designations are strictly honorary, a city listing often obliges the owner to maintain the property and go before a local review board before architectural changes are made. ''The real teeth in terms of preservation are at the city level,'' said Peter H. Brink, senior vice president for programs at the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a private nonprofit advocacy group in Washington. 
 For example, you could legally put neon pink aluminum siding on a house that is on the National Register or is a state historic site, but you would face a stiff fine and perhaps a lawsuit if you did that to a municipal landmark in Galveston, Tex.
 ''As far as the city is concerned, you can't do anything that would destroy the historical context and integrity of the building,'' said Marsh Davis, executive director of the Galveston Historical Foundation, which owns and operates six historic properties there. 
 Such oversight might feel restrictive and intrusive, but it might also lead to a tax break on approved renovations. This is true not only in some 2,000 cities, like Galveston and Cleveland, but also in more than 20 states, like Maryland and Oregon -- provided the appropriate authorities clear the work in advance.
 On the state level, there are no legal repercussions for proceeding with unapproved plans, but any potential tax benefit is forfeited. The incentives are usually in the form of property tax abatements or state income tax credits. If the property is on the National Register and produces income (a duplex qualifies), then up to 20 percent of the cost of the renovation can be deducted from federal income taxes. Moreover, the benefits are not mutually exclusive; the same renovation could potentially qualify for three separate tax breaks.
 Joseph Bruce, an advertising executive in Baltimore, wrote off almost a quarter of the cost of renovating his 1921 home four years ago. Although his house is not individually recognized as historic, it is in a neighborhood called Guilford, which was added to the National Register in 2001. This made him eligible for Maryland's Heritage Preservation Tax Credit Program. 
 Mr. Bruce said he had wanted to modernize the interior of his home for almost a decade and the state income tax benefit was the ''final push that made me go ahead and do it.'' He added that he would not have ''remodeled as extensively'' without the credit. While careful not to change the structural character of the house, Mr. Bruce said he put in central heat and air-conditioning and updated the kitchen and bathroom.
 ''The state authorities were unbelievably realistic during the review process,'' he said. ''They realize that houses have to be modified so you can live as people do today.'' 
 Many people who go to the trouble to have their property recognized as historic have a genuine interest in history and, like Ms. Ross in Long Beach, enjoy displaying a plaque. But many people ''could care less and just tell me to get them the tax credit,'' said Amy McFeeters-Krone, a historian in Portland, Ore., who is often hired to prepare National Register applications. 
 State historic preservation offices can make referrals to consultants and historians who do this kind of work (a directory of state offices can be found at nationaltrust.org/help/statewide--org.asp).
 The cost of researching and completing the paperwork to get a historic designation is $1,000 to $2,500. There is usually no charge to submit the application. 
 A recent trend is to band together, as residents did in Guilford, to have a neighborhood declared a historic district, said Mr. Brink at the National Trust for Historic Preservation. This tends to raise property values in the entire area, even on structures that are less than historic.
 Mr. Bruce in Baltimore said: ''There was some controversy at first about whether we should try to get on the National Register because people were scared it might add new restrictions, but I don't think anyone regrets it now. I'm definitely a happy beneficiary.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Officials Lobby To Preserve Fort Monmouth

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: EATONTOWN, N.J., June 3 

 BODY:
It was New Jersey's chance on Friday to make its case against the closing of Fort Monmouth, but the head of the federal commission reviewing proposed closings offered only the slightest glimmer of hope.
 ''We've heard one perspective,'' said Anthony J. Principi, the chairman of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. ''Now we have to go back to Washington and hear the Pentagon's perspective.''
 On May 13 the Pentagon proposed closing nearly 180 military facilities, including 33 big bases like Fort Monmouth, to save money and improve military efficiency by combining scattered functions into several ''centers of excellence.'' BRAC, as the commission is known, will make its recommendations on the closings to President Bush on Sept. 8. 
 In the meantime, its members are crisscrossing the country, visiting the selected bases and acting as a kind of court of appeals to hear the pleas of state and local officials trying to keep their bases open. The officials also hope to keep the millions in federal dollars flowing into the bases and out to neighboring communities. Fort Monmouth pumps about $1.4 billion into New Jersey each year, according to the Army.
 Commission members recently visited the Groton submarine base in Connecticut on a similar tour, and Mr. Principi, the former federal secretary of veterans affairs, said he would continue his visits throughout the summer.
 Fort Monmouth employs some 5,000 civilians, many of them highly paid engineers engaged in research and development projects, including how to improve batteries in military gear and developing ways to interrupt signals used by terrorists to detonate bombs. Under the Pentagon's plan, those functions are to be shifted to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
 New Jersey officials later argued that Fort Monmouth should be kept open because few of those civilian engineers are thought to be prepared to move to Maryland and the Army will suffer a loss of scientific talent when it is most needed.
 At a news conference here after the tour, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey said he told Mr. Principi ''closing the fort down was the wrong place and the wrong time.'' 
 Mr. Codey added: ''They talk about developing centers of excellence, well, this is a center of excellence, and with all respect, Aberdeen isn't. Because these engineers won't go to Maryland, and the Army will suffer a brain drain when they don't.''
 Maryland's secretary for economic development, Aris Melissaratos, has been just as loudly declaring that Maryland has plenty of engineers to replace any of those at Fort Monmouth who decide to remain in New Jersey. But Mr. Principi seemed to offer a hint of sympathy for the brain-drain argument.
 ''That is part of the data analysis that needs to take place,'' he said. ''In 5 or 10 years you can build that kind of talent base, but in time of war, we don't have that much time.''
 He continued: ''So we have to look at our options. Why is Fort Monmouth moving to Aberdeen, and not Aberdeen to Fort Monmouth?''
 The president and Congress will have the option this fall either to accept all or none of the commission's recommendations. They will not have the equivalent of a line-item veto. In the meantime, politicians who may privately say there is only a small chance Fort Monmouth will be saved rarely miss a chance to speak in defense of its remaining open. 
 Representative Rush Holt, whose district takes in much of Fort Monmouth , praised New Jersey's role in electronics innovation. Speaking of the engineers at the fort, he said, ''If this expertise were lost, it could never be made up.''

HEADLINE: Layoffs at TV & Radio Museum

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
Facing what its chairman called ''difficult financial challenges,'' the Museum of Television & Radio has laid off more than a dozen employees and accepted the resignation of its president, Stuart N. Brotman.
 The layoffs, announced to the staff on Thursday afternoon after a meeting of the museum's board, included 14 full-time employees and one part-time employee. 
Diane Lewis, a spokeswoman for the museum, said the layoffs would affect its operations at both the museum's locations, on West 52nd Street in Manhattan and in Beverly Hills, Calif.
 In a statement released yesterday, Frank A. Bennack Jr., the museum's chairman, said the museum ''reluctantly had to make these adjustments'' in the face of a continuing financial crunch.
 As for Mr. Brotman's resignation after just 15 months on the job, Mr. Bennack thanked him for his efforts and said the museum would conduct a national search for his replacement. Calls to Mr. Brotman's office at the museum and to his consulting business in Lexington, Mass., were not returned, but in a statement, Mr. Brotman said it had been ''an honor and a privilege'' to work for the museum. 
 One fired employee, who would not give her name for fear of jeopardizing her severance package, said the layoffs were painful but not altogether surprising. ''We all knew things were bad,'' she said. ''And then the board just seemed to slash.'' 
 The layoffs are the third in recent years for the museum, founded in 1975 as the Museum of Broadcasting by William S. Paley, the longtime president and chairman of CBS. In 2003 the museum suffered the death of its president, Robert M. Batscha, who had led the museum since 1981. Mr. Brotman was hired in February 2004 and took over the next month.

HEADLINE: Now Playing On Broadway: The Money Pit

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
Now Playing on Much of Broadway: The Money PitIN anticipation of tomorrow night's Tony awards, I saw ''Hurlyburly'' this week, the fine revival of David Rabe's 1984 play, which is playing at well, where it's playing is the whole point. Or at least it is if you're a business columnist and not a theater critic. 
 ''Hurlyburly,'' which stars the movie actor Ethan Hawke, opened January in a small off-Broadway theater, where it got the kind of sweet reviews and packed houses that almost always mean an eventual move to Broadway. But when the play did move, in April, it didn't go to Broadway but to a bigger off-Broadway theater, in a new $28 million complex called 37 ARTS. That means the producers of ''Hurlyburly'' made a conscious decision to opt out of the Tonys, since only shows on Broadway are eligible. But it also signals something important about the increasingly impossible economics of the Broadway theater.
 The producers of ''Hurlyburly'' and the owners of 37 ARTS are Jeffrey B. Seller and Kevin McCollum, two theatrical entrepreneurs who certainly know their way around the Great White Way. Their Broadway production credits include such rousing financial successes as ''Rent'' and ''Avenue Q,'' but they also produced Baz Lurhman's version of ''La Boheme,'' which lost $6 million. 
 Like everyone I spoke to for this column, including theater owners, producers and financial ''angels,'' Mr. Seller and Mr. McCollum spoke passionately about bringing great plays to New York audiences. In talking about their new theater, they stressed art, not commerce.
 ''If you come to our theater you will have a fantastic relationship between audiences and actors,'' Mr. McCollum said.
 But their new theater is very much about the financial realities of Broadway. To wit: ''If you go to Broadway, you will spend a minimum of $2 million before the play is seen by a single audience member,'' Mr. Seller said. ''We think the bill is too high.'' 
 By keeping ''Hurlyburly'' off Broadway, the producers' upfront costs were cut to $650,000; their weekly operating budget of $95,000 is also less than half the budget of even the most barebones Broadway production. But their upside is also limited: because their theater has only 499 seats, ''Hurlyburly'' will never generate the revenue that can be had in a big Broadway theater, most of which have at least 1,000 seats, nor can the show afford the big advertising budget that is part of any Broadway production.
 With ''Hurlyburly,'' Mr. Seller and Mr. McCollum are conducting an experiment, and it may ultimately not work. Although Mr. Seller said he expected it to make a small profit by the time the play closes in July, discounted tickets are being sold at the TKTS Booth in Times Square -- never a good sign. But whether they ultimately succeed or not, at least they're thinking about new business models. Somebody sure needs to.
 VENTURE capitalists love to talk about the high failure rate of the start-ups they finance, but it turns out that venture capitalists have nothing on Broadway producers. ''One play out of 40 recoups its investment,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, one of the three companies that owns 31 of the 40 theaters that constitute Broadway. 
 That is probably an exaggeration. Jed Bernstein, the president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said that it is more on the order of one in five, but even the latter number means the failure rate is 80 percent. (We're going to leave musicals out of this discussion. They cost much more to produce -- upfront costs are usually over $10 million -- but when a musical like ''The Producers'' or ''Spamalot'' hits, it can turn into a genuine cash cow.)
 Theater people have lots of different theories why plays have so much trouble making back their investors' money. Audiences are aging. There is competition from television and movies and every other form of entertainment. Ticket prices, which now routinely reach $100, have put plays out of reach of many middle-income families. And so on.
 But the biggest factor, everyone finally agrees, is the enormous cost of putting a play on Broadway. In a sense, Broadway is a little like the airline industry: its cost structure no longer makes sense, but it's almost impossible to change. Did you know, for instance, that in addition to getting a percentage of the gross and charging rent of $20,000 to $25,000 a week, theater owners also charge every penny of their own overhead to whatever production is playing in their theater -- up to and including the toilet paper? Theater owners can make money even when shows flop.
 Upfront advertising budgets start at $300,000 to $400,000 and go up from there. (The bulk of this money, it must be noted, goes to The New York Times, whose published rate for a full-page color ad in the Arts & Leisure section on Sunday is $105,000.) And then there are the labor costs. Any theater with 500 seats or more has to abide by the most onerous of the contracts theater owners have with the various theatrical unions. 
 That's why some off-Broadway theaters have 499 seats. Take, for instance, something called the ''load in,'' which is the process of setting up the show -- putting up the set and scenery and so forth. Thanks to the contract the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees has with the theater owners, which includes work rules that guarantee lots of overtime, a load-in starts at $200,000 and can run as high as $1 million for some huge productions. By contrast, the ''Hurlyburly'' load-in was a mere $45,000. 
 When I asked people who worked on Broadway whether we were at the point where things might start to change, as they are starting to change in the airline industry, the answer I got was always the same: highly unlikely. Nobody involved has any incentive to change. Right now, for instance, every theater on Broadway is booked for the foreseeable future. ''As bad an investment as this increasingly is,'' Mr. Landesman said, ''there are no shortage of players who want to put in shows.''
 There are always just enough hits -- ''Doubt'' is the big surprise moneymaker this season -- to make theater investors and producers think that maybe their show is the one that makes it. So they keep coming back. But if costs keep rising and audiences keep dwindling, it is hard to imagine that this state of affairs is sustainable.
 AND then where will we be? I think we're going to be in ''Gem of the Ocean'' territory. Let me explain. ''Gem of the Ocean,'' the latest Broadway offering by August Wilson, ran in the Walter Kerr theater, a Jujamcyn theater, for just two months, closing in early February. If not for a devoted theater backer named Carole Shorenstein Hays, a San Francisco real estate heiress, it wouldn't have even made it to Broadway; her last-minute infusion of $1 million provided the necessary capital that made it possible for Mr. Landesman, who was also a producer, to mount the production. Needless to say, the show lost pretty much all of its upfront costs. 
 Although Mr. Landesman wouldn't say so, it's hard to believe that he ever thought ''Gem of the Ocean'' would ever make money. In any case, he made it sound as though it didn't really matter to him whether it did or not. ''We have a commitment to August Wilson,'' he said. ''We lost a half a million dollars on that show. But the rewards aren't measured just in financial returns. The audiences at 'Gem of the Ocean' were some of the most rapturous we've ever had.'' 
 He added that he never wanted to have public shareholders because he never wanted to be in a position where financial considerations would prevent him from putting on a play like ''Gem of the Ocean.''
 Ms. Hays, for her part, seemed not to care in the least that she had lost $1 million on the play. ''I grew up loving theater,'' she said, ''and it gives me faith and hope and verve.'' She, too, talked about her commitment to the work of August Wilson and other important American playwrights. '''Gem of the Ocean' is an important work,'' she said. ''It would be a shame if people didn't have a chance to see it.'' She described her involvement in the play as her true dividend.
 As a theater lover, I'm happy that there are benefactors like Ms. Hays, and theater owners like Mr. Landesman. But the business journalist in me says something else. If this is the future of Broadway, we should stop talking about ''investing'' in a play, and start calling it what it is: an act of philanthropy.

HEADLINE: Pomp and Circumspect

BYLINE: By Daniel H. Pink. 
Daniel H. Pink is the author of ''A Whole New Mind: Moving From the Information Age to the Conceptual Age.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
COMMENCEMENT speakers have long offered graduating seniors the same warm and gooey career advice: Do what you love. 
 And graduates have long responded the same way: They've listened carefully, nodded earnestly, and gone out and become accountants. No surprise. On every day except graduation day, young people are taught that their futures depend not on following their bliss, but on mastering dutiful (and less lovable) abilities like crunching numbers and following rules. 
 But this year is different. The students graduating this spring will operate in a labor market that increasingly confers an economic advantage on the activities that people do out of a sense of intrinsic satisfaction -- designing cool things, telling stories and helping others. For the class of 2005, ''Do what you love'' is no longer a soft-hearted sentiment. It is also a hard-headed strategy. 
 What's going on? 
 Three powerful forces are converging to overturn the conventional logic of careers.
 The first force is automation. Last century, machines replaced human muscle. This century, software is augmenting, if not replacing, the human brain's left hemisphere -- the part that is linear, sequential and computer-like. Software can now do many tasks faster, cheaper and better than we can: processing claims, adding figures, searching data. 
 So accountants lose work to TurboTax. And lawyers lose work to legal Web sites that offer uncontested divorces for $249 and articles of incorporation for the price of a pizza. To cope, we'll have to rely on what's harder to replicate in the 1's and 0's of computer code -- inventiveness, empathy and seeing the big picture -- which also happen to be the components of satisfying work.
 The second force involves jobs going overseas. As certain types of work (answering phone calls, writing basic computer code, analyzing financial statements) migrate to places like India, graduates will have to draw on abilities that are less routine. These abilities (creating new products, crafting narratives, caring for others) are more difficult to outsource. But once mastered, they're typically more engaging than simply following the steps on a spec sheet or plugging numbers into a spreadsheet. 
 Finally, there's prosperity. This year's graduates have always lived in a country whose standard of living -- deep into the middle class -- is breathtaking. While the United States still has a disgraceful level of poverty, most Americans, in material terms, are doing pretty well. 
 For instance, the United States has more cars and trucks than licensed drivers. American families own such a surfeit of consumer goods that they've turned self-storage into a $17 billion-a-year industry. In an overstocked marketplace, businesses can no longer crank out pallets of identical widgets. They must create customized, intriguing, even beautiful products, services and experiences. How do you do this? You need employees who possess not only technical ability but also a sense of curiosity, aesthetics and, yes, joyfulness. 
 In other words, to make it in the emerging economy, we will have to do things that software can't do faster and that overseas knowledge workers can't do more cheaply. In addition, what we produce must also satisfy the growing consumer demand for products and services infused with emotion, spirituality and artistry. 
 As the information age matures, eat-your-spinach skills are still necessary, but they are no longer sufficient. The abilities that matter more are turning out to be the abilities that are also fundamental sources of human gratification. And that's good news for many intrinsically motivated (but sometimes parentally discouraged) professions. Indeed, more Americans already work in art, entertainment and design than work as lawyers, accountants and auditors. 
 To be sure, this new labor market is not a land in which every person will be able to pursue a passion and instantly arrive at a fat paycheck. Still, we may finally be at the point where we can tell freshly minted graduates: Look, it's a rough world out there. There's only one way to survive. Do what you love.

HEADLINE: RUMSFELD ISSUES A SHARP REBUKE TO CHINA ON ARMS

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Saturday, June 4 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, in an unusually blunt public critique of China, said Saturday that Beijing's military spending threatened the delicate security balance in Asia and called for an emphasis instead on political freedom and open markets.
 In a keynote address at an Asian security conference here, Mr. Rumsfeld argued that China's investment in missiles and up-to-date military technology posed a risk not only to Taiwan and to American interests, but also to nations across Asia that view themselves as China's trading partners, not rivals.
 He said no ''candid discussion of China'' could neglect to address these military concerns directly, and criticized China for not admitting the full extent of what he described as its worrisome military expansion. 
 ''Since no nation threatens China, one wonders: why this growing investment?'' Mr. Rumsfeld asked.
 His remarks come as Washington's stance regarding Beijing appears to be growing more critical. The United States has accused China of manipulating the value of its currency, for example, in order to increase exports, and of exerting heavy-handed pressure on Taiwan. 
 A joint warning from the American and Japanese defense and foreign ministers has rankled Chinese leaders, as has the Bush administration's insistence that Europe must not ease curbs on arms sales to China. 
 The administration has also been increasingly disappointed by China's apparent reluctance to press North Korea to resume talks on its nuclear weapons programs, as Mr. Rumsfeld again urged China to do.
 Perhaps because of his emphasis on military developments, as well as trade and democracy, Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks, while measured, were more critical in tone than those heard in recent months from other administration officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who visited China in March. Before the election last year, she and her predecessor, Colin L. Powell, both said relations were better than they had been in years.
 Mr. Rumsfeld's comments on China also stood in contrast to those on another power in Asia: India. On the flight to Singapore, he said ties with India would strengthen while those with China could fray if Beijing did not open up society more. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld previewed findings of the Pentagon's annual report to Congress on the Chinese military, saying: ''China's defense expenditures are much higher than Chinese officials have publicly admitted. It is estimated that China's is the third-largest military budget in the world, and now the largest in Asia.''
 Warnings about China's military modernization have been issued before, but Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks were notable because they came at an Asian security conference attended by defense ministers and military specialists from across Asia and the Pacific Rim. 
 ''The world would welcome a China committed to peaceful solutions and whose industrious and well-educated people contribute to international peace and prosperity,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. But that requires China to match its economic liberalizations with domestic political freedoms, he said, which in turn would bring clear benefits to Beijing because ''China would appear more as a friend and a welcome partner.'' 
 ''China has fundamental decisions to make about its goals and its future,'' he said. ''Ultimately, China will need to embrace some form of open, representative government if it is to fully achieve the benefits to which its people aspire.'' 
 That echoed the Bush administration's broad theme of encouraging democracy around the world, a message that Mr. Bush himself had carried to China when he visited there in February 2002, in a speech broadcast on state television.
 Mr. Rumsfeld, for his part, has long taken a tough stance on China.
 He ordered American military relations with China to be frozen shortly after he became defense secretary in 2001, when a Chinese fighter jet shadowing an American Navy surveillance aircraft in international airspace collided with the plane, forcing it to land on Chinese territory. The crew members were held as virtual hostages for 11 days.
 But the American Navy's port calls have slowly resumed over recent months, and Mr. Rumsfeld now says he hopes to pay an official visit to China before the end of the year.
 In recent weeks, American officials have compiled reports detailing how China has carefully analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the United States military to focus its growing spending on weapons systems that could exploit perceived American weaknesses in case the United States ever responds to fighting in Taiwan.
 These military and intelligence officials say China has purchased or built enough amphibious assault ships, submarines, fighter jets and short-range missiles that pose an immediate threat to Taiwan and to any American force that might come to Taiwan's aid.
 Asked about the speech before Mr. Rumsfeld delivered it, Scott McClellan, press secretary for President Bush, declined to discuss any change in tone in the way that the administration is talking about China. Referring to Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. McClellan added: ''He speaks for the administration as secretary of defense. I haven't seen his remarks.''
 How to assess the Chinese military buildup has been the source of some debate within the administration. Mr. Rumsfeld's speech here, to a forum held by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, was circulated among senior administration officials, including Ms. Rice, before delivery, one Pentagon official said.
 The Pentagon's report to Congress on China is two months late, and one administration official said drafts of the document have been written, circulated and re-written as officials try to strike the right balance between warnings to Beijing and praise of its help on North Korea and its openness to investment.
 In a clear indication of the complicated nature of the relationship, Mr. Rumsfeld stressed the critically important role that China plays, along with the United States and three other nations, in a six-party negotiation aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program. Those talks have been stalled for a year.
 ''One nation that can make a notable contribution in persuading North Korea to return to the six-party talks is China,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.
 He was also harshly critical of North Korea, which he labeled an impoverished, Stalinist regime, but he did not offer new policy pronouncements. Before his arrival here, Mr. Rumsfeld did note that the Bush administration's policy toward North Korea was under review.
 ''Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions threaten the security and stability of the region, and indeed the world,'' he said. ''President Bush and the other four leaders have urged the regime to return to the six-party talks. The United States also urges the regime to embrace the openness and freedom that have helped so many of its neighbors thrive.''
 Mr. Rumsfeld described the American military in the region as poised to battle terrorism and the proliferation of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, but he also highlighted the emergency assistance given by American armed services after the tsunami in December killed more than 170,000 people across Southeast Asia.

HEADLINE: Red Tide Strikes Shellfish Beds, Leading to a Partial Ban

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 3 

 BODY:
New England waters are being plagued by what may be the worst outbreak of red tide in the region, a Massachusetts official said Friday.
 The toxic algae bloom has led state officials to close shellfish beds between Maine and Cape Cod so that people do not eat infected clams, mussels, oysters and scallops. 
 Scientists and state officials say the outbreak, possibly caused by an unusually cold and wet winter and spring, is worsening and, at minimum, is expected to last several weeks. The chief shellfish biologist in Massachusetts, J. Michael Hickey, said two-thirds of the shellfish beds in the state had been closed, including, late on Friday, all the shellfish flats off Nantucket Island. 
 Fishermen in the oyster- and clam-rich centers of Cape Cod are out of work, and fish markets and restaurants on the cape are scrambling to find more expensive substitutes, and, in turn, selling the fish at higher than usual prices.
 ''It is spreading, and it is getting worse,'' Mr. Hickey said. ''I think this one's going to be probably the biggest in terms of area and probably, the way it's going, in terms of toxicity levels.''
 This species of algae, unlike a variety of red tide that occurs off Florida, does not emit fumes that kill ocean life or prevent people from swimming. Beaches have not closed. And it affects only bivalves, not other seafood like lobsters or shrimp.
 If shellfish infected with the New England strain is eaten, the toxin could cause numbness, breathing problems or even death, said Dr. Don Anderson, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who, along with other scientists, has received emergency federal money to help monitor the problem. 
 No illnesses have been reported from this outbreak.
 Dr. Anderson said that in light of a few serious cases several years ago -- the deaths of a few people in Alaska and California who had ignored or did not know about closings of shellfish areas in those states -- New England officials are being careful to place contaminated beds off limits.
 ''This is certainly a major event,'' he said.
 The closings are cramping the shellfish industry, which earns much of its revenue from soft-shell clams that Cape Cod vacationers clamor for in the summer.
 ''It's tens of thousands of dollars a day just in Wellfleet,'' said Molly Benjamin, who farms oysters and littlenecks there. ''It's 'killing' people. I mean nobody was ready.'' 
 Different species of red tide bloom in different parts of the world. The New England variety, Alexandrium, often permeates the waters off Maine or New Hampshire, experts say. But it rarely spreads with such ferocity and almost always drifts out to the ocean before infiltrating the prolific shellfish bastions around Cape Cod. 
 Dr. Anderson said that in a normal year the algae concentration in the water might be ''1,000 cells or 2,000 cells in a liter.'' 
 With this outbreak, he said, ''we're seeing 20 to 40 times that many cells per liter.''
 For days, Mr. Hickey and others have been saying that the outbreak was not as bad as one in 1972, the first time that officials think that red tide encroached on Massachusetts waters. Then, the water around Cape Ann, 30 miles northeast of Boston, was tinged reddish and some seabirds died. This time, the water has not changed color, and no birds are known to have died.
 Although the state closed all the shellfish flats in 1972, Mr. Hickey said, some of those were closed as a precaution, not because contamination was found.
 ''I would say right now we got more area closed because of actual toxin than you had in 1972,'' Mr. Hickey said.
 ''It's just a pretty sad situation,'' said Barbara Austin, who has been farming oysters and littleneck clams for 20 years in Wellfleet. ''Everything is just really on hold until this algae bloom clears up, and they don't have any way of knowing how long it's going to take.''
 Ms. Austin, out of work for a week, took a temporary job ''doing some house-cleaning and taking care of some animals for some folks,'' she said.
 ''I just never imagined that it could possibly happen in Wellfleet,'' she said. ''What's really scary is the economic impact for this town. It trickles right down to the guys who we employ, who hand-count clams into bags. We have truck drivers, managers. We've been trying to find other things for them to do. But if this is an extended closure, they're going to have to go on unemployment. It trickles down right to coffee shops where people say: 'I've got to save my money. I can't afford to buy a sandwich.'''
 At the Friendly Fisherman, a fish market and restaurant in Eastham, Colleen Francke said clams for frying have been bought from Canada at double the price per gallon that the local ones cost last summer. Her business is selling steamers for $5.29 a pound, up from a high of $3.99 last year.
 ''The prices are just skyrocketing,'' she said.
 Dr. Anderson said that in some places people were ''misinformed and are overreacting,'' avoiding all fish, not understanding that lobster and other seafood are unaffected and that the clams and oysters on sale have been rigorously tested and are safe. The misperception could make it even harder for fishermen, he said.
 Officials predict that currents will sweep the red tide out to sea in coming weeks and that it will not drift south along the coast. Mr. Hickey said that just in case, he was communicating with environmental officials in New York, who are ''obviously very interested in what's going on.''
 Dr. Anderson, who said the snowy winter and rainy May may have brought in algae-nourishing nutrients from the sea, said he was concerned that a second wave of red tide might hit Cape Cod, because a second outbreak is under way in Maine.
 Several fish entrepreneurs on the cape said they hoped that the red tide has cleared by the Fourth of July, when summer vacationers arrive in earnest, because out-of-towners are quite likely to be less understanding of the problem than their regular customers.
 ''We know that being in a coastal area, especially a seasonal area, it has its highs and lows, and that's probably why we're here and what we love about it,'' said Jim Russo, who manages the Lobster Shanty in Eastham and the Orleans Lobster Pound on the cape. 
 Mr. Russo said his current customers were not panicking or staying away. Still, he said, even he could grow sentimental about shellfish.
 ''If I could pick it,'' Mr. Russo said, ''even over chocolate, I'd pick clams.''

HEADLINE: Show Him the Money

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I hope Mark Felt and his family get the big payoff they want, but they've already hurt their chances by ignoring his famous advice as Deep Throat. They didn't follow the money.
 They didn't appreciate how seriously we journalists take our ethical standards. We are bound by the sacred vow we make to our sources: if the information you give us turns out to be profitable, we will keep the money. 
 Mr. Felt's family tried profiting from his revelation, but the news cartel held firm. People and Vanity Fair both rejected the family's overtures and held to their policy of not paying sources for news. 
 The best their lawyer could manage for disclosing the greatest secret in journalism was a fee from Vanity Fair for writing the article. He got about $10,000, which is less than what the magazine has paid for articles in which movie stars disclose they have a major motion picture about to open in a theater near you.
 The Felts' mistake, of course, was hawking the secret directly instead of persevering with the genteel approach used by celebrities and former presidents: laundering the news through a book publisher. You don't actually have to write the book yourself, but once your name is on the cover, you've joined the literary priesthood and are pure enough to accept cash offerings.
 As a mere source, though, you cannot be trusted with money, at least not according to the keepers of journalistic ethics in America. They say the money would taint the media's image, inspire lies from mercenary sources and maybe even corrupt journalists. An editor once told me that if he bought an article, he feared he would overplay it to justify the expense. 
 But editors are already tempted to overplay some stories simply because of the resources -- staff time, travel expenses -- expended on them. And sources already tell lies and try to create news without demanding any upfront payment.
 Journalists are supposed to have the judgment to deal with these problems, and money could help them do their job better. Money would give them more leverage than they have now over their sources, because they could withhold some of the payment until the story comes out and is proven correct. They would have access to more sources than the ones they so often rely on now: people peddling stories to further a political or personal agenda.
 If People magazine hadn't been bound by the taboo against checkbook journalism, it could have exposed Deep Throat on its cover this week. Instead it gave its readers an exclusive story on Britney's craving for pickles and ice cream, and the singer got publicity that's probably worth more than what the Felts would have collected in cash. 
 The taboo might make long-term economic sense for newspapers and magazines because it spares them from taking part in expensive bidding wars, but it probably has more to do with class than money. In Britain, the tabloids pay freely for stories, but the highbrow papers insist they don't (while accusing their rivals of violating the code). 
 When American journalists talk about the ''taint'' of paying sources, they remind me of lawyers who once fought fiercely and unsuccessfully to preserve their self-imposed ban on advertising. They considered themselves professionals above such commerce -- ''sheer shysterism,'' in the words of former Chief Justice Warren Burger.
 But while journalists disdain haggling for information, a lot of nonjournalists share the sentiments of Mr. Felt's daughter, Joan. ''Bob Woodward's gonna get all the glory for this,'' she said, ''but we could make at least enough money to pay some bills, like the debt I've run up for the kids' education.'' 
 Without her father's actions, Richard Nixon might well have stayed in office and the University of Texas library would never have paid $5 million for the papers of Mr. Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Even if they'd brought down the president without him, ''All the President's Men'' would never have sold so many copies and movie tickets without Mr. Felt's dramatic touches -- the coded signals he devised, the secret meetings in the parking garage.
 Now the reporters are rushing out another book, and Mr. Felt is still not supposed to get any money from it. He deserves a cut, not only for what he did for them but for what they and their editor did to him. He risked his career to expose corruption in the White House, and they ensured that his name will be forever linked in the annals of history with a 1970's porn flick. They owe him.

HEADLINE: Israel Evacuates Staff From Uzbekistan as Instability Worsens

BYLINE: By C.J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 3 

 BODY:
Signs of instability grew on Friday in Uzbekistan, as Israel swiftly evacuated most of its diplomats amid fresh warnings of terrorist attacks and the American Embassy authorized most of its employees and their families to leave as well.
 Only the Israeli ambassador and a senior official remained in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, according to Mark Legev, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, who said 13 other embassy employees and their families flew out of Uzbekistan on Thursday night.
 The United States issued a warning on Thursday night saying it had received new information that Islamic terrorist groups were planning attacks, perhaps against Americans. The warning mentioned four terrorist organizations -- Al Qaeda, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Islamic Jihad Union and the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement -- that it said were active in the region. 
 Israeli and American officials declined to discuss details of the intelligence.
 Mr. Legev said in a telephone interview only that Israel had received ''a specific threat against an Israeli target by an extremist element.'' After the threat was evaluated, he said, it was quickly decided to evacuate most of the diplomatic corps.
 The threats underscored the fresh difficulties in Uzbekistan for the United States, whose activities in the country are being restricted both by the risks of terror attacks and by a diplomatic chill.
 The United States has used a former Soviet air base in Uzbekistan near the Afghan border since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
 Earlier this week, the Uzbek government refused to renew visas for 54 Peace Corps volunteers, who were forced to leave the country, according to Barbara Daly, the corps' spokeswoman in Washington. 
 The nation's stability and direction are in question. An authoritarian state with a population deeply resentful of the government's repression and corruption, it has been strained by terrorist attacks and wider public unrest, and has suffered three waves of violence since early last year. 
 In April 2004, several attacks, including some by suicide bombers, broke out in Tashkent and Bukhara, a city on the ancient Silk Road in the west. Nearly 50 people died, according to official Uzbek reports. 
 Three more suicide bombers struck nearly simultaneously last July, one each at the Israeli Embassy, the American Embassy and the Uzbek general prosecutor's office in Tashkent. Besides the bombers, at least two more people died.
 The country, an ally of the United States in efforts against terrorists but resistant to liberalizing its politics or economy, has been enveloped by uncertainty since May 13, when Uzbek security forces used gunfire to put down a revolt, prison break and large antigovernment demonstration in Andijon, a city in the northeastern Fergana Valley. 
 Witnesses say hundreds of unarmed people were killed when the authorities resorted to indiscriminate force. The Uzbek government says 36 soldiers and 137 others, mostly armed men, died. 
 With violence apparently fueled by both social disaffection and militant Islam, it is not clear who has been responsible for the outbreaks.
 President Islam A. Karimov, who routinely blames Islamic terrorists for Uzbekistan's ills, has said the Andijon uprising was planned by international terrorist groups and a faction of Hizb ut-Tahrir, or Party of Liberation, which seeks to create governments ruled by its view of Islamic tradition. 
 The party, which says it is peaceful, has denied involvement. Demonstrators who survived the crackdown insist that the uprising was organized by local men made desperate by economic underdevelopment and government repression. 
 It was not immediately clear how many American diplomats were leaving. Departures will be voluntary, the State Department said.

 David Brooks hit the nail on the head: Europe's crisis is just beginning. 
 Within a decade, the slow slide into economic and social stagnation will become an avalanche. And as an avatar of American liberalism, The New York Times will find it increasingly difficult to argue that a xenophobic and irrational Europe shows the way.
 If you value the liberal project, you would do well to think hard on Mr. Brooks's message and what it means for all that you cherish.

 In David Brooks's view, we should give up hope of attaining the quality of life found in Western Europe and embrace the dog-eat-dog world of hard-nosed capitalism. 
 But since median income in the United States has fallen against inflation in the last few years, while a smaller percentage of Americans has health insurance or retirement security, Mr. Brooks should be cautious about bragging too loudly. 
 An economic system's true success is measured not by its ''efficiency'' or the latest stock-market peak but by the quality of life it delivers. On that scale, most Americans are falling further behind Europeans.

 In ''Fear and Rejection,'' David Brooks makes a point that Europeans aren't as well off as Americans because their output isn't as high and that ''Europeans clearly love their way of life, but don't know how to sustain it.''
 Some people measure quality of life by more than economic factors.
 Americans are working more and earning less (other than the top 2 percent). And most workers, when asked the one thing they would want the most, say ''more time off.''
 We spend less time with our children and less time on vacation, and the retirement age is going up. Where is the quality of life in that?
 I'm not suggesting that the European model has all the answers, but as we watch our children falling behind in their educations, our workloads going up, the cost of medical services skyrocketing and the quality of the care decreasing, I wonder about our ''fear and rejection.''

 David Brooks is right in noting that what American liberals want has been tried in Europe and has failed. Europe has tried high taxes, big welfare states, nationalized health plans and subsidies galore, and Europe's quality of life has eroded.
 So why are so many intelligent Americans still lefties?
 Being a lefty on economic issues -- since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the breakup of the Soviet Union and now with Europe's prolonged economic malaise -- is like being a flat-earther after Columbus.

HEADLINE: How to Exorcise A Corporate Scandal

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In Washington, the Supreme Court this week swept aside the conviction of Arthur Andersen for trying to hide the fraud at Enron -- a legal victory of little practical benefit for the firm, now all but dead.
 In Birmingham, Ala., yesterday, a federal judge ordered a deadlocked jury to continue weighing evidence against Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive of HealthSouth, accused of orchestrating a $2.7 billion accounting fraud. And that courtroom decision, regardless of the outcome, will have scant effect on a company that has avoided the downward spiral that engulfed Andersen and Enron.
 The Scrushy trial is impossible to ignore in Birmingham, given the constant media coverage. ''But it's not much of a distraction,'' said Jay F. Grinney, the new chief executive of HealthSouth. ''Everyone understands that the company is not on trial. It is the former chief executive of the company that is on trial.'' 
 In the corporate scandals of the last four years, the striking fact is how often the closing chapters have followed the script at HealthSouth and not Andersen.
 The spectrum of business misconduct has included seemingly every flavor of fraud, self-dealing, improper accounting and conflict of interest. The punishments have ranged from the recent conviction of Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief of WorldCom, for guiding an $11 billion fraud, to the fines paid in 2002 by a group of Wall Street firms to settle charges that stock analysts wrote rosy reports on companies to help bring in investment banking business.
 Yet the goal of government policy, prosecution strategy and business practice has nearly always been to rehabilitate the wayward companies rather than liquidate them. There are exceptions. Enron proved a financial house of cards, as no one was willing to trade with a trader that was bankrupt. Enron's physical assets, like its national gas pipelines, were auctioned. Andersen was given a death sentence -- justified or not -- when it was indicted, and its corporate auditing clients fled within weeks.
 The Justice Department's corporate indictment of Andersen was controversial, and similar moves are unlikely. Since Andersen, federal and state prosecutors have adopted the less draconian approach of making the responsible executives the targets and reaching settlements with the companies that include fines and changes in corporate behavior.
 ''You don't want to be swinging a meat ax when a scalpel is appropriate,'' explained Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. ''You want to get rid of the individuals who did the wrongdoing and get the company back on an even keel.''
 That has been the pattern followed in pursuing misconduct at other major companies, including Tyco, WorldCom, Adelphia, Marsh & McLennan and the American International Group. 
 There have been, to be sure, spectacular financial failures like the bankruptcies of WorldCom and Adelphia. But the American system of bankruptcy allows companies to seek temporary shelter from creditors and gives them time to recast themselves for corporate survival or later sale at better than fire-sale terms. In April, Time Warner and Comcast bought Adelphia for $17.6 billion and will divvy up its cable television operations and subscribers. And WorldCom, renamed MCI since emerging from bankruptcy, agreed last month to be sold to Verizon Communications for $8.5 billion. 
 In 2002, after WorldCom disclosed its huge fraud, the financial advisers to the company and its creditors estimated that selling WorldCom's assets would yield $1 billion or less. MCI employed 75,000 people when the scandal broke; the work force is down to 40,000 today. ''But that's 40,000 jobs in a situation where it could have been zero,'' observed Richard C. Breeden, MCI's court-appointed monitor.
 ''Our bankruptcy system,'' said Mr. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, ''provides for the flexibility to allow companies to fail financially, and then recycle the companies back into the marketplace.''
 Whether a scandal-tainted company files for bankruptcy protection or not, the recipe for restoring its reputation and fortunes is much the same.
 Edward D. Breen arrived at Tyco International as its new chief executive in July 2002, a month after the company's former chief, L. Dennis Kozlowski, known for his lavish parties and a $6,000 gold-laced shower curtain in his corporate apartment, was forced to resign. Mr. Breen found a company in disarray, embarrassed by the charges that Mr. Kozlowski looted the company, and faced with a cash shortage since $11 billion in debt was coming due in a year.
 Mr. Breen, who came from Motorola, took quick and decisive action. Within a month, he asked the board that had hired him to resign. He started cleaning house immediately. Today, 480 of the 500 employees at corporate headquarters in Princeton, N.J., are new to the company since Mr. Breen came aboard. ''We had to take immediate and aggressive action to show investors, customers and employees that it was a different management at Tyco,'' he noted.
 The good news, Mr. Breen said, was that Tyco, built through acquisitions, had several sound businesses, ranging from electronic components and medical devices to lawn sprinklers and home security systems. He streamlined operations and pulled out of a couple of businesses, like a money-losing undersea cable network, to increase cash flow.
 With tighter management, Tyco has been able to cut its debt in half and is growing profitably again. Its worldwide payroll is 250,000, only 10,000 less than when Mr. Breen took over. 
 In New York, a jury is deliberating in the retrial of Mr. Kozlowski on charges of grand larceny; the first trial ended in a mistrial. And there are still private shareholder suits against the company, which Mr. Breen calls the last of the ''legacy'' issues from the scandal. ''As far as running the company, it's pretty much business as usual now,'' he said.
 One measure of its success has been a rebound in its stock price, from $8 just before Mr. Breen joined Tyco to $28.65 yesterday.
 At HealthSouth, bankruptcy looked likely in the crisis immediately after federal investigators raided the company's headquarters for evidence of fraud in March 2003. Within days, Bryan Marsal, a turnaround consultant, was in Birmingham scouring the company for what he calls ''lazy assets'' to sell to raise cash quickly. His list -- land, investments and 14 corporate aircraft -- went on the block to raise $300 million. ''Cash buys you time and time lets you develop options,'' explained Mr. Marsal, a partner in Alvarez & Marsal, a corporate restructuring consulting firm.
 Bankruptcy was averted, but HealthSouth was still embattled when Mr. Grinney, a former executive from HCA, a big hospital chain, became chief executive in May 2004. HealthSouth was facing a Medicare fraud suit, an S.E.C. investigation and restless bondholders. He moved quickly, sometimes accelerating steps begun under the interim chief executive, Robert P. May, like closing 300 of HealthSouth's outpatient rehabilitation and diagnostic clinics.
 His priorities, Mr. Grinney said, have been to bring in new senior management, set a long-term strategy, revitalize the corporate culture and put in place the technology and standardized procedures for efficiently handling sales, expenses and corporate reporting. Fraud tends to flourish, he said, in closed corporate environments where numbers and transactions are difficult to track and find. 
 ''We've had a massive overhaul of the management environment at HealthSouth,'' Mr. Grinney said.
 The company plans to refinance debt and finally publish audited financial results for 2000 through 2003 before the end of this month. It also has yet to reach a settlement with the S.E.C. 
 But HealthSouth is a company that managed to sidestep bankruptcy and a severe deterioration of its business, and it seems to be on its way back. HealthSouth shares have risen from a low in the pennies two years ago to $5.30. 
 WorldCom fell into bankruptcy within weeks after it initially disclosed in June 2002 that it had overstated earnings by $3.8 billion (later investigations concluded profits were falsely inflated by $11 billion). Mr. Breeden, the former S.E.C. chairman, was brought in to lead the cleanup and lend credibility to a company whose reputation was in tatters.
 Addressing the ''ethics crisis,'' he said, was essential to both customers and employees, and thus for any hope of stabilizing the company. ''People don't want to do business with crooks,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''And when you're at your mother's house for dinner, you don't want to be ashamed to say where you work. It's critical to keep the faith of your customers and employees, that they care whether the company succeeds or not.''
 WorldCom brought in Michael D. Capellas, the former president of Hewlett-Packard, as its chief executive in December 2002, and he guided the company, which changed its name to MCI in 2003, out of bankruptcy and eventually into the arms of Verizon. 
 To Mr. Breeden, the MCI outcome stands as proof that the bankruptcy system works to preserve jobs and corporate assets, making the economy stronger, and that the legal system wisely focused on crime and punishment at the top. 
 ''Bernie Ebbers richly deserved to be indicted and prosecuted,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''That is far better than punishing the company itself and all the innocent people who work for it.''

HEADLINE: Billiton Acquires Control of Rival Mining Company in Australia

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, June 3 

 BODY:
The world's largest mining company, BHP Billiton, won control of a rival, WMC Resources of Australia, on Friday, warding off potential competitors by forcing a vote on its offer of 9.2 billion Australian dollars ($6.9 billion).
 With less than six hours before the offer was scheduled to expire, BHP Billiton announced that it had taken control of WMC and automatically extended its offer of 7.85 Australian dollars ($5.93) a share until June 17 to seek a higher stake. The company said it held 76.25 percent of WMC by the time its offer closed. 
 BHP Billiton's offer is free from conditions and it must win 90 percent of the stock before it can make a compulsory acquisition of WMC under Australian law. Otherwise it faces the prospect of keeping WMC as a listed subsidiary company.
 BHP Billiton, by adding WMC, moves up a notch to become the world's third-largest nickel producer and solidifies its No.2 ranking in copper behind Codelco of Chile.
 Both commodities are at or near their highest prices in years, in large part because of China's booming industrial economy and its need for millions of tons of raw materials to build roads, homes and office buildings.
 BHP Billiton intends to move quickly to integrate WMC's outback mining and refining operations into its global commodities base.
 ''It was always going to be close, but there was a wide expectation that BHP would get WMC in the end,'' said Tony Robson, an analyst at Global Mining Research.
 BHP Billiton had threatened to drop the offer if it failed to win 50 percent of WMC shares by the Friday deadline.
 This week, the chairman of WMC, Tommie Bergman, implored shareholders to accept, saying the offer was ''as good as it is going to get.''
 Hopes among some WMC shareholders that a higher rival offer was in the wings and public holidays earlier this week in the United States and Britain may have delayed the arrival of acceptances at BHP Billiton's Melbourne headquarters.

Job Creation Slows, but Unemployment Rate Falls
Job creation slowed in May, with 78,000 jobs added, but the unemployment rate edged down to 5.1 percent, its lowest point since September 2001, the Labor Department said. The job creation report, which was weaker than expected, rekindled talk of an economic slowdown, although analysts cautioned that monthly numbers can be volatile. BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1

HEADLINE: Don't Rush the Revolution

BYLINE: By Yassin al-Haj Saleh. 
Yassin al-Haj Saleh, a writer, was imprisoned in Syria from 1980 to 1996.

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria 

 BODY:
ON Monday, Syria's Baath Party will begin its 10th party congress, the second since President Bashar al-Assad took power in June 2000 and the first since the only other Baathist regime, that one in Iraq, was overthrown by American forces. In many respects the outcome of the gathering will determine whether Syria's leadership can ever reform itself.
 Constitutionally, the Baath Party, which has been in power since 1963, is considered ''the leader party of state and society.'' Yet this leadership is unsettled. Under international pressure, the Syrian Army and intelligence services have been forced to pull out of Lebanon. This was a severe blow to the regime, which lost a key strategic asset, a profitable satellite and much prestige -- all vital commodities to an authoritarian government that must constantly prove its power to its subjects. 
 However, since it completed its Lebanon withdrawal, the Assad government has partly regained its composure. And the stronger it feels, the fewer concessions it will make to its own people and the less willing it will be to engage in much needed political and economic reform. 
 In March, the ambassador to the United States, Imad Mustapha, promised there would be no political prisoners left in Syrian jails by this July. I suspect he would hesitate to make that claim now. On May 15, the political security directorate arrested Ali al-Abdullah, a human rights activist, for having read in public an e-mail message written by the exiled head of the Islamic dissident group the Muslim Brotherhood. This was followed by the arrest, on May 22, of Mohammad Radun, head of the Arab Organization for Human Rights-Syria. Human rights groups estimate that about 1,500 political prisoners remain in Syria's jails, and at least 40 people have been arrested since the end of March. As someone who spent 16 years in prison for political reasons, including a year in the infamous and brutal Palmyra prison, I am skeptical about the regime's intentions. 
 So what will next week's congress decide? Some have suggested the Baathists will finally announce that they will allow other political parties to operate freely. Perhaps, but even so, the nation's Constitution ensures the supremacy of the Baath -- any changes the congress makes will be cosmetic, simply modernizing the regime's authoritarianism. Of course no one expects the ''emergency laws,'' in place since the Baathists took power, to be lifted. And the murder on Thursday of the Lebanese journalist Samir Kassir, a prominent critic of the Syrian regime, will make things harder for reformers, though official sources vehemently denied any Syrian involvement in that act of terrorism. News of violence is always good for the hard-liners.
 Paradoxically, outside pressure has weakened the government as a whole but strengthened President Assad and his ''young guard'' in its internal clash with the older followers of his father, the former strongman Hafez al-Assad. The president will probably use this congress to remove many of his father's associates, but he cannot do so without entering into a Faustian bargain -- namely committing himself to Syria's archaic one-party system, to the omnipotent and omnipresent security services, to a continued state monopoly over all media and, most important, to a ruling political elite that continues to hoard Syria's national wealth. These interests, not the members of the ''old guard,'' are the most unyielding obstacles to reform. 
 As for average Syrians, many want to see real change, but the events in Iraq over the last two years have convinced them that direct outside intervention would be a disaster. The approach that the United States adopted in Iraq -- first dissolving the Iraqi state and then engaging in a ''nation-building'' social engineering program -- is the one thing that all Syrians wish to avoid. 
 Rather, when it comes to international pressure, an alternative approach is preferable: one based on multilateral efforts by the global powers and international organizations; financial penalties directed specifically against the businesses and foreign assets of the Syrian elites who have helped themselves to public money; constant moral demands from the international community for domestic political and economic change; and, most important, progress in negotiations with Israel. Until the occupied Golan Heights are returned to Syria, there will be a strong tendency toward the militarization of politics here. And America has an unrivaled role in speeding that transfer. 
 As we have seen in Iraq, ''regime change'' is easy but ensuring stability afterwards is very difficult. Despite the authoritarian nature of the Syrian leadership, gradual change is preferable to abrupt change. A slower pace would not only provide a better chance at avoiding bloodshed, but would give a larger number of Syrians a chance to gain some experience in public affairs, as many have started doing recently by more openly criticizing the regime. True democracy requires a maturation process with respect to participation. 
 For how long will the Baathist regime survive? This depends to a great degree on the solutions and compromises it offers. There is certainly a role to be played by the global powers. But in the end, the regime will have to answer to 18 million Syrians, most of whom want to see freedom, justice and the rule of law in their country.

HEADLINE: Silver Poised to Aid Downtown as Mayor and Governor Seek Stadium

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
It is happening again.
 When New York's political leaders want something, want it badly, to get it they often have to persuade, coerce or lure the state's enigmatic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, into a deal.
 The routine is often the same: the leaders courting Mr. Silver voice confidence of prevailing, his camp protests that his objections are being dismissed out of hand, and they ultimately find Mr. Silver to be an elusive partner, delaying, extracting concessions, not revealing his bottom line until the last possible moment. 
 That pattern, established over more than a decade of fights over state budgets, rent laws and mass-transit capital plans, is being acted out again on a grand stage, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki try to win approval for the mayor's vision of a stadium and a thicket of office towers on Manhattan's West Side. As a crucial vote on the stadium loomed yesterday, Mr. Silver hinted that if forced to choose he would veto the plan. Faced with his resistance, the other side blinked, the deadline was pushed back and the talks continued.
 The outlines of Mr. Silver's demands have been clear for months -- though what precisely it will take to win him over remains far murkier. He wants a stronger city and state commitment to the stalled development of downtown Manhattan -- especially the World Trade Center site, in his district -- which he sees as more pressing than the West Side. And he wants to be sure that West Side development does not become so attractive that builders and tenants turn their backs on downtown.
 ''We're talking about the impact of the proposal to build 24 million square feet of office space in Midtown at a time when we are all committed to redeveloping downtown, and what kind of competition that would create, and how, if it's possible, to do that,'' Mr. Silver said at a news conference yesterday with the governor.
 The problem, he and people close to him have argued, is that his concerns have not been taken seriously enough until the last few days -- a claim that is disputed both in the governor's office and at City Hall. 
 That Mr. Silver has once again emerged as the pivotal figure in a divisive battle is no surprise; though he is just one of 150 Assembly members, including 65 from the city, he is also one of the troika of officials who control state government, along with the governor and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno.
 As the lone Democrat in that group, he often uses his enormous clout to block the other two -- a source of endless frustration for Mr. Pataki and relief to his Democratic colleagues. But in this case, Mr. Bruno has joined the speaker in voicing reservations about the West Side plan, and Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg need to gain his vote, too.
 His tactics reflect the guarded style and shrewd politicking of Albany's ultimate inside player. His colleagues often say that they have little idea what Mr. Silver is thinking -- a great strength in negotiating and balancing competing demands within the Democratic conference, some say, and, according to others, an infuriating sign of evasiveness.
 Mr. Silver has played things so close to the vest that fellow Assembly members in favor of the stadium plan and opposed to it express equal assurance that in his heart of hearts, he is on their side. He remains little known to the wider public even after 12 years in power, and though he is relaxed, confident and persuasive in small groups, he tends to be uncomfortable and stiff in front of large audiences and television cameras.
 If he uses his powers to stall and say no to the hilt, they are often the only powers he has as Albany's odd man out -- a Democrat lined up against a Republican governor, a Republican majority in the state Senate and a Republican mayor. ''That's the control he has over things, and he understands that and he's very skillful at it, and it doesn't work if you give your position away,'' said Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol of Brooklyn, who opposes the stadium plan. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has ardently courted the speaker, even attending the circumcision of his grandson, and building a relationship far warmer and more cooperative than the ones Mr. Silver has had with either Mr. Pataki or Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. And in recent weeks, the mayor and governor have pledged a number of measures Mr. Silver wanted in his district, from school construction and tax breaks for businesses to altered traffic patterns.
 But people close to Mr. Silver say he has been put off by the suggestion that his vote on the West Side plan can be bought by lavishing money on his district rather than by a serious debate about Manhattan's future.
 Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said there was no intention to diminish Mr. Silver's demands. ''The mayor has always been very responsive to the speaker's concerns,'' he said.
 Politically, Mr. Silver answers to two small constituencies -- his Lower Manhattan district and the Assembly Democrats -- and he probably has little cause to worry about whatever decision he makes. Polls show the public is not enthusiastic about the stadium, after months of negative advertising by opponents.
 Many city Assembly members support the plan, especially minority members -- one of Mr. Silver's bases of support -- who see it as a source of jobs. But they also understand his concern over Lower Manhattan. Many downstate lawmakers oppose the plan just as vehemently.

HEADLINE: U.S. Faults 4 Allies Over Forced Labor

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3 

 BODY:
The United States criticized four of its closest allies in the Middle East on Friday, saying Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are doing little if anything to stop forced labor and other forms of ''modern slavery'' within their borders.
 The four countries are among 14 ''Tier III'' nations that the State Department said had a serious problem with trafficking in persons and made little or no effort to control it, despite prodding from the United States. Citation as a Tier III country can trigger economic penalties. 
 ''Trafficking in human beings is nothing less than a modern form of slavery,'' said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking at a news conference introducing the government's fifth annual Trafficking in Persons Report. 
 None of the four Middle Eastern countries were on the government's list of problem nations last year -- though Saudi Arabia was listed in 2001 and 2002. The government decided this year to focus its attention on forced labor, the primary problem in the four Middle Eastern states.
 In Saudi Arabia, said John R. Miller, the State Department's senior adviser on trafficking, ''We have domestic workers being brought in from many countries into domestic servitude, child beggars, a lot of beatings, reports of beatings and rape -- very difficult to get shelter, no convictions.''
 Slave trafficking burst onto the world stage in the mid-1990's, when thousands of women from the former Soviet Union, attracted by job offers in Europe, were forced to work as prostitutes once they arrived. These Russian women began working the streets of major European capitals.
 In the United States during the late 1990's, several notorious farm-labor servitude cases in Florida and forced prostitution cases involving hundreds of Mexican and Thai women caught the attention of the Clinton administration, just as Europe was urging Washington to get involved.
 In 2000, Congress passed the Trafficking Victim Protection Act, which set out new penalties for slave traffickers and required the State Department to publish an annual report on slave trafficking worldwide. The department vigorously opposed the report provision. Officials said they did not want to do research for another annual report, on top of the human rights and drug trafficking reports, and did not believe nations found to be out of compliance should be penalized automatically.
 The bill was amended to make the sanctions subject to the president's discretion. And since 2003, when the sanction provision took effect, only two countries -- Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea -- have been cited. Under the law, no decisions on whether to sanction the 14 nations cited this year can be made before September -- to give the nations time to improve their records, Mr. Miller said.
 The other nations include Bolivia, Cambodia, Ecuador, Jamaica, Sudan, Togo and Venezuela. Also listed were Cuba, Myanmar and North Korea, nations that are mentioned in almost every government list of problem states. Last year, the department listed only 10 problem states. But the first report, in 2001, listed 23. 
 Saudi Arabia is a key American ally and oil supplier whose leader, Crown Prince Abdullah, visited President Bush at his Texas ranch in April. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with Qatar, are also allies, and the United States maintains an important military base in Qatar.
 The criticisms of the four countries were similar. All four nations, the report says, imported workers from the region, from the Middle East and Asia and then effectively enslaved them.
 ''Some foreign women who migrate legally to Kuwait as domestic workers,'' the report says, ''are subsequently abused by their employers or coerced into situations of debt bondage or involuntary servitude,'' the legal term for slavery. In the United Arab Emirates, ''women are trafficked'' from many nations ''for the purpose of sexual exploitation.'' 
 Saudi Arabia, the report adds, discourages victims from complaining. ''The government offers no legal aid to foreign workers,'' the report says, ''and does not otherwise assist them in using the Saudi criminal justice system to bring exploiters to justice. If a victim chooses to file a complaint, he or she is not allowed to work.''
 None of the embassies of the four countries responded to requests for comment.
 The government was particularly critical of Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates for allowing young children to be held in captivity and used as jockeys in camel races, ''a multi-million dollar activity'' in the Persian Gulf states. Tiny children, some 3 or 4 years old, are prized, and they are underfed to keep their weight down, the report notes. 
 ''Some boys as young as 6 months old were reported kidnapped and sold to traffickers and raised to become camel jockeys.'' Others, it adds, ''were sold by their parents to traffickers.'' Recently, it adds, one fell off his camel and was trampled to death.
 In Kuwait, it says, ''some have been thrown from the camels they rode and suffered serious neurological damage. Most no longer remember where they came from.''
 The United States estimates that about 800,000 people are trafficked against their will between nations each year, and that many hundreds of thousands more are enslaved within their own nations. 
 The government also estimates that about 15,000 people are trafficked to the United States each year. That estimate has fallen since the Central Intelligence Agency issued the first one in 2000. Then it was estimated that as many as 50,000 people were trafficked to the United States from a dozen foreign countries each year.

HEADLINE: Backers Delay Stadium Vote As Silver Balks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and CHARLES V. BAGLI; Charles V. Bagli reported from New York, and Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 3 

 BODY:
Supporters of a proposed West Side stadium postponed a crucial vote on its construction on Friday, shortly after Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver signaled his intention to vote against it. The delay threw the stadium's fate back onto Albany's murky trading floor of favors and promises, and set up an expected frenzied weekend of talks intended to change Mr. Silver's mind.
 Once again, the project that has become Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's centerpiece became the subject of negotiations over political needs hundreds of miles apart, from the future of downtown Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to the revival of depressed towns upstate. 
 City and state officials said they were preparing a broad package of incentives to lure businesses back downtown -- appealing to Mr. Silver, who has made such an effort his pet project -- and a senior aide to Mayor Bloomberg said the administration believed room remained for negotiation and compromise with the speaker.
 But the enigmatic Mr. Silver, who with Gov. George E. Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno holds veto power over the project -- declined to show his hand in a day of high-stakes brinksmanship. Early in the day, he scheduled a 1 p.m. news conference at ground zero, a clear signal to stadium supporters that he planned an announcement to disappoint them.
 The possibility of such an announcement clearly shook Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Pataki, who were more accustomed to hearing Mr. Silver say he still had reservations or unanswered questions about the football stadium. On Thursday, both men had made it clear they would brook no delay in the vote by the little known Albany panel, controlled by Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno.
 ''The meeting will be held tomorrow,'' Mr. Pataki said on Thursday. Mr. Bloomberg said, ''We've run out of time.''
 But after a private morning telephone conversation with Mr. Silver, the mayor learned the seriousness of his position and agreed to delay the vote again, a senior aide said, the third such delay in the last month. When Mr. Silver gave him a glimmer of hope that he could still possibly be persuaded to vote yes with more negotiation, Mr. Bloomberg conferred with the governor who agreed to delay the vote, the aide said.
 Minutes later Mr. Bloomberg went on his weekly radio show, nearly a half-hour late, to announce the postponement.
 ''We are going to postpone that vote until Monday and work through the weekend to see if we can satisfy all of the parties, each of whom has legitimate concerns,'' he said on his weekly radio show. ''And I believe that there is a way for us to get together and do what the city needs.''
 In an interview late Friday afternoon, Mr. Silver said he opposed the mayor's plan to subsidize business growth on the West Side, particularly because there are no similar subsidies planned for downtown nearly four years after the World Trade Center attack.
 ''It's unfortunate if the vote on the stadium is the only thing that may get them to focus on that,'' he said. But ruling nothing out, he added, ''Monday's a long way from Friday.''
 At a news conference, the governor said he shares Mr. Silver's concerns that the 24 million square feet of office space the mayor plans to add to the West Side, along with the stadium, could make it harder to lure businesses back downtown. 
 ''I think the speaker has raised with the mayor some valid concerns about creating competition with new office space on the West Side that could impact his commitment, my commitment, and the mayor's commitment to Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''To me this is an issue that should be resolvable.''
 The postponement, clearly a blow to the mayor, means there may be a vote on the stadium on Monday, the same day that the International Olympic Committee issues an evaluation, but not a final decision, on New York's bid for the 2012 Summer Games, along with those of four other cities. Mayor Bloomberg has contended that an approved stadium is crucial to the city's bid, and had expressed hope for the vote before the evaluations are released.
 Some state officials harbored doubts that the matter could be resolved by then, but one said he believed it was a distinct possibility. Aides to Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Silver said that the weekend's talks would try to address Mr. Silver's insistence that the city offer more incentives to lure businesses back to Lower Manhattan. It was unclear, however, if Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno would come around to support the stadium in the end. 
 Both men have expressed increasingly stronger misgivings about the project in recent days, ranging from the size of the public subsidy involved, which both say could top $1 billion, to questions about the financing of the plan. Both have wondered whether it makes sense, if the city does not get the 2012 Olympics, to build a stadium that would serve as the home of the Jets football team.
 But in Albany's culture of compromise and deal-cutting, lawmakers and lobbyists were unsure if that meant that the two men were really against the proposal, or staking out firm bargaining positions. State officials have said that if the state spends $300 million on the Manhattan stadium, Senator Bruno is expected to seek a commitment of at least that much money for other, unrelated projects upstate. As a result, the stadium and its side deals could cost the taxpayers far more than the subsidies now planned.
 One senior state official said that in negotiations with Mr. Silver's staff, they had worked out an incentive package to retain and lure businesses and jobs to Lower Manhattan, ranging from the elimination of the commercial rent tax to rent subsidies and job credits.
 The state was ready to ensure that the subsidies downtown would be steeper than what Mayor Bloomberg has in mind on the West Side for commercial tenants and developers. But efforts to save the stadium are also splitting the ranks of the real estate industry, with some Midtown landlords of older buildings concerned that downtown properties will be able to steal their tenants with the spectacular set of subsidies being proposed, not to mention rents that are already cheaper.
 ''I would like to see something put together for downtown, but it can't be some massive aid package that encourages people to move from Midtown to downtown,'' said Jeffrey R. Gural, chairman of Newmark & Company. ''A lot of people feel that's not fair. The $3,000 per employee is a killer.''

HEADLINE: What a Gas! A Week in Suburbia With a Hydrogen Honda

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

DATELINE: Fairfield, Conn. 

 BODY:
FOR a decade or longer, the fuel-cell car has resembled the mirage that recedes as you draw closer to it. Hydrogen-powered vehicles always seemed at least 20 years away, the subject of news conferences in Washington and static displays at auto shows. Even when test-drive opportunities came up, they were strictly controlled rides around a track, with nervous company representatives making excuses from the passenger seat.
 All that changed last month when Honda handed me the keys to a 2005 edition of its FCX (for Fuel Cell Experimental), the first zero-emission, hydrogen-driven vehicle to be certified by both the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of California for everyday commercial use. This is a street-ready hydrogen car with license plates and no rough edges, a test bed for green technology worth well over $1 million. 
 Only 20 similar cars exist in the United States and Japan, and I was one of the first journalists to drive it for an extended, unsupervised period -- a week in the mixed company of Northeastern traffic.
 Given my experience with fuel-cell prototypes that were noisy, balky and incapable of going very far between refuelings, the FCX was something of a surprise. Featuring the latest generation of Honda's own fuel cells (hundreds of them are arrayed in two multiple sets, called stacks) and a body and electric motor derived from the company's unsuccessful EV Plus battery vehicle, the FCX felt like a real car, not a high-strung test mule.
 A small two-door hatchback with seating for four, it came with traction control, a CD player and even an automatic climate-control system. There may be fewer than two dozen of these cars in the world, but Honda went to the trouble of giving this one classy floor mats embroidered with the FCX logo.
 With new noise-suppression technology, the FCX is one of the quietest cars on the road. While driving, you hear only a low rumble from the fuel cell's compressor and the brakes' vacuum pump, complemented on acceleration by a jet-taking-off whine. 
 The main hydrogen components are hidden: an 86-kilowatt fuel cell under the front passenger area, two tanks (holding a total of 8.3 pounds, pressurized to 5,000 pounds per square inch) under the rear seat and the ultracapacitor (which stores electricity and takes the place of a battery pack) behind a cover in the cargo area.
 Although top speed is only 93 miles an hour, the low-end torque of the 80-kilowatt electric motor is substantial, booting the little car off the line with alacrity. The 107 horsepower has to move a relatively weighty 3,700 pounds, so it takes about 11 seconds to accelerate to 60 miles an hour, but there is no noticeable lag or flat spots in the power delivery. 
 The FCX is equipped with a standard hybrid feature, regenerative brakes, which capture energy that would otherwise be wasted and feed it to the ultracapacitor. While the brakes feel a bit spongy, they stop the car with confidence thanks to antilock technology and electronic vacuum assist.
 Getting under way in the FCX is a little different. You turn the key and a ''system check'' message appears on a dashboard display, followed (in five to eight seconds) by a ''ready to drive'' message. You just drop the normal-looking shifter into drive -- the car has a single-speed transmission -- and take off. No drama, no sonic symphony. 
 The latest FCX incorporates several improvements, including a new aromatic electrolyte fuel-cell membrane that allows cold weather use to minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. The cell itself, with thin stamped steel separators replacing bulkier carbon dividers, is half the size of Honda's previous design, but produces twice the power. 
 In most important ways, the FCX feels ready for prime-time combat on the world's roads. But its Achilles' heels are price, travel range (about 190 miles) and refueling capability. My loan was interrupted by a trip to the nearest compatible hydrogen station -- in Latham, N.Y., near Albany --a three-hour journey in an enclosed trailer. 
 The FCX carried a federal combined city-highway economy rating of 57 miles per kilogram, but since the car holds less than four kilos of hydrogen -- a very light gas -- long cruises are a challenge. The dash includes two colorful light-bar fuel gauges, one of which displays the estimated number of miles left until the FCX needs a tow truck. 
 Like an execution in the morning, range-challenged fuel-cell cars concentrate the mind. As I neared the end of my loan, I constantly checked the rapidly diminishing blue bars and mentally prepared myself to get out and push. When the gas pump icon lighted up, doom seemed imminent, but I eased into my office parking lot with about 10 miles left to play. 
 Between hydrogen fill-ups I had plenty of opportunity to put the FCX through its paces. I drove it 265 miles, one of the longest press outings in any fuel-cell car. Over the course of the week, the FCX began to feel quite normal, though its bold graphics attracted a fair amount of attention. Some onlookers with battery-car experience might have thought that the legend ''Sub Zero Performance,'' painted on the doors, referred to its prowess in stoplight derbies.
 I took the FCX on shopping trips, to parties and concerts, and even made a command performance at my daughters' school. I got thumbs-ups from drivers of Toyota Priuses and Honda Civic Hybrids. Of course, the questions came in torrents: ''Do you have to plug it in?'' is a familiar query for any hybrid owner, and it's an easy one to answer: No!
 The notion that the fuel cell itself must be replaced when the hydrogen ran out was also quickly dispatched. Other questions -- ''How much is it worth?'' and ''How much does it cost to fill up?'' -- are more difficult. 
 Honda hasn't publicly disclosed its investment in hydrogen technology, but General Motors has committed more than $1 billion and produced only a handful of cars. When vehicles are hand-made by Ph.D.'s as part of blue-sky research projects, can you even speculate on how much they are ''worth''? A Honda spokesman, Andy Boyd, says the FCX's estimated expense ($1 million to $2 million) is based on ''the cost of body and powertrain, and also the experimental nature of some key components, like the fuel cell itself.'' 
 The pricing of hydrogen remains fluid. The Department of Energy has estimated that the cost of a kilogram of hydrogen (with roughly the energy content of a gallon of gasoline) could fall to $3 by 2008, but that assumes certain economies of scale that have not yet been established. 
 The California Fuel Cell Partnership puts the average capital cost to add low-volume hydrogen refueling to gas stations in that state at $450,000. The cost of the Latham station -- opened by Honda and a locally based engineering company, Plug Power, aided by a $735,000 state grant -- is proprietary.
 At my daughters' school, the youngsters were happy to squeeze into the back seat like college students in a phone booth. Their questions about fuel cells were simple. 
 ''Is this the car of the future?'' they asked. ''Maybe,'' I said.

HEADLINE: Ellen Baer, David Lebenstein

 BODY:
Ellen K. Baer and David N. Lebenstein were married last evening at the Friends Meeting House in Manhattan. Cantor Cathy Lawrence officiated. Ms. Baer, 50, is keeping her name. 
 She is a partner at Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, an economic development and real estate consulting firm in Manhattan. She graduated from Kirkland College in Clinton, N.Y., and received an M.B.A. from Baruch College. 
 She is the daughter of Josephine Baer of Manhattan and the late Norman Baer. Her mother is a saleswoman at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The bride's father worked in Los Angeles as a radio producer for CBS Sports and was also a television producer.
 Mr. Lebenstein, 54, is the executive director for sales and leasing at Time Equities, a company in Manhattan that owns and manages real estate. He is a board member of the Citizens Budget Commission, which monitors New York City and State finances and operations. He graduated from Lehman College and received a degree from Brooklyn Law School. His previous marriage ended in divorce.
 He is a son of Mary Lebenstein of Flushing, Queens, and Alexander Lebenstein of Richmond, Va. His father, who retired as the owner of Pick and Save Kosher Meats, which operated butcher shops in Brooklyn and Long Beach, N.Y., is a docent at the Richmond Holocaust Museum. 
 It was their love of New York Jets football that brought Ms. Baer and Mr. Lebenstein together.
 On a Monday afternoon in September 2000, Mr. Lebenstein was at a golf and tennis outing with real estate colleagues and began talking with a woman there about the single life.
 Mr. Lebenstein, a Jets season-ticket holder, checked his watch and announced he had to leave because they were playing that evening. ''Have I got a girl for you,'' the woman said. ''My friend, Ellen, she's a tremendous Jets fan.''
 ''Oh, is she looking for tickets?'' he asked jokingly. 
 ''No,'' the woman responded, ''she has her own season tickets.''
 ''That was intriguing,'' Mr. Lebenstein recalled.
 He took Ms. Baer's number and called a few days later. The conversation was not the stuff fairy tales are made of. ''I was sort of busy,'' Ms. Baer remembered, ''and to be honest, I was quite rude to him.'' 
 A month passed, and then Ms. Baer called to apologize. By mid-October they agreed to meet for dinner in Midtown Manhattan. 
 It was a busy Friday night at the restaurant. Mr. Lebenstein, who likes to say he resembles the actor Paul Sorvino, told Ms. Baer he would pass himself off as Mr. Sorvino in the hope of getting a table.
 Ms. Baer recalled, ''I thought: 'Paul Sorvino? Oh God, what a jerk!''' 
 But as the evening progressed, she said she began to see ''a very genuine, very grown-up'' man sitting across the table from her.
 ''He walks into a room and fills it with warmth,'' she said. ''I had a rich, full life as a single woman before David came along, but I guess that true love can happen to anyone, even at 50.'' 
 Mr. Lebenstein said, ''She is a totally loving and devoted partner and pretty good company at Jets games, too.''

HEADLINE: If the Navy Leaves

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHILE the state is worried about the estimated $3-billion-a-year loss to its economy if the Naval Submarine Base in Groton is closed as the Pentagon recommended last month, the Blood Services division of the Connecticut Red Cross wonders what will happen to its blood supply.
 In the last 12 months, sailors and civilians at the base have donated 984 units of blood, said Lynn Townshend, a Red Cross spokeswoman. And that's not counting the effects of an economic downturn, which tends to affect all blood drives in the area.
 ''It could run into the thousands of units a year that we won't be collecting in southeastern Connecticut if the base closes,'' Ms. Townshend said. ''It would be a lot to make up.'' 
 There has been a lot of worry in Groton since the Pentagon's announcement. The president of the Little League is worried about having enough players to field teams, the school superintendent is concerned that some schools may close and the staff at the Senior Center wonder who will run the programs after its naval volunteers leave.
 While the rest of the state looks at the billions of dollars and thousands of jobs that will be lost, Groton has the concerns of a community that is about to lose at least 4,000 residents, about 10 percent of its population. 
 ''Who knows how long it will take to replace them with people moving into the area,'' Mark R. Oefinger, the Groton town manager, said. ''It's a lot of people leaving in a very short period of time, even if it stretches out longer than the five years the Navy said it will take. I'm not sure we can begin to gauge the impact right now. And the human impact is going to be even more significant, because sailors and their families are so active in Groton.''
 Indeed, sailors coach Little League teams, they volunteer at charities. Their spouses teach in the schools and hold important jobs such as lawyers and nurses. Their children fill the schools. About 25 percent of Groton's students are Navy children and 10 percent more are children of base workers. At the Charles Barnum Elementary School, which is adjacent to the Navy's largest housing complex, 90 percent of the 330 students are Navy children. Valerie G. Nelson, the school's principal, said it's not unusual to have a turnover of more than 200 students during the school year because of Navy transfers.
 ''The children are so resilient, though, you can'ttell who's new and who's been here for a while,'' Mrs.Nelson said. ''The only bad part is you're always saying goodbye to someone.''
 Beth Anne Trask, whose husband is a senior chief petty officer, works as a paraprofessional in the special-education department at the school. She said a half-dozen of the aides who work in the school are Navy spouses.
 ''Being here for so long, and knowing everybody, the idea of moving is a little scary,'' she said. ''Here, you know everybody on the waterfront, and everybody knows you. There's a comfort level that is hard to find in the Navy. At least half of my husband's military career has been spent here, so even if they do close it, we'll take it with us, and if they keep it open, we'll return.''
 The Groton schools superintendent, James E. Mitchell, said he expected to lose the federal impact aid that Groton receives because of the submarine base. The aid makes up about 10 percent of $65 million annual school budget. 
 ''Hopefully, if the Navy does pull out, it won't be quickly, because it would make it very difficult to plan for,'' Dr. Mitchell said. ''If they pull out over a longer period, it would mean a lot fewer teachers and probably fewer schools.''
 He said the schools would suffer in another regard as well: Members of the military and their spouses are a large portion of the school's volunteers. In a recent ceremony honoring volunteers, Dr. Mitchell acknowledged 17 members of the military, from the commanding officer of the base for helping to identify maintenance needs at Ledyard High School, to a Navy wife who raised thousands of dollars to pay for painting classrooms and setting up a computer network.
 Other organizations that rely on volunteers said that while the base closure may not be a fatal blow, they don't look forward to its effect.
 ''Our volunteer base is pretty diverse, but I can't say we wouldn't lose some very key people who have helped us in our work over the years,'' said Bradford Bates, executive director for the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity. ''The Navy has some very wonderful people who have put a lot of work into making Habitat successful. They're great workers, hard workers, always very dependable. They've always been a great asset.''
 Every Christmas, sailors from the base collect more than $60,000 worth of toys and cash for children of needy families. These donations are distributed by the eastern Connecticut office of the state's Department of Children and Families.
 ''That kind of work with needy kids in their community is a real display of the value that these men and women have,'' said Gary M. Kleeblatt, a spokesman for the department. ''It shows you they are an important part of the fabric of the community. And it's efforts like that, from the community, that are really the most effective.''
 Hundreds of sailors also volunteer annually for programs at the Senior Center, teaching computer classes, participating in the fall cleanup, delivering meals to shut-ins, and driving the elderly to medical appointments.
 ''If the base closes, it's going to be felt all over town, in ways we probably can't even guess right now,'' said John P. Silsby, the Groton town parks and recreation director.
 Frank Norosky, president of the Groton Little League, wonders what's going to happen to the youth baseball schedule if all the military dependents leave. Many of the coaches are sailors and many players are Navy children. 
 ''It would leave us down several teams, and take away our ability to fill the schedule,'' Mr. Norosky said. The remaining teams would probably end up having to play each other several times each season. ''It would be a tremendous blow to our program.''
 The Department of Defense estimates the closure of the base could eliminate more than 16,000 jobs. The state had previously estimated spinoff effects could raise that number to more than 25,000, and the annual impact on the state economy could exceed $3 billion in lost wages and federal spending.
 The recommendation now goes to the Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which is to hold a hearing on July 6 in Boston. The commission has until September to review the list and decide on any changes. Four of the nine members of the commission toured the base on Tuesday.The commission will forward its final list to President Bush, who must accept or reject it as a whole. If the president accepts it, it goes to Congress, which must vote to reject it within 30 days, or it becomes law.
 The time line means the state probably won't know until December, at the earliest, whether any save-the-base initiative has been successful, which means months of anxiety for people who worry about the impact on day-to-day life in the region.
 Thomas A. Sheridan, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut, said the economic disruption would involve more than just jobs on the base. If the Navy pulls out, a lot of people in non-Navy jobs would go with it.
 ''There are a huge number of Navy spouses who work in local businesses,'' said Mr. Sheridan, who employs one of them in his office. Some of the spouses work as nurses or lawyers or in other professional capacities, but many of them are young and move every couple of years with their husband or wife in the service, and so fill service jobs in retail, tourism or entertainment.
 ''I'd say we're talking 2,000, 3,000, and maybe as many as 5,000,'' he said. ''The impact from the loss of those people is going to put a lot of pressure on the casinos and other businesses that rely heavily on this type of labor.''
 Jennifer L. Millspaw runs a cosmetics business out of the house where she lives with her husband, Petty Officer First Class Keith Millspaw, an electronics technician who works at the Naval Submarine Support Facility, a shore-based repair station in Groton.
 ''It's an easy business to pack up and move, but it wouldn't be so easy rebuilding my customer base,'' said Mrs. Millspaw, who estimates that 70 percent of her clientele come from outside the Navy. ''And I have friends who have just bought a house or started a family because they thought they were going to be here for a while, so it's going to be difficult for them.'' 
 Janet D. Pearce, executive director of the United Way of Southeastern Connecticut, said her greatest fear is that the base closure would put thousands of people out of work and cause an economic downturn that forces local governments to curtail spending on social services.
 ''It would be a double whammy -- just as the service needs increase, the funds for paying for those services would decline,'' Mrs. Pearce said.
 And it would likely cut into United Way collections even before the base is actually shut down, she said. ''Fear is the biggest killer in a United Way campaign, and the possibility of losing your job is one of the greatest fears,'' she said.
 Mr. Oefinger, the town manager, said there is a lot of retail development along Route 12, just south of the base, including car dealers and grocery and department stores, that serve the Navy population.
 ''The people who are in the Navy go out to the movies, to a restaurant, they buy a pair of shoes for their kid or a new family car -- if we lose those things, it's going to hurt,'' Mr. Oefinger said.
 ''The base closure commission isn't going to be swayed by arguments about the local economic impact, because closing a base anywhere is going to generate local economic impact,'' he said. ''We have to make a case for the military value of the base so we can keep it here.''

HEADLINE: If They Gave Nobels for Networking...

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON was riveted last week by the unveiling of the 30-year-old secret of Deep Throat, but behind all the talk about the ethics of leaks and the business of journalism was a gem of a parable about how the city really works. Aficionados ferreted it out instantly in the first paragraphs of Bob Woodward's tale, stripped across The Washington Post's front page, of how he first met W.Mark Felt in a chance encounter that Mr. Woodward called one of the most important of his life.
 Mr. Woodward, then a 27-year-old Navy lieutenant who sometimes carried documents to the West Wing, described a night in 1970 when he was waiting with papers outside the White House Situation Room. A distinguished-looking gentleman took a seat near him. He turned out to be Mr. Felt, a senior official in the F.B.I., and in a scene worthy of a Beckett play, the two men struck up a conversation as they waited in the dead time. 
 Mr. Woodward, anxious and confused about his future, nonetheless displayed the kind of terrier instincts that would later serve him so well. He peppered Mr. Felt with questions about his job, extracted his phone number and over the years cultivated Mr. Felt as a mentor and friend. When the Watergate break-in occurred, the fledgling Washington Post reporter had a vital relationship with the leaker, christened Deep Throat, who had no small part in bringing down a president and making Mr. Woodward's career.
 In short, it was a lesson in what is now called networking, or the importance of personal relationships in the small town of the nation's capital.
 ''If I hadn't taken a course with Paul Wolfowitz decades ago, I probably wouldn't be in Washington,'' said I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, who in 1973 was a student in Mr. Wolfowitz's political science class at Yale. Mr. Libby went on to work for Mr. Wolfowitz at the State Department in the Reagan administration and at the Pentagon in the first Bush administration.
 Mr. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary who is now the World Bank president, had a boss, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has a parallel 30-year friendship with Mr. Libby's boss, the vice president.
 ''I have this little game I play in my head when someone gets an appointment,'' said Chris Matthews, the host of MSNBC's ''Hardball.'' ''And I say, 'Now, how did that happen?' And then someone will say, 'Well, they went to school together,' or 'They live next door to each other,' or 'Their wives are friends.' And you go, 'Oh, yeah,' and it clicks.'' On the other hand, he said, ''serendipity is a big part of our lives, but it grows in direct proportion to sociability.''
 Or ambition. Bill Clinton and both George Bushes were often Olympic-class networkers who saw Washington as a hunting ground, which is one reason they got to the White House in the first place. But few in modern history can match Lyndon B. Johnson, who had skills for spotting and seducing power that are unrivaled today.
 ''Johnson had a genius for seeing who could help him, and making them like him,'' said Robert A. Caro, the Johnson biographer. ''Everybody in Washington networks, but nobody could do it like Lyndon Johnson.''
 The quintessential L.B.J. story occurred in 1937, when the 28-year-old Johnson, a newly elected congressman from Texas, spent a day traveling across the state by train with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who promptly returned to Washington and told his powerful aide, Thomas G. Corcoran, according to Mr. Caro: ''I've just met the most remarkable young man. Now, you're going to help him with anything you can.''
 In no time at all, Johnson had befriended a young, influential group of New Dealers -- James H. Rowe, William O. Douglas, Abe Fortas -- who used him as a conduit to Sam Rayburn, the formidable House speaker whom Johnson had cultivated, too. ''He immediately saw that these were the young guys who were going someplace, and that years from now, they might be able to help him,'' Mr. Caro said.
 That, of course, they did, in the familiar Washington pattern of young turks rising to power together. The Rayburn-Johnson bond is another pattern, that of the older man-younger man relationship, a model that loosely fits Mr. Woodward and Mr. Felt.
 ''I love the generational aspect to it,'' said Christopher Buckley, the author of 11 books, 6 of them Washington novels, speaking of Mr. Woodward's pursuit of Mr. Felt. ''It's the not quite old, but wise elder man and the scrappy but confused younger naval officer looking for direction in his life.'' 
 Mr. Woodward, Mr. Buckley noted, ''depicts himself as an Energizer Bunny.'' He added: ''You can almost hear Felt saying, 'Oh no, not him again,' like he's almost wishing someone would hurry up and invent Caller ID.''
 Networking, of course, occurs across the country, although it is most intense in population clusters focused on a single business -- Hollywood, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, the Research Triangle of North Carolina. Washington obviously distinguishes itself with politics, a people trade that requires more networking for success than most.
 ''Everybody gets together in the grand smorgasbord of Washington by knowing people,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a lobbyist and former chief of staff in Ronald Reagan's White House who came to town in 1965 as a summer intern for Jacob Javits, the Republican senator from New York. ''It's the way you go from administration to administration. It's the way you go from Capitol Hill to an administration, or from an administration to the private sector.''
 Robert S. Strauss, a champion across-the-aisle networker who is the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a Bush family friend, recalled that when he arrived in Washington from Texas in 1970, he instantly recognized that a skill for personal relationships would make the difference in any success he would have.
 ''Listen, if I had come here as a brilliant tax lawyer, I would have been a success as a tax lawyer,'' Mr. Strauss said. ''But my strength was people.'' In short order, Mr. Strauss was treasurer of the Democratic Party, and then its chairman.
 ''And I was about as good with people as most folks,'' he said. ''That was my strength, and I built on my strength.''

HEADLINE: Some Skilled Foreigners Find Jobs Scarce in Canada

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 2 

 BODY:
Gian S. Sangha wanted to work so badly he cut his hair and removed his turban when interviewing, even though it compromised his Sikh beliefs. He sent hundreds of resumes. He prayed fervently and finally bought a Buddha statue for good luck.
 But Mr. Sangha, 55, an environmental scientist from India, could not seem to get a job in Canada, his adopted country, despite a doctorate from Germany, two published books and university teaching experience in the United States. 
 ''Here in Canada, there is a hidden discrimination,'' Mr. Sangha said over cups of Indian tea and spicy pakoras, or fritters, in the dining room of his home in the suburb of Surrey. To scrape by, he once cut lawns, and now does clerical work and shares his house with his extended family. 
 It was not supposed to be this way in Canada, which years ago put out a welcome mat to professionals around the developing world. With a declining birthrate, an aging population and labor shortages in many areas, Canada, a sparsely populated nation, has for decades encouraged foreign engineers, health professionals, software designers and electricians.
 But the results of this policy have been mixed, for Canada and for the immigrants. Recent census data and academic studies indicate that the incomes and employment prospects of immigrants are deteriorating. Specialists say a growing number of immigrants have been forced to rely on unemployment insurance and welfare, and some have even returned to their homelands or migrated to the United States.
 About 25 percent of recent immigrants with a university degree are working at jobs that require only a high school diploma or less, government data show.
 ''The most mobile workers in the world come to Canada and find themselves immobilized,'' said Faviola Fernandez, a teacher from Singapore who became an immigrant advocate after finding the process of getting a teaching license in Canada so unwieldy that she gave up. 
 Over the last decade, the country has attracted 200,000 to 250,000 immigrants a year -- measured as a percentage of the population, that is triple the rate in the United States. Canada's largest cities are ethnic mosaics of great diversity. One in every six people in Canada immigrated, giving it the world's second-highest proportion of immigrants. Only Australia's is higher.
 Officials in South Africa and other countries have even begun to complain to Canadian officials that they are losing talent trained in their universities in a brain drain they can ill afford.
 But very frequently, highly skilled immigrants, who are nearly half of those who come here, are driving taxis and trucks, working in factories or as security guards, and hoping their children will do better.
 The Canadian public continues to support the government's goal of increasing immigration, and relations among ethnic groups are good, though neighborhoods in some cities are becoming more segregated. But some fear that if opportunities for immigrants do not expand, social cohesion may suffer.
 ''The existing system is broken,'' said Jeffrey G. Reitz, a sociologist who studies immigration at the University of Toronto. ''The deteriorating employment situation might mean that Canada will not be able to continue this expansionist immigration program in the positive, politically supported environment that we've seen in the past.''
 Mr. Reitz estimates that foreign-educated immigrants earn a total of $2 billion less than an equivalent number of native-born Canadians with comparable skills because they work in jobs below their training levels. Drawing on census data, he judges that in 1980, new immigrant men earned 80 percent of the salaries of native Canadian men, and that the proportion has now dropped to less than 70 percent. 
 He concludes that immigrant earnings in Canada are declining to the lower levels of the United States, where the skill levels of immigrants tend to be lower. 
 Academic specialists and immigrant advocates say that discrimination is one of many reasons for the problem. Native-born Canadians are better educated now than 25 years ago, so immigrants have more competition, some specialists note. But all agree that professional organizations and provincial licensing agencies have been slow to recognize foreign professional qualifications. The children of immigrants, who enter the job market with Canadian credentials, typically do better at acquiring high-paying jobs, immigration specialists note.
 ''We have an arcane infrastructure of professional organizations that essentially mitigate against the immediate integration of these highly skilled immigrants,'' Joe Volpe, the minister of citizenship and immigration, conceded in an interview.
 ''It's a shame we have a shortage of doctors, and yet we have thousands of foreign trained medical doctors and we don't recognize their credentials,'' he said. ''We haven't found an easy way of assessing their qualifications.''
 Mr. Volpe said he was concerned that news from disappointed job seekers would seep back to their native countries and discourage qualified people from immigrating. In a recent speech, Mr. Volpe committed more than $250 million over five years to pay for programs to accelerate professional integration. Complaints abound from those caught in this bind -- encouraged to come by federal policy, but hamstrung by expensive, time-consuming hurdles created by regulatory agencies and professional organizations. 
 ''Canada advertises that there are no foreigners here, that everyone is at home in this multicultural dream,'' said Farid A. Hadi, 40, a gynecologist who arrived from Egypt last year and is out of work. He is one of 1,200 applicants for 200 spots in an Ontario program to assess and retain foreign doctors seeking licenses to practice in the province. With his savings disappearing, he is looking for lab work. 
 ''I'll do whatever I need to support my family,'' he added, referring to his wife and three children. 
 Mr. Sangha is another example. Since the Canadian Embassy in India and a Canadian immigration consultant encouraged him to bring his family here in 1996, he has not had a single job that fits his qualifications. He would have left Canada long ago, he says, if not for his two children, who have become acclimated to Canada and are now young adults. In 2001, Mr. Sangha was turned down for a job as an environmental inspector with an agency of the Northwest Territories government. He took the case to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, where it is under consideration.
 The territorial government agency told the commission that Mr. Sangha had been rejected because he was overqualified and would have become bored. But Mr. Sangha said in an interview that, during his job interview, an agency official had shown crude disrespect by interrupting him and not paying attention to his responses, and that he was the victim of discrimination. ''It's a painful life,'' he said. ''I'm angry and frustrated. I never thought it would be like this in Canada.''

HEADLINE: No T.G.I.F. for Stocks as Gains Disappear

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market lost ground last week, as concerns about the economy and energy prices led stocks downward on Friday, eliminating earlier gains. 
 The government reported on Friday that job creation slowed in May. 
Earlier data, including a report on manufacturing, also suggested as that the economy might be slowing. Oil futures in New York, meanwhile, traded at $55.03 on Friday, up from $51.85 the previous week. 
 The setback for equities on Friday coincided with a stumble in the bond market, which had rallied earlier. On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond closed at 3.98 percent, down from 4.07 percent the previous week. But at one point on Friday, the yield fell all the way to 3.80 percent. Mortgage rates, which are linked to Treasuries, have fallen to their lowest levels in many months. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 81.58 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 10.460.97. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,196.02. The Nasdaq composite index lost 4.30 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,071.43. Because the markets were closed for the Memorial Day holiday on Monday, there were only four days of trading last week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Should Your Portfolio Vote 'Yes' on European Stocks?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
FRENCH and Dutch voters have ushered in a fresh period of political and economic uncertainty for the European Union by rejecting its proposed constitution, but many professional investors with global stock portfolios say the region still offers better prospects than the United States over the near to medium term. Their reasoning is that the American economy has enough uncertainty of its own.
 Francis X. Claro, senior portfolio manager at Evergreen Investments in Boston, said that in the United States ''there's a 6.5 percent current account deficit, an environment of rising rates, some inflation, oil is very high and you have a fiscal deficit.'' 
 ''It's not hard to see why investors may be reluctant to buy U.S. assets,'' he added.
 Any outperformance by European markets would continue a multiyear trend. While American stocks have recovered recently, they are still down sharply over the longer term. The Morgan Stanley Capital International USA index was down 14.6 percent over the five years through Friday, even after factoring in dividend payments. The MSCI index of European shares shows a gain of 0.7 percent in dollars over the same period. 
 In 2005, the trend has held until very recently. American stocks now have a slight advantage for the year, thanks to the fall of the euro, which reduces the value of European assets for American investors. The MSCI Europe index was down 0.8 percent in dollars through Friday, compared to a 0.2 percent loss for the MSCI USA index.
 The fact that the edge is so small, despite the euro's 10 percent decline this year and the recent ''no'' votes on the constitution, shows the resiliency of European markets. Dutch and French stocks rose modestly in the days after the referendums, although some analysts said the results could delay European economic changes.
 In a note to clients after the French vote, Philippe Tibi, research director in Paris for UBS, warned that ''structural reform and perhaps privatizations may also be sidelined again.''
 One reason the market impact was negligible may be that stocks are much cheaper in Europe than in the United States.
 ''We've been able to find more value in Europe,'' said Ray Vars, a manager of global stock portfolios at North Road Capital Management in New York. ''We can buy more return on equity for a cheaper price.''
 Paul R. Niven, head of strategy at F&C Asset Management in London, concurred. ''Europe looks undervalued compared to the United States,'' he said. ''Some markets have very attractive yields, and companies have been giving cash back to shareholders'' through buybacks and special dividends.
 Tim Harris, European equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in London, is less optimistic. He recently lightened the European stock component of his model portfolio.
 About two months ago, ''we took some of our European bets off the table because we saw no reason for Europe to outperform,'' he said. The sales amounted to 2 percent of the portfolio, he said, and the proceeds were placed in European commercial real estate. Mr. Harris suggested that investors in the United States keep the bulk of their portfolios at home.
 ''We tend to keep a home bias to protect against currency risk,'' he said.
 Generally over the last five years, that risk would have been worth taking. The dollar fell substantially against the euro and other European currencies over most of that time, which accounts for much of the superior performance of European stocks. The dollar is still down by more than 30 percent against the euro over that stretch.
 A weaker dollar has hurt American shares in two ways: the dollar values of assets denominated in other currencies have risen, and the shrinking of the dollar has caused some European investors to avoid American stocks. Gil Knight, senior fund manager at Gartmore Global Investments in suburban Philadelphia, warned that the same effect might occur in reverse if the dollar's recovery continued and Europeans began buying American stocks again.
 But he considers such events unlikely. ''Right now I would consider the U.K., Germany and Italy'' as good markets to invest in, Mr. Knight said, declining to be more specific. 
 Mr. Niven, at F&C, also recommends being heavily invested in Europe and lightly in the United States, although he suggested that European stocks were the lesser of several evils. ''Equity valuations look good, compared to bonds, but over all the outlook is uninspiring,'' he said. Pressed to offer some investment ideas, he said that European financial stocks look appealing.
 Mr. Vars, at North Road, likes European stocks in industries offering the prospect of stable earnings growth, especially pharmaceuticals and food and beverages. Among the drug companies he favors are GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in Britain, Sanofi-Aventis in France and Novartis of Switzerland. He also mentioned one American drug maker, Pfizer. Among food and beverage makers, he likes Diageo and Cadbury Schweppes of Britain. In other industries, Mr. Vars said that even after the increase in crude oil prices, energy concerns like Total of France and Eni of Italy are ''two companies that trade at compelling valuations.'' He also favors the French life insurance company AXA.
 There is little overlap between Mr. Vars's favorite sectors and those of Mr. Claro, at Evergreen. Mr. Claro prefers information technology, basic industries and the consumer discretionary sector, which encompasses such products as electronics and sports shoes.
 And the companies he recommends are smaller, including Photo-Me International of Britain. He called it ''a play on the migration from analog to digital photography.'' The company operates kiosks that allow users to print photographs from files stored on computer memory sticks. In Britain, France and Japan, it installs booths where customers can have passport-size photographs shot instantly. 
 Mr. Claro noted that France had introduced a new photo identification card for users of its state health care system. He said he expected the company's business to improve as the French sit for instant portraits. A new passport in Japan should have the same effect, he said.
 Another British company in Evergreen's portfolios is Ashtead, which rents equipment to the building industry. Construction is a volatile business, and equipment rental is even more so. Lately, he said, use of rental equipment has been rising, and so are the prices that owners command.
 On the Continent, Mr. Claro says he likes the United Services Group, a Dutch company that runs temporary-employment agencies in Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. Business was up 20 percent in the first couple of months this year, compared with 2004, he said.
 Another holding is Adidas-Salomon, the German maker of sneakers and sports gear. Adidas benefits from a weak dollar, he said, by manufacturing in countries with currencies tied to the dollar while conducting much of its sales in Europe.
 It has improved its American business with a change of management, Mr. Claro said, and he predicts sales will grow next year when Germany plays host to the World Cup soccer tournament.
 Another point in Adidas's favor is its price, he said. It sells at 12 times Evergreen's estimate of 2006 earnings.
 MR. CLARO said his preference for Europe was based on more than ephemera like valuation discrepancies, foreign-exchange movements and the latest economic reports. The referendums last week may raise doubts about state-led economic changes, but he says he believes that reform is still bound to occur, even if it is one company at a time.
 ''Long term, opportunities in Europe are being driven by a financial discipline that is being instilled,'' he said. Noting that restructurings intended to make businesses run more efficiently have long been promised but seldom delivered, he added, ''I think it's actually happening, and over the next 15 years we're going to see a true shift.''

HEADLINE: Lessons in Gratitude, At the Basement Sink

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MY father entered Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., in September 1931. The United States was entering the downswing of a small uptick at the beginning of what would be the worst industrial depression in history. 
 My father had an unemployed father (a former skilled tool-and-die maker) and a mother who worked as a sales clerk at a department store in Schenectady, N.Y. He had no money, no financial reserves, no social connections. 
 He told me of many jobs while he was at Williams, but one stays in my memory a dozen times a day, especially when I am working by traveling through a dismal, endless security line or waiting in a line to check into a hotel or noticing that my bed in my new hotel has a ripped sheet and is next to a noisy air-conditioner. 
 My father had a job thanks to a kindly man named Taylor Ostrander at a fraternity called Sigma Psi. My father's job was to wash dishes in the basement of the frat house as the other boys finished their lunches and dinners. (One of the boys, Richard Helms, went on to be director of the C.I.A., but that's another story.) He toiled down there at a huge sink, with steam rising and detergent getting on his unimaginably soft hands. He wore a stocking cap to keep his already curly hair from going crazy. 
 It was the 1930's, and Jews weren't allowed in any fraternity at Williams. Many years later, maybe in the 1980's, by which time my father had become a major economist and public policy discussant, I asked him if he felt angry about having to wash dishes to pay his way through school in a fraternity that didn't admit Jews. ''Not at all,'' he said. ''I didn't have the luxury of feeling aggrieved. I was just grateful to have a job so I could go to one of the best schools in the country.''
 I think that this was the secret ingredient -- aside from astonishing intelligence and versatility -- in my father's success and happiness. He did not feel that he had the luxury of feeling aggrieved. He was just grateful to have a chance. Or, I can say, he was grateful for the opportunities he had been given. I think about this in other situations, too. A few days ago, on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Denver, a group of flight attendants gathered near my seat in the last row of first class. One was either wearing or displaying a perfume I was allergic to, and I went into a wild asthmatic attack in which I could simply not breathe for an uncomfortable amount of time. 
 When I revived, I thought of lodging a complaint and throwing a fit. But then I thought: ''Well, these poor people. Think of what United employees are going through. I am just grateful I have a job. Why torture them any more than they are already tortured?'' 
 I was on my way to another job. I got to the next stop in my journey, Baltimore, and my driver could not recall where he had left the car. We had to have the airport police find it for us. He also did not know his way from Baltimore to Washington. (I am not kidding.) Exhausted as I was, I had to guide him all of the way. Never mind. I was grateful that I was in a car with a driver and on my way to a superimportant gig. This man was probably about where my father was in 1931. I decided not to pick on him.
 Now, I have found that I cannot predict the stock market except over very long periods. I cannot tell you when the housing bubble will burst -- only that it will burst. I cannot tell you when the dollar will stop rallying -- only that it will stop. So I cannot tell you anything that, in a few minutes, will tell you how to be rich.
 But I can tell you how to feel rich, which is far better, let me tell you firsthand, than being rich. Be grateful. Be grateful you have a job, even if it takes you to the world's worst airport, Dulles, and to the world's worst security lines, also at Dulles. 
 Be grateful you have a job to travel to, even if you must travel to a hotel room where the previous tenant was a cigar tester for Fidel Castro. (But do ask for another room.) Be grateful about everything and you'll feel a lot richer than the billionaires I know who are always moaning about everything that happens and who lament, like King Canute, that they cannot control the waves of the market or the business cycle.
 When I got to Washington with my novitiate driver, I rested. The next day, I spoke to about 250 kids, perhaps ages 5 to 15, about how grateful the nation was to them. Their fathers had died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and in training accidents. They were as good, brave, intelligent and yet haunted-looking as any kids I have ever met. Be grateful for their sacrifice and that your son or daughter is not one of them.
 Then I spoke to about 500 widows, widowers, mothers, fathers, fiancees of men who had been killed in the war on terror. They were totally devoted to one another and to helping one another through their grueling losses. They were probably the most spiritually fit, unselfish human beings I have ever met. One showed me the contents of his son's wallet when his son was killed. A dollar bill still had a blood stain on it. The father cried when he showed it to me. Be grateful that the armed forces of this country have such brave families. 
 AS I told them, we could do without Hollywood for a century. We could not do without them and their sacrifice for a week. Gratitude. As my pal Phil DeMuth says, it's the only totally reliable get-rich-quick scheme. Gratitude. Losing the luxury of feeling aggrieved when, if you look closely, you have an opportunity. My father washed dishes at the Sigma Psi house so that he could build an education and a life for the family he did not even have yet. 
 At my house, I always insist on doing the dishes, and I feel a thrill of gratitude for what washing a dish can do with every swipe of the sponge. Wiping away the selfishness of the moment, building a life for my son. The zen of dishwashing. The zen of gratitude. The zen of riches. Thanks, Pop.

HEADLINE: How We Feel About Home

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS and MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
SYLVIA RINI, an idealistic public schoolteacher, lives in a classic New York shoebox: a 400-square foot studio. Yes, she admits, the apartment is small. But the space is renovated, and located on the respectable Upper East Side, a neighborhood where she can feel that she has arrived.
In Parkchester, in the Bronx, Alane Johnson knows she should feel lucky to be paying a relatively modest $865 a month for her one-bedroom apartment in a safe if unprepossessing neighborhood. But Ms. Johnson, who works for Metro-North Railroad and is a single mother, feels cramped and wishes she could afford to live in the suburbs. 
 Every New Yorker has heard such stories. Often, the tales are more extreme: the smug couple who tell of the killing they made on the co-op they bought just a few years ago, the 20-something who gasps at the rent for a tiny one-bedroom, the single man with the closetless, kitchenless, windowless apartment. As the city grapples with galloping real estate prices and fears of a housing bubble -- Prudential Douglas Elliman says the average price of a Manhattan apartment hit $1.2 million in the first quarter of this year, up 23 percent since December -- the stories have become more frequent, more vivid and more embroidered. 
 Unaddressed by these tales, however, are far more basic questions. How many New Yorkers, like Ms. Rini, are fundamentally happy with where they live, and why? How many, like Ms. Johnson, are frustrated? How many think their living quarters are roomy? How many think they are too expensive? 
 To try to answer these questions, a New York Times poll has surveyed 1,014 city residents about how they really feel about the city's bustling real estate market. According to the poll, a majority of New Yorkers -- 62 percent -- said they had about the right amount of space in their houses or apartments, and an additional 5 percent said they had more than enough space. About one in three New Yorkers, or 32 percent, said their houses or apartments were too small. 
 When asked about cost, half of the New Yorkers polled said they paid as much as they could afford for housing, and 14 percent said they could pay more if they wanted to. But 32 percent of city residents said they were paying more than they could on their rent or mortgage. The poll was conducted Feb. 4 through 13 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
 One person who was not surprised by the basic finding that most New Yorkers are content with their housing is Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban studies at New York University. Most middle-income New Yorkers, he pointed out, live in the city because they want to be here, and are willing to put up with a certain amount of inconvenience and even hardship to do so. ''New York is not the suburbs, where people judge their housing separate from the community in which they are situated,'' Professor Moss said. ''Status in the suburbs often depends on the size of one's property. In the city, status depends on where you live.''
 But when it came to which New Yorkers were happy, the poll found sharp variations among residents. Manhattanites, apartment dwellers, renters and low-income New Yorkers were more inclined to describe their living quarters as too small. For example, while 62 percent of people with annual household incomes under $30,000 said they had enough space, for people with incomes over $75,000 the figure was 73 percent. 
 As for cost, renters were more likely to say they were paying too much for housing (40 percent) than were owners (22 percent). People with children under 18 were also more likely to say their housing was too expensive (44 percent) than were people without children in that age bracket (24 percent). Manhattanites were more likely than residents of other boroughs to say they could afford to pay more (18 percent, compared with 13 percent). 
 The attitudes of New Yorkers now are similar to what they were in 1997. A Times poll conducted at that time found that 66 percent of New Yorkers considered the size of their houses or apartments to be about right, 28 percent said their homes were too small and 5 percent said they had more space than they needed. 
 But the results of the recent poll of New Yorkers differ sharply from a national New York Times poll conducted in March, which showed that Americans across the country were far more satisfied with their housing than city residents were. Americans nationally were less likely than New Yorkers to say they did not have enough space in their homes -- 20 percent to 32 percent -- or that they were paying more than they could afford -- 13 percent to 32 percent. These differences may stem partly from the fact that most of the Americans polled live in houses, while most New Yorkers live in apartments.
 Housing experts point to several forces that help shape the city's current housing mood. One major factor is the great good fortune of homeowners whose properties have skyrocketed in value. 
 Another is the departure from the city of people who can't handle its real estate costs. ''As the desire to live in New York City gets stronger, the people at the bottom end of the income spectrum are the people who get pushed out,'' said Chris Mayer, director of the Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia University Business School. ''I'm not making a social statement that that's good or bad. But when there's a lot of demand to live in the city, it changes the character of who lives in the city and makes it harder for people whose incomes don't grow very quickly to afford to stay.'' 

A Sense of Place, Not Space
 In purchasing her 400-square-foot studio apartment, Sylvia Rini followed the time-honored dictum that it is better to buy the smallest house in a premium neighborhood than the biggest house elsewhere. 
 Ms. Rini, an energetic 35-year-old with short-cropped ginger hair, grew up on the West Coast but is a New York buff. She keeps a copy of Kenneth Jackson's Encyclopedia of New York City on a prominent shelf, and her apartment is filled with photographs of the city. 
 As a modestly paid teacher in a public school in the Bronx, Ms. Rini lived in a variety of modest neighborhoods, from West Harlem to Boerum Hill in Brooklyn, before settling on the Upper East Side. She bought her studio at 62nd Street and First Avenue for just over $200,000 soon after Sept. 11, when some feared that New York might lose its cachet as a place to live. She is thrilled that such dire predictions did not come true, and that the value of her apartment has probably doubled.
 Although Ms. Rini's apartment is small, it has been cleverly renovated to tuck a full kitchen under a loft bedroom, and the high ceiling keeps the space from feeling cramped. Through gauzy curtains, she has a view of leafy trees and the mix-and-match buildings of East 62nd Street. She can also invite friends and relatives over without worrying that they will feel sorry for her, as they did when they visited some of her previous apartments.
 White walls amplify the light in the small space, and she can manage casual get-togethers of five or six people using a coffee table and TV dinner trays. She has also streamlined her life enough that she does not have to rent storage. ''I do have two decent-size closets,'' she said, ''one upstairs with the loft -- that has everything from the Christmas tree to luggage stuffed into it. Then the hall closet has all my clothes and the linens packed to the rafters.'' 
 When she feels squeezed, Ms. Rini reminds herself that she paid what now seems like a bargain-basement price to live in a fabulous neighborhood. ''If I lived in Los Angeles with this size apartment, I think that would be unacceptable,'' she said. ''But here, unless you're a millionaire, you live in a very tiny apartment.'' 

Yearning for a Suburb
 The one-bedroom apartment that seemed adequate when Alane Johnson lived by herself seems confining for two, especially when one of the two is a fretful infant and the other is a harried mother. Baby clothes hung out to dry festoon the kitchen, and the tiny living room is crammed with toys, stacks of disposable diapers, a flat-screen television and a computer, leaving little room to just walk around.
 ''It's always been a small apartment,'' said Ms. Johnson, a 25-year-old single woman with a warm smile and a voice to match. ''But I could deal with it, because I didn't have my son at the time.'' 
 Ms. Johnson's pleasant manner makes her well suited to her job as a customer service representative for Metro-North, working the rush-hour shift in the booth under the clock at Grand Central Terminal. But she often thinks that she could use a customer service representative herself, especially someone who could offer good advice about housing.
 About 10 months ago, when Ms. Johnson was pregnant with her son, Royce, she joined the ''first-time home-buyers' club'' at her bank. Since then, she has been socking away a few dollars a month and hopes to save enough for the closing costs on a new condo or house.
 As a renter with no equity to cash in, and with a salary of about $42,000 a year, Ms. Johnson feels priced out of most city neighborhoods. So she has been looking in towns along Metro-North lines -- Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Tarrytown and Ossining -- where small condominiums start at more than $100,000 and houses at $400,000. 
 She hopes for a one-bedroom condo with an extra nook for the baby, but she worries that if she pays more for housing, she won't be able to afford the baby sitter or save for the future.
 Many of her friends, even those in their 20's, have avoided real estate problems by moving in with their parents. 
 ''I think I'm the one that's strugglingthe most,'' Ms. Johnson said, ''becausenot all of my friends have children, and if they do, they haven't moved out of the house yet.''

A Lifetime Invested
 When all else fails, New Yorkers are champion rationalizers. Sure, their situation may be bad, but compared with what?
 ''Next to people living in Darfur. ,'' said Bart Auerbach, an antiquarian bookappraiser, his voice trailing off. In keeping with his rarefied profession, Mr. Auerbach, 67, is a Gorey-esque figure, a lean,mustachioed six-footer who favors tidy jeans and work shirts while working at home. 
 Mr. Auerbach lives with his wife, a lawyer, on West End Avenue in the high 70's, and he describes their book-lined two-bedroom apartment as fairly comfortable, especially since 1995, when their son went off to college and then moved to San Francisco.
 Residents of their apartment since 1979, they bought it when the building went co-op in 1985, at an insider price that Mr. Auerbach would not divulge. But given the way housing prices in his neighborhood have escalated in recent years, it is probably safe to say that the value of his property has appreciated significantly. 
 The walls of the apartment are lined with hundreds of antiquarian reference books. But there is still ample room for Persian rugs, a graceful maroon Chesterfield couch and a cherrywood imitation 1820's Irish Regency desk with bear-paw feet. 
 Mr. Auerbach is satisfied with his living conditions, he explained, in part because he has built a life in this apartment, and it has been a good one. After decades there, he said, ''you get kind of attached to it.''
 He is also keenly aware of the reasons he chose to move to New York from his native Philadelphia in 1960. For example, although his son attended a costly private school, Collegiate, it was only three blocks away. By living in the city, the couple was also spared car expenses and the commuting costs of living in the suburbs. 
 Moreover, Mr. Auerbach likes ordering dinner from any conceivable ethnic restaurant and having it delivered to his door within minutes. He also loves looking at the city's architecture -- he lives in a 1936 Art Deco building -- and he likes to walk everywhere.
 ''I can get from the 80's to the Plaza Hotel in 45 minutes,'' he said. 

The Right Price in Chelsea
 Charles Shaw, a private-school teacher turned Fordham Law School student, is one of those happy owners who bought apartments before prices soared. 
 In 1997, Mr. Shaw purchased a place on the Upper East Side for $180,000, figuring the building was a good bet because a friend had bought a $45,000 studio there in the early 90's and sold it five years later for $155,000. But Mr. Shaw found the Upper East Side ''sterile and boring,'' so when one of two apartments in Chelsea owned by his brother Timothy became vacant, he grabbed it, and rented out his own place.
 ''I'm a gay man, and I just find it a lot more interesting downtown,'' said Mr. Shaw, an athletic-looking 35-year-old who favors flip-flops and well-laundered T-shirts. His apartment, at 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue, is a small studio, yet Mr. Shaw is content. ''New Yorkers come to accept whatever it is they live in,'' he said. ''I mean, I'd love something bigger, but it's fine. I live alone, I don't have a significant other, and it's perfectly situated.''
 The decor is what Mr. Shaw calls ''comfortable all-American, very lived-in rather than chic.'' It features worn diner stools at the kitchen counter and books stacked on shelves up, down and sideways. A wall of mirrors, left by the previous owner, strikes him as tacky but contributes a sense of space. The couch substitutes for a living-room wall, with his bed right behind it. 
 The building has an interior garden, and the quiet is conducive to competing for a place on Fordham's law review. Mr. Shaw can also wander upstairs and visit his brother. ''It's almost like a dorm room,'' he said. He wishes the apartment had more natural light -- a taller building blocks it out -- but because he pays just the $650 monthly maintenance, ''economically, it's wonderful.''
 When he visits his other brother in northern Virginia, he realizes that if he sold his apartment, he could afford to buy a huge house somewhere else. ''But,'' he said, ''I don't want to live in northern Virginia.'' 

BEHIND THE NUMBERS
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Feb. 4 through Feb. 13 with 1,014 adults throughout New York City. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of active residential exchanges across New York City. 
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form complete telephone numbers, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age, and education. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New York City. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: A New Game: Pin the Tail on the Economic Expansion

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF the textbooks are correct, stocks eventually reflect the market's prevailing expectations for economic growth. The problem, however, is that there are two wildly divergent views about how the economy is doing. Or so it may seem.
 On the one hand, you have the Federal Reserve Board, which has made its opinions clear by raising short-term interest rates eight times over the last year. 
 Minutes from the Fed's most recent monetary policy meeting show that central bankers are confident the economy is still on track for growth. The recent soft patch is ''likely to be transitory,'' the minutes said, and it would be a mistake to ''overreact to a comparatively small number of disappointing indicators, especially when economic fundamentals appeared to remain quite supportive of continued solid expansion.''
 On the other side of this debate is the bond market, which appears to be ignoring the Fed -- by focusing squarely on the disappointing signs. Among them are slumping manufacturing activity and four consecutive months of decline in the leading economic indicators. 
 A result is that the target for the federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, has climbed to 3 percent from 1 percent since the Fed began tightening monetary policy last June. At the same time, yields on 10-year Treasury notes have fallen below 4 percent from 4.62 percent. In industry jargon, the yield curve has flattened considerably.
 For a brief time starting in February, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, seemed to be winning this debate with the bond market. Shortly after Mr. Greenspan described as a ''conundrum'' the simultaneous decline in long-term yields and climb in short-term ones, bond traders took notice, said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates. In fact, yields on 10-year Treasuries jumped more than half a percentage point by late March, before reversing course. 
 Today, conventional wisdom seems to be shifting slightly to the bond market's point of view. A Merrill Lynch survey in May showed that 52 percent of global money managers say the current economic expansion is nearing an end. By comparison, 44 percent say we're only midway into this economic cycle. (Since 1945, the average expansion has lasted more than five years; the current cycle is about three and a half years old.)
 In reality, the two camps aren't all that far apart. The Fed, for instance, is not claiming that economic growth is accelerating, or that the economy will keep growing in perpetuity. Instead, it is just making the case that the economy is in the middle innings of growth.
 By contrast, the bond market isn't arguing that we're headed for recession just yet. Recessions are typically preceded by an inverted yield curve, where long-term rates are lower than short-term rates. For the moment, the yield curve has simply narrowed, as it typically does in times of Fed tightening. The bond market is simply saying that we're in the late innings of growth. 
 For most buy-and-hold investors, this distinction between the mid- and late-cycle phases of the economy isn't that huge. 
 Whatever inning we're in, it's clear that this economic cycle is maturing. When that happens, stock market leadership typically shifts from fast-growing small stocks to shares of large, blue-chip companies that can produce consistent earnings growth without the need for a rapidly accelerating economy. To be sure, investors have been predicting a blue-chip resurgence for years, without much to show for it. But after five years of small-cap outperformance, many market strategists say change is in store. So far this year, the Standard & Poor's 500 index of blue chips has lost 1.3 percent, while the S.&P. 600 index of small stocks is down 1.1 percent. 
 ''We think we're reaching an inflection point,'' said Joe Battipaglia, chief investment officer at the brokerage firm Ryan Beck & Company, who contends that the economy is in its mid-cycle phase.
 Even if economic growth slows considerably, Mr. Battipaglia predicts that large stocks will outperform small ones because the blue chips are less volatile and offer more downside protection in the form of dividends.
 Typically, in the middle to late stages of an economic cycle, value-oriented stocks -- those that have been beaten down or overlooked and that trade at relatively inexpensive prices -- are likely to thrive, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.
 But because value stocks have trounced growth-oriented shares for the last five years, many investment strategists say the trend may be about to reverse.
 Mr. Battipaglia contends that consumers are better off financially than some economists say, so the consumer discretionary sector, which is more growth-oriented than the broad market, should show promise. Robert Turner, chairman and chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners, says investors should not overlook tech stocks.
 Even if the current economic cycle is nearing an end, the inclusion of some growth stocks in a portfolio could offer some protection. That's because two of the most popular value-oriented sectors, financial services stocks and energy, could be hit hard in a downturn. If the economy is approaching a recession, financials would be hurt by rising credit risks while energy prices are likely to slip in the face of falling demand.
 YOUR opinion about whether the economy is in its mid- or late-cycle phase could affect the type of value stocks you own. If you think the economic expansion is only half through, you may want to stick with the red-hot energy sector. David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, says there are still opportunities for investors in oil and natural gas stocks.
 But if you think the economy is about to roll over, more defensive value areas may be attractive -- including consumer staples and utilities, which tend to do best as the economy shifts from expansion to contraction. 
 Whichever you choose, ''this is not the time to be making big sector bets,'' said Nicholas P. Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort Washington Investment Advisors.
 For one thing, some economists and market strategists say the bond market may not be sending a crystal-clear sign of an economic slowdown. They wonder if other factors, like the voracious foreign appetite for Treasuries, are contributing to low bond yields.
 Another possibility is that the Fed and the bond market could each be partly correct. In other words, the cycle could be between the middle and late innings.
 If that's the case, Mr. Sargen says, there is an argument for ''parking your portfolio in the middle of the road'' -- just to play it safe.

HEADLINE: Forget the Founding Fathers

BYLINE: By Barry Gewen. 
Barry Gewen is an editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
THE founding fathers were paranoid hypocrites and ungrateful malcontents. What was their cherished Declaration of Independence but empty political posturing? They groaned about the burden of taxation, but it was the English who were shouldering the real burden, paying taxes on everything from property to beer, from soap to candles, tobacco, paper, leather and beeswax. The notorious tea tax, which had so inflamed the people of Massachusetts, was only one-fourth of what the English paid at home; even Benjamin Franklin labeled the Boston Tea Party an act of piracy. Meanwhile, smugglers, with the full connivance of the colonists, were getting rich at the expense of honest tax-paying citizens. The recent French and Indian War had doubled Britain's national debt, but the Americans, who were the most immediate beneficiaries, were refusing to contribute their fair share. 
 The revolutionaries complained about a lack of representation in Parliament, but in this they were no different from the majority of Englishmen. What was more, the God-given or nature-given rights they claimed for themselves included the right to hold Africans in bondage. Edward Gibbon, who knew something about the ups and downs of history, opposed the rebels from the House of Commons. Samuel Johnson called them ''a race of convicts'' who ''ought to be thankful for any thing we allow them short of hanging.'' 
 Observed from across the Atlantic, the story of the Revolution looks very different from the one every American child grows up with. To see that story through British eyes, as Stanley Weintraub's ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire: 1775-1783'' enables us to do, is to see an all-too-familiar tale reinvigorated. Weintraub reminds us that justice did not necessarily reside with the rebels, that the past can always be viewed from multiple perspectives. And he confronts us with the fact that an American triumph was anything but inevitable. History of course belongs to the victors. If Britain's generals had been more enterprising, if the French had failed to supply vital military and financial assistance, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and the rest would be known to us not as political and philosophical giants but as reckless (and hanged) losers, supporting players in a single act of Britain's imperial drama. We would all be Canadians now, with lower prescription drug costs and an inordinate fondness for winter sports.
 But Weintraub's book does more than add a fresh dimension to a tired subject. By giving the war a genuinely international flavor, it points the way to a new understanding of American history. Instead of looking out at the rest of the world from an American perspective, it rises above national boundaries to place the past in a global context. This is a significant undertaking. At a time when the role of the United States in the world has never been more dominant, or more vulnerable, it is crucially important for us to see how the United States fits into the jigsaw of international relations. Weintraub indicates how American history may come to be written in the future.
 A globalized history of the United States would be only the latest twist in a constantly changing narrative. Broadly speaking, since the end of World War II there have been three major schools of American history; each reflected and served the mood of the country at a particular time. In the 1940's and 50's, that mood was triumphal. As Frances FitzGerald explains in ''America Revised: History Schoolbooks in the 20th Century,'' the United States was routinely presented in those years as ''perfect: the greatest nation in the world, and the embodiment of democracy, freedom and technological progress.'' The outside world may have been intruding on the slumbering nation through the cold war, the United Nations, NATO and the rise of Communist China, but the textbooks' prevailing narrative remained resolutely provincial. ''The United States had been a kind of Salvation Army to the rest of the world,'' the books taught. ''Throughout history, it had done little but dispense benefits to poor, ignorant and diseased countries. . . . American motives were always altruistic.'' 
 The histories of that time, FitzGerald says, were ''seamless,'' a word that applied not only to schoolbooks but also to the work of the period's most sophisticated scholars and writers, men like Richard Hofstadter and Louis Hartz. Reacting against the challenge of totalitarianism, they went looking for consensus or, in Hofstadter's phrase, ''the central faith'' of America, and they found it in the national commitment to bourgeois individualism and egalitarianism. Americans clustered around a democratic, capitalist middle. Uniquely among major nations, the United States had avoided serious ideological conflict and political extremes; even its radicals and dissenters adhered to what Hofstadter called the ''Whiggish center'' and Hartz termed ''the liberal tradition.'' Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote about ''the vital center.'' Daniel Bell spoke of ''the end of ideology.''
 Because they emphasized unity at the expense of division and dissent -- Hartz referred to ''the shadow world'' of American social conflict -- these consensus historians later were criticized for being conservative and complacent. There is some truth to this charge, but only some. As a group, they were reformers, even liberal Democrats, but their liberalism was pragmatic and incremental. Mindful of the leftist extremism of the 1930's, they looked upon idealism as something to be distrusted; grand visions, they had come to understand, could do grand damage. Taken too far, this viewpoint could lead to a defense of the status quo, or at least to a preference for the way things were to the way visionaries said they could be. Down that road, neoconservatism beckoned. Hofstadter, for one, was discomforted by some of his critics, and admitted to having ''serious misgivings of my own about what is known as consensus history.'' It had never been his purpose, he explained, to deny the very real conflicts that existed within the framework he and others were attempting to outline. 
 Hofstadter acknowledged that his writing ''had its sources in the Marxism of the 1930's,'' and an alert reader could detect a residual Marxism, or at least an old-fashioned radicalism, in some of his comments in ''The American Political Tradition.'' Though the book appeared in the late 1940's, at the onset of one of the greatest economic booms in American history, Hofstadter was still complaining about ''bigness and corporate monopoly,'' misguidedly declaring that ''competition and opportunity have gone into decline.'' Similarly, in ''The Liberal Tradition in America,'' Hartz brilliantly but, it seemed, ruefully, analyzed why socialism had failed to take root in the United States. 
 However much these thinkers had been disappointed by Marxism, they were hardly ready to embrace straightforward majoritarian democracy. Indeed, with the exception of Henry Adams, there has probably never been a historian more suspicious of ''the people'' than Richard Hofstadter. For him vox populi conjured up images of racism, xenophobia, paranoia, anti-intellectualism. The more congenial Hartz described Americans as possessing ''a vast and almost charming innocence of mind''; his hope was that the postwar encounter with the rest of the world would awaken his countrymen from their sheltered, basically oafish naivete.
 But if the consensus historians were not Marxists and not majoritarian democrats, what, during the cold war era, could they be? What other choice was there? The answer is that they were ironists who stood beyond political debate, beyond their own narratives. Hartz urged scholars to get ''outside the national experience''; ''instead of recapturing our past, we have got to transcend it,'' he said. One became an anthropologist of one's own society. How better to understand the national character, what made America America? Yet the outsider approach had real limitations, as became apparent once the tranquil 50's turned into the tumultuous 60's. The consensus historian, Hartz wrote, ''finds national weaknesses and he can offer no absolute assurance on the basis of the past that they will be remedied. He tends to criticize and then shrug his shoulders.'' This preference for the descriptive over the prescriptive, with its mix of resignation and skepticism, its simultaneous enjoyment and rejection of the spectacle of American life, was at bottom ''aesthetic.'' In retrospect, one can even begin to see certain links between the consensus generation's aesthetic irony and the distancing attitude Susan Sontag described in her 1964 essay, ''Notes on Camp.''
 In any event, the work of these historians was drastically undermined by the upheavals of the 60's and early 70's -- the Kennedy assassination and the other political murders, the Vietnam War, the urban riots, the student revolts, Watergate and the kulturkampf of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. As division and conflict consumed the country, the emphasis on American unity seemed misguided. And the ironic stance itself looked irresponsible. The times demanded not distance but engagement, not anthropologists but activists, not a shrug but a clenched fist. Everyone was being forced to make choices, and those choices presented themselves with an almost melodramatic starkness, especially on the campuses that were the homes of the consensus historians. It was the blacks against the bigots, the doves against the hawks, the Beatles against Rodgers and Hammerstein. For historians, too, the choice was easy: for the neglected minorities and against the dominant dead white males.
 As postwar seamlessness faded in the 1960's, a school of multicultural historians emerged to take the place of the consensus historians. This school has been subjected to a lot of criticism of late, but in fact it brought forth a golden age of social history. Blacks, American Indians, immigrants, women and gays had been ignored in the national narrative, or, more precisely, treated as passive objects rather than active subjects. The Civil War may have been fought over slavery, but the slaves were rarely heard from. Who knew anything about the Indians at Custer's Last Stand? The immigrants' story was told not through their own cultures but through their assimilation into the mainstream. But now, the neglected and powerless were gaining their authentic voices. 
 New studies increased our knowledge, enlarging and transforming the picture of America, even when the multiculturalists worked in very restricted areas. Judith A. Carney's ''Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas,'' for example, describes how the South Carolina rice industry was built not only on slave labor but on the agricultural and technological knowledge brought over by the Africans. The book has not found many readers outside the academy, but it nonetheless changes our understanding of the black contribution to American life.
 At its best, multiculturalism illuminated the niches and byways of American history. It investigated smaller and smaller subjects in greater and greater detail: gays in the military during World War II, black laundresses in the postbellum South. But this specialization created a problem of its own. In 1994, when the Journal of American History asked historians about the state of their profession, they bemoaned its ''narrowness,'' its ''divorce from the public.'' The editor of the journal wrote that ''dazzling people with the unfamiliar and erudite'' had become ''more highly prized than telling a good story or distilling wisdom.'' 
 Yet what story, exactly, did the multiculturalists want to tell? Could all those detailed local and ethnic studies be synthesized into a grand narrative? Unfortunately, the answer was yes. There was a unifying vision, but it was simplistic. Since the victims and losers were good, it followed that the winners were bad. From the point of view of downtrodden blacks, America was racist; from the point of view of oppressed workers, it was exploitative; from the point of view of conquered Hispanics and Indians, it was imperialistic. There was much to condemn in American history, little or nothing to praise. Perhaps it was inevitable that multiculturalism curdled into political correctness.
 Exhibit A, Howard Zinn's ''People's History of the United States,'' has sold more than a million copies. From the start, Zinn declared that his perspective was that of the underdog. In ''a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people . . . not to be on the side of the executioners.'' Whereas the Europeans who arrived in the New World were genocidal predators, the Indians who were already there believed in sharing and hospitality (never mind the profound cultural differences that existed among them), and raped Africa was a continent overflowing with kindness and communalism (never mind the profound cultural differences that existed there). American history was a story of cruel domination by the wealthy and privileged. The founding fathers ''created the most effective system of national control devised in modern times,'' Zinn stated. The Civil War was a conflict of elites, and World War II was fought not to stop fascism but to extend America's empire. The United States and the Soviet Union both sought to control their oppressed populations, ''each country with its own techniques.'' The Vietnam War was a clash between organized modern technology and organized human beings, ''and the human beings won.'' We have traveled a long way from the sophisticated ironies of the consensus historians.
 A reaction against distortions and exaggerations of this kind was sure to come. Battered by political correctness, basking in Reaganesque optimism and victory in the cold war, the country in the 1980's and 90's was ready for a reaffirmation of its fundamental values. After all, democracy was spreading around the world and history itself (treated as a conflict of ideologies) was declared at an end. One of the first historians to take heart from the cold war's conclusion and to see the value of re-examining the formative years of the republic was the early-American scholar Joseph J. Ellis. In ''Founding Brothers'' he wrote: ''all alternative forms of political organization appear to be fighting a futile rearguard action against the liberal institutions and ideas first established in the United States.'' 
 Ellis was a major figure in the new school of founding fathers historians that emerged in the 1990's. But as an academic, he was exceptional. Most were amateur and freelance historians, since the universities had become hostile to the kind of ''great man'' history they were interested in doing. A National Review editor, Richard Brookhiser, taking Plutarch as his model, explained that his goal was to write ''moral biography,'' a phrase unlikely to endear him to postmodernist academics; in rapid succession he produced brief, deft studies of Washington, Hamilton and the Adams family. Ellis, the biographer of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, saw himself engaged in retro battle against his own profession, and observed that his work was ''a polite argument against the scholarly grain, based on a set of presumptions that are so disarmingly old-fashioned that they might begin to seem novel in the current climate.'' George Washington, Ellis joked, was ''the deadest, whitest male in American history.''
 But if the academy was hostile to these books, the larger world was not. The volumes by Brookhiser and Ellis, not to mention works by David McCullough, Ron Chernow and Walter Isaacson, were widely praised. Some won National Book Awards and Pulitzer Prizes. And in sharp contrast to the restricted monographs of the multiculturalists, they sold by the truckload. Here was genuinely popular history, written with a public purpose and designed to capture a large audience. Ellis's ''Founding Brothers'' was a best seller in hardback for almost a year, and a best seller in paperback for more than a year. Isaacson's ''Benjamin Franklin'' spent 26 weeks on the best-seller list; McCullough's ''John Adams'' entered the list at No.1, staying there for 13 weeks, rivaling for a while the popularity of novels by the likes of John Grisham and Danielle Steel. Chernow's ''Alexander Hamilton'' and Ellis's ''His Excellency: George Washington'' both made the best-seller list last year.
 And yet there are reasons to believe the popularity of the school is peaking. For one thing, it is running out of founding fathers. The only major figure still awaiting his Chernow or McCullough is the thoughtful but unexciting James Madison. No doubt the principal author of the Constitution will have his day, but the founding fathers school is facing the choice of reaching down into the second ranks, or going over ground already covered by others. Brookhiser's most recent biography was of the less-than-great Gouverneur Morris, whom he teasingly describes as ''the rake who wrote the Constitution.'' Meanwhile, another formidable biography of Adams has just come out, and Benjamin Franklin has been turned into an industry unto himself, the subject of an apparently endless flood of books. There's always room for different interpretations, but the bigger picture is in the process of being lost. A school that arose in reaction to the excesses of the multiculturalists has started feeding on itself. 
 Most important, however, 9/11 has changed the way Americans relate to their past. The war on terror, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the apparently insoluble problem of nuclear proliferation and the ominous but real potential for a ''clash of civilizations'' -- all these are compelling us to view history in a new way, to shed the America-centered perspective of the founding fathers school and look at the American past as a single stream in a larger global current. Stanley Weintraub will never equal the best of the founding fathers authors in the felicity of his prose, and ''Iron Tears'' is unlikely to reach far beyond the campuses. But by embedding the American Revolution in British history, by internationalizing it, his book speaks more directly to the needs of our time than do biographies of Adams and Hamilton.
 Weintraub is hardly alone. Another book that gains immediacy by giving a global spin to an old subject is Alonzo L. Hamby's ''For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s.'' The New Deal is as overdiscussed as the Revolution, yet by internationalizing it, Hamby is able to raise provocative, revealing questions, even disturbing ones. The Great Depression, he points out, was a crisis that ''begged for international solutions.'' The Western governments, however, pursued beggar-thy-neighbor policies, including protective tariffs and competitive currency devaluations, that ''frequently made things worse.'' And the United States, he says, was the worst offender of all, ''the most isolationist of the major world powers.'' Roosevelt was an economic nationalist who mistakenly treated his country as a self-contained unit, even actively sabotaging the feeble efforts at international cooperation. Whatever economic successes he had domestically -- and Hamby, following other recent historians, shows that those successes were modest indeed -- his actions contributed to the nation-against-nation, Hobbesian atmosphere of the world arena. Hamby does not go so far as to blame Roosevelt for Hitler's growing strength in the mid-1930's, but it would not be difficult to take his argument in that direction. Roosevelt was an ''impressive'' figure, Hamby writes. But from a global perspective, the New Deal record was ''hardly impressive.''
 AS if to signal to historians the kind of reassessment that needs to be done, the National Endowment for the Humanities will sponsor a four-week institute at the Library of Congress later this month on ''Rethinking America in Global Perspective.'' And one group of professional historians has already begun submerging the United States within a broader identity. The growing field of ''Atlantic history,'' connecting Europe, Africa and the Americas through economics, demography and politics, has become a recognized academic specialty, taught not only in the United States but also in Britain and Germany. It is generating books, conferences, prizes and, of course, a Web site. No less a figure than the eminent Harvard historian Bernard Bailyn has devoted his most recent book to this ''very large subject'' that is ''now coming into focus.'' Bailyn writes that Atlantic history is ''peculiarly relevant for understanding the present.'' 
 It may be that for general readers trying to understand the present (as opposed to scholars), Atlantic history goes too far in dissolving the United States into a blurry, ill-defined transoceanic entity -- the might and power of the nation are not about to disappear, nor is the threat posed by its enemies. But because the post-9/11 globalization of American history is really just now taking shape, there is sufficient flexibility at the moment to accommodate a wide range of approaches. Three recent books, for example, offer starkly contrasting visions of America's past and, correspondingly, of its present world role. They are of varying quality but in their different approaches, they point to the kind of intellectual debates we can expect in the future from historians who speak to our current condition.
 In ''A Patriot's History of the United States,'' Larry Schweikart, a professor of history at the University of Dayton, and Michael Allen, a professor of history at the University of Washington, Tacoma, self-consciously return to 50's triumphalism, though with a very different purpose from that of the consensus historians. Not interested in irony or in standing outside of history, they are full-blooded participants, self-assured and robust moralists, who argue that the United States is a uniquely virtuous country, with a global mission to spread American values around the world. ''An honest evaluation of the history of the United States,'' they declare, ''must begin and end with the recognition that, compared to any other nation, America's past is a bright and shining light. America was, and is, the city on the hill, the fountain of hope, the beacon of liberty.'' Theirs is a frankly nationalistic -- often blatantly partisan -- text in which the United States is presented as having a duty to lead while other countries, apparently, have an obligation to follow. ''In the end,'' they write, ''the rest of the world will probably both grimly acknowledge and grudgingly admit that, to paraphrase the song, God has 'shed His grace on thee.' '' This is a point of view with few adherents in the academy these days (let alone in other nations), but it's surely one that enjoys warm support among many red-state conservatives, and in the halls of the White House.
 Critics of the Bush administration will find more to agree with in the perspective of '' 'A Problem from Hell': America and the Age of Genocide,'' Samantha Power's Pulitzer Prize-winning history of 20th-century mass murder. Unlike Schweikart and Allen, she does not see virtue inhering, almost divinely, in American history. Instead, she judges that history against a larger moral backdrop, asking how the country has responded to the most dire of international crimes, genocide. The record is hardly inspiring. Power reveals that throughout the 20th century, whenever genocide occurred, whether the victims were Armenians, Jews, Cambodians, Kurds or Tutsis, the American government stood by and did nothing. Worse, in some instances, it sided with the murderers. '' 'A Problem from Hell' '' exhorts Americans to learn from their history of failure and dereliction, and to live up to their professed values; we have ''a duty to act.'' Whereas Schweikart and Allen believe American history shows that the United States is already an idealistic agent in world affairs, Power contends that our history shows it is not -- but that it should become one.
 A third book, Margaret MacMillan's ''Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World,'' is in effect an answer to Schweikart, Allen and Power -- an object lesson in the ways American idealism can go wrong. MacMillan's focus is on Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War I. A visionary, an evangelist, an inspiration, an earth-shaker, a holy fool, Wilson went to Paris in 1919 with grand ambitions: to hammer out a peace settlement and confront a wretched world with virtue, to reconfigure international relations and reform mankind itself. Freedom and democracy were ''American principles,'' he proclaimed. ''And they are also the principles and policies of forward-looking men and women everywhere, of every modern nation, of every enlightened community. They are the principles of mankind and they must prevail.'' Other leaders were less sure. David Lloyd George, the British prime minister, liked Wilson's sincerity and straightforwardness, but also found him obstinate and vain. France's prime minister, the acerbic and unsentimental Georges Clemenceau, said that talking to him was ''something like talking to Jesus Christ.'' (He didn't mean that as a compliment.)
 As a committed American democrat, Wilson affirmed his belief in the principle of self-determination for all peoples, but in Paris his convictions collided with reality. Eastern Europe was ''an ethnic jumble,'' the Middle East a ''myriad of tribes,'' with peoples and animosities so intermingled they could never be untangled into coherent polities. In the Balkans, leaders were all for self-determination, except when it applied to others. The conflicting parties couldn't even agree on basic facts, making neutral mediation impossible. Ultimately, the unbending Wilson compromised -- on Germany, China, Africa and the South Pacific. He yielded to the force majeure of Turks and Italians. In the end, he left behind him a volcano of dashed expectations and festering resentments. MacMillan's book is a detailed and painful record of his failure, and of how we continue to live with his troublesome legacy in the Balkans, the Middle East and elsewhere.
 Yet the idealists -- nationalists and internationalists alike -- do not lack for responses. Wilsonianism, they might point out, has not been discredited. It always arises from its own ashes; it has even become the guiding philosophy of the present administration. Give George W. Bush key passages from Wilson's speeches to read, and few would recognize that almost a century had passed. Nor should this surprise us. For while the skeptics can provide realism, they can't provide hope. As MacMillan says, the Treaty of Versailles, particularly the League of Nations, was ''a bet placed on the future.'' Who, looking back over the rubble, would have wanted to bet on the past?
 Little has changed in our new century. Without the dreams of the idealists, all that is on offer is more of the same -- more hatred, more bloodshed, more war, and eventually, now, nuclear war. Anti-Wilsonian skeptics tend to be pessimistic about the wisdom of embarking on moral crusades but, paradoxically, it is the idealists, the hopeful ones, who, in fact, should be painting in Stygian black. They are the ones who should be reminding us that for most of the world, history is not the benign story of inexorable progress Americans like to believe in. Rather, it's a record of unjustified suffering, irreparable loss, tragedy without catharsis. It's a gorgon: stare at it too long and it turns you to stone.
 Fifty years ago, Louis Hartz expressed the hope that the cold war would bring an end to American provincialism, that international responsibility would lead to ''a new level of consciousness.'' It hasn't happened. In the 1950's, two wide oceans and a nuclear stockpile allowed Americans to continue living blithely in their imagined city on a hill, and the student revolts of the 60's and 70's, if anything, fed the notion that the rest of the world was ''out there.'' ''Bring the troops home'' was the protesters' idea of a foreign policy. 
 But the disaster of 9/11 proved that the oceans do not protect us and that our nuclear arsenal, no matter how imposing, will not save our cities from terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction. Today, there is no retreating into the provincialism and innocence of the past. And because withdrawal is not an option, the work of the globalizing American historians possesses an urgency unknown to scholars of previous generations. The major lesson the new historians must teach is that there is no longer any safe haven from history's horror story. Looking forward is unnerving, but looking backward is worse. The United States has no choice. Like it or not, it is obliged to take a leading role in an international arena that is unpredictable and dangerous, hopeful perhaps, but also potentially catastrophic.

HEADLINE: The Quantitative, Data-Based, Risk-Massaging Road to Riches

BYLINE: By Joseph Nocera. 
Joseph Nocera is a business columnist for The New York Times and, beginning with this article, a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Clifford Asness is probably going to be annoyed when he sees that this article begins with a discussion about how much money he makes, but there's no way around it. Asness is a very successful hedge-fund manager, and very successful hedge-fund managers make stupendous amounts of money, even by Wall Street's extravagant standards. And in the public mind, their staggering compensation tends to overshadow pretty much everything else. ''Filthy Stinking Rich'' was New York magazine's unambiguous take on the hedge-fund phenomenon some months ago. Last month, in its survey of the best-paid hedge-fund managers, Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine reported that the average pay for the top 25 hedge-fund managers was an astounding $251 million in 2004. Asness himself has written, in one of his better lines, that hedge funds ''are generally run for rich people in Geneva, Switzerland, by rich people in Greenwich, Conn.'' 
 Asness likes to point out that he wrote that sentence before he moved his own hedge fund, AQR Capital Management, to Greenwich, Conn. He started AQR, with three partners, in the spring of 1998, when he was 31 and had just walked away from a high-paying job at Goldman Sachs, where he was one of the firm's brightest young stars. During AQR's first three years, Asness and his partners didn't make much money. But by 2002, the firm was doing well, investors were clamoring to get in and AQR was managing about $3 billion in assets. (It's up to around $13.5 billion today.) And the partners were getting rich. Asness cracked the Alpha list for 2002, taking down a reported $37 million. The next year, the magazine reported, he made $50 million. Asness won't discuss the specifics of his pay, but if you ask him what it's like to have that kind of money, he won't duck the question the way most hedge-fund managers do. Instead, he'll lean back on his couch, scratch his neatly trimmed beard for a minute and then offer a sheepish smile and an endearing, exaggerated shrug. ''To quote Dudley Moore in the movie 'Arthur,' '' he'll reply finally, ''it doesn't suck.'' 
 Cliff Asness says things like that. It is one of the qualities that make him different from his brethren in the hedge-fund community, who tend to shroud themselves in secrecy, as if they're trying to protect some special formula they've devised for making investors -- and themselves -- money. They don't just shy away from talking about their pay; they shy away from talking about just about anything. Have you ever heard of Stephen Mandel Jr., or Daniel Och, or James Simons? Among hedge fundies, they are three of the most respected names in the business. Yet they studiously avoid having their names in the paper. 
 Cliff Asness, on the other hand, is an outspoken, exuberant Ph.D. in financial economics who has built a public reputation for his willingness to write and say what's on his mind. In academia, he's known for the witty, biting papers he writes for such publications as The Financial Analysts Journal. (One recent title: ''Stock Options and the Lying Liars Who Don't Want to Expense Them.'') Among financial journalists, he is known as a cogent and articulate bear -- someone who can make a compelling case that stock-market returns over the next few decades will almost certainly be lower than the double-digit returns investors have come to expect as their birthright. And among the hedge-fund cognoscenti, Asness has become known as someone who has been thinking hard thoughts about the future of hedge funds. A hedge fund is nothing more than a private, largely unregulated pool of capital that can buy stocks, sell stocks or do just about anything else. It is Asness's essential belief that hedge funds -- or, rather, some hedge funds -- are doing things that are genuinely useful for investors, especially sophisticated institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments. You will not be surprised to learn that Asness includes AQR among the useful hedge funds.
 These are strange times for hedge funds. They are, right now, at the absolute forefront of the collective financial psyche. Every day, it seems, a half-dozen more young Wall Street hotshots abandon the millions they're making at the big firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley and start hedge funds. There are now 8,000 of them, about 40 percent of which have been opened in the last four years, and money is absolutely pouring into them -- they're at $1 trillion and counting -- as institutions search for ways to generate positive returns in this difficult market. Just as business-school graduates once gravitated to venture capital or private equity or dot-coms, now they all want to work for hedge funds. 
 Hedge funds have also become a huge force in the market. When hedge funds are enthusiastic about a stock, they have the collective buying power to drive up the price, at least for a while. When they turn on a stock, they can drive the price down. Some hedge-fund managers have become activists, buying up stakes in companies and then demanding change from management. One hedge fund -- Eddie Lampert's ESL Investments -- engineered a merger between Kmart and Sears. 
 There are plenty of people, even in the hedge-fund world, who are convinced that we have entered bubble territory. Their secrecy, their power, the incredible amount of money flowing into them, the sense that everybody on Wall Street is trying to start a hedge fund and of course the staggering riches: it all seems a little crazy and out of control. Hedge funds right now feel a little like mutual funds in the late 1960's, or junk bonds in the 1980's, or dot-coms in the late 1990's. You just assume they are going to get their comeuppance eventually. Isn't that what always happens?
 But do you remember what happened after the mutual-fund boom burst? Or after the junk-bond craze? Or even after the dot-com insanity? It turned out, in every case, that underneath the craziness, something enduring was being created. The modern mutual-fund industry emerged in the wake of the early 1970's mutual-fund crash. Junk bonds today are a critical part of the world's financial scene. Amazon and eBay and lots of other real, profitable companies emerged from the dot-com mania, after all the pretenders were swept away in the rubble of the collapse.
 And so it is with hedge funds. There are hedge funds today -- big ones, run by serious people -- that are creating portfolios that are less risky than either the typical mutual-fund portfolio or the market itself. Certain hedge funds are becoming important tools for institutions that want to diversify their portfolios and become less dependent on the ups and downs of the overall stock market. Hedge-fund managers are convincing institutional investors that they are far better served not seeking outsize returns, because those returns entail taking too much risk. 
 Cliff Asness uses a highly complex, computer-driven investing strategy. You and I will never be able to invest the way he does. And yes, he's become immoderately wealthy as a result. But if you can get past how much money he makes, you'll find he has something worth listening to. Boiled down, what Asness really does is try to understand the relationship between risk and reward. And in that broad and important sense, there are lessons in what he does for anyone in the market. 
Asness is hardly the first hedge-fund manager to employ techniques for managing investment risk; in fact, that concept goes back to the very origins of hedge funds. The man generally credited with coming up with the first such fund was a former Fortune magazine writer named Alfred Winslow Jones, who hung out his shingle in 1949 with $100,000 in capital and a new idea about making money in the market. He wanted to invest aggressively while still trying to protect investors' capital. These would seem to be contradictory goals, but here's how he went about it: Instead of simply buying stocks and hoping the wind was at his back, Jones also had a certain percentage of his portfolio on the ''short'' side -- that is, he was betting those stocks would go down. In doing so, he was limiting his fund's exposure the market, or as they say today, he was limiting his ''market risk.'' Since his shorts were likely to make money in a down market, they acted as protection -- a hedge! -- when his ''longs'' weren't doing well. Yet because Jones also borrowed money to buy more shares -- that was the aggressive part of his strategy -- when his stocks went up (as they usually did, for he was a very good stock picker), his returns were much higher than they might otherwise have been, despite having those shorts hedging his portfolio.
 Jones was enormously successful; between May 1955 and May 1965, his fund returned 670 percent, according to Fortune magazine, nearly twice as much as the best-performing mutual fund. But Jones was also an innovator in other ways. Because he wanted complete freedom to invest as he pleased -- and didn't want to deal with regulatory restrictions -- he never let more than 100 wealthy investors into any of his funds at any one time; under the rules, this allowed him to avoid registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulated mutual funds. And he used a fee structure that called for him to get a whopping 20 percent of the profits if he made money. Mutual funds, by contrast, collected fees based on the size of the fund: the more assets under management, the more the fund company made, no matter how well (or poorly) the fund performed.
 As hedge funds evolved, Jones's essential structure stuck. Hedge-fund managers made sure their investors were both wealthy and few in number; these days, the rules allow them to have up to 500 ''qualified'' investors and still avoid most S.E.C. regulation. (The theory is that wealthy investors should be able to look out for themselves and don't need as much government protection as the rest of us.) Of course they all adopted performance fees -- usually 20 percent, just like Jones. Hedge funds also became hooked on asset fees, just like their mutual-fund brethren. Today, when a hedge-fund manager says he charges ''2 and 20'' -- and many of them do -- he means he is taking a 2 percent asset fee as well as his 20 percent performance fee. To the extent that hedge funds remain the most Darwinian of investment vehicles, it is because most hedge funds simply can't afford to lose money for even a single year: if they do, investors and employees head for the exits, and the funds shut down. But that fee structure of ''2 and 20'' is what makes the business so potentially lucrative. A $4 billion hedge fund that gains 10 percent in a year and charges 2 and 20 has generated $160 million for itself. A $4 billion hedge fund that charges 2 and 20 and makes no money for investors still pockets $80 million thanks to its asset fees.
 What got lost over time was the idea that hedge funds were supposed to hedge. That was primarily because of the powerful bull market that began in August 1982 and ended in March 2000. Investors took outsize risks and invariably wound up being rewarded, because the market was going straight up. The bull market forgave a lot of investing mistakes. Hedging seemed unnecessary -- even a little silly.
 In fact, during the bull market, hedge funds became synonymous not with hedging but with the most extreme forms of investment risk-taking. Think for a moment about the hedge-fund giants who captured the public imagination in the 1980's and early 1990's -- George Soros, Julian Robertson, Michael Steinhardt and a handful of others. Those men were all swashbucklers who didn't want to control risk -- they wanted to embrace it. They ran billions of dollars, and their fame and fortune was based on their willingness to make stunning bets on markets, currencies, stocks, even on entire economies. When they bet right, they made hundreds of millions of dollars; Soros netted more than $1 billion when he made his legendary bet in 1992 against the British pound. And when they bet wrong? On Valentine's Day in 1994, Soros got caught on the wrong side of the yen and lost $600 million in one day. ''Making money took courage,'' says Steinhardt, who is now retired, with no small satisfaction.
 Today most people still think of the Soros-Steinhardt-Robertson model when they think of hedge funds. And indeed, there are still hedge funds that make the kind of big ''macro'' bets the grand old men were so justly famous for. But there are all kinds of other hedge funds as well. There are hedge funds that deal in distressed securities. Others are dedicated to short-selling. Still others deal in the various derivative markets. The main thing hedge funds have in common today is not the way they invest, but their structure -- including, of course, those lucrative fees.
 Since the end of the bull market, though, the idea of using hedge funds to actually hedge has been making a comeback. Some of the best hedge funds, like Maverick Capital and Lone Pine Capital (the latter is run by the aforementioned Stephen Mandel) use the classic A.W. Jones technique of having a certain percentage of their portfolios on the short side -- betting stocks will go down -- to limit their market risk. Others search for small inefficiencies in discrete segments of the financial world to eke out small but steady returns. All of them are offering institutional investors ways to generate returns that are less connected to the rise and fall of the market itself than, say, a mutual fund is. And then there's Cliff Asness, who runs something called a ''market neutral'' fund. Which means that although he's buying and selling stocks, the returns he generates aren't connected to the overall market at all.
One crisp day this past April, Cliff Asness was sitting on a sofa at one end of his large corner office in a nondescript low-rise building in Greenwich. ''Sitting,'' however, doesn't quite do justice to what he was doing. One second he was scrunching into the sofa, the next he was leaning forward intensely, and the second after that, he was gesturing excitedly, as some new, interesting thought entered his head that he had to convey right that instant. He was like an exuberant, well-dressed, overgrown kid, so overflowing with enthusiasms that he couldn't contain himself. Except that the enthusiasm in question at that particular moment was the research that had led to one of his earliest published papers, ''OAS Models, Expected Returns and a Steep Yield Curve'' -- which, frankly, made it a little bewildering to be on the receiving end of his monologue. Realizing that I was pretty much lost, Asness finally stopped talking and let out a loud, self-aware cackle. ''This is so geeky!'' he said finally. Well, yes, it was.
 Asness did not emerge from the womb a fully formed geek. Growing up in Roslyn Heights, N.Y., he was an underachiever who played soccer and didn't spend a lot of time engrossed in his studies. Much to everyone's surprise -- including his own -- he did well on his SAT's, which got him into the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated with degrees in engineering and economics. It was the mid-1980's by then, and the bull market had begun, but Asness wasn't exactly walking around campus with The Wall Street Journal tucked under his arm. ''I tacitly assumed I would be applying to law school,'' he said, following in the footsteps of his father, a trial lawyer. When his father heard of his plans, however, he told his son: ''Why do you want to go to law school? You're good at this math stuff. You should do that.'' It was good advice.
 ''I think it's a little weird for a 20-year-old to be interested in finance,'' Asness said, but the academic, ''portfolio theory'' side of finance -- the geeky side -- had captured his imagination. By the late 1980's, the field of portfolio theory was undergoing enormous ferment. The long-accepted academic dogma, the so-called efficient-market hypothesis -- which states that the stock market is entirely efficient, with all available information already built into stock prices, and thus can't be beaten on any consistent basis -- was coming under at least mild assault. Accepted into the Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago's business school, Asness found himself right in the middle of the ferment.
 The dominant figure in the University of Chicago's finance department -- indeed, one of the dominant figures in all of academic finance -- is Eugene Fama. Fama is often described as the father of the efficient-market hypothesis, because in the 1960's and 1970's he wrote a series of elegant papers that laid out the theory with more clarity than anyone else had before, gave it its name and said, in effect, that it seemed to make a lot of sense. He also said, however, that it needed to be tested. To test it properly -- by going back and looking at the historic performance of stock prices -- you had to grapple with a series of issues that had yet to be worked out: how should a stock's riskiness be measured? What kind of risk-adjusted returns should a stock have if it were, in fact, acting ''efficiently''? And so on. Still, a series of early, crude tests seemed to bear out the theory, and in time, the central idea behind the efficient-market hypothesis even filtered down to the rest of us. Although Wall Street still makes most of its money convincing people that they can beat the market, it also peddles index funds, which have become popular precisely because people want to be in the market but don't believe they can beat it.
 By the time Asness got to Chicago in 1988, academics had begun to come to a better understanding of risk. Most of us think of risk as being related to the volatility of an individual stock -- that is, how much it bounces around from Point A to Point B. But new research was measuring how the risk characteristics of an individual stock changes the overall riskiness of an entire portfolio. Fama, along with a younger colleague named Kenneth French, was among those conducting a newer and deeper series of tests. In particular, they were working on a paper comparing the risk-adjusted historic returns of two different types of stocks -- value stocks versus growth stocks. (Growth stocks are typically those of companies whose investors are optimistic about their futures. Their stock prices are high relative to their actual corporate earnings and other measures. Value stocks are the opposite -- their stock prices are low compared with their earnings because the market is either pessimistic or nervous about their prospects.) A draft of that paper began circulating soon after Asness arrived on campus, and when it was finally published in 1992, under the unassuming title of ''The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns,'' it created something of a sensation. It essentially showed that if you took a large, diverse portfolio of value stocks, which are cheap, and put it next to an equally large, equally diverse portfolio of growth stocks, which are expensive, the value stocks would outperform the growth stocks more than the efficient-market hypothesis suggested they should. Asness describes the results of that paper: ''Cheap beats expensive more than it should.''
 Using a large universe of stocks, going back to 1927, Fama and French showed that if you divided the stocks into thirds, put the cheapest third in the ''value basket'' and the most expensive third into the ''growth basket,'' the value stocks outperformed the growth stocks in more than two-thirds of the years. This, of course, did not mean you couldn't lose money betting on value over growth -- no investment strategy is risk-free. It did mean that if you took this approach, history strongly suggested that the odds would be on your side. What's more, it seemed to make no difference whether the market had a good year or a bad year. The pattern stood up. There were years when the market was down, and cheap beat expensive -- and other years when the market was up, and cheap still beat expensive. In other words, this method didn't just reduce market risk, the way A.W. Jones did when he was devising the first hedge fund. It eliminated it entirely. To use hedge-fund lingo, the pattern was uncorrelated to the market. 
 By his second year in the Ph.D. program, Asness had become Fama's teaching assistant and had enlisted both Fama and French as his thesis advisers. For his dissertation, Asness had his own idea about testing the efficient market: he would take a look at a popular short-term strategy called momentum investing, in which an investor buys a stock for the simple reason that it is going up. In an early draft, he called it the ''fool's strategy.'' (Most day traders during the Internet bubble were momentum investors, for instance.) ''I was nervous telling Fama that I wanted to investigate momentum investing,'' Asness says now. ''But his reply was the best thing he ever said to me: 'Sure you can write it. If the data shows something interesting, then write it.' What Gene really believes in is empirical testing. Go where the data takes you.''
 And wouldn't you know it? Asness (along with other academics doing similar work) discovered that a large, diverse portfolio of momentum stocks also ''worked'' more than it should under the efficient-market hypothesis. Nobody can say with any assurance why these things worked. Asness guesses that in both cases, investors, as he puts it, ''overextrapolate.'' There is usually some bad news associated with value stocks -- and investors assume there will always be bad news, so they avoid these stocks more than they should. As for momentum, people often get too optimistic about growth stocks and pay too much for them. In the short term, that enthusiasm will often drive the prices higher. But eventually the enthusiasm will wane, and the stocks will come crashing down.
 Academics still argue about what these discoveries mean. Fama remains a committed efficient-market man. He says he thinks these findings don't overturn the hypothesis but suggest instead that academic finance needs a better model for measuring risk. Asness, however, came to the view that the market was not perfectly efficient: that human beings thought and acted in ways that created market anomalies. There is now an entire branch of economics that tries to explain the market in terms of the way humans behave -- both rationally and not. Asness does not classify himself as a strict behavioralist; ''I think the market is reasonably close to efficient,'' he says, ''but there are a lot of little inefficiencies.'' And in exploiting these inefficiencies a business could be built.
 After grad school, Asness landed at Goldman Sachs, where he spent a year and a half trading mortgage-backed securities on the fixed-income desk while finishing his dissertation. Then Goldman asked him to set up a ''quantitative research desk.'' The firm wanted Asness to somehow use the wealth of new research coming out of university finance departments to help it make money. Asness quickly hired two friends, Robert Krail and John Liew, both of whom he knew at the University of Chicago, and they began building a model that would combine both Fama and French's value insight with Asness's momentum insight. 
 The computer model they developed -- and which, after many refinements, they still use today -- grabs a wealth of up-to-the-minute data to identify the cheapest value stocks (Fama and French), but only value stocks that seemed to have started on an upward swing (Asness). They buy a large block -- about 200 to 300 -- of those stocks. Then the model identifies stocks with the opposite characteristics: growth stocks whose rise is stalling. They sell an equally weighted amount of those stocks short. Unlike A.W. Jones, who had only a percentage of his portfolio on the short side, the Asness portfolio is perfectly balanced between longs and shorts. That is what makes his fund ''market neutral.'' It doesn't matter to him whether the market goes up or down. AQR makes money if its basket of value stocks beats its equally weighted basket of growth stocks -- the way the history suggests it should two-thirds of the time.
 Asness and his colleagues soon discovered that the strategy they had come up with worked not only with stocks but with currencies, commodities and even entire economies. (Yes, economies. Asness and his team use economic data to sort out ''overvalued'' versus ''undervalued'' countries, and then buy -- or short -- those countries' market indexes, their S.&P. 500 equivalents.) In time, they developed models that sorted out cheap versus expensive in all kinds of different investments.
 In 1995, Asness's group started an internal hedge fund for Goldman partners and a few clients, using the new model. The fund did so well that the firm rolled it out and began to market it. Within two years, Asness and his crew had $7 billion under management. Their run was amazing -- barely a down month, and some spectacularly good years. Like A.W. Jones, they borrowed money, using leverage as their way to take on more risk and boost returns; one year they returned more than 100 percent before fees. ''Intellectually,'' Asness says, ''I knew we couldn't sustain that kind of performance. It was a lucky period. But I was young and I was arrogant.''
 And in his youth and his arrogance, he looked around him and saw that other Goldman hands were leaving to start hedge funds and that they were putting themselves in a position to make geometrically more money than he was making. For much of his time at Chicago, his working assumption was that he'd be an academic and make maybe $100,000 a year. At Goldman, by 1997, he was making millions, and he was unhappy. The firm wouldn't leave him alone to do his research and run money; it was always asking him to fly to Tokyo, or to make a presentation to clients, or to help some in-house portfolio manager whose performance was down. One member of his original group quit to open a hedge fund. ''That bugged me,'' Asness said. ''He was doing what we had all invented together.'' His colleagues kept pushing him to quit and kept meeting secretly to map out plans. Finally, in November 1997, he decided to break from Goldman. He gave notice two days after receiving a big bonus. 
 The four founders of AQR -- Asness, Liew, Krail and an ex-Goldman hand named David Kabiller -- set up shop in New York City in March 1998. They immediately set out to rebuild their computer model and to raise money. By August 1998, they had $1 billion committed, which at the time was thought to be the largest sum ever raised for a hedge-fund startup. (Last year, a young former Goldman partner, Eric Mindich, started a hedge fund and raised the current record: more than $3 billion.) That first month, AQR made money. Then came a market event that all of Asness's historical stock research, and all his complex models, hadn't prepared him for -- a market that was not just a little bit inefficient, but that was insanely inefficient. The Internet bubble had begun.
Remember earlier in this article, when I quoted Asness's funny line about hedge funds being ''run for rich people from Geneva, Switzerland, by rich people from Greenwich, Conn.''? There was a time when that was true -- when the vast majority of hedge-fund investors were, indeed, rich people trying to get richer. By the time Asness set up AQR, however, that was all changing. Although AQR had a few individuals among its investors -- some friends and relatives, mainly -- the fund was primarily marketed to large institutions, especially university endowments. The best of the institutional investors were sophisticated, they were demanding and they insisted on understanding the underlying strategy and having regular conversations with the fund managers.
 If an investor had asked George Soros or Michael Steinhardt for that kind of access, he would been given the back of the hedge-fund manager's hand. But the new breed of hedge-fund manager had a different mind-set. From Cliff Asness's point of view, sophisticated investors who understood his complex, quantitative approach were exactly the people he wanted as clients. They would understand how his approach fit into their overall portfolios. If he hit a bad patch, he had a far better chance of holding on to a big institution's money than that of a panicky rich person. Most of all, Asness and the other partners at AQR understood that the most forward-thinking of the endowments had themselves become influenced by what was going on inside academic finance and were trying to incorporate some of those ideas into the way they managed their own money. Indeed, in setting up his ''market neutral'' hedge fund, Asness was reacting to the changing demands of the marketplace.
 Even in the middle of a roaring bull market, these institutions had come to believe, first of all, that they shouldn't be completely reliant on a rising stock market for their returns. After all, someday the market was going to go down. Thus, having a diversified portfolio didn't just mean having a broad mix of stocks and bonds. It also meant going beyond the market and adding ''alternative'' asset classes. Timber, energy, real estate -- these were all assets that could help institutions diversify. And so could hedge funds, so long as they were the right kind of hedge funds. These hedge funds weren't set up to make the kind of huge gains Michael Steinhardt and George Soros made, but that was O.K. They had a different goal. They were trying to manage risk and produce a return that was commensurate with the risks they were taking. Just as important, by adding hedge funds that were uncorrelated to the market -- even ones that were moderately risky -- they were lowering the risk characteristics of their overall investments.
 The institutional money manager who led the way into hedge funds was David Swensen, who took over the Yale endowment in 1985. A former investment banker himself, Swensen had a deep understanding of both portfolio theory and the hedge-fund industry. He and his endowment colleagues got to know which were the best of the lot and sank money into a diverse range of hedge funds. Simultaneously, he cut way down on stocks, despite the bull market. The results are undeniable: over the past decade, Yale has generated annualized returns of 16.8 percent. (The S.&P. 500, by comparison, generated annualized returns of 10.8 percent during that period.) Seeing these results, other institutions -- Notre Dame, Stanford, Princeton among them -- began emulating Swensen's hedge-fund strategy. 
 Which, it turns out, was a good thing for Cliff Asness and AQR. Had he been operating in the old days, when the clients were all wealthy individuals, his firm would never have survived the Internet bubble. His investors would have all cut and run and put their money in some fund that was investing in dot-coms. But the institutions understood what Asness was doing, and even though his fund shrank from that original $1 billion to $400 million over the next 20 months, a surprising number of them stuck by him. What he was doing made intellectual sense, and it would work again so long as the bubble eventually ended. Which had to happen, didn't it?
 Not that Asness was sanguine during the bubble. AQR's first year and a half in business was a time when investors completely lost their heads, when dot-coms with neither profits nor revenues had triple-digit stock prices and when millions of investors actually believed that the rules of investing had changed. It was a period of such utter insanity that it seemed to repudiate the essential mathematics that had always guided the market. That drove Asness completely crazy. He had never lost money for investors over any significant period; indeed, he'd never in his adult life been anything but a superstar. Now his new hedge fund was like a dripping faucet he couldn't turn off: every month, it seemed, it was down another 2 percent. The fundamental insight that drove his model -- cheap beats expensive more than it should -- simply didn't work during the Internet bubble. Expensive wasn't just beating cheap. It was crushing cheap. Outrageously expensive tech stocks just kept getting more expensive. During the height of the dot-com era, the fund fell about 20 percent.
 ''I snapped during the bubble,'' Asness concedes today. His partner John Liew looked at the bubble the way a statistician might -- it was a hundred-year flood, and there was nothing you could do but wait for it to recede. Intellectually, Asness agreed, but emotionally he could not distance himself from the awful downward slide. He had much of his own money in the fund; many of his investors were people he had known for years; even his father had put a good portion of his retirement money in the fund. The pressure was nearly unbearable. He railed about the stupidity of investors who were driving up the stock prices of tech stocks. One night in the middle of one such diatribe, his wife, Laurel, said, ''But Cliff, you always told me you made money when people acted stupidly.'' Asness stopped talking and looked up at her. He knew she was right. ''Now you're whining about it,'' she continued. ''I guess you just want them to be a little stupid.''
 What Asness didn't do, however, was capitulate to the bubble. ''Our belief in the process never wavered,'' Liew said. ''The evidence was that the models we had devised had worked going back to the 1920's.'' In fact, the bubble gave Asness a cause. ''We try to make money by making a lot of little venal trades,'' Asness said. But fighting the bubble seemed to imbue him with some larger purpose. He began to see himself as on the side of good fighting evil. Bubbles, after all, put investment capital into the hands of company founders who know nothing about how to build companies. They finance lots of terrible ideas. And they hurt investors, who wind up losing money once the giddy ride ends. 
 Mostly, though, it offended Asness that so many investors were willing to blindly toss aside decades of accumulated market history and data. By early 2000, he began to write a lengthy article exposing what he saw as the fallacies being used to justify crazy stock prices. It was unlike anything Asness had ever written. It was biting, sarcastic, tough-minded and occasionally even funny. He laid out the math for why even the stock prices of strong companies like Cisco Systems were not sustainable. He called the paper ''Bubble Logic.''
 The draft of ''Bubble Logic'' that Asness showed me is dated June 1, 2000. As we all now know, the bubble had ended by then; the air began leaking out of it three months earlier. That March was the low point for Asness and his partners at AQR. Feeling that his father had too much money in the fund, Asness -- against his father's wishes -- tossed him out. (''If I was going to go down,'' he says now, ''I didn't want to take him with me.'') But in April, the fund made money, and it gained again in May, and when the year ended, AQR had made back a substantial chunk of its losses. It would be another year before the partners started making hedge-fund-like compensation themselves -- that's because it is standard practice for hedge funds to make back all their investors' money before they start tacking on that 20 percent performance fee again -- but the ship had righted itself. For months, an early draft of ''Bubble Logic'' had been circulating among Asness's friends in academia; it was discussed in online forums; it was even quoted here and there in business publications. But it was never published. There was no need to publish it. Asness says that if the bubble had lasted six more months, he would have been out of business. But it didn't. He had outlasted it.
Once the bubble ended, the AQR model went back to working just the way the data say it is supposed to. Over the last five years, the firm's primary hedge fund is up an average of 13.2 percent a year after fees. Those are not George Soros-like numbers, of course, but AQR generates those returns with a little less risk than the overall market. More to the point, when it is added to an institutional portfolio of stocks and bonds, it reduces the overall riskiness of that portfolio. And though it does not seek out new investors, big institutions are banging down the door trying to get in. Why? Because once the Internet bubble ended, the market did go down, a lot. And the institutions that had loaded up on stocks for the past 18 years were suddenly losing money. So they all decided, en masse, to load up on hedge funds, to replicate what Yale was doing. 
 Hedge funds, it turns out, had a fabulous run during the downturn; while the mutual-fund industry was losing more than $1 trillion, the hedge-fund community was essentially breaking even. The best of the hedge funds made money during the bust. Even CalPERS, the giant California state pension fund, began dabbling in hedge funds a few years ago. The real reason so many new hedge funds are being started these days is that the demand is insatiable. And that demand is coming from institutions. Every big institutional investor in the country -- if not the world -- wants what Yale has: a truly diversified portfolio that generates decent, positive returns with less risk than the market itself offers. And really, who wouldn't want that?
 ''David Swensen was so successful, and so eloquent in explaining what he did that he convinced folks that he had it figured out,'' says James Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, a short-selling hedge fund with more than $2 billion under management. ''It looked like he had found the Holy Grail.''
 But here's the problem: there is no Holy Grail, not when it comes to investing. Or, more precisely, investing Holy Grails are, at best, temporary phenomena. As hedge funds proliferate, for instance, the quality of fund managers is bound go down, and that will hurt the performance of hedge funds. That's what happened when mutual funds became wildly popular, and it is already happening in hedge-fund land as well. (Hedge-fund returns are down slightly this year, for instance.) Let's face it: even though there are 8,000 hedge funds, are there really 8,000 great hedge-fund managers? Of course not. 
 There is a second issue as well. You know those little inefficiencies that so many hedge-fund managers are trying to capture? Those strategies work well when there are only a handful of people employing them. But once there are hundreds of fund managers all trying to exploit the same inefficiencies, the anomalies tend to go away. The very fact that all these people are trying to do the same thing makes the market more efficient. As Chanos puts it, ''Success breeds imitation, and imitation breeds mediocrity.'' He adds: ''I think a lot of the institutions that are just getting into hedge funds now are going to be extremely disappointed. And there is going to be a gradual recognition that the fees aren't worth it.''
 Most people I talked to in the hedge-fund world don't believe that the hedge-fund bubble will end in some giant cataclysm that threatens the foundations of the financial system. It is far more likely that the air will gradually come out of the bubble in ways that most of us will barely notice. Hedge funds with mediocre returns will go out of business. A lot of the power hedge funds now have in moving the markets will dissipate. Some scam artists -- who always emerge during bubbles of any sort -- will be exposed. Some hedge funds that have taken too much risk will crash and burn. New regulations will be put in place (indeed, next year the S.E.C. will require hedge funds to register with the agency.) Business-school grads will find the next hot thing to gravitate toward.
 And what will be left? There are those, like Chanos, who say they believe that hedge funds will contract over time and that what will be left is a cottage industry of successful funds that don't outlast their founders. But there are others who believe that the hedge funds that are left standing -- the funds run by grown-ups who understand how to manage risk, and who position their funds as an alternative asset class for institutions -- have a shot at becoming permanent institutions and a normal part of the investing landscape. There is, after all, something powerful in these ideas of managing market risk and generating returns that are uncorrelated to the market. 
 This is not, however, a case in which a big idea eventually filters down to the rest of us. Theoretically, mutual funds could develop market-neutral funds like the one Asness runs; the regulations that limited how much short-selling a mutual fund could engage in were repealed years ago. But the fund industry has historically shied away from shorting stocks. For one thing, there's a strong psychological aversion to short-selling in the investing world. Rather than pumping money into companies to help them grow and prosper, the short-seller is rooting for a company's defeat. It seems somehow un-American, or at least not very nice. But other things once viewed as unseemly or un-American, like buying on credit, were quickly adopted by the masses once some smart guy figured out how to sell the idea in an appealing way. The real obstacle to the massification of hedging is that it is hard. What Cliff Asness does requires an immense amount of skill. There just aren't that many people who can do it well. And that's not going to change any time soon. 
 Of course, if the mutual-fund industry did start rolling out such funds, it would further degrade the ability to make decent returns, because it would mean there would be yet more people trying to execute the same strategies. Around and around it goes.
 Asness, of course, is in the camp of those who would like to see hedge funds become a more permanent part of institutional portfolios. But he can see the impediments as well. Last year, he published a lengthy paper on the subject of hedge funds in The Journal of Portfolio Management. Titled ''An Alternative Future,'' it was written as a two-part series. In the first part, he laid out all the reasons that hedge funds could wind up achieving the same kind of permanence as mutual funds: the power of the ideas behind them, the attractiveness of using them to diversify institutional portfolios and so on. In the second part, he laid out all the reasons that it might not happen -- at least any time soon -- including the real possibility of lower returns in the near term, as well as ''those pesky fees,'' as he put it.
 In our various discussions, I pushed him often on the subject, but I could never get him to commit one way or the other. ''I'm very schizophrenic on the subject,'' he said toward the end of one of our talks. ''To me, the real question is whether these institutions are rationally going to accept lower returns. Or are they secretly hoping that even if everybody else is getting lower returns, their hedge funds will still be getting the big returns? If it's the latter, we'll have problems.'' Some things even Cliff Asness doesn't have the data to predict.

HEADLINE: Hunger for Energy Transforms How India Operates

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 1 

 BODY:
Fed by a decade-long economic boom, India's ever-growing appetite for energy is quietly reshaping the way it operates in the world, changing relations with its neighbors, extending its reach to oil states as far flung as Sudan and Venezuela, and overcoming Washington's resistance to its nuclear ambitions. 
 Hovering over India's energy quest is its biggest competitor: China, which is also scouring the globe to line up new energy sources. The combined appetite of the two Asian giants is raising oil prices and putting greater demands on world oil supplies. 
 Already India's energy ambitions have led to developments unthinkable just a couple of years ago: a proposed pipeline to ferry natural gas from Iran across Pakistan; a new friendship with the military government in gas-rich Myanmar, formerly Burma; and budding talks with the United States to let India buy nuclear technology.
 Nuclear power is expected to top the agenda when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visits Washington to meet with President Bush in July. While India covets new equipment to strengthen its feeble nuclear energy program, the United States has prohibited the sale of nuclear technology to India since it tested a nuclear bomb in 1998. 
 ''International cooperation, international understanding of India's nuclear ambition,'' Mr. Singh told foreign journalists on Monday, in an allusion to what New Delhi wants from the United States, ''can help to ensure our nuclear energy program moves forward at a faster pace.''
 To understand India's dire need for energy, consider the fate of its commercial capital, Mumbai, formerly Bombay. It was enveloped in darkness in May because of a severe power shortage. 
 These days, the prime minister is engaged in a politically explosive argument with left-wing parties after suggesting that the government curtail giving free electricity to farmers. As the world's fifth-largest consumer of energy, India used energy at the equivalent of 538 million tons of oil daily in 2002, the most recent year for which figures were available from the International Energy Agency. That demand is expected to nearly double by 2030. 
 Today, India imports about 70 percent of its oil; in another 20 years, the Indian government estimates, that will rise to an ominous 85 percent. India's demand for natural gas is also expected to grow, and most of it would have to be imported. 
 ''Our dependence is rising,'' Mani Shankar Aiyar, India's petroleum minister, said during a recent interview in his office. ''I welcome that, because it reflects India moving on.''
 Indeed, it is. ''Mutual dependencies'' is the buzzword of the day, signaling the way oil and gas links among South Asian countries stand to rewrite the enmities of the past. ''The foreign policy of India will have a lot to do with energy,'' said Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. ''That is a new imagination and one likely to stay.''
 That vision is not without its challenges. On the one hand, India seeks to cast itself as the model of democratic pluralism, as in its bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. On the other, its hunt for fuel is pushing it to reach out to authoritarian governments like those of Sudan and Myanmar, which the United States has sought to isolate. In both of those countries, China's weight is also keenly felt. 
 But India is quickly making inroads. It has persuaded a wary Bangladesh to agree, at least in principle, to a pipeline that would ship gas from Myanmar to India. 
 Mr. Aiyar, the petroleum minister, has been shuttling to Saudi Arabia, India's largest oil supplier, to persuade it to invest in Indian oil and gas projects, among other things. He has also sought to lure foreign investors to explore for reserves in the Bay of Bengal, off India's eastern coast -- what he buoyantly calls ''the North Sea of South Asia.'' 
 By far, New Delhi's most ambitious proposal is a $4 billion, 1,600-mile pipeline that would ferry natural gas from Iran across Pakistan to India, though a final deal is nowhere near fruition. [Talks resumed on Saturday, when Mr. Aiyar visited Islamabad.] Pakistan stands to collect handsome transit fees from the pipeline. But how it would ensure its security across vast, restive Baluchistan Province, where disgruntled tribal armies routinely attack gas installations, remains a mystery. 
 Among Mr. Aiyar's ''fanciful dreams,'' as he calls them, is yet another pipeline that would dispatch gas from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan, then into Pakistan and India. 
 ''We now realize we have to get a large part of our energy from our extended neighborhood, and that means we have to engineer and structure new relationships,'' said R.K. Pachauri, director general of Tata Energy Research Institute in Delhi. The nonprofit institute estimates that India will need to invest $766 billion in the energy sector to meet the growing demand over the next 25 years. 
 India's changing relationships regarding energy are inspiring a delicate diplomatic dance with the United States. Publicly, Bush administration officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on her visit here in March, have frowned on India's plans with Iran. India is pursuing nuclear technology as the United States and European nations are trying to get Iran to give up its own nuclear program. 
 This week, a senior Indian official, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, was in Washington to meet with the secretary of energy, Samuel W. Bodman, to discuss, among other things, nuclear energy options. Whether the United States will turn a blind eye to the Iran pipeline or consider selling nuclear reactors to India remains uncertain. 
 ''In some sense there's a delicate tightrope walk that's going on,'' said Ashley J. Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''The Indians are trying to push the limits on what they can get away with, and the U.S. is trying to see how flexible India might be.''
 Mr. Aiyar did not miss an opportunity to remind the United States obliquely that India would not countenance interference in one of its foreign policy priorities -- buying gas from Iran. ''We are sensitive to the concerns and interests of other nations,'' he said, ''even as we expect other nations to be sensitive to our concerns and our requirements.'' 
 When it comes to molding and marketing India's energy needs, Mr. Aiyar -- a leftist at heart, a diplomat by training and possibly the biggest extrovert in India's Congress Party-led government -- likes to think grandly. He never tires of articulating a chief goal: to persuade China to cooperate rather than compete for oil and gas abroad. Some analysts greet the idea with skepticism. 
 Sundeep Waslekar, an analyst with Strategic Foresight Group in Mumbai, notes that China can offer a much more comprehensive and lucrative package -- including arms sales -- to energy-supplying countries like Iran, Sudan, or the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Unless India can offer something strategic to China -- food, for instance -- China would have little reason to join efforts. 
 China-India energy cooperation in the oil and gas sector is ''a beautiful academic idea,'' Mr. Waslekar said. ''I don't see how it could work politically.'' 
 Mr. Aiyar is unbowed. He offers the idea of an Asian gas grid that would stretch from former Soviet republics like Kazakhstan to the Persian Gulf all the way to China. 
 Every chance he gets, he pushes the analogy of the European coal and gas community, the precursor to the European Union. He demands to know why China and India cannot create the Eastern equivalent. ''An Asian oil and gas community, which could eventually blossom as an Asian identity in the politics of the world,'' he said.
 Of course, for now, a majority of Indians continue to live in the dark -- that is to say, without electricity -- and the most common fuels for Indian households remain among the worst for respiratory health: charcoal and animal dung.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about how India's need for energy is changing its relationships with other countries misidentified a group that was a precursor to the European Union. It is the European Coal and Steel Community, not the European coal and gas community. The article also misstated the rate at which India uses oil. The rate in 2002 was 538 million tons per year, not per day.

An article on Sunday about India's growing need for energy misstated the country's rate of consumption. It is the equivalent of 538 million tons of oil per year, not per day. A correction in this space yesterday included an erroneous reference to the rate. It represents the use of energy from all sources, including wood and charcoal, not just oil.

SECTION: Section 3; Column 1; SundayBusiness; AT LUNCH WITH -- JEFFREY P. ANSELL; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 1201 words

HEADLINE: The Truth About Cats, Dogs and Executives

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
JEFFREY P. ANSELL is definitely a corporate guy.
 Otherwise, why wear a tie to Fred's, a casual restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that is rife with pictures of dogs? Why bring sales charts and such to lunch -- and have public relations people follow through with offers of more? And why sprinkle product plugs throughout a conversation, despite a reporter's pledge to keep those plugs from appearing in print? 
 Because he can't help himself, that's why. Mr. Ansell, 45, is president of the Iams Company, the arm of Procter & Gamble that sells food for cats and dogs. Spreadsheets, revenue charts and such are in his DNA. 
 But so is the love of pets. Mr. Ansell has owned Kerry blue terriers for nearly 30 years. And, unlike many other dog lovers, he does not turn up his nose at cats. So he seemed a natural choice to ask for tips on keeping dogs and cats happy and well.
 ''Dogs bond with owners; cats orbit around them,'' Mr. Ansell said. ''Dogs feel lucky to sit at your feet; cats think you are sitting at theirs. But all pets have their owners wrapped around their paws.'' 
 Indeed, time and again, Mr. Ansell has heard people discuss their pets' ''accomplishments'' with the same pride they display over those of their children. He even cites statistics to shore up his point: a survey by the American Animal Hospital Association showed that 84 percent of pet owners think of themselves as ''Mom'' or ''Dad'' to their pets. 
 They're not all good parents, though. In Mr. Ansell's view, there is far too much tough love going around. For example, he disapproves of people who come home from work, discover that their puppy has soiled the carpet, and yell at -- or worse, hit -- the puppy.
 ''The puppy will never link the punishment with the mistake, so it will just learn to associate your coming home with bad things happening,'' he said. So what to do?
 Pick up a comfortable dog crate at the pet store, ''walk the dog before you leave, and leave it in the crate while you're away,'' he said. ''Dogs don't like to sit in excrement any more than people do, so it won't go there.'' 
 Mr. Ansell does not pretend that a love of dogs drove his choice of his current job. Procter & Gamble, his employer for 23 years, offered it to him in 1999. It seemed a good career move, so he said yes, as he had in previous years, when the company had moved him through units that sold diapers, potato chips and coffee. (He joined Procter & Gamble right after he received his Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from Indiana University in 1981.) 
 But Mr. Ansell has had lots of hands-on experience with his current customer group. Animals were omnipresent throughout his childhood in Rockland County, N.Y. ''I had gerbils, chameleons, lizards, fish -- I even had a pet tarantula once,'' he recalled. And he and his older brother and sister also had a schnauzer, a cocker spaniel -- ''that one had behavioral problems,'' he recalled with a wince -- and other dogs. 
 His father, however, had a soft spot for Kerry blues, which have boundless energy and little desire for daytime naps. The breed drove his mother crazy. Still, she gave his father one for his 50th birthday.
 But Dolly, as the dog was called, quickly became Jeff's dog. He took her to obedience school, taught her tricks and spent the most time with her. He and Dolly were inseparable until he left for college.
 DURING his junior year, he met Lynn Engle, also a dog lover. They married in 1985 and now have three teenage children, two of whom were still in diapers when Procter's Pampers unit moved Mr. Ansell and his family to Europe.
 ''I'd test out new diapers on them,'' he recalled, ''and I'd leave the ones that didn't work well on the research manager's desk.''
 Since then, the Ansell family, which now lives in Cincinnati, has expanded: it includes two Kerry blue terriers and two large, shaggy Leonbergers. 
 Not surprisingly, a life in which dogs play such prominent roles has given Mr. Ansell some pretty good ideas for the dos and don'ts of pet ownership. Here are a few he offered at lunch:
 Don't assume that obesity is any healthier for pets than it is for people. For a cat, the ribs are the best indicator: if you can see them, the cat's too skinny; if you can't put your fingers between them, it's too fat. A dog of proper weight will have a bit of an hourglass shape when viewed from the rear. 
 Don't believe the myth that animals will naturally eat what's best for them. Dry food, for example, is better for a dog's or cat's teeth than wet food, and usually costs a lot less. ''But wet food gets the lip-smackin', tail-waggin' reaction, and owners give in,'' Mr. Ansell said. 
 Use Pavlov as a guide for training. If you want the pet to come running at meal time, noisily shake something -- the food itself, if it's dry -- in a container. The pet will soon learn to associate the noise with the food, and to come whenever it hears it. But don't forget the dark side of Pavlovian conditioning: feed a dog or cat from the table, and it will quickly learn that annoying you at meal time brings nice rewards. 
 Don't get two puppies at the same time. ''Dogs are by nature pack animals, so they'll bond with each other instead of the family,'' Mr. Ansell said. And do not even think of obedience school before a puppy is at least three months old. ''Better it should bond with the family before it socializes with other dogs,'' he said. 
 Know why you want a dog, and pick a breed accordingly. If you want a fierce guard dog that's also a loving companion, go for a German shepherd or even a Rottweiler. If you'd rather have big and gentle, Leonbergers do the trick. If you are a neatnik or are allergic to pet dander, pick a nonshedding dog like a soft-coated Wheaton terrier, a Kerry blue or a poodle. Special alert: Mexican hairless dogs shed skin, which can prompt allergic reactions. And avoid Newfoundlands if drooling bothers you. 
 Recognize that pets can suffer from allergies, too. If your dog or cat licks its paws a lot, gnaws at its own skin, loses clumps of hair or seems prone to ear infections, its diet may be to blame. A veterinarian who specializes in allergies -- and, yes, there are also specialists in veterinary oncology, cardiology and other areas -- can help pinpoint the culprit and point you toward more benign foods. Mr. Ansell said that ''several pet nutrition manufacturers'' offer products for allergy-prone pets -- a clear indication that he understood the reporter's aversion to product plugs -- and suggested PetPlace.com, a Web site not affiliated with Iams, as a good place for pet health information.
 Buy pet health insurance. Surgery and hospitalization for pets can run into the thousands of dollars, yet Mr. Ansell said that fewer than 1 percent of American pet owners are insured against them. The cost for insuring a kitten or puppy is in the ballpark of $25 a month -- and that includes many vaccinations. The older the pet, the higher the premium. But, Mr. Ansell says, it is still lower than the psychic cost of ''economic euthanasia'' -- putting down a much-loved pet rather than spending what it takes to save its life.
 ''Remember,'' he said, ''you're dealing with a member of the family.''

HEADLINE: Red Ink? Yes. But Not as Much.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
IT is not disappearing -- not by a long shot -- but the federal budget deficit for this year is shrinking.
 In January, the Bush administration said that the deficit for fiscal 2005, which ends on Sept. 30, would be $427 billion. Many Wall Street forecasters have cut their forecasts -- some to below $300 billion. 
 One reason is a surprising jump in tax receipts because of better-than-expected economic growth last year, said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. He has cut his forecast of the budget's red ink for the year to $360 billion, from $390 billon, and has lowered his monthly deficit estimate for May to $34 billion from $45 billion. The Wall Street forecast is also $45 billion, according to Bloomberg News. The May number will be released on Friday.
 Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, said the deficit was also shrinking because tax revenue from the exercise of stock options had rebounded faster than expected. ''If you assume that revenue surprises continue the rest of the year, you can say the deficit will be $320 billion,'' he said. ''If the surprises get better, you can pierce $300 billion.'' Mr. Barbera's forecast is $290 billion. That would be down from a deficit of $412 billion in fiscal year 2004.

FED SPEAK -- Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is scheduled to testify before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Thursday. His comments could be especially interesting, after remarks last week by Richard Fisher, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
 Mr. Fisher prompted a rally in the stock and bond markets on Wednesday when he implied that the bank could stop raising interest rates soon. On CNBC, Mr. Fisher said the Fed was in the ''eighth inning'' of its rate-raising cycle. The ninth inning, he said, is ''coming up'' when policy makers meet on June 29 and 30.
 The question is, did Mr. Fisher go too far? Only Mr. Greenspan knows. 

DATA WATCH -- The trade deficit, to be reported on Friday, is expected to have widened slightly in April, to $58 billion from a surprisingly low $55 billion in March.
 And the trade deficit is likely to keep widening. A rising dollar makes American exports less competitive abroad and imports cheaper at home. Global economic growth is slow -- or slowing -- which could cut into America's export sales. Mortgage rates are at the lowest since February, suggesting that the housing boom is not over. American consumers are likely to keep spending on imports. So, monthly trade deficits are more likely to be $60 billion than $55 billion.

HEADLINE: What Are Mergers Good For?

BYLINE: By Gretchen Morgenson. 
Gretchen Morgenson is a reporter and business columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
The Dark Side of the Deal
To most investors, mergers are the stock market's equivalent of catnip. Takeover bids typically provide a nice boost to investors' portfolios and confirm their stock-picking smarts. And to hear the executives orchestrating them tell it, they always produce greater profits at the combined company down the road. Business publications and newspapers, including The Times, celebrate the deals with breathless tales of how they came together, complete with photographs of smiling executives shaking hands in front of a crowd.
 This year, with the stock market moving sideways, buyouts and the gains they generate are prized all the more. There have been a lot of them, too. This year, according to Thomson Financial, the first quarter's combinations were valued at $308.2 billion, up 17 percent from the value of deals announced in the same period in 2004. If this activity continues, 2005 will be the fourth-largest year in deal size.
 And yet, for all the profit and promise that mergers seem to hold, the truth about companies combining their operations is a darker one. Academic research suggests that few mergers add up to significantly more prosperous or successful companies and also that acquisitions during buyout booms, like the one we are in now, are more likely to fail than those made in other periods. And when one company acquires another using its own stock as currency, as commonly happens today, shareholders' stakes in the acquiring firm typically decline.
 What's worse, there is a disturbing trend among some of the most aggressive corporate acquirers to use deals to mask deteriorating financial results at their companies and to reap outsize executive pay. The complexity of folding companies into one another makes it more difficult, whether by accident or by design, for investors to fathom what's really going on. Because mergers require the extensive use of estimates on matters like job cuts and asset write-offs, for example, deals represent an opportunity for management to throw everyday expenses into the merger cost bucket and make operating results look better than they actually are. It's probably no coincidence that some of the biggest frauds in recent years have involved serial deal makers like Tyco International, Waste Management and WorldCom. (Long before a jury found him guilty of securities fraud in federal court in March, Bernard J. Ebbers, the chief executive of WorldCom, entertained himself and his friends aboard his 118-foot yacht called the Aquasition.)
 Perhaps the biggest downside to mergers, however, is their human toll. Deals that combine companies are becoming a bigger factor behind large-scale layoffs across the nation.

Some Bad Unions of the Recent Past
 Robert F. Bruner, professor of business administration at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, has compiled a list of colossal merger failures in a new book, ''Deals From Hell.'' High up on his roster is the Sony-Columbia Pictures merger in 1989, which cost $4.8 billion initially but ultimately resulted in a $2.7 billion write-off in 1994. Also on the list is the 1991 deal in which AT&T bought National Cash Register for $7.5 billion. Five years later, AT&T spun off NCR for $3.4 billion, for a loss of $4.1 billion. Another entry is the December 1994 purchase of Snapple Beverage by Quaker Oats for $1.7 billion, a deal that eventually produced a $1.5 billion loss. In late 1998 Mattel acquired the Learning Company, an educational software firm, for $3.8 billion in stock. Just over a year later, Mattel sold it for a loss.
 But the champion of all failed mergers, even years later, remains the AOL-Time Warner combination, announced in January 2000 just as the technology stock bubble was about to burst. Time Warner's chief executive, Jerry Levin, called the deal a ''transforming transaction'' -- an accurate assessment, as it would turn out, if not precisely in the way he hoped. The deal resulted in a $200 billion loss in stock-market value and a $54 billion write-down in the worth of the combined company's assets.
 What's more, in merging with AOL, Time Warner inherited accounting irregularities that attracted the attention of the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In December, the company agreed to pay $510 million to settle with the S.E.C. (neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing) and also to enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. Prosecutors said they would put off bringing criminal securities-fraud charges against the America Online unit as long as Time Warner adopted measures to correct past problems and engaged an independent monitor to oversee AOL's financial operations for two years.
 ''The AOL/Time Warner transaction dwarfs other deals from hell in almost all respects,'' Bruner writes. ''It leads the field in meltdown in value. The executive firings and resignations, the civil litigation, criminal investigation and the erasure of AOL from the corporation's name reveal a remarkable wipeout of the vision of the deal's architects.''

What Does It Profit a C.E.O.?
 Given all the forces that seem to be lined up in opposition to mergers, it may be a bit surprising that the deals keep on coming. But there are people for whom they make perfect sense: the executives and the Wall Street bankers behind them. There are several reasons for this -- for example, acquisitions enable companies to show earnings growth that rising stock prices, and therefore investors, require -- but the most compelling case for mergers may simply be the immense wealth that they generate.
 Executives began reaping big rewards from deals during the 1980's, when so-called golden parachutes were introduced. (Today those payouts look positively quaint.) Back then, shareholders viewed large payouts to managers at a company subject to takeover as a way to induce entrenched executives to consider a change in control there. Those inducements then became embedded in every executive's employment contract, growing to the gargantuan levels of today.
 The actual numbers associated with some of the bigger deals can be staggering. James Kilts, the chief executive of Gillette Company, stands to make $165 million from merging that venerable Boston company with the Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble. That payout was so large that Joseph F. Turley, the company's former president, and Joseph E. Mullaney, a former vice chairman of Gillette's board, deplored the merger in an open letter to Gillette's directors. ''Thousands of Gillette's employees will soon receive pink slips,'' they wrote. ''Their 'leader' will receive $170 million.''
 While the Gillette pay stands out, it is by no means a singular occurrence. In April, Toys ''R'' Us disclosed that 21 current and former officers and directors could receive more than $170 million for selling the toy retailer to an investment group that includes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Bain Capital, two buyout firms, and Vornado Realty Trust, a real-estate investment trust. The $6.6 billion deal will result in a $63 million payout to John H. Eyler Jr., the toy retailer's chairman and chief executive officer who has been with the company since 2000. That includes some $30 million in stock options, $7.1 million in restricted stock, an $11 million cash severance if he leaves after the deal closes, $7 million in deferred compensation and $7.5 million to pay taxes generated by the payout.
 Last year, AXA, the French insurer, bid $1.5 billion for the MONY Group, a United States financial services company. In that deal, top MONY executives were set to receive $90 million in severance and other payments, but enraged MONY shareholders threatened to vote against the merger. Only then did the executives agree to forego about $7 million.
 ''Shareholders have to ask sometimes, Was this executive team motivated to do this deal only because they knew this pot of gold was waiting for them at the end of the rainbow?'' Pat McGurn, special counsel at Institutional Shareholder Services, an investor advisory firm in Rockville, Md., says. ''In some cases, it does border on what could be considered corporate waste.''
 Unfortunately, shareholders find out how much of a merger's costs will wind up in the pockets of one or both company's executives only after the deals are announced. And because uncovering the payouts requires digging through complex corporate filings, some shareholders never learn about them at all. Michael S. Kesner, principal in charge of the executive compensation practice at Deloitte Consulting, says it is not uncommon for payouts to management to reach 8 percent of a merger's total cost.

How to Justify a Merger: It's All About the Growth -- Really
 ''I speak with senior executives in the course of my research,'' Robert Bruner, the Darden business school professor, told me. ''They all tell stories about how they are charged with maintaining earnings growth. They can only get 5 to 6 percent growth organically, yet the C.E.O. has set a target that is much more ambitious, and they must make up the difference by acquisitions.'' Bruner is critical of this process, which he calls financial cosmetics. ''It invites the creation of growth for appearance rather than growth that creates wealth for investors and society,'' he says.
 Indeed, shareholders who own stock in companies that make a lot of acquisitions -- serial acquirers -- should consider whether the deals are being cooked up by executives concerned about a slowdown in growth inside their operations. (Of course, shareholders who expect rising stock prices are not without guilt themselves. As James A. Fanto, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, wrote in a study of mergers he conducted in 2000, ''It is not too strong an expression to say that investors have become addicted to these transactions.'')
 ''The only thing people get paid for these days is growth, not running a company well,'' Jack Ciesielski, editor of The Analyst's Accounting Observer in Baltimore, says. ''The cult of growth will always encourage companies to buy other companies to paper over the valleys in their earnings patterns.''
 Perhaps the best -- or worst -- examples of acquisitions performed for earnings expediency were those made by Tyco International, a conglomerate, during the years it was run by L. Dennis Kozlowski. Founded in 1960 as a technology company, Tyco soon became a manufacturer of industrial products. By the late 1990's, however, it had begun promising investors that it would produce reliable earnings growth in excess of 20 percent a year. Kozlowski, who became chief executive in 1992, wanted to pattern his company after General Electric, which had produced remarkably steady earnings gains for years. Today Tyco has operations in fire and security services, health-care products and electronic components.
 In 2002, Kozlowski and an associate were accused of stock fraud and of looting the company of $600 million (a figure later reduced to $150 million). After an earlier mistrial, he is currently on trial for the second time in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
 Whether or not Kozlowski is found guilty of fraud -- at the time this article went to press, the trial was winding down -- his acquisition record certainly turned out to be flawed. Since he left Tyco, the company has registered $9 billion in losses and impaired assets.
 Kozlowski, however, received more than $330 million in stock sales and other compensation in his last three years running Tyco. A good bit of his compensation was based on achieving certain financial results. Tyco cleared most, if not all, of these hurdles, at least in part because of its many acquisitions. For example, in 2001, according to Tyco's regulatory filings, Kozlowski received a cash bonus of $4 million, based on the company's 39 percent increase in net income, before nonrecurring items, and on its 31.3 percent increase in operating cash flow. That year, the company made more than 10 acquisitions that contributed to both net income and cash flow.

The Bigger the Company, the More the C.E.O. Gets (Never Mind How the Company's Doing)
 An academic study from 2000 examined the relationship between chief-executive compensation and mergers in the banking world. Richard T. Bliss, a professor at Babson College in Massachusetts, and Richard J. Rosen, then a professor at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, studied bank mergers that occurred from 1986 to 1995. They found that these deals had a positive effect on the size of executive compensation and that even when an acquiring bank's stock declined following a merger, the compensation paid to the chiefs running the institutions grew significantly enough to offset any losses to their stockholdings.
 ''The net result is that even mergers which reduce shareholder value can be in a manager's private interest,'' Bliss and Rosen concluded.
 Their study found that more than three-quarters of the mergers in the sample led to a 10 percent or greater boost in executive compensation. The median change in compensation following a merger, the study showed, was an increase of between 20 and 30 percent of a chief executive's premerger pay.
 Bliss and Rosen also compared increases in chief executive compensation at banks where assets grew organically with those at institutions that grew, more quickly, by acquisition. For every $1 million in new assets a bank acquires through a merger, the study found, its chief executive received an increase in total compensation of $54, on average. For every $1 million in assets grown organically at a bank, its chief executive received an average $30 rise in compensation. 
 But those are numbers from the mid-1990's and are probably a fraction of the riches that executives receive in mergers today. Exhibit A is James Kilts's $165 million in the Gillette-Procter & Gamble deal. Eric Kraus, a spokesman for Gillette, says that the merger is a ''historic opportunity'' for both shareholders and employees, and he adds that Kilts ''has taken a chronically underperforming company to an industry leader. . . . If the company didn't do well during his tenure as chairman, then he also wouldn't have done well, because his compensation is tied directly to performance.'' After the merger, according to Kraus, Kilts has agreed to keep the combined company's stock for at least 18 months.
 Lucien Bebchuk, a professor of law, economics and finance and director of the program on corporate governance at Harvard Law School, recently wrote a book with Jesse Fried on executive compensation titled ''Pay Without Performance.'' In it, he argues that when acquisitions enter the mix, top executives often get away with larger amounts of ''gratuitous payments'' than might otherwise be possible. One reason for this, he says, is that the gains typically made by the shareholders of a target company may lull them into complacency about outsize payments to top executives. In other words, since everyone is getting a little richer in the transaction, the fact that a couple of executives are getting a lot richer is less bothersome.
 In addition, Bebchuk claims, after a firm is acquired, its directors often step down. As a result, they have less reason to be worried about confronting angry shareholders.

Why More Critics Don't Ask About the Payoffs for the Execs
 It does seem odd that few large shareholders have objected to the skyrocketing payouts to top executives in these deals. One that did was the California-based CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, which last year took exception to the $16.5 billion merger of two health insurance companies, Anthem, based in Indianapolis, and WellPoint Health Networks, in California. 
 Because the merger triggered certain changes in the employment contracts of the top executives at both companies, they received bonuses, severance payments and vested stock options totaling some $200 million. Leonard D. Schaeffer, WellPoint's chief executive, was entitled to $47 million in severance, stock options and enhanced retirement benefits.
 CalPERS criticized the payments. ''All this is doing is putting more money in the pockets of management, not putting money back into the company to assure the long-term value shareowners require,'' Rob Feckner, head of CalPERS Investment Committee, said last June. CalPERS voted against the merger, but to no avail. The deal closed in November, creating the largest health insurer in the United States, now known as WellPoint Inc.
 Such sweet deals for executives are exceedingly common. Last summer, for example, when Harrah's announced that it would acquire Caesars Entertainment for $5.2 billion, one of those who hit the jackpot in the deal was Wallace R. Barr, Caesars' chief executive. Under change-in-control provisions of his contract, Barr received almost $20 million. And if he resigned from Caesars ''for good reason'' after the two companies merged, the contract stated, he would be entitled to an additional $6.6 million. The merger is expected to close by the end of June. (Barr declined to comment.)
 Another combination from last summer involved two banks, Wachovia and SouthTrust. Under the terms of the $14.7 billion deal, Wallace D. Malone Jr., the chief executive of SouthTrust, stood to receive $59 million in stock, options and termination awards over the next five years if he left the bank. His annual pension was approximately $3.8 million. He remains vice chairman at Wachovia. A spokeswoman for the bank and Malone declined to comment.
 The single biggest factor behind these eye-popping numbers are stock options, which typically vest over a period of years but in a merger can be cashed in immediately. The 21 former officers and directors at Toys ''R'' Us, for example, are sharing $65 million in proceeds from the vesting of their options. (A spokeswoman for Toys ''R'' Us notes that Eyler has never sold a share of the company's stock since he took over as C.E.O. five years ago and that most of the directors have taken their pay in company stock. Thus, she says, the interests of the executives and directors are aligned with those of shareholders.)
 But executives also receive other goodies in one lump sum following a merger. First they get a hefty multiple of their average base pay -- usually 2.99 times the amount. (Any more than that and a federal tax kicks in.) Corporate executives involved in a merger may also receive enhanced retirement benefits, like a crediting of their service to age 65, even if they are nowhere near that. Another common merger perquisite for top executives is the continuation of medical and life insurance benefits and allowances for financial counseling and outplacement counseling. Reimbursement of all legal fees can also be a part of a contract.
 One apparent drawback to these enormous payments is the enormous tax bill they generate for executives. Happily for them, however, their contracts almost always require the companies to pay those bills. Enter the so-called excise tax gross-up provisions, which can be so colossal that, according to one pay expert, a major merger was scuttled not long ago because the cost of covering executives' tax bills generated by the deal exceeded $100 million. And while most companies claim that executive compensation is based on performance, supposedly aligning managers' goals with shareholders' interests, many of these huge payouts are triggered regardless of whether the executives performed well or not in the years before the deal.
 ''While much attention is focused on the failure of many mergers and acquisitions to create lasting shareholder value, less attention is paid to company performance leading up to the transaction,'' Tim Ranzetta, president of Equilar, a compensation analysis firm in San Mateo, Calif., says. ''It is not uncommon to see opportunistic transactions take place following a large drop in the target company's stock price or periods of chronic underperformance. It would seem illogical in situations like this that target executives would be 'rewarded' with a severance payout that can often approach three times their annual salary and bonus.''
 One reason that shareholder outrage about these payments has been muted may be that few people, beyond the executives themselves and maybe the company's compensation committee, know how costly these pay deals are. Even with all the scrutiny of corporate governance in recent years, a full tally of what executives will earn under a change of control is undisclosed until the deal is struck.
 Experts say that many compensation committees do not even understand the size of these pay packages because they do not routinely ask their consultants for detailed lists of the various pay components.
 ''Sometimes I think the boards themselves are shocked at what they've done, the astronomical dollar levels they've paid out,'' Pat McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services says. ''That's why we encourage companies to do exactly this scenario -- what would happen tomorrow if you triggered the C.E.O. payout? Shareholders should force directors to sit down and have that 'holy cow' conversation.''

Does the Urge to Merge Ever Cease?
 What may be most troubling about the lavish benefits and perquisites paid to executives is that they are doled out even as lower-level employees at the merging companies lose their jobs. ''One of the sine qua nons of a merger is that there is going to be some condensing of the operations,'' John Challenger, C.E.O. of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago, told me. ''So job cuts are automatic.''
 For most executives that do deals, it is necessary to eliminate jobs after combining the companies' operations in order to clear the performance hurdles that investors demand. For example, the promise of the Hewlett-Packard and Compaq merger in 2002 was annual savings of $2.5 billion in operating costs; the company says it wound up saving more than $3 billion (ahead of schedule too). But those savings resulted ultimately in the loss of 17,900 jobs.
 According to Challenger's firm, merger activity accounted for the elimination of almost 77,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2005, or 27 percent of the total cuts that were announced. Merger-related cuts in the first quarter were 17 percent higher than they were in all of 2004. Industries registering the largest job losses so far this year are telecommunications, defense and consumer goods.
 The disparity between the way top managers and their lower-level colleagues are treated in a merger has the potential to create a backlash. ''I worry about merger-related job cuts,'' Robert Bruner says. But he adds that workers who have lost their jobs because of mergers have so far been able to find other jobs.
 Merger manias do, of course, fizzle out. As is true of so many parts of the economy, they are cyclical. ''Merger waves seem to come up every 20 or 30 years or so,'' Richard Sylla, professor of business history at the Stern School of Business at N.Y.U., says. ''The great merger wave from 1898 to 1902 was when U.S. Steel was created. In the 1920's there were a lot of public utilities merging, and then we had another wave in the 1960's, which was the conglomerate merger wave.'' The current one, which began in the early 1980's, is the fourth such American fever of the last century or so.
 In the 1960's, a combination of rising interest rates and investors' realizing that conglomerates were not necessarily the recipe for business success undermined that mania. The junk-bond-fed boom in the late 1980's ended when Michael Milken, at Drexel Burnham Lambert, drew prosecutorial scrutiny to his control of that part of the bond market. And sometimes government puts a stop to mergers: in the early 1900's, the government cracked down on a big railroad merger, Sylla notes, and in the 1930's regulations curtailed the mergers of public-utility holding companies.
 What might end today's fever? ''Rising interest rates and falling stock markets'' could curb mergers, Bruner says. ''And either self-regulatory systems of accounting and industry watchdogs as well as government regulators may challenge practices that have grown aggressive during the height of the boom.''
 Till then, however, we can count on more mergers, more money paid to executives and fewer jobs for everyone else.

HEADLINE: Preserving History in Los Angeles Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY STEVENS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, Laura Weekes bought a fixer-upper home nestled in the heart of the Angelino Heights neighborhood, a collection of around 500 homes in Echo Park, just a stone's throw from downtown. 
 The house, built in 1905, has details from both the Victorian era and the Craftsman style of architecture. 
 ''To build a new house with the quality of materials they used back then would be financially impossible for me,'' said Ms. Weekes, who was drawn to the neighborhood because she restores houses professionally. ''And because these houses don't always point to a quick financial return they get torn down, which is a travesty.'' 
 As the real estate market in Southern California continues to boom, so does the destruction of old houses. Large new houses or apartment buildings are simply more profitable, and they continue to take the place of the old structures. 
 Although there is no record of exactly how many houses are torn down, The Los Angeles Times estimated in 2001 that there were three demolitions a day in Los Angeles. ''It is safe to say that since the Times survey in 2001, there has been more permit activity and an increase in teardowns,'' said Ken Bernstein, director of preservation issues for the Los Angeles Conservancy.
 Those who love old houses admit that there is rarely money to be made in their restoration, at least short term. But they insist that preservation pays off in the long term, both financially and psychologically. 
 The experience of residents in the Angelino Heights neighborhood gives some insight into what happens when a neighborhood receives a legal designation that protects its architecture. When Angelino Heights was granted the designation of a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone, or H.P.O.Z., in 1981, it was a first for Los Angeles. Preservationists consider it a rousing success. 
 Since 1981, 20 more zones have been formed in Los Angeles and the surrounding area, and 12 more are being considered in neighborhoods as diverse as Hancock Park, known for its grandiose mansions, Stonehurst in the Valley, for its small stone-clad bungalows, and Balboa Highlands, for the 1960's Eichler tract houses.
 A neighborhood receives the historic preservation designation if the majority of its properties have architectural and historic significance. They are protected from demolition, and rules govern what can be done to the exteriors. 
 The guarantee that houses will not be demolished is either a great thing or an unfair limitation, depending on one's perspective. Ms. Weekes, who bought her house in the neighborhood several years ago, is now trying to have a historic house in Pasadena lifted up and moved to the neighborhood, so she can restore and sell it. 
 ''I can be sure the personality of the neighborhood will stay the same and there is a true appreciation for history in pockets like this,'' she said. 
 But it isn't always easy on the pocketbook. The cost of preservation is nearly always more than that of a basic renovation. 
 Jim Prager, a resident of Angelino Heights long before the Historic Preservation Overlay Zone designation, owns two meticulously restored homes on Carroll Avenue. Historic houses haven't been the best investments in the city, he said. ''If we had invested our money in the 70's over on the west side of Los Angeles, we'd probably be sitting on $10 million,'' he said. ''But we had a connection to these old houses. I certainly don't regret it.'' 
 According to Mr. Bernstein of the conservancy, the historic zones add value, but not always in the most obvious ways. 
 The historic districts tend to be diverse neighborhoods economically, ethnically and culturally, he said. ''There is a stereotype which comes from the East Coast that historic districts are blue blood, old money, homogeneous and wealthy and that's just not the case here in Los Angeles,'' he said. He also said that a much wider variety of architectural styles are considered worth saving. 
 ''The H.P.O.Z. fosters a real sense of community and a sense of place and I think that adds to property value,'' her said. 
 Henni Bouwmeester, a sales agent for Sotheby's International Realty, who has been selling in the neighborhood since 1998, claims that there is very little turnover, but that when there is, there has been a considerable profit. She sold an Eastlake Victorian five years ago for $430,000 and she recently sold it again for $942,000. That was consistent with the market in neighborhoods that do not have the historic designation, she said -- neither higher nor lower. But the buyers get more. ''What you're getting is a much better quality home with cachet,'' she said. 
 The existence of many rules and regulations in the historic districts tends to keep the so-called flippers away. ''I have seen some people turn homes over quickly and make money, but they are not top- notch examples of historic homes,'' she said. 
 She works with one woman, however, who buys dilapidated historic houses and restores them, using tax breaks to her advantage. Ms. Bouwmeester will list one of her properties this August for $1 million that she has owned for only a year. ''This is an example of very high-end flipping, but it is unusual in this neighborhood and I doubt she's making a huge profit,'' she said.
 Jim McHargue, who bought his home in 1986, said the historic designation has caused some real demographic shifts in the neighborhood. ''When we moved to the neighborhood, over half the properties were owned by absentee landlords,'' he said. ''The H.P.O.Z. has created a longstanding group of homeowners and it is the only thing that has enhanced and added value to the homes in this neighborhood.''
 Murray Burns, who owns 12 properties in the neighborhood, is known for doing high-end restorations and renting the houses to tenants who tend to stay. 
 ''It's difficult and expensive,'' he said. ''I think the payoff comes in the long run.'' 
 Ms. Weekes said that living in old houses becomes a way of life. ''There really isn't any way to quantify financially what it means to wake up in a beautifully restored old house every morning,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Spring of Our Discontent

BYLINE: By A.O. SCOTT

 BODY:
A LITTLE more than two weeks ago, when much of the American movie-critic population was in Cannes pushing and shoving our way into four or five movies a day, the news arrived from back home that the general public did not appear to share our zeal. For the third spring in a row, the box-office grosses and the number of tickets sold for first-run theatrical releases had fallen, data that provoked concern and speculation in Hollywood and in the industry trade papers. What could be keeping people away from the movies? Bad weather? Economic uncertainty? The high price of gasoline? The angry and polarized political climate? 
 Those are interesting theories, but there may be a simpler explanation: the movies that the major studios and their subsidiaries have released this year have just not been very good. And their mediocrity appears to be less a matter of accident than of design. Looking back at the last 20 weeks, you can find some serviceable examples of familiar genres -- tame romantic comedy (''Hitch''), uplifting sports melodrama (''Coach Carter''), all-ages action adventure (''Sahara''), star-driven political thriller (''The Interpreter'') -- all of which have earned decent returns, and even some admiring reviews. But none of them have inspired much excitement or argument, and missing any (or all) of them would not feel like a great loss. They will each show up eventually on basic cable some night when you have nothing else to do, or on the transcontinental flight when your iPod battery is dead and you've forgotten to pick up the latest issue of Vanity Fair. You'll watch with a shrug and maybe a smile, in all likelihood rendering a judgment consistent with the ambitions of the picture in question: not bad.
 From where I sit, not bad is very bad indeed. The commitment to meticulously engineered mediocrity suggests that the American movie industry, in its timid, defensive attempts not to alienate the audience, is doing just that. 
 I am aware that the springtime malaise is, to some extent, a seasonal complaint, one to which critics are especially susceptible. In May it's always the death of cinema, and by December the golden age is upon us once again. What else is new? Distributors save their good stuff for the last quarter of the year, in the hopes of harvesting awards and nominations. In the summer, they roll out their blockbusters, leaving the months from January to May for clearance sales and placeholders -- movies that need be good enough only to satisfy someone's desire to get out of the house. If you want something more, the previous autumn's crop of Oscar contenders and 10-best-list laureates is newly available on DVD. Many of those high-quality theatrical releases crowding the calendar between Labor Day and New Year's Eve are, from an economic standpoint, dry runs for the home-video market. The accolades and prizes look good on the DVD box, especially in April, when the discriminating film lover, uninspired by the multiplex marquee, decides to catch up with the pictures everyone seemed to be talking about a few months before. 
 So the public, glutted with savories for three months, must make do with leftovers for the other nine. This is not a healthy diet, and it has some unfortunate side effects -- good winter movies that meet with spiteful backlashes or critical neglect; weak spring offerings whose mere willingness to deal with serious subjects or grown-up behavior makes them look better than they are. (This spring ''Crash'' and ''The Upside of Anger'' are the examples that come most readily to mind.)
 Every writer who complains about the quality of movies in general risks being accused of snobbery. Unlike critics, who often seem to be happiest when they are most disappointed and vice versa, most people just go to the movies to have a good time. But that is exactly my point: what we want from movies is not just distraction, diversion or passing amusement. We want satisfaction.
 And this comes in many different forms. Most accounts of the box-office dip note that the numbers in recent years have been skewed upward by a few anomalous blockbusters. In 2004 the crowds flocking to ''The Passion of the Christ'' made the season appear hotter than it was, and in 2005 ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith'' will probably have a similar effect on the numbers for the first half of the year. Whatever else they may have in common, these are both movies that audiences cared enough about to want to see in theaters, sometimes more than once. They are also, not incidentally, independent films, made under the auspices of their directors' production companies (Mel Gibson's Icon and George Lucas's Lucasfilm) without studio oversight or interference.
 Which brings me back, somewhat circuitously, to Cannes, where cinema is understood to be the director's art, and where the disconnection between global film culture and the American audience can seem especially stark. Despite some loud grumbling (including some from Emir Kusturica, president of the competition jury, who complained afterward about the poor quality of the selections), Cannes was full of movies that were challenging, interesting and in various ways satisfying. It was therefore troubling to read, at the end of the festival, an article in The Hollywood Reporter in which several executives complained about how few of the films were worth buying for American distribution. Part of the fault, it seemed, lay with audiences who shy away from anything they think will be difficult or disturbing. The article probably made me madder than it should have because it represented longstanding conventional wisdom about the commercial viability of the kind of movie that is a staple of the international festival circuit and an exotic specialty on American screens.
 But some of us persist in hoping that the conventional wisdom will be refuted. Each of us came home from Cannes with a list of movies that fueled our solitary rapture, our angry debates, our sleepless nights: Michael Haneke's ''Cache'' (''Hidden''); ''Hou Hsiao-hsien's ''Three Times,'' Carlos Reygadas's ''Battle in Heaven.'' As of this writing, two of those -- the Reygadas and the Haneke -- have been picked up for North American distribution. With any luck, they will arrive at a theater near you sometime before next spring.

HEADLINE: REPORT PRESSES EASY WAYS TO FIX AIRLINE SECURITY

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4 

 BODY:
Significant gaps in security at the nation's airports could be curtailed even at a time of rising passenger traffic by quickly making a wide range of relatively modest changes in screening people and bags, a confidential report by the Department of Homeland Security has concluded. 
 Fixing serious weaknesses in the nation's aviation security system is critical as passenger traffic rises beyond levels seen before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the report observed. This summer, passengers are expected to take about 200 million trips globally on the nation's airlines, up about 4 percent from last year. 
 The proposed fine-tuning of airport security includes expanding the use of devices that can detect trace amounts of explosives and stationing more armed guards in secure areas. 
 ''There is increasing pressure to increase the flow of passengers and their property through security checkpoints,'' the report said. ''Unfortunately, our analysis has shown there are significant security gaps at checkpoints as they currently exist.'' 
 Widespread delays caused by security breaches could be reduced by simply preventing passengers from dashing through exits leading from secure areas, the report said. Checkpoints operated by the Transportation Security Administration, the division of Homeland Security that oversees airport security, should have gates or lockable doors at those exits, the report said. 
 And while the T.S.A. has an agreement with local law enforcement agencies to provide backup, if necessary, the arrangement is not enough, the investigators concluded, because it may take several minutes for an armed response.
 ''If, say, a handgun were discovered,'' the report says, ''the terrorist would have ample ability to retain control of it. T.S.A. screeners are neither expecting to encounter a real weapon nor are they trained to gain control of it.''
 To speed the screening process, the report included some low-tech solutions, like setting up longer tables where passengers disgorge personal items into plastic bins. Because people are often backed up waiting to unload items, investigators found, the X-ray machines that examine carry-on baggage sit idle as much as 30 percent of the time. 
 Mark O. Hatfield Jr., a spokesman for the T.S.A., said steps were already being taken to speed passengers through airports without compromising security, including expanding checkpoints at airports in Atlanta, Denver and Washington. As a result, Mr. Hatfield said, even though passenger traffic is increasing, the average peak wait time at checkpoints has dropped a minute in the past year, to about 12 minutes.
 ''Getting as many people through as possible in a way that maintains or improves security -- that's the name of the game,'' he said.
 The detailed security evaluation was necessary, the 214-page report says, because government officials made mistakes in rushing to improve aviation security after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 ''There can be no doubt that their efforts were Herculean, and the resulting system has made the nation safer,'' the report says. ''However, speed always comes at a cost, and the existing system may neither uniformly provide the degree of security desired, nor do it as efficiently and/or in as customer-friendly a fashion as might be achievable.''
 The study, prepared at the request of Congress, looks at four areas: passenger checkpoints, checked baggage, air cargo and in-bound international flights. Staff members from the Department of Homeland Security and employees of Northrop Grumman, a giant military contractor, examined 5 domestic airports and 16 foreign ones, looking for quick ways to modify existing operations. The report, by the department's Science and Technology Directorate, was not intended to be released to the public, but a copy was obtained by The New York Times.
 The point the report makes is not that the T.S.A. should stop its effort to deploy more advanced technology that can better detect bombs and other threats. It is just that in the interim, the existing technology can be used more effectively, largely to close the most serious gaps.
 While the report found ways to improve security and increase the processing of passengers, it said that to accomplish both simultaneously would most likely require additional checkpoint lanes.
 Because work on the report has been under way for more than a year, Congress is already moving to provide financing for certain proposals, Homeland Security officials say. 
 ''It is not gathering dust on a shelf,'' Donald W. Tighe, a department spokesman, said of the report, which does not include cost estimates for the security changes. ''It is translating into action.''
 The most severe domestic shortcomings involved passenger checkpoints, and included unnecessary bottlenecks and less-than-satisfactory security, the report said. 
 Checkpoints are equipped with devices known as explosives trace detection machines, in which the screener rubs a swab along a surface to look for minute amounts of explosives. But the machines get only ''limited, undirected use,'' the report found, meaning that a very small percentage of carry-on bags or other items are examined. By adding a single screener to the typical checkpoint, these machines could be used to check the boarding passes, hands and shoes of all passengers.
 The additional work could be accommodated in part because some manual tasks could be automated, like moving empty bins back to the front of the line via conveyor belt. As a result, a reconfigured checkpoint used in the study could handle 171 to 179 passengers an hour per lane, compared with the current 183, meaning a major improvement in security without a corresponding slowdown in passenger screening. 
 Another option to screen better for explosives, Mr. Tighe said, is to install more expensive machines that can detect particles of explosives displaced by puffs of air as passengers walk through them.
 Recommendations related to checked baggage include allowing workers monitoring the scanning device to rely more on the computer screen to determine if a suspicious-looking item is an actual threat, instead of the more time-consuming process of opening up the bag. 
 Air cargo on passenger planes is rarely physically inspected today. Several alternatives were proposed for systems that could handle such a complicated task, given the many different sizes and weights of packages. The House of Representatives has allocated $30 million to Homeland Security for testing such options in the coming year.
 Perhaps the most difficult challenge is enhancing security for passengers flying to the United States, the report says. Ideally, the report says, the system should be set up so that ''passengers departing overseas locations for the U.S. can expect the same level of security.''
 But the report makes clear that this is not the case. Whatever the shortcomings of the United States system, more severe problems existed at most of the 16 airports in South America, Asia and Europe that were examined for the report. 
 ''Urgent attention needs to be given to some security measures that can be taken very quickly at relatively low costs,'' the report says, recommending, for example, wider use of explosives trace detection machines.
 Christopher R. Bidwell, managing director for security at the Air Transport Association, who has seen a draft of the report, said many of the recommendations seemed obvious. But pulling together all of these possible short-term improvements in aviation security is still worthwhile, he said.
 ''They are not visionary by any means,'' Mr. Bidwell said. ''But they are things that need to happen.''

HEADLINE: A Commercial Strip Gaining in Charm

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, residents of Brooklyn's Victorian Flatbush have been all dressed up with no place to go. No place in the neighborhood, that is. 
 But that seems to be changing with the slow but steady evolution of Cortelyou Road, the seven-block-long commercial section of a street that cuts through Flatbush between Coney Island Avenue and East 17th Street. Benches and new street lamps are on the way, as 99-cent shops, bodegas and hair parlors increasingly share turf with new businesses catering to a vast ethnically diverse clientele, affluent new arrivals and young families yearning for more service. 
 Established businesses like the Flatbush Food Co-Op and the Greenmarket, which has expanded, have been joined by new restaurants, a cafe with a bookshop, and an antique shop, Cortelyou Vintage, which is scheduled to open Wednesday at 1118 Cortelyou Road. It will have mid-20th-century furniture and decorative accessories intending to cater to new residents coming from places like Park Slope and Williamsburg. 
 ''I'm looking to capture the young hipsters who want unique furniture and who are not going to go to Levitz and buy new,'' said the owner, Nicole Francis, who works as a financial planner and lives in a 10-room Victorian house nearby. ''The key market is couples with young children.'' 
 She pays $2,000 a month, or slightly more than $2 per square foot, for a 950-square-foot retail space, with a bonus 850 square feet of garden, according to Dr. Edmund Lee, the building's owner, who grew up in the neighborhood and whose Chinese immigrant parents operated a hand laundry nearby. 
 Catherine Hickey, director of economic development for the Flatbush Development Corporation, said store rents on Cortelyou Road are typically $1.50 to $3 per square foot. Vacancies are up, she said, as leases expire and landlords look for higher rents. 
 Most buildings on the street are brick, about 20 feet wide and three stories high, and were constructed around 1930, according to the Department of City Planning. 
 Asking prices for commercial properties for sale are picking up after stagnating for decades. A 4,140-square-foot building at 1502 Cortelyou Road with four residential units and a ground floor bar, the Cornerstone, is on the market for $1.3 million, according to Jan Rosenberg, a principal in Brooklyn Hearth Realty Ltd., a brokerage firm, and president of Friends of Cortelyou, the five-year-old group dedicated to improving the street. Monthly rent for the bar space is in excess of $4,000. 
 That price is higher than most on the road, where closing prices are typically in the mid-$600,000's. A three-story structure at 1410 Cortelyou Road is in contract for $650,000, according to Ms. Hickey of the Flatbush Development Corporation. The space is now a temporary headquarters for a transportation project. The buyers, Salvatore and Matteo Amato, are brothers who plan to convert it to a restaurant and bar. Their family has owned the adjacent San Remo pizzeria since 1976. 
 William Del Quaglio, who paid $245,000 for the building at 1416 Cortelyou Road about seven years ago, is now in contract to sell it for $675,000. Mr. Del Quaglio used to run the bagel shop on the ground floor. 
 Like Mr. Del Quaglio, the Amato family and Mr. Lee, many property owners have long associations with the neighborhood. Sales of buildings most often take place through word of mouth and without brokers. 
 Cortelyou Road is anchored at one end by the Q line subway station, an Associated supermarket and a Duane Reade, and at the other end by charmless auto body shops lining Coney Island Avenue.
 In between, the street has a kind of Norman Rockwell, small-town allure to it, complete with a fire company (Da Pride A Flatbush), a red-brick school, a library, rambling old colonnaded houses, a playground, massive flowering chestnut trees in full bloom and unusually wide sidewalks that invite a pleasant amble. A Mexican grocery store has pinatas hanging from the ceiling. 
 Named for Jacques Cortelyou, a 17th-century tutor and surveyor who had a hand in establishing the town of New Utrecht, the street had originally been called Avenue C, according to the Brooklyn borough historian, Ron Schweiger. Around the turn of the 20th century, wealthy executives began moving into mansions on streets with lettered names and many were given upper-class British names like Argyle, Buckingham, Rugby, Marlborough and Stratford. 
 Until 1930, a trolley ran along Cortelyou Road. Small businesses thrived until the 1960's, when commerce started to slide and crime increased. Improvements were slow to germinate as new arrivals in $1 million Victorians or well-priced co-ops went elsewhere to shop and dine out. 
 ''We didn't have a place where people came together and which created a sense of neighborhood,'' said Ms. Rosenberg of Friends of Cortelyou, which hopes to woo a bank and children's clothing store to the area. ''And because the commercial strip was so small, I felt that only a few different stores could help create that change.'' 
 Change has gained momentum in the last 18 months. On weekend nights there are waits for a table at the popular Picket Fence restaurant, which opened a year ago at 1310 Cortelyou Road. Its bustling back garden was recently made twice as large, and now seats 50 with plenty of room for families with strollers, according to the owner and chef, Graham Meyerson, who formerly cooked at the Union Square Cafe and who lives nearby. Dishes include a pecan crusted pork chop at $15, warm garlic potato chips at $5, turkey meatloaf for $12, and a house burger for $8.
 About 100 people from all over the city turned up at a recent book party at Vox Pop, 1022 Cortelyou Road, a new cafe and book shop that serves fair-trade coffees, $4 vegetable sandwiches and $6 organic turkey baguettes and whose motto is ''Books, Coffee, Democracy.'' 
 The owner, Sander Hicks, who lives over the shop with his wife, Holley Anderson, a singer-songwriter, and newborn son, Coleman, runs a print-on-demand operation on a balcony over the bar. He was also the publisher of ''Fortunate Son,'' a biography of George W. Bush, under his own imprint, Soft Skull Press. 
 Mr. Hicks got a month's rent free when he opened in November, welcomed by a landlord who wanted a tenant who would help improve the street. This kind of response to the community seems typical of the new Cortelyou, he said. 
 ''Even the food co-op is now open until 11 p.m.,'' Mr. Hicks said. ''They listen to their customers.'' 
 The street will get added exposure in the next few months when Picket Fence and Mr. Meyerson, whose wife, Chelsi, manages the seasonal greenmarket, are featured on a segment of ''Roker on the Road,'' with Al Roker, on the Food Network. According to Ms. Rosenberg, it is welcome recognition for the restaurant as well as the neighborhood. 
 ''People are finding their way here from around New York City and beyond,'' she said. ''It's what we've been working for for several years.''

HEADLINE: Yes, Obi-Wan, There Still Are Books

 BODY:
For the first few centuries after Johann Gutenberg started churning out Bibles, books had it easy. There were paintings, songs and sermons, of course, but movable type applied to paper was the cutting-edge technology for telling stories. Today, books compete with DVD's, video games, 500 channels of cable television and a nearly limitless number of pages on the Internet. The good news is that even in this high-tech age, old-fashioned books appear to be holding their own. 
 In the three years that ended last December, consumer spending on books rose 8 percent, to nearly $21 billion, as Edward Wyatt reported in The Times last week. Spiritual books like ''The Purpose-Driven Life,'' which has sold more than 22 million copies since 2002, and books with religious themes, like ''The Da Vinci Code,'' have been selling particularly briskly. Political books, both conservative and liberal, have also done well.
 Remarkably, Americans still spend more on books than they do on moviegoing, recorded music, video games or DVD's. Despite all the advances in technology, books still have no equal when it comes to telling complicated, nuanced narratives. 
 The news on book sales is not all good. The driving force behind the increase in revenue is higher prices, not more books sold. In fact, the number of books sold has declined 3 percent in the last three years. And the National Endowment for the Arts found, in a report released last year, that literary reading had declined sharply among adults over the past two decades.
 That means there is still a need for all of the well-known prescriptions: better English instruction in the schools, more literacy programs and more money for libraries. Still, in an age when air travelers can watch a Hollywood movie on their laptops, and video game players can live in a virtual city in their computers, a gratifyingly large number of Americans still want to curl up with a good book.

HEADLINE: A New Nation Has Beaches Like Bali's but Few Tourists

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
A STORM of fine, white sand blew across the half-deserted beach as a group of teenagers kicked a soccer ball by the surf; nearby, other youngsters whooped as they raced bicycles along a beachfront road.
 It was the end of a lazy afternoon one recent Sunday on the outskirts of Dili, the listless little town that is the capital of East Timor, a poor, almost completely undeveloped nation in the Indian Ocean. Slightly larger than Connecticut, this nation shares roughly half of a narrow island with West Timor, which is part of Indonesia. The two-story town becomes an oven in the midday sun, with mostly jobless men and women strolling slowly past near-empty shops.
 Though the weather was perfect and the water crystal clear, this prime beachfront lined with palm trees had an off-season feel to it. Only the low-key Caz Bar and one or two other sunset-watching hangouts seemed alive, with clusters of beer drinkers and a mixture of Western rock and pop music drifting through the air. 
 Simon Richardson, 23, a volunteer medical worker from Britain, turned his back to the stinging storm of sand as a handful of foreigners mixed with the local beachgoers. He pronounced his verdict on a place that has the potential to be an alluring tourist destination but almost little of the infrastructure to support it.
 ''There's not a lot to do in the traditional sense,'' he said. ''There's not much night life. It doesn't have all those things like Jet Skiing.'' 
 Like the other foreigners on the beach, which lies under a towering hilltop statue of Jesus, Mr. Richardson was not a tourist. He was one of the small army of aid workers, volunteers and United Nations employees who help keep East Timor -- officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste -- functioning three years after it emerged from a quarter century of occupation by Indonesia to become an independent nation.
 ''The main reason to come is it's a new place to come,'' he said. ''I feel like it's becoming safe here and tourism is about to take off in the next 10 years. We can say we were here at the beginning.''
 The government tourism bureau says the nation gets about 500 tourists a month -- mostly from China -- but virtually all of them have in fact come primarily to work, said Miguel Lobato, director of tourism for East Timor. Some hop over briefly from Indonesia to renew 30-day tourist visas.
 ''They say, 'What should we do?''' said Susie Mattson, 23, an American who works for an international aid organization and was sitting near Mr. Richardson on the beach. ''Well, there's stuff to do, but it's really expensive. I always have difficulty recommending things.''
 The expense mostly involves high-priced airline tickets and poor-quality hotel rooms whose rates are a strain for a low-budget traveler. The top hotel in Dili is the Timor, a functional, but charmless hotel, which may rate a couple of stars but charges $90 a night and serves extraordinarily bad food.
 The Turismo, slightly less expensive, is a seaside hotel on the eastern side of town that has been there forever with its green patio and fresh ocean breezes. In the same class, the Esplanada, a newer hotel a little to the west, offers pleasant rooms and good food. 
 It is indeed possible to spend very little for a room in a cheap backpacker hotel, and get what you pay for.
 There are a dozen or so good restaurants that pitch themselves to foreign aid workers. Places like the Tropical Bakery, the City Cafe and the One More Bar serve good Western food and are gathering points for the tight-knit foreign community. Dinner for two in rather spartan settings might cost $20 or $25.
 All of this is part of the makeshift economy that depends on the spending of the foreign workers. As the United Nations and aid agencies have shrunk their staffs since East Timor became an independent nation three years ago, the entire national economy has begun to contract and these restaurants will have to struggle to survive.
 Tourism is one of the few hopes for a boost to East Timor's economy. But nothing is specifically in place to welcome tourists, and even the secretary of state for tourism, Jose Teixeira, concedes that it will be years before East Timor will be ready to handle large numbers of visitors.
 ''We need to have a lot of infrastructure,'' he said in an interview, ''including the legal infrastructure for investment. As you know, we started from scratch here.''
 Always a poor nation, this former Portuguese colony was utterly ruined in 1999, when the Indonesian troops who had occupied it for 24 years were forced to withdraw after a United Nations-sponsored referendum resulted in a vote for independence. As they left, the soldiers and the Timorese militias they sponsored systematically tore the country apart, burning most of its buildings and wrecking the infrastructure.
 East Timor has been peaceful since then, first under a United Nations administration and then as a self-governing nation. Most of its buildings have been repaired or replaced, although there are occasional power failures. But it remains desperately poor.
 Even the little open markets scattered around town are soporific, with vendors spreading meager piles of roots and vegetables on the ground or on small wooden stands. Battered taxis cruise the rutted streets and carry passengers for a bargained price of a few dollars.
 And so for the moment, Mr. Teixera said, the country can expect to welcome only ''a bit of the intrepid sort of travelers.''
 For people like this, East Timor offers something increasingly rare, the kind of serendipitous adventure that backpackers experienced in the 1960's, when there were still numerous ''exotic'' destinations where roads were rough, accommodations iffy and food not always readily available. As Tony Wheeler, the founder of the Lonely Planet guidebooks noted in his newly published guide to East Timor, ''Restaurants may be nonexistent in the back blocks, so it's wise to carry food with you, as you can get very hungry before the next market day.''
 Adventurers find beauty in thickly forested mountains and small, Portuguese-era port towns like Liquica and Baucau, with their whitewashed buildings sloping down toward the sea.
 Perhaps the most enthusiastic adventurers are the scuba divers who have found some of the world's most glorious unexploited dive sites off the coast of East Timor.
 ''The thing that's special here is that for the most part, you are the only ones at the dive site,'' said Greg Kintz, an American aid worker who is an avid diver. ''The reefs are for the most part undamaged, so when you go down it's absolutely myriads of fish, unbelievable diversity, gorgeous colors. ''
 There are dozens of dive sites along the beaches, where coral reefs are accessible without a boat. There are 25 sites within 30 miles of Dili alone, said another American diver and aid worker, Nick Hobgood. One is right off the pier at the downtown port, he said, and another at the Com Beach Resort about six hours' drive east of Dili over poor roads.
 But even enthusiasts warn of one of East Timor's major drawbacks. ''It's not easy to get here and you have to go through one of the world-renowned dive sites to get here,'' said Mr. Kintz, noting that geography has dealt East Timor one insurmountable drawback: the primary route to reach it passes through Bali, 700 miles west, a place many visitors never want to leave.

BACKPACKERS AND OTHERS WELCOME

Getting There
 Dili can be reached from Denpasar in Bali or from Darwin, Australia. The Denpasar flights are on Merpati Nusantara, an Indonesian airline, and can be booked through a travel agent or at (62-21) 654-6789 in Jakarta, and cost about $485 round trip. The flights from Darwin, about 440 miles, are on Airnorth, www.airnorth.com.au, starting at about $395 round trip, at $1.34 Australian to the U.S. dollar. The schedules are complicated and should be checked.
 On arrival you are asked to pay $30 (the United States dollar is the official currency) for a tourist visa before going through immigration. There's a $10 departure tax at the airport. 
 Taxis at the airport charge $5 to $7 for the 15-minute ride to the center of town. They cruise the streets for negotiated fares. I paid $2 an hour, although some drivers asked up to $5 an hour.

Where to Stay
 The Esplanada, Avenida da Portugal (also known as Beach Road), in Dili, (670) 331-3088, fax (670)- 3313-087, www.hotelesplanada.com, is one of the most pleasant hotels in East Timor. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, with 34 rooms in two-story bungalows rooms surrounding a pool. The cost is $99 a night, dropping slightly for longer stays. SETH MYDANS

HEADLINE: Still Covering the Big City

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH HAYT

 BODY:
GILBERT CENTER never forgets an umbrella.
 Surrounding him in the small basement workshop of his Brooklyn home, along with worktables crowded with varnish, solvent and orphaned black metal spokes, are hundreds of umbrellas.
 ''There are always features that distinguish one umbrella from another,'' Mr. Center said. ''Somebody will call me up about their umbrella, and I won't recognize their name but they'll tell me, 'It's a blue plaid,' and I'll say, 'I know what you're talking about.''' 
 Mr. Center, 81, has been an umbrella maker and repairman for most of his life after learning the trade from his father, a Russian immigrant who was an apprentice to an umbrella maker before he arrived in this country. To Mr. Center, umbrellas are family. ''They're like children,'' he said. ''Umbrellas are alive.'' 
 After almost three-quarters of a century in and around this business, Mr. Center has mended the tattered canopies of fine European umbrellas and reattached mahogany sticks to turn-of-the-century cane handles. ''I'll restore anything that has to do with an umbrella,'' he said. ''I haven't failed yet.''
 One of the few expert craftsmen in a dying art, he has attracted clients from Westchester to the West Coast, as well as stores like Burberry, Hermes and T. Anthony, which send their repairs to him. He also is the authorized United States representative for the venerable English umbrella maker, Swaine Adeney Brigg.
 ''Gilbert's just the umbrella man,'' said Will Sweeney, a prop man on ''Spamalot,'' who hired Mr. Center to custom make yellow umbrellas that are smaller than average for a tap dance routine in the show. ''He's the guy I go to.'' 
 ''He's the kind of vendor who used to exist in New York in greater numbers but was forced out due to the economics of the business,'' Mr. Sweeney continued. 
 Mr. Center is also one of the few craftsmen who can build an umbrella from scratch, a skill that has prompted calls from Disney, which commissioned him to do a custom design for a Jiminy Cricket character at Disneyland, from producers at the Miss USA 2005 pageant who ordered umbrellas for a performance, and from a London photographer who hired him to build a giant white umbrella for outdoor shoots. 
 Slightly stooped, the white-haired Mr. Center is 5 feet 11. When he smiles, which is often, his light blue eyes appear to twinkle in spite of being covered by large, tinted, aviator-frame eyeglasses. He said his coordination and stamina remain intact although he has mild cataracts, making it difficult for him to thread a needle, and has hearing loss, for which he refuses to wear a hearing aid out of ''vanity.'' 
 His workshop is in a two-family house in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he lives with relatives. Although a typical day might involve trips to Manhattan or Long Island, where he uses equipment at an umbrella company for big jobs, Mr. Center starts and ends his day in the basement doing repairs, which can take from 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the damage. 
 He does about 20 repairs a week, he said, but that number can spike in stormy weather and does not include custom-made umbrellas. Repairs cost $15 to $50; antique restoration is $100; and custom-made umbrellas are $50 to $300. 
 ''If you're lucky enough to get work for shows, then you can make some money,'' he said. ''I could probably charge more, but over the years, you get a feel for what it's worth to fix an umbrella. Sometimes people say to me, 'That's all?' I don't do it for the money. I enjoy it.'' 
 ''But tips are welcome,'' he added with a wink.
 On a recent Friday, Mr. Center arrived at P.E. Guerin, a decorative hardware manufacturer on Jane Street, to meet with the manager, Martin Grubman, who owns about 100 antique umbrellas and 75 antique canes. The collector handed over a chipped 1880 silver and mother-of-pearl handle. To fix it, Mr. Center would delve into his huge inventory of old parts to find pieces of mother-of-pearl, cut them down, and match them to the original.
 Mr. Center got his start working for his father, who opened a shop on Essex Street in 1933. Upon his death in 1969, Mr. Center took over.
 In 1984, the building was put up for sale. Mr. Center was then turning 65. His wife of more than 25 years had died nearly a decade earlier, and neither of his two grown, married daughters wanted the business. He retired to the Dominican Republic, where it was ''cheap and adventurous,'' he said. ''For $100 a month, I lived like a king.''
 Remarrying a much younger woman, he returned with her to New York after six months because he grew bored, he said. Although the couple had a son, the marriage did not last.
 Mr. Center got a job at Uncle Sam Umbrellas and Canes on West 57th Street, and worked there for 14 years, until 2000, when it folded. At that point, Mr. Center struck out on his own and gained the loyal following he enjoys to this day. 
 Meanwhile, a younger generation of umbrella enthusiasts is anticipating the return of handmade umbrellas as a style statement. Mr. Center is collaborating with Jodell Egbert, 38, owner of Bella Umbrella, a Seattle-based shop for vintage umbrellas, to create a line of pagoda-shaped parasols with detachable jeweled handles, which she plans to market to brides wanting to ''individualize themselves,'' she said.
 David Kreitman, an owner of BrellaBar, a NoLIta boutique that sells Italian and vintage umbrellas, which Mr. Center services, will soon open another store in response to what Mr. Kreitman perceives as a growing popularity of umbrellas as a luxury accessory. Some might argue that his biggest challenge is to convince customers to spend $300 or more on an item that is easily lost. But he has a greater worry. 
 ''Gilbert runs around the city, taking care of people's umbrellas,'' Mr. Kreitman said. ''Everyone wonders, 'What will happen when there is no Gilbert?'''

HEADLINE: College's Layoffs: Both Bane and Boon

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH Mercy College officials say restructuring efforts that included the layoffs of almost 50 office workers and deans are paying off, a union representing some of those affected has filed a federal grievance against the college.
 Administrators at the main campus here report that some benefits of the changes made earlier this spring mean that students no longer have to wait in long lines to apply for student aid and that Mercy's satellite campuses -- in the Bronx, Manhattan, White Plains, Yorktown and Yonkers -- are running more efficiently. 
 The layoffs and reorganization are part of a larger national and international trend among institutions of higher education, which are receiving less public money, to become more competitive in the market place, explained Tom Milton, vice president for enrollment management at the college. 
 A publication -- an online essay based on a round-table discussion -- of the American Council on Education in Washington this spring seems to echo Mr. Milton's contention, reporting a ''rapidly developing injection of free-market principles and practices into the once-buffered world of academe.'' 
 In response to the layoffs, which were made in April, Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers has filed a grievance with the federal government against the college. In the grievance, it claims, among other things, that Mercy passed over long-term older workers and filled positions with ''newer, younger people from outside,'' said Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110. Ms. Rosenstein called the layoffs of union workers inappropriate.
 But Mercy's interim president, Louise H. Feroe, said that the recent restructuring here was the culmination of ''10 years of computer technology and part of a long-term plan to put resources where they are most effective.'' The private college has 9,800 full- and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on six campuses.
 The administrators' positive assessment of the college's new direction, though, was of little comfort to former union workers like Verna Holloway, a loan coordinator here for 14 years before losing her job. ''The college called it a restructuring and used words like 'one-stop shopping' for students, but for me it means unemployment if I don't find other work soon,'' said Ms. Holloway, who is a member of the union.
 Ms. Holloway is one of 40 members of Local 2110, which includes workers in universities, publishing, museums and law firms, who worked at the college and either lost their jobs or were moved to new positions. Ms. Holloway, a union representative on campus, said that when she was told she was out of a job, she was given an hour to pack her belongings and leave. Other workers, she said, were given 30 days' notice.
 ''The way I was treated was a bit harsh,'' she said. ''All I had time to do was hug my friends and say goodbye.''
 DESPITE the laid-off workers' outrage, Mr. Milton said the reorganization was necessary if the college here, like many others, is to survive financially. While Mercy is in no immediate danger of closing, he said, the college wanted to streamline operations. ''Traditionally colleges have not been notable for the attention to customer services, but students and their parents today want better services, like they get in stores,'' he said. ''They don't want us to waste their time or give them the runaround.''
 Mercy's campus deans have been replaced with campus managers, who oversee operations at the separate campuses but do not address educational issues, which fall within the purview of faculty and administration at the central campus here, he said. ''You can see the effect in just one month,'' Mr. Milton said. ''When I walk around on the campuses, I see physical improvements now. Things are neater. More of the facilities are kept up. You don't need deans to make the hallways look better.'' 
 College officials have closed the offices of the registrar, financial aid and bursar and replaced them with a single unit called the Center for Student Services. ''A year ago, it took 90 minutes, students told us, to get financial aid,'' Mr. Milton said. ''Now they say it takes a half-hour.'' 
 Although Local 2110 has filed a grievance, Ms. Rosenstein, its president, said workers are willing to negotiate with the college and have begun a series of meetings. 
 But June Benjamin, a union organizer at Mercy who claims the college has violated workers' seniority rights, predicted ''a long process'' to get things worked out. Ms. Benjamin said most of the workers affected had been working at the college 15 to 20 years, earning about $25,000 annually. She described long-time older employees like Ms. Holloway, who is in her 50's and was fired after putting in many years at Mercy, as the most vulnerable in terms of finding new job.
 ''Other people were brought back at lower pay, but it's not clear there's a difference in their positions,'' Ms. Benjamin added. ''It was just a superficial change in title.''
 The campus's faculty association, which is not represented by a union, objected via e-mail messages to the firing of four deans who were told to leave the same day they told they no longer had jobs, according to Ms. Feroe, the interim college president. ''But with very high administrative personnel, it was the cleanest way to do that,'' Ms. Feroe said. ''They did receive a fairly generous severance.''
 A former dean, who declined to be identified, said he was shocked by the dismissals, as were students on the campus where he worked, who, he added, ''had to hold each other up when they heard the news.''

HEADLINE: 6-Figure Salaries? To Many Teachers, A Matter of Course

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN and JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THE hiring of a public school teacher in Scarsdale, one of the most sought-after districts in the nation, begins with a flood of applications and can take months.
 A careful screening of credentials winnows 80 or 90 applications to about 15, who then get probing telephone calls from the department chief. A half-dozen are invited for interviews. Two or three of those are asked to demonstrate their teaching prowess in the classroom before the lucky survivor is offered a job.
 ''This has to be someone who has an interest in the larger issues of teaching, with an inquisitive mind, a person of tolerance and openness,'' said Christopher Douglass, the English department chairman at Scarsdale High School, emphasizing that he ''immediately discounts'' any applicant who mentions an interest in a large salary. 
 But this noble sensibility ignores a crucial fact about the teaching profession in Westchester County: Teacher pay levels in Scarsdale, and several other districts in the county, are now high enough to constitute an entry ticket to upper-middle-class income and status. In Scarsdale, 166 teachers -- nearly half -- have base salaries exceeding $100,000; for more than a dozen, base pay tops $120,000. 
 A study of teacher salaries across New York State found that as administrators and affluent parents compete to give their children every possible advantage, thousands of teachers in the New York suburbs now make six-figure salaries -- numbers strongly at variance with the popular stereotype of the poorly paid, altruistic mentor of the young. 
 The study indicates that only the most experienced teachers, with the most education, earn such salaries -- which are the highest in the nation. But the money is arguably substantial enough to affect what it means to be a public school teacher. Consider this, for instance: A family whose parents both teach in Westchester schools can make enough to put it in the top 6 percent of earners in the county.
 Teachers say the salaries are justified, even necessary, in a place where the cost of living is high. ''You can earn $100,000 and not afford to live here,'' said Susan Taylor, a longtime Scarsdale teacher who heads the district's teacher training institute.
 And in fact the rising salaries have not really made waves in Westchester, because in many communities they have arrived in tandem with rising property values -- which softens the effect of school district budget increases. 
 The average home in Scarsdale, for instance, sold for $1.4 million in 2004, and the average income per pupil in the schools was more than $500,000 in 2002, five times that in the rest of the state.
 ''Our taxes are high, but our education is superior,'' said Ellen Cohen, 53, who has a daughter at Scarsdale High School. ''It doesn't bother me that teachers do so well.''
 She is one of many Scarsdale homeowners who, like those in other affluent communities around New York, based their choice of suburb on the reputation of the schools. For these parents, the relationship between good schools and good neighborhoods is symbiotic. 
 ''I would not have moved to Hartsdale or Eastchester, because of the reputation of the schools,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''We live in Scarsdale for different reasons, but one of those is the education is excellent.''
 IN Westchester, the study found 1,074 teachers -- 1 of every 9 -- who made more than $100,000 in the 2003-04 school year, the most recent for which data are available. (That total excludes Yonkers, whose teachers have worked without a contract for the last two years. The state does not collect salary data in districts where salary issues remain unresolved.)
 The number of six-figure base salaries tripled between 2001 and 2003; among those in that earning bracket are 223 elementary teachers, 39 kindergarten teachers and 61 physical education teachers. Base salaries do not include stipends for extra duties like coaching and directing plays, which can add thousands. 
 With combined step and cost-of-living increases, the median salary of a Westchester teacher who had 10 years' experience and a master's degree in 2001 had advanced 5 percent a year by 2003, a time when other salaries in the Northeast went up about 3 percent a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 In May, Scarsdale's school budget passed without controversy, and by 73 percent, even more overwhelmingly than the year before. The school board president, Jeff Samuelson, believes there is a consensus in his community to attract and pay for the best teachers.
 ''One group this year said, 'We understand we are the leader but we don't want to get too far out in front of No.2,''' Mr. Samuelson said. Other than that, he said, ''we don't hear that much about teacher salaries.''
 Similarly in White Plains, where a substantial commercial tax base keeps residential taxes low, a quarter of teachers (151) make more than $100,000, with little taxpayer complaint.
 ''Our teachers are our best asset,'' said Donna O. McLaughlin, the White Plains school board president. ''I think it's very important that we pay them well. You need to be competitive.''
 She acknowledges that deep pockets help. ''We are very fortunate,'' she said. ''We have a lot of industry that helps pay the taxes, so the taxes in White Plains are nowhere near what they are in nearby areas.'' 
 Six-figure teachers are not unique to the New York suburbs. Connecticut and New Jersey reported a few dozen in 2003. In the Chicago suburbs, state records show that hundreds of teachers make six figures when all their extra stipends are figured in.
 But they have not been universally adopted, by any means. The top base salary for New York City teachers is $81,232 (although some make six figures with stipends and overtime). In California, the highest teacher salary in 2003 was well under $100,000, according to state figures.
 In the state, Scarsdale was among the first to have teachers reach six-figure salaries, starting in the late 1990's. ''It's been a conscious strategy of this district over a lot of years to be among the leaders in salary,'' said Michael McGill, the superintendent. 
 The pay raises quickly appeared in other districts in Westchester and Long Island as administrators competed for talent. Now, 29 of the county's 41 districts have teachers making six figures.
 Most are in their early 50's, and have advanced degrees and 25 years of experience. Contracts are structured to reward for longevity. Median salary for a teacher with one year of experience in Scarsdale was about $50,000 in 2003. Each year of experience brings a step up in salary, and extra hours in seminars at the teaching institute earn additional raises. The top salary in Scarsdale for a teacher who spends no more than 20 percent of his time as a department head or other administrator was $128,000 in 2003.
 ''The community wants stability and experience,'' said Ms. Taylor. ''There's a lot invested in the retention of a good teacher.''
 THE less wealthy districts, meanwhile, struggle to compete in the expensive suburban market. In Mount Vernon, where the property values per student are one-fifth those of Scarsdale, no teacher had a base salary over $100,000 in 2003, although the top salary of a full-time teacher came close, at $96,000.
 Mount Vernon -- most of whose students are black -- is not poor except by Westchester standards. Although its test scores rose dramatically this year, they are still far below Scarsdale's. 
 Brenda L. Smith, the superintendent, worries about being able to deliver a competitive education to students in a place where teacher costs are so high.
 ''We really have a need to be comparable to other districts in terms of the quality we get, but our district is lower in terms of resources,'' Ms. Smith said. ''We compete on job satisfaction. People come to Mount Vernon to make a difference in the lives of children.''
 She added, ''It's a compliment to our teachers, who are willing to work in Mount Vernon for less than they could make in neighboring towns.'' 
 John Larkin, a teacher at Mount Vernon High School with 32 years' experience and two master's degrees, also emphasized satisfactions other than financial. ''This is not an easy job, it's an extraordinarily exhausting job,'' he said, as he watched his girls' softball team take batting practice. ''But it offers you an opportunity to be creative, and how many jobs really do that? Working with young people can be quite challenging, but it can also be quite invigorating.''
 Mr. Larkin lives in Eastchester, between Mount Vernon and Scarsdale, and works as a coach and during summers, he said, because of ''economic realities.'' 
 The day before a recent game against Scarsdale, his team had to practice without seven of its players, who were staying after school for academic work.
 ''Scarsdale is a challenge to us,'' he said. He was hopeful, even though his team had lost twice, 10-1. ''They were not that overpowering. Our girls hit their pitcher pretty well.''
 Mount Vernon lost again, this time by 21-2.
 SO far, there has been little evidence of a backlash against school costs in Westchester. Only six budgets were defeated last month.
 But one of those was in Edgemont, a rich district next to Scarsdale. Salaries are high in Edgemont, and Jack Vaughan, 70, a lawyer and Edgemont homeowner who organized opposition to the budget this year, argued that salaries, among other costs, have become too high.
 ''I would say when you combine the salaries and the perks, that they are probably being overcompetitive,'' said Mr. Vaughan. ''We're willing to pay for good teachers, but not unreasonably so.''
 But Mr. Douglass, the Scarsdale teacher, couldn't disagree more. While he may discount someone who mentions salary in the interview process, he believes it does attract the best people.
 ''I have to tell you,'' he said, ''six figures is a pretty minimal amount for Scarsdale. These are people's children. Our culture values salaries and the salaries should be an important reward for all this hard work.''

 Re ''The Five-Bedroom, Six-Figure Rootless Life'' (''Class Matters'' series, front page, June 1):
 I just left the ''relo,'' or relocation, class, having lived in Alpharetta, Ga.-like variations with absent fathers and overscheduled kids. A place where a second grader with a few rough Little League outings gets a personal trainer to play catch and help his self-esteem. 
 Like the Links described in the article, we decided that for our children's high school years, we needed roots. As a family, we had tried to opt out of the hyperparenting, but unstructured kid time is no fun if everyone else in the cul-de-sac is fully booked. We moved one last time to a rooted place. 
 We have family dinners now where we argue for our ideas. We play town-level sports with neighbors. We see poets at our awesome library. This feels like a better childhood for our kids where we can ignore overscheduling. 
 But there are two small glitches: high school sports and college applications. Both seem to require a childhood enclosed in S.U.V. armor, driving the mean streets to daily practice-tutors-lessons in order to make the cut. 
 I have my fingers crossed for the underscheduled slackers.

 Some people think that Bob Dylan's ''Like a Rolling Stone'' is the best rock song ever written. ''How does it feel to be on your own, with no direction home?'' 
 No one in America understands that song better than the ''relos'' of the new exurban diaspora.
 That's why megachurches are growing. That's why Kathy Link is in a Bible study group. 
 At its best, religion offers two things that the relos desperately need: community and meaning.

To the Editor:
 I appreciate your ''Class Matters'' series, highlighting the pervasive effects of social class on individual lives -- whether through poverty, stunted aspirations, poor education, lack of access to health care or inadequate housing. 
 It is a stain on our society -- and a mockery of the American Dream -- that class origin has come to function more and more as caste, as a fixed and unequal condition, with less and less contact and flow between the worlds of the haves and the have-nots.
 More than 40 years ago, I was the child of poor and uneducated parents. But I was lucky -- and I had help from, and formed social ties with, others who were more fortunate than I was. But as the worlds of the rich and the poor grow more remote from one another, such help and ties are less in evidence. More to the point, class is an artifact of society and not of nature. 
 We owe our fellow citizens something better than an institutional structure that allows their fates to depend so deeply on the brute luck of class origin.

HEADLINE: Old Nantucket Warily Meets the New

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: NANTUCKET, Mass. 

 BODY:
In spring, along with the daffodils, crowds on the ferry and workers raking the beaches, comes the ritual of real estate gossip. What properties changed hands over the winter? And who could possibly be paying those out-of-sight prices?
 That 15-acre waterfront parcel for sale for $15 million? It was snatched up after only one day on the market. Turns out the purchaser was Steven Rales, the billionaire entrepreneur who owns at least 61 acres next door and bought the parcel to protect his privacy and waterfront views, said Dalton Frazier, a local real estate agent.
 Have any other palatial estates expanded? Not so long ago H. Wayne Huizenga, the billionaire founder of Blockbuster and owner of the Miami Dolphins, wanted more elbow room and bought a neighboring house for $2.5 million. Richard Mellon Scaife, the publisher and heir to a banking fortune, bought an extra house too; he needed it for the staff. 
 The real estate frenzy, even in the dead of winter, is only the most visible reminder that over the past decade or so this 50-square-mile, fishhook-shaped island off the Cape Cod coast has come to be dominated by a new class: the hyper-rich. They emerged in the 1980's and 1990's, when tectonic shifts in the economy created mountains of wealth. They resemble the arrivistes of the Gilded Age, which began in the 1880's when industrial capitalists amassed staggering fortunes, except that there are so many of them and they seem to be relatively anonymous.
 Like their precursors, they tend to be brash, confident and unapologetic. They feel they have earned their money, and they are not shy about spending it. They construct huge mansions, outdo one another in buying high-end status symbols like mega-yachts (100 years ago it was private railroad cars) and not infrequently turn to philanthropy. Their wealth is washing over the upper reaches of society as it did a century ago, bringing cultural and political clout as they take up positions on museum boards and organize presidential campaign fund-raising dinners.
 And they seem unconcerned about being accepted by the old money. If the blue bloods want to mix with them, fine. But if not, the hyper-rich are content to stick with their kind. If they cannot join an exclusive country club, they form their own. They are very good at creating a self-enclosed world where the criterion for admission is not the Social Register, but money.
 Once a low-key summer resort, Nantucket is rapidly turning into their private preserve, joining the ranks of other enclaves like Palm Beach, Aspen, the Hamptons and Sun Valley. Now that the hyper-rich have achieved a critical mass, property values have zoomed so high that the less-well-off are being forced to leave and the island is becoming nature's ultimate gated community.
 ''It's a castle with a moat around it,'' said Michael J. Kittredge, a 53-year-old entrepreneur who realized a fortune when he sold his Yankee Candle Company seven years ago for about $500 million. He was relaxing in the living room of his 10,000-square-foot house, which has a basement movie theater and a 2,000-bottle wine cellar. A separate residence a quarter-mile away houses staff members and a gym.
 ''Successful people want to be with other successful people,'' Mr. Kittredge said. ''Birds of a feather,'' he added. ''On Nantucket you don't feel bad because you want a nice bottle of wine. If you order a $300 bottle in a restaurant, the guy at the next table is ordering a $400 bottle.''
 Dressed in blue jeans and a pink button-down shirt, he looked across the breadth of his swimming pool at a spectacular water view. The island, he said, is rapidly dividing into two types of people: ''the haves and the have-mores.''

New-Fashioned Values
 Nantucket, with its vistas overlooking cranberry bogs and more than 80 miles of beaches, has always had its share of rich people. In the first half of the 19th century, owners of whaling ships amassed fortunes from oil and built the still well-preserved Federalist and Greek Revival mansions on upper Main Street. 
 During the last century, Vanderbilts, Mellons, duPonts and other wealthy families built residences here. Over time, as inherited wealth smoothed the rough edges, their descendants morphed into American high society and evolved a signature style of living based on understatement and old-fashioned patrician values.
 Some of the scions of these older families are still here. They spend their time sailing, playing tennis and sometimes recalling the halcyon days of crossing the moors behind packs of beagles to hunt down rabbits. The mix of the old aristocratic families and the hyper-rich often plays out as a none-too-subtle tug of war between class and money. 
 Nina Chandler Murray, an 85-year-old relative of the Poor family from Standard & Poor's, the investment credit rating firm, is convinced that the world of the elite was more genteel in the old days.
 ''Coming from a New England background, you had a honed discipline of what was expected,'' Dr. Murray, a psychologist, said over iced tea and chocolate chip cookies on the porch of her hillside home above the harbor. ''Showing off money was a sin. It was not that status was not important, but marriage was very closely controlled and predetermined, and everyone knew where everyone else fit.''
 A family name alone was enough to place someone in the pecking order. Wealthy people dressed down. Women eschewed heavy jewelry. The uniform for a man was a plain shirt, faded ''Nantucket red'' Bermuda shorts and Topsiders. Now, Dr. Murray suggested, the rule is: If you've got it, flaunt it.
 ''What has happened in America is that achievement is so important that everyone wants everyone else to know what they have done,'' she continued. ''And in case you don't know, they want to tell you with a lethal combination of houses, cars and diamonds.''
 Dr. Murray was appalled at a recent dinner party when a woman leaned over to her and said, ''My husband paid $250,000 to join the golf club, and he doesn't even play golf.''

Work Hard, Spend Hard
 Mr. Kittredge, who began his candle-making business at age 16 in his mother's kitchen and says he was raised in a ''lower-class to lower-middle-class'' home, holds attitudes typical of many of the newcomers. When prodded he will say that he worked hard for his money and that others can do the same. He is unapologetic about spending it lavishly and says that he has paid his dues in the form of taxes, which he estimates at $500 million so far. He also says that the chasm between the old-timers and the newcomers is inevitable.
 ''Money makes a lifestyle,'' he said. ''It creates a division between the old money and the new. It is a little bit of class jealousy. We go to a cocktail party and a guy is telling my wife about his airplane. So finally the question comes up: 'How do you get over to the island?' and she says, 'We come by plane.' And he says, 'What kind of plane?' and she says, 'A G-IV.' And so the wind comes out of the guy's sails.''
 ''The old money guy has a twin-prop airplane and that is pretty incredible,'' Mr. Kittredge continued. ''For his time, that is pretty great. Now he is talking to a guy who is half his age who has a transcontinental jet. That is the end of the conversation.
 ''Or you meet someone and they start telling you about their boat. He has a 45-foot boat and he is very happy with it. Then he'll say, 'Do you have a boat?' And you say, 'Yes.' 'Well, what kind of boat do you have?' And you say, 'A Fed Ship.' And he says, 'How big is it?' That's how people rank them. So I have to say, 'It's 200 feet.' It's the end of the conversation. Is there envy? Yes, could be. Was he a wealthy guy in his day? Absolutely, but relative to today -- no. The two worlds can mix as long as they don't talk too much.''
 The accouterments of wealth play a different role for the old-money clans than they do for the new wealthy, says Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., author of ''Old Money.''
 ''For many self-made men,'' Mr. Aldrich said, ''homes, boats and even membership in expensive clubs are trophy signs of wealth. But for the older money, a boat may well be part of a tableau that has to do with family, with his grandparents and his children. It is part of his identity. If he walked away from the conversation, it was because he thought he was talking about his boat as part of his life. Instead he found he was talking about money, and he doesn't like being reminded that he lives in a competitive world.''
 Over time, some say, the new money will not prove much different. ''Ultimately, the new money becomes as insular as the old money because it gains the power to exclude,'' said Michael Thomas, a novelist who, like his father, was a partner at Lehman Brothers and whose mother came from an old New England family. ''Once you have the power to exclude, you have what people have been seeking in old money.'' 
 The single greatest change brought by the hyper-rich is in the cost of housing. The average Nantucket house price last year jumped 26 percent, to $1.672 million, said H. Flint Ranney, a veteran real estate broker. 
 Last fall one waterfront residence, with its own elevator, wine cellar, theaters and separate guesthouse, sold for $16 million, the year's record. 
 ''Shame has somehow gone out the window,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''There is no incentive to exercise control.''
 A handful of the new affluent indulge their fantasies with gusto. Michael S. Egan, the founder of Alamo Rent-a-Car, built his own baseball field, complete with a batting cage and stands. Roger Penske, the automotive tycoon and former race car driver, tussled for months with the Historic District Commission until he finally won permission to build a faux lighthouse that joins the two wings of his multimillion-dollar home. The investment banker Robert Greenhill likes to fly his Cessna jet to the Nantucket airport or his Cessna seaplane to his waterfront dock.
 The rise in real estate values has, of course, benefited many of the old-timers. With some of their fortunes eroding, they find they are sitting on an extremely valuable asset, a realization that adds a touch of ambivalence to their protests against changes that are all too obvious. 
 One such change is at the airport. On high summer weekends, more than 250 Challengers, Gulfstreams and Citations a day might land there, vying for parking spaces. Some jets drop off passengers for a round of golf and whisk them away after.
 In easternmost Siasconset, the gray-shingled fishermen's cottages that occupied the corners of plots of sea grass and wildflowers are giving way to mansions in private cul-de-sacs. Here and there hedges have sprouted up, tall as windsurfers, to partition the property parcels. They separate the community, contributing to the ineffable sense that something familiar and precious about the ethos of the island is disappearing.
 ''At least one new family has built a hedge to avoid people seeing them as they pass by,'' said Wade Green, 72, who has summered here for years. ''Those open paths had an old-fashioned elegance to them. It is part of an old and fading spirit of community. Blocking them off is an unfriendly and antipublic thing to do.''
 Not all the changes here are striking. Downtown, with its cobblestone streets and absence of traffic lights, could still pass as a quaint New England fishing village. But some harbingers horrify the old-timers: upscale restaurants, boutique windows displaying expensive designer jewelry and the arrival of the first ever chain store, a Ralph Lauren shop.
 On the sidewalks, class speaks through clothes. ''The old money wears Lily Pulitzer, J. McLaughlin and CK Bradley,'' said one saleswoman, who wanted her name withheld to avoid offending customers. ''They wear gold hoops, and if they buy new jewelry it is pearls or they upgrade their diamond rings. The new money wears Juicy Couture, Calypso and big necklaces. They even go to different restaurants. The old people go to 21 Federal and the new people go to the Pearl. They don't want to mix. They want to show off for each other.''
 But the lines cross. A handful of the hyper-rich gravitate toward Lily Pulitzer to give themselves a blue-blood look. And some pedigreed teenagers lust for Juicy Couture. 
 Daisy Soros, wife of the harbor designer Paul Soros and sister-in-law of the financier George Soros, has been coming to Nantucket since the 1960's, an era when few women, new money or old, dressed up. She thinks that the newcomers are beginning to influence the culture. 
 ''Everybody is building monster houses now, and they are all dressing up,'' Mrs. Soros said. ''Now even I wear Manolos,'' she added with a laugh. 
 Some say that too much is being made of all these distinctions. ''The only people who are truly class conscious,'' said Roger Horchow, who realized his fortune when he sold his catalog business to Neiman Marcus in 1988 for $117 million, ''are the second tootsie wives of men with big bankrolls.''

Why Wait? Build a New One
 When there is a division between the old and the new, it is apt to express itself on the most time-honored of battlefields: the putting green, the tennis court or the marine berth. 
 The existing clubs are still the preserves of the old wealth, but new clubs are springing up to welcome newcomers, as well as some longtime residents who grew impatient with waiting lists. For years the Sankaty Head Golf Club had a waiting list that seemed to extend for decades. So in 1995, Edmund A. Hajim, an investment banker in Manhattan, and others created the Nantucket Golf Club, assiduously designed to look as if it had been around forever. It became such a hit that its list is now full, too, even at a cost of $325,000 (80 percent reimbursable upon departure), as opposed to the $30,000 it costs to join Sankaty Head.
 In the same way, the old Nantucket Yacht Club has spawned a rival, the Great Harbor Yacht Club. About 300 families have already bought memberships, which now cost $300,000.
 Some Nantucketers applaud the new clubs. 
 ''Why shouldn't they start a club if they can't get into the old ones,'' said Letitia Lundeen, who was raised in the social whirl of New York and Washington and now runs an antiques store here.
 The resentment of new money riles Liz Petkevich, whose husband, J. Misha Petkevich, an investment banker and former Olympic figure skater, helped found the new yacht club.
 Her husband worked hard for what he achieved, she said. ''Does that mean we are better than anyone else? No. But we should not be penalized because we cannot get into the old yacht club.'' 
 In the old days, the clubs were homogenous and dominated by white Anglo-Saxon Protestant families. 
 ''When I first came here it was the tail end of the 'grande dame' era,'' said David L. Hostetler, a sculptor, who arrived in 1971. ''The place was dominated by WASP women in Bermuda shorts. There were hardly any Jews.''
 Today the island's elite is diversified enough to support a synagogue where membership has reached 250 families and where the yarmulke worn during services is Nantucket red and decorated with miniature whales.
 One place where the old and the new do mix is charity events. As in cultural and philanthropic institutions from San Francisco to New York City, the old money has made room at the table for the new money to replenish the coffers. There are more and more fund-raising events, and they are no longer the low-key affairs they once were. Last year the annual cocktail party and auction for the Nantucket Historical Association instituted valet parking and a classical quartet in black tie.
 Some appreciate the infusion of money and energy that the newcomers have brought. ''The old money doesn't like to spend money because they worry about whether they can make it again,'' Ms. Lundeen said. ''Even when they can spend it, they often think it's vulgar and unnecessary. The newcomers have brought the island up to par with their demands.'' 

Everything New Is Old
 Old-time Nantucketers are given to trading what one of them called ''barbarian stories.'' Did you hear that Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs partner, annoyed some of his neighbors when he hired Jackson Browne to entertain at his anniversary party? Or that Jon Winkelried, another Goldman Sachs partner, had the nerve to close off a small road that people had been using for as long as anyone can remember? Or that Louis V. Gerstner, the former I.B.M. chief executive, hired a Boston litigator to help him push through a plan for a large new house on his $11 million waterfront plot? 
 Aggressive behavior, Dr. Murray said, is natural to the species. ''And after all, why should they give it up?'' she said. ''Look where it has gotten them. That is exactly how they made their money.'' 
 One Nantucketer was L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International, on trial a second time on charges of criminal larceny, accused of looting the company of tens of millions of dollars. His lavish New York apartment, with its $6,000 shower curtain, became a symbol of the over-the-top corporate lifestyle.
 To some, the multimillion-dollar party that Mr. Kozlowski gave on Sardinia to celebrate his wife's birthday -- replete with a vodka-spewing ice sculpture fashioned after Michelangelo's ''David'' -- was a modern echo of the lavish celebrations of the Gilded Age. 
 Subtler distinctions between old and new money lie in the attitude toward work. The financier David Rubinstein bought a 15-acre waterfront property, tore down the existing house, as many wealthy buyers have done, and put up an 8,000-square-foot home. The stunning view lets him watch the sun rise and set, and yet he has boasted to friends that he spends only 12 days a year here; a rock on his front lawn reads: ''I'd rather be working.'' 
 Robert E. Torray, who is a co-manager of a mutual fund family and has been flying here on his company's Gulfstream since the 1980's, is either on the golf course or working the phone in his cranberry red library. He likes it here because there are Wall Street moguls everywhere and wherever he goes he can talk business.
 That is hardly the attitude of some veteran summer residents, who find comfort in the thought that they can occasionally be fogged in without worrying about the office. For them, being rich means a license to break schedules and to play. ''If you are working,'' said Nicki Gamble, whose husband, Richard, is an heir to the Proctor & Gamble fortune, ''it is very nerve-racking. The way to be here is not to be working.''

Caught by a Boom
 The high cost of housing is squeezing middle-class people off the island.
 The former principal of Nantucket High School, Paul Richards, and his wife, Martina, a nurse, moved last year to Needham, Mass., after renting here for five years. ''The expense of that together with having two little children made a home beyond reach,'' Mr. Richards said. ''It was frustrating to be driven away from two jobs that we very much enjoyed, but a starter home for our family would have cost over $600,000.''
 Linda Finney Williams, administrator of the Nantucket Zoning Board of Appeals, who has a 19-year-old son in college and an older daughter in law school, said, ''I'm hanging on by my fingernails.'' 
 ''The cost of living has risen so much that it's very hard on us.'' 
 The demand for labor is so great that every weekday roughly 400 workers fly in from the mainland for construction, gardening, plumbing and other services. The commute may be a nuisance, but the money makes it worthwhile. It also explains why building is so expensive; the additional costs are passed along to customers. 
 John Sheehan, a 65-year-old construction worker who rises every day at 4:30 a.m. to catch a plane from Hyannis, does not complain. ''I have always been in the lower-middle-class area,'' Mr. Sheehan said. ''But the times are good for me now. I'm making more money than I ever did and I'm living more comfortably.''
 To try to stem the outflow of workers the Nantucket Housing Office, a private nonprofit group, has proposed a one-time ''McMansion'' tax of $8 per square foot on any construction space exceeding 3,000 square feet.
 The bill has several more hurdles, but if it is approved, the proceeds would be used to build housing for families making $120,825 a year or less. 
 Some real estate agents worry that the hyper-rich will resent the tax, but so far wealthy homebuilders seem to regard it as a pittance compared with the other costs they incur.
 Despite the money to be made, some shop owners and other locals miss the way the island used to be. 
 Though she applauds their self-confidence, Ms. Lundeen, the antiques dealer, says she is sometimes appalled by what she considers the cavalier ignorance of some women who are suddenly rich. ''They don't want to learn,'' she said. ''I had a monogrammed tray and when I proposed it to a customer, she said, 'Why would I want other people's monograms?' These women have never inherited anything.'' 
 Robin Bergland, a young florist who moved here from Manhattan, has stopped providing flowers for weddings. ''The final straw was a wedding where a Wall Street executive tried to bill me for the wedding gown and medical expenses,'' she said. ''He charged that the roses I used to decorate their party tent ruined the hem of the bride's dress and caused her aunt to trip and break her leg.
 ''I got threatening phone calls daily. I was terrified until I gave the case to my lawyer and they went away. There's no question it was unlikely to have happened five years ago.''
 The old summer people ''used to try and fit in,'' said Arlene Briard, a taxi driver who has lived here 35 years. ''They didn't want to differentiate themselves by class or by a look that said how much money I have. When I sold TV Guides to people, I'd walk into a house, sit down and have a lemonade with people or play tennis with them at the yacht club. Now they get in my taxi and find a way to tell me that they belong to the Nantucket Golf Club.
 ''Class has a certain grace,'' Ms. Briard said. ''Just because you can go to Chanel and buy a dress does not mean you have class. A person who just pays their bills on time can have class.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 23, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about the life of the rich in Nantucket and a front-page article on June 1 about affluent families who often relocate because of their employment both misspelled the name of a clothing brand emblematic of the upper middle class. It is Lilly Pulitzer, not Lily.

A front-page article on June 5 about the life of the rich in Nantucket referred incorrectly to a type of yacht owned by some. It is a Feadship -- that is, from the Feadship yards in the Netherlands -- not a Fed ship.

HEADLINE: Monkey Business

BYLINE: By Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt. 
Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt are the authors of ''Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything.''

 BODY:
Keith Chen's Monkey Research 
Adam Smith, the founder of classical economics, was certain that humankind's knack for monetary exchange belonged to humankind alone. ''Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog,'' he wrote. ''Nobody ever saw one animal by its gestures and natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am willing to give this for that.'' But in a clean and spacious laboratory at Yale-New Haven Hospital, seven capuchin monkeys have been taught to use money, and a comparison of capuchin behavior and human behavior will either surprise you very much or not at all, depending on your view of humans.
 The capuchin is a New World monkey, brown and cute, the size of a scrawny year-old human baby plus a long tail. ''The capuchin has a small brain, and it's pretty much focused on food and sex,'' says Keith Chen, a Yale economist who, along with Laurie Santos, a psychologist, is exploiting these natural desires -- well, the desire for food at least -- to teach the capuchins to buy grapes, apples and Jell-O. ''You should really think of a capuchin as a bottomless stomach of want,'' Chen says. ''You can feed them marshmallows all day, they'll throw up and then come back for more.''
 When most people think of economics, they probably conjure images of inflation charts or currency rates rather than monkeys and marshmallows. But economics is increasingly being recognized as a science whose statistical tools can be put to work on nearly any aspect of modern life. That's because economics is in essence the study of incentives, and how people -- perhaps even monkeys -- respond to those incentives. A quick scan of the current literature reveals that top economists are studying subjects like prostitution, rock 'n' roll, baseball cards and media bias.
 Chen proudly calls himself a behavioral economist, a member of a growing subtribe whose research crosses over into psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary biology. He began his monkey work as a Harvard graduate student, in concert with Marc Hauser, a psychologist. The Harvard monkeys were cotton-top tamarins, and the experiments with them concerned altruism. Two monkeys faced each other in adjoining cages, each equipped with a lever that would release a marshmallow into the other monkey's cage. The only way for one monkey to get a marshmallow was for the other monkey to pull its lever. So pulling the lever was to some degree an act of altruism, or at least of strategic cooperation.
 The tamarins were fairly cooperative but still showed a healthy amount of self-interest: over repeated encounters with fellow monkeys, the typical tamarin pulled the lever about 40 percent of the time. Then Hauser and Chen heightened the drama. They conditioned one tamarin to always pull the lever (thus creating an altruistic stooge) and another to never pull the lever (thus creating a selfish jerk). The stooge and the jerk were then sent to play the game with the other tamarins. The stooge blithely pulled her lever over and over, never failing to dump a marshmallow into the other monkey's cage. Initially, the other monkeys responded in kind, pulling their own levers 50 percent of the time. But once they figured out that their partner was a pushover (like a parent who buys her kid a toy on every outing whether the kid is a saint or a devil), their rate of reciprocation dropped to 30 percent -- lower than the original average rate. The selfish jerk, meanwhile, was punished even worse. Once her reputation was established, whenever she was led into the experimenting chamber, the other tamarins ''would just go nuts,'' Chen recalls. ''They'd throw their feces at the wall, walk into the corner and sit on their hands, kind of sulk.''
Chen is a hyperverbal, sharp-dressing 29-year-old with spiky hair. The son of Chinese immigrants, he had an itinerant upbringing in the rural Midwest. As a Stanford undergraduate, he was a de facto Marxist before being seduced, quite accidentally, by economics. He may be the only economist conducting monkey experiments, which puts him at slight odds with his psychologist collaborators (who are more interested in behavior itself than in the incentives that produce the behavior) as well as with certain economist colleagues. ''I love interest rates, and I'm willing to talk about their kind of stuff all the time,'' he says, speaking of his fellow economists. ''But I can tell that they're biting their tongues when I tell them what I'm working on.''
 It is sometimes unclear, even to Chen himself, exactly what he is working on. When he and Santos, his psychologist collaborator, began to teach the Yale capuchins to use money, he had no pressing research theme. The essential idea was to give a monkey a dollar and see what it did with it. The currency Chen settled on was a silver disc, one inch in diameter, with a hole in the middle -- ''kind of like Chinese money,'' he says. It took several months of rudimentary repetition to teach the monkeys that these tokens were valuable as a means of exchange for a treat and would be similarly valuable the next day. Having gained that understanding, a capuchin would then be presented with 12 tokens on a tray and have to decide how many to surrender for, say, Jell-O cubes versus grapes. This first step allowed each capuchin to reveal its preferences and to grasp the concept of budgeting.
 Then Chen introduced price shocks and wealth shocks. If, for instance, the price of Jell-O fell (two cubes instead of one per token), would the capuchin buy more Jell-O and fewer grapes? The capuchins responded rationally to tests like this -- that is, they responded the way most readers of The Times would respond. In economist-speak, the capuchins adhered to the rules of utility maximization and price theory: when the price of something falls, people tend to buy more of it.
 Chen next introduced a pair of gambling games and set out to determine which one the monkeys preferred. In the first game, the capuchin was given one grape and, dependent on a coin flip, either retained the original grape or won a bonus grape. In the second game, the capuchin started out owning the bonus grape and, once again dependent on a coin flip, either kept the two grapes or lost one. These two games are in fact the same gamble, with identical odds, but one is framed as a potential win and the other as a potential loss.
 How did the capuchins react? They far preferred to take a gamble on the potential gain than the potential loss. This is not what an economics textbook would predict. The laws of economics state that these two gambles, because they represent such small stakes, should be treated equally.
 So, does Chen's gambling experiment simply reveal the cognitive limitations of his small-brained subjects? Perhaps not. In similar experiments, it turns out that humans tend to make the same type of irrational decision at a nearly identical rate. Documenting this phenomenon, known as loss aversion, is what helped the psychologist Daniel Kahneman win a Nobel Prize in economics. The data generated by the capuchin monkeys, Chen says, ''make them statistically indistinguishable from most stock-market investors.'' 
But do the capuchins actually understand money? Or is Chen simply exploiting their endless appetites to make them perform neat tricks?
 Several facts suggest the former. During a recent capuchin experiment that used cucumbers as treats, a research assistant happened to slice the cucumber into discs instead of cubes, as was typical. One capuchin picked up a slice, started to eat it and then ran over to a researcher to see if he could ''buy'' something sweeter with it. To the capuchin, a round slice of cucumber bore enough resemblance to Chen's silver tokens to seem like another piece of currency.
 Then there is the stealing. Santos has observed that the monkeys never deliberately save any money, but they do sometimes purloin a token or two during an experiment. All seven monkeys live in a communal main chamber of about 750 cubic feet. For experiments, one capuchin at a time is let into a smaller testing chamber next door. Once, a capuchin in the testing chamber picked up an entire tray of tokens, flung them into the main chamber and then scurried in after them -- a combination jailbreak and bank heist -- which led to a chaotic scene in which the human researchers had to rush into the main chamber and offer food bribes for the tokens, a reinforcement that in effect encouraged more stealing.
 Something else happened during that chaotic scene, something that convinced Chen of the monkeys' true grasp of money. Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of money, after all, is its fungibility, the fact that it can be used to buy not just food but anything. During the chaos in the monkey cage, Chen saw something out of the corner of his eye that he would later try to play down but in his heart of hearts he knew to be true. What he witnessed was probably the first observed exchange of money for sex in the history of monkeykind. (Further proof that the monkeys truly understood money: the monkey who was paid for sex immediately traded the token in for a grape.)
 This is a sensitive subject. The capuchin lab at Yale has been built and maintained to make the monkeys as comfortable as possible, and especially to allow them to carry on in a natural state. The introduction of money was tricky enough; it wouldn't reflect well on anyone involved if the money turned the lab into a brothel. To this end, Chen has taken steps to ensure that future monkey sex at Yale occurs as nature intended it.
 But these facts remain: When taught to use money, a group of capuchin monkeys responded quite rationally to simple incentives; responded irrationally to risky gambles; failed to save; stole when they could; used money for food and, on occasion, sex. In other words, they behaved a good bit like the creature that most of Chen's more traditional colleagues study: Homo sapiens.

HEADLINE: Chump Change

BYLINE: By William Safire. 
Send comments and suggestions to: safireonlanguage@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A source at The Times Magazine, on strict condition of anonymity, tipped me weeks ago that the theme of today's issue would be Money. One article, whispered Rob Hoerburger, copy-desk head (oops! burned another source), would be about Silicon Valley's brat pack: ''those who, for example, made upward of $10 million in the dot-com era but who consider that chump change.''
 In the grand scheme of American economic linguistics, far more significant than the profits or predations of Web-site wizards is the emergence and staying power of the phrase chump change. The alliteration that drove its predecessor phrase, chicken feed, into innocuous desuetude is a stinging attack on the arrogance of those enviable richies who supposedly use the term. 
 Begin with chump. In the 1864 edition of J.C. Hotten's Slang Dictionary, it was defined as ''the head or face. . . . A half-idiotic or daft person is said to be off his chump.'' The chump then became synonymous with ''fool'': Senator Marcus A. Hanna, who considered ''politician'' to be a high calling, in 1902 derided an opponent: ''I used to think he was a politician, but I don't now. He's a chump.''
 That sense of being a jerk, easily defeated, was accentuated by its contrast with the similar-sounding champ. But by 1930, in his Dictionary of the Underworld, Eric Partridge detected a sinister connotation in the verb form of chump, meaning ''to hoodwink'': ''Every once in a while I chump a guy for some real dough.'' That meaning was taken up in the world of prostitution, married to ''trivial amount,'' and in 1967, Robert Beck wrote in ''Pimp'' that in the 1940's ''Western whores were lazy and satisfied with making 'chump change.''' The novelist George Cain wrote in the 1970 ''Blueschild Baby,'' ''The toughs stand at the entrances . . . jingling chump change in their pockets.'' James Ellroy had his fictional villain in 1988 ''only making chump change gigging on Central Avenue.''
 Now the phrase is used 24/7 (a numeric locution that has temporarily replaced the nondigital round the clock as well as the slangily natural allatime). It is most frequently used to describe a huge number that pales in comparison with an even bigger number: ''An extra $11 billion in the highway bill may seem like chump change to most of the Senate,'' grumbles The San Antonio Express. Or, as my source uses the phrase, it's what dot-com dukes think of as a measly $10 million.

NOMICSNOMICS
 I had a hand, as a White House speechwriter back in 1969, in popularizing the word Nixonomics. It seemed like a nice encapsulation of a philosophy of a ''full-employment budget'' but soon became a handy phrase that liberals could use to castigate stagflation and conservatives to hoot at wage and price controls. 
 Now the last two syllables of economics are making a comeback. Nomics is in, with or without the initial n. We have genomics, mapping the DNA sequencing of sets of genes, and the more recent proteomics, analyzing the interaction of the proteins produced by the genes of a particular cell. Ergonomics is the science of designing modern equipment to reduce discomfort as we plonk our way painfully through the carpel tunnel of love. Leaping on the -nomics bandwagon, with the vowel o inserted, is rockonomics, the monetary machinations of the huge and lucrative music industry. (For that matter, see Freakonomics, Page 30.)
 Here's my advice to White House aides of all stripes: If your president's name ends with an n, brace yourself for an -omics branding. Thus did we have Nixonomics, Reaganomics and Clintonomics. We did not have Fordonomics or Carternomics or Bushonomics, nor would we have had Dukakisonomics or Gorenomics or Kerrynomics. It has nothing to do with politics; it's the elision quality of the last letter of the president's last name. 

BOILING BOOTS
 President Vladimir Putin of Russia angrily rebutted charges at a news conference in Yalta last fall that he was trying to extend his power into the former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine: ''This is total nonsense, absurdity, soft-boiled boots.'' The Russian adjective was vsmiatku, meaning ''lightly boiled,'' which Prof. Paul Austin and Prof. Tatiana Patera at McGill University in Canada inform me literally modifies cooked eggs and is used colloquially, especially in relation to boots, to mean ''nonsense.'' 
 Last month, faced with a similar accusation that he was putting pressure on defiant Baltic states, Putin returned to his favorite figure of speech: ''This is complete nonsense -- soft-boiled boots.'' 
 Russians classify such a figure of speech as Putinki, the equivalent of our ''Bushisms.'' Perhaps this one is rooted in frozen-Siberian lore; perhaps not. In the back part of my frontal cortex, where I store unforgettable movie scenes from 1925, there is Charlie Chaplin's Thanksgiving dinner in ''The Gold Rush.'' The Tramp, starving and freezing, stews one of his leather boots and eats it fastidiously, as at a feast: first filleting it, then twirling the laces on his fork and daintily sucking the nails of the boot as if they were succulent quail bones. Inspired ''nonsense.''
 Could it be that Russians, who enjoyed Chaplin in his silent days, absorbed that scene into their culture? We will see if citations turn up from before 1925, because Russian lexicographic irregulars keep a close eye on this space. 
 In an article on the need to steal words from other languages to fill our vocabu-gap, I noted references to razbliuto, ''a feeling a person has for someone he or she once loved but no longer feels the same way about.'' It came to me from some Russian speakers but generated a dozen letters from others who insist that the word does not exist. These nyet-sayers are joined by the two experts I consulted, Austin and Patera at McGill. Others write that the word my original sources must have had in mind is the verb razliubit, which means simply ''to stop loving.'' 
 My next column may be about the word retraction.

HEADLINE: The Hot College

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

DATELINE: EWING TOWNSHIP 

 BODY:
THE brick Georgian-style buildings are surrounded by a sea of neatly manicured lawns. Inside, the small classes are filled with some of the best students New Jersey's high schools have to offer. The college has won a top ranking for northern schools from U.S. News & World Report, and Barron's has rated it ''most competitive.''
 All of this comes at a bargain price for the approximately 6,000 undergraduate students who have made the cut. The College of New Jersey -- having shaken off its old name, Trenton State, and its mantle as a mediocre teacher's college -- has arrived.
 ''It's quite the hot school,'' said Sigus Vanni, a guidance counselor at Cherry Hill West High School and a former assistant dean at Swarthmore College. 
 Indeed, the seventh-ranked student at Cherry Hill West plans to attend the College of New Jersey in the fall, Mr. Vanni said. But that is not all. Of the 40 students who make up the top 10 percent of the class, about 5 are planning to go there. 
 It is a school that Mr. Vanni encourages students to consider. ''I will sell it because I do believe in their mission,'' he said. ''It's talked about in the same breath as schools like Villanova.''
 Paul Shelly, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of State Colleges and Universities, agrees that the College of New Jersey is reaching its goal of enticing New Jersey's students to stay in the state by offering them a smaller and seemingly more exclusive college for the in-state price of about $8,200 -- or about $17,000 a year with housing and meals included. For out-of-state students, the price is about $4,000 more.
 ''They achieved their mission,'' Mr. Shelly said. ''They are viewed as a destination. They are a great value.''
 Just how good is the College of New Jersey considered? Well, it is one of only seven public colleges among Barron's list of 70 schools described as ''most competitive'' -- keeping company with such institutions as Brown, Columbia, William & Mary, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Vassar, the University of Chicago and University of Virginia. Princeton, for instance, is the only other school in New Jersey in this category. 
 And in the 2005 college edition of U.S. News & World Report, of the 83 schools in the northern region that offer undergraduate and master's degrees but few if any doctoral degrees, the College of New Jersey is rated fifth behind Villanova, Providence College, Fairfield University in Connecticut and Loyola College in Maryland. By comparison, Rowan University and Rutgers-Camden are tied for 34th place, and Rider University is tied for 36th with Regis College in Massachusetts. 
 Indeed, the school's own statistics show that it has been attracting a better caliber of student over the last several years. In 1999, for instance, the school received applications from 5,755 students, out of which 1,209 students enrolled, and including those who applied through special programs for the disadvantaged, the average College Board score was 1,205, and the average student was in the top 15 percent of his or her class. For the 2004 freshman class, of the 6,485 students who applied, 1,231 enrolled; their average College Board score was 1,308 and the average class rank was the top 10 percent.
 ''I was looking for a smaller school,'' said James Van Strander, a 19-year-old sophomore who graduated from Morris Hills High School in the top 10 percent of his class and scored 1,500 on his College Boards. ''I was hearing a lot of good things about the academics here.''
 Mr. Van Strander, from Rockaway, was accepted at the University of Maryland, but a scholarship to The College of New Jersey was a deciding factor.
 Alida Liberman, a 19-year-old freshman from Lincoln Park, was accepted at Franklin & Marshall College and the College of William & Mary, but ultimately chose the College of New Jersey.
 ''The more I found out the more I realized it was a good school,'' Ms. Liberman said. ''The classes were small. You really get a lot of personal attention.'' 
 In fact, many of her classes this year have been smaller than those in her high school -- with 17 students in a literature course, 11 in philosophy and 15 in Spanish. Administrators say that 90 percent of all classes have no more than 30 students.

'Campus From a Movie'
 As odd as it might sound, some students said the sheer appearance of school seemed to attract them and their parents. ''T.C.N.J. is a campus where I felt comfortable,'' Ms. Liberman said. ''It looks like a college campus from a movie.''
 For students accepted by private colleges in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, the relatively modest cost of an education at the College of New Jersey is sometimes the deal-maker. ''We are so similar to those institutions,'' said Lisa Angeloni, the dean of admissions. ''Parents are really looking at the cost.'' 
 Whatever the reason, the effort to lure attractive students is working. Ms. Angeloni said that 7,290 students applied this year for admission in the fall, an increase of 13 percent over last year. 
 ''I believe there is an economic issue to it,'' said Dr. R. Barbara Gitenstein, president of the College of New Jersey since 1999 after arriving from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, where she was provost. ''They are looking at the smart alternative. It's being a smart consumer. Price does matter, but they are looking for value.''
 The transition from Trenton State to the College of New Jersey did not happen overnight. While the name was changed in 1996, the die was cast 20 years earlier. ''It's been an incredible transformation in the past 25 years,'' said Dr. Gitenstein, who gives much of the credit to her predecessor, Dr. Harold Eickhoff, who was president from 1980 to 1998.
 When the college opened 150 years ago, it was called the Trenton Normal School. And from 1929 to 1937 it was called New Jersey State Teachers College and State Normal School at Trenton. The phrase ''teachers college'' was not removed from the title until 1958, when the school became simply Trenton State College. And while about 30 percent of the students receive teaching certificates upon graduation these days, that is often in conjunction with another major; the largest concentration of majors at the college are now English, biology, business administration, psychology, communication studies and criminology and justice studies.
 But Dr. Eickhoff's big changes began taking shape well before the decision to rename the school. In the 1970's -- when many colleges and universities began opening their doors to students with lower grades and test scores -- Dr. Eickhoff and his administration chose to become more competitive. The college reduced the number acceptances, and although it does not have a cutoff for College Board scores and class rank, in the last 15 years it has been recruiting the top students around the state by inviting them to apply and offering scholarships. 
 At the same time, it was also considered necessary for the college to transform itself into a primarily residential campus made up of full-time students rather than a hodgepodge of full-and part-time students, with some living on campus and others elsewhere.
 And while the trustees have determined that up to 10 percent of its student body can be made up of out-of-state applicants -- usually from Pennsylvania and New York -- according to Dr. Stephen Briggs, the provost, the college has limited that to 5 percent because of the number of qualified applicants from New Jersey. 
 To be sure, part of the reason the College of New Jersey has tried to raise its game is to retain high school graduates who would otherwise have chosen to continue their education in a neighboring state or beyond. This year, while more than 90,000 pupils will graduate from the state's public and private high schools, about 19,000 of them will choose to attend college outside New Jersey.
 And that is not only because the out-of-state schools are more alluring. There are simply not enough places in New Jersey's colleges and universities. The state ranks 45th in the nation for the number of available slots in colleges when compared with the overall population. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education Almanac for 2003-4, the state -- with more than 8.5 million residents -- has 142,336 students enrolled in four-year public colleges.
 Mr. Shelly, of the New Jersey Association of State Colleges and Universities -- which includes schools like the College of New Jersey, Montclair State, Rowan, Ramapo, Paterson and Stockton -- said the association's nine members receive about 44,000 applications each year from high school seniors in the state and have only 10,000 seats to fill each fall. 
 As a result, the College of New Jersey -- like many of the other state colleges -- is turning away many qualified students.
 ''I think we are kind of hot at the moment, and that's good news, bad news,'' Dr. Briggs said. ''We can't get bigger and do what we are doing.''
 To Dr. Briggs, the college's greatest changes these day center around campus housing and the ability to recruit a talented faculty. He estimates that 40 to 50 percent of the 350 faculty members had been hired in the last 12 to 15 years. 
 Among the professors who have joined the faculty in the last three years, he said, include Dr. John Allison, a chemistry professor from Michigan State University who did his post-doctoral work at Stanford University; Jayne Zanglein, a business professor from the Texas Tech University School of Law who was provost of the National Labor College in Silver Springs, Md., and is an expert on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; and Derek Peterson, a history professor on leave from Cambridge University who teaches colonial and pre-colonial African history.
 As for campus housing, Dr. Briggs said the college had increased the number of beds to 3,577 from 2,170 in the early 1980's. Moreover, he said that in the fall 95 percent of all freshman and 85 percent of all sophomores would live on campus. 
 Still, campus housing is not always the answer, said Bill Indek, the guidance program director at Glen Ridge High School -- who says he has high regard for Rutgers as well as the College of New Jersey. ''If you could move T.C.N.J. to Pennsylvania,'' Mr. Indek said, ''you'd get even more students.''
 But these days, the College of New Jersey seems to be winning more often. Nicole Kukawski, a 21-year-old junior from Palmyra chose the college over Villanova, Loyola and the University of Delaware after graduating from Bishop Eustace Preparatory School in Pennsauken.

'You Need to Apply'
 Ms. Kukawski had not applied to the College of New Jersey until two days before the application was due, and admitted that her parents had persuaded her. 
 ''My parents said it's such a great school, you need to apply,'' she said.
 Ultimately, she said, she based her decision on academics as well as cost. ''It was the best deal for the academics and the price,'' she said. ''Now, I can't imagine myself anywhere else.''
 While trying to make up her mind, she said she sat in on a literature class with Dr. David Blake and was impressed with his teaching as well as with the students. 
 These days, Ms. Kukawski finds herself in the spotlight because of her discovery of an interview done in February 1888 with Walt Whitman at his home in Camden. In it, Whitman gave advice on schools and learning, saying there was no royal road to learning and that students should go out and write and have experiences. 
 In this month's issue of the Walt Whitman Quarterly Review, there is an article by her about the interview, and in the fall she plans to discuss it at a symposium on campus.
 So while the prestigious Ivy League schools have a little more tradition, she said, ''that's no reason to discount this school.''
 ''I'm constantly amazed at the people I go to school with and how the majority of them are Ivy League people,'' she said. ''I don't feel like I go to a state school. Some people still don't know that this is not called Trenton State anymore. This school deserves to be on the map.''

HEADLINE: At Vatican's Doorstep, a Contest for Immigrant Souls

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
Carlos Mejias is a Roman Catholic missionary in an unlikely setting in this city of churches, a few miles from the Vatican's solemn majesty. He and other lay missionaries walk through bustling piazzas, noisy nightclubs and cramped apartments on the city's outskirts looking for Latin American immigrants who are sometimes as far from their faith as they are from their homelands.
 On a Saturday afternoon, Mr. Mejias walked with two other missionaries down a sloping street that led to a run-down apartment complex ringed by luxury homes near the Piazza Azzarita. Walking past men who sipped beer and children who darted about the dingy terraces, they knocked on doors in hopes of persuading others to join them at a religious center they were about to open nearby.
 Nelly Cando welcomed them into her brother's barely furnished apartment as she and a cousin sliced fruit for a modest party on their day off from working as domestics. They held hands in a small circle and prayed, for work, life and relatives in Ecuador. 
 ''We need to be closer, to know each other and be neighbors,'' she said. ''We all live here but don't know each other. We need unity.''
 If the Vatican is ever to re-evangelize Europe, it could start with the waves of immigrants living at its doorstep, many of whom are already baptized and who have a cultural kinship with the church. Rome's 50,000 Latin American immigrants are often poor and isolated, far from their homelands and from their memories of Catholicism as the center of spiritual and local life.
 In these very ways, the Latin Americans in Rome are more and more like the half billion or so Catholics back in the Western Hemisphere. Both in Europe and Latin America, the church is trying to come up with a way to appeal to these nominal Catholics, and to keep them from the evangelical churches that are competing intensely to convert them. 
 Many in Latin America are waiting to see whether Pope Benedict XVI, who had a stern image as the church's chief enforcer of doctrine, will assume the mantle of pastor that his predecessor donned.
 ''What people are looking for in Latin America is for the church to have a human face,'' said the Rev. Mark Francis, superior general of the Viatorian religious order. ''It's that Latino idea of being in communion with someone you can identify with. It should not be a big surprise that people are looking for personal outreach, beginning with the pope, but especially with local priests.'' 
 Many Catholics in Latin America cite poverty as the foremost problem facing the church. In countries where free market policies and globalization have yet to lift the poorest out of despair, people are looking for a defender.
 Dean Brackley, a professor of theology and ethics at the Jesuit University in San Salvador, said he hoped Pope Benedict would continue his predecessor's strong defense of the poor in Latin America. Though John Paul reined in liberation theology across much of Latin America and Benedict -- as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- denounced it as essentially Marxist, John Paul did agree with many of the social and economic justice beliefs from that movement. 
 ''The great struggle in the church is whether the victims of poverty -- which is the majority of the human race -- are at the center of our picture of the world and our ministry,'' Father Brackley said. ''That is our great concern in Latin America. Are they central or are we only talking about saving souls in general?''
 The region's lingering poverty sets many off on journeys that take them from country villages to urban centers and beyond. That unchecked growth of urban ghettos in Latin capitals leads to concentrations of desperately poor people who have hardly any connection to one another. 
 That social dislocation, in turn, has helped Evangelical groups to grow rapidly, as they eagerly welcome newcomers who have lived in silent alienation.
 A similar phenomenon is happening in Rome, with Evangelicals seeking out Latin American immigrants who feel cut off from their faith. In some cases, people feel unwelcome in Catholic churches because they are divorced or have had children out of wedlock. In other cases, they are longing for more than a Mass celebrated hastily by a priest from Spain who returns to the sacristy immediately after the final benediction.
 The Rev. Luis Ernesto Ayala Benitez, a Salvadoran priest who is studying at the Gregorian University, said the church needed to learn how to build true community beyond the hours of Mass, whether here or back home.
 ''One reason why people go to the Protestant churches is they feel a warmer welcome there,'' he said. ''It's not that people are looking for God, but looking for each other. They leave service feeling better, not necessarily because of the doctrine.''
 The lingering question is whether Pope Benedict, an intellectual who tends to doctrinal orthodoxy, will encourage expressions of faith and culture that would appeal to Latin Americans.
 ''I believe sometimes our discourse in church is too intellectual and rational,'' said the Rev. Orlando Torres, a Jesuit from Puerto Rico who is in charge of religious education and spiritual development for the order. ''We need to recover a vision of God that has not just reason, but feeling.''
 Catholics are trying hard to serve the immigrants here, and provide a warm and helpful atmosphere. But the demands of surviving in Rome makes every outreach difficult. 
 The biggest movement to build a community of worshipers is led by the Rev. Antonio Guidolin, a member of the Scalabrinian missionary order who founded a Rome mission in 2002. The group runs 18 centers for Latin American immigrants, helping them with work, clothing, food and spiritual outreach.
 Some 100 lay volunteers go out each week seeking immigrants who have fallen away from their faith. A smaller group of priests -- many from the same nations as the immigrants -- celebrates Mass for their countrymen.
 ''It is important for them to see a Salvadoran priest,'' said Father Ayala Benitez. ''I knew the reality of why they migrate here. It is easier to be in solidarity with them.''
 Yet the demands of work and the stress of being in a foreign culture take a toll on many immigrants, and often keep them from church. At a recent meeting of the priests involved in the Rome mission, there were laments that immigrants were sometimes more interested in having the church get them a job than in saving their souls. And often, many of them lived far from the Rome parish where the missionary group offered a variety of social services.
 Father Antonio, normally an impish ball of energy, grew quiet when he considered all the difficulties in building a community even here, so close to the seat of Catholicism. 
 ''To be a missionary today, we have to travel within the church and the world,'' he said during a meeting of priests. ''If we are not missionaries, what kind of Christians are we? What message are we taking to the world?''
 During a recent visit to immigrants who lived on the outskirts of the city, Jorge Guerra, a seminarian from Mexico, wondered how many of the people he encountered were nominally Catholic. In his experience, he said, many Latin Americans drew close to the faith around Holy Week or on patron saint feast days.
 ''We need an internal dialogue to revive these people,'' he said. ''Latin America has faith, but it has to grow, to mature. We have to go forward and live the faith and turn it into a social commitment.''
 Yet sometimes, the feast day is the best way, and perhaps the only way, to bring people together. 
 The next Sunday, Mr. Guerra went to Santa Lucia Church to join some 100 immigrants from Colombia on the feast of that country's patron, Nuestra Senora del Rosario de Chiquinquira. The Rev. Hector Aya, a Scalabrinian priest, wore a stole emblazoned with flags of the Spanish-speaking world.
 He echoed Pope Benedict's message at his installation Mass. ''Remember,'' he said. ''We are not alone in Italy.'' 
 A short procession left the church after Mass, as the worshipers returned to a concrete playground where they ate empanadas and danced, all under the serene gaze of their patroness. Father Aya took off his vestments, revealing a soccer shirt in the Colombian national colors. Slowly, people slipped off into the stream of scooters, cars and pedestrians scurrying past.

HEADLINE: Believing [and Believing and Believing] in Bullion

BYLINE: By Stephen Metcalf. 
Stephen Metcalf is the book critic for Slate and a regular contributor to The Times Book Review.

 BODY:
On a recent early spring morning, I made my way down to the appropriately poker-faced and austere building that houses the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In its sub-basement, 80 feet below street level, there is a vault that rests on the granite bedrock of Manhattan. ''No man-made floor could hold the weight of all this,'' Peter Bakstansky, a Fed spokesman, assured me. The vault holds 7,000 tons of gold. This represents the world's largest stash of the precious metal, and it is worth about $100 billion. To view it, you descend to an underground bunker and pass through a narrow passageway cut into a 90-ton steel cylinder. Like most people, I'd seen gold before, though only in small quantities -- a filling here, a vanity wristwatch there. In front of me now, stacked in bricks atop wooden pallets, lay some pretty serious bling. 
 Gold is a majestic condenser of wealth. A standard bar is seven inches long, three and five-eighths inches wide, and about one and three-quarters inches thick. It weighs 27.4 pounds, and at the current market price -- roughly $420 a troy ounce, the unit in which gold is measured -- is worth about $170,000. As miraculous as gold is in itself -- it is soft, dense, ductile, sectile, highly conductive, all but indestructible and, of course, very beautiful -- when you look at any quantity of it, you immediately exchange it in your head for something else. One bar, college education; 10 bars, Brooklyn town house. The cage in front of me appeared fairly small. Filled to the ceiling with gold bars as it was, it might well hold the financial health of a nation in the balance.
 Most of the bullion at the New York Fed is kept -- in 122 separate lockers -- in custody for foreign countries. (Most American gold is in Fort Knox.) There is something ancient and strange about the vault, in which workers wear magnesium shoe covers to protect their toes from falling ingots. Egyptians were casting bars of gold thousands of years ago; but the thrust of human history has been away from hard money and toward virtual money, like paper bills, or even little electronic pulses shot off by the trillion across the ether. When I remarked that all this brute physical wealth represented an anachronism, Bakstansky seized upon the word brightly. 
 ''Yes, exactly. Gold is an anachronism.''
 ''And yet,'' I said, ''all these nations, they hold on to this anachronism, just in case. . . . ''
 At this, a light chill entered his voice. ''I don't think anyone in a policy-making position,'' he explained to me politely, ''seriously believes that everything else of value could disappear, leaving only gold.''
To a small but extremely avid subculture in the American financial community, gold doesn't mean bling, or King Midas, or them thar hills. Gold is money; and not just money, but the one true money. The gold subculture divides along several lines -- some of its members are gold speculators, some gold hoarders, some gold philosophers and some outright nut jobs -- but it unites behind a single idea: Paper money issued by governments, when not redeemable for actual gold, is fraudulent. Most of us accept the existence of dollar bills unconsciously. To the gold faithful, however, a dollar bill is ''ink money,'' or better yet, ''fiat currency,'' a nearly constant term of abuse at gold conferences and in gold chat rooms. ''Fiat currency -- it's a floating abstraction,'' Doug Casey, a star speaker on the gold circuit, bellowed at me over the phone. ''What's its worth? I don't know what it's worth! It's a figment of some government bureaucrat's imagination!''
 The ''gold bugs,'' as they often are referred to with more than a hint of disdain, find gold appealing because they believe it represents the one enduring form of nonstate money. ''Money is far too important to be left in the hands of bankers, Congress or the Federal Reserve System,'' Gary North, a legendary gold bug who has edited financial newsletters for decades, told me via e-mail. North's Web commentaries include everything from advice regarding prostate problems (saw palmetto has helped his immensely) to a recently completed 700-page ''economic commentary'' on the Gospel of Luke, which he encourages readers to download onto their hard drives, in case he were to ''drop dead and the site is taken down for any reason.'' But the focus of his writings is politics, and North's politics aren't hard to pin down. His is the fierce libertarianism of the ardent gold bug.
 I had sought out Casey and North, two leading voices among gold enthusiasts, because after 20 years during which paper assets -- stocks, bonds, and the world's leading ''fiat currency,'' the dollar -- soared, gold was making a comeback. If you bought $10,000 worth of gold in 1980, by 2001 you would have lost $6,800. But then the long bull market in stocks ended, and the dollar, responding to the growing debt burden of the average American, not to mention the federal debt and our trade deficit, began a steep decline. And so, starting in 2001, gold, which like many commodities moves in the opposite direction of the dollar, began to recover some of its lost glamour as a store of value. The price of gold broke through the $300 barrier in February 2002, then the $400 barrier at the end of 2003. Could this be the dawn of the apocalypse that the gold bugs, whose prevailing attitude might best be described as a wishful pessimism, have been predicting? Could the dollar collapse, leaving only gold?
 ''I will accept questions by e-mail,'' North wrote me, adding, ''I will answer the following type question: 'In your article on [ ], you write that [ ]. But what about this? How could this work?''' I apparently phrased my first questions according to protocol, because North e-mailed me back, relaying his nine-point plan for returning gold to its proper status as the only money. Among his ideas: ''Government collects tax payments in gold. . . . Abolish legal tender law. . . . Let anyone set up a bank/warehouse company who wants to.'' Gold bugs are notoriously squirrelly, and North had warned me ahead of time: no questions regarding the future price of gold, and all questions must hew closely to his published work. When I e-mailed him again, asking whether the rising price of gold might be signaling doom, I must have crossed some invisible line. His one-sentence reply read simply, ''Here endeth the lesson.''
 For the past 70 years, the United States has been conducting an experiment regarding the dollar. The experiment asks: Can the United States manage its currency responsibly, without having that currency backed by gold? The U.S. effectively went off the gold standard twice in the 20th century, and both times responsible men in positions of power foresaw cataclysm. ''This is the end of Western civilization!'' Lewis Douglas, Franklin Roosevelt's budget director, declared in 1933, when Roosevelt terminated the right of American citizens to demand gold in exchange for their dollars. ''Pravda would write that this was a sign of the collapse of capitalism,'' Arthur Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned Richard Nixon in 1971, when Nixon terminated the right of our international trading partners to demand gold in exchange for their dollars. 
 In spirit, the gold bugs are the heirs to Douglas and Burns. Every day is the end of Western civilization -- or should be, now that our currencies float free of gold. In fact, the recent weakness of the dollar has become an idee fixe within the gold community, as it opens up one possible route back to an economic system ballasted by gold. Representative Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas who is gold's lonely advocate in Congress, put it to me this way: ''We will go back to the gold standard, even if it takes the near-destruction of the dollar to get there.'' 
James Sinclair is a 64-year-old American businessman in a tan blazer and navy blue slacks. From his manner and dress, he could be host to an Amway seminar. But when he speaks, he sounds more like a karma yogi. It's as if you're watching a movie dubbed with the wrong soundtrack. ''Silence is deep rest,'' Sinclair told me as we waited for sandwiches at a deli. ''It's the only way to restructure ourselves.'' Among the most famous gold speculators, Sinclair proclaimed in the 70's that gold, then at $150 a troy ounce, would hit $900. (It eventually peaked at $887.50; he sold his position the following day, for a profit of more than $15 million.) Then, with some analysts predicting that gold could go as high as $2,000, he declared the gold bull market dead. (Within months, he was proved right.) In 2001, with gold near its bear-market lows, Sinclair told Forbes magazine that it could hit $430. On the day I met him, gold was trading at $434.
 Sinclair remains a star attraction at gold conferences around the world, but in the 1980's he sold his brokerage firm and took his wife and two of his daughters to the foothills of the Berkshires, where he lives on a 40-acre equestrian compound featuring its own 9,000-gallon water system, its own electrical system and a shooting range. (''I like to cut a target every now and again,'' he told me. ''Get out my aggressions.'') Sinclair's private office sports the typical C.E.O. blandishments -- a massive mahogany desk, a wall-mounted flat-panel computer monitor -- but also a profusion of religious items. Incense always burns, and a temple gong sits in the corner, along with a prominently displayed statue of Ganesh. Behind the desk there is a full-color portrait of Bhagavan Sri Sathya Baba, whom Sinclair visits frequently in India. ''I am an enquiring soul,'' he replied, when I asked if he was Hindu. ''All the great minds have wandered the Indus Valley.''
 Perhaps because he has found spiritual satisfaction elsewhere, Sinclair regards gold with dispassion. ''Gold is not to be loved or hated, accepted or refused,'' he said. ''Gold is not barbaric or angelic. It fixes nothing in itself. But it is a mirror.'' Sinclair sees the health of the dollar reflected in the price of gold, and the health of the dollar is now in foreign hands. ''We're not talking about what I want, but about what is,'' he told me, as he picked through a tuna salad. ''If we go over $529, that is not good news,'' he said, referring to the price of gold. ''Anyone cheering for a high price of gold should get on Prozac.'' Sinclair says that when the dollar acts successfully as the world's currency, gold naturally returns to its status as a mere commodity. In the parlance, it demonetizes -- it loses out to the dollar as the world's reserve currency. But a mismanaged dollar, he said, could cause gold to remonetize. Our world would look very different then. ''The first sign is the foreign banks will diversify out of dollars. Then they will cease buying dollars. And then they will sell them.'' What could happen then? ''Stagflation. . . . Expansion of U.S. federal deficit. Expenses rise and incomes drop.'' 
 Are we talking apocalypse? ''The most likely crisis is the collapse in the common stock of the operating entity. In this case, the operating entity is the United States, and the common stock is its currency.'' We had made our way up a hill, to Sinclair's koi pond and its accompanying meditation gazebo. As if on cue, what appeared to be a military airplane flew across the sky. ''That's carrying Iraqi supplies,'' Sinclair told me. ''We have war and monetary easing at the same time,'' he said, shaking his head. ''Everything has its season. That includes gold. Do I have a bet on gold? You know I do. Will I one day unravel that bet? You know I will.''
The Daily Reckoning is a freewheeling Web site for libertarians, gold bugs and doom enthusiasts of every stripe. Its editorial director is Addison Wiggin, and before we met, I pictured an ''Addison Wiggin'' as an ancient gold-hoarding Yankee, and the offices of The Daily Reckoning as a cinder-block bunker patrolled by Minutemen. I was wrong on both counts. Wiggin is a sober, black-clad 37-year-old who is active in libertarian circles. The Daily Reckoning, meanwhile, is nestled in the lovely Mt. Vernon section of Baltimore, and its interior could pass for any 1990's dot-com, with a glass-enclosed conference room, exposed brick walls and a couple of nerdy 20-somethings in sneakers and T-shirts.
 The narrative Wiggin spun out for me over lunch is repeated, nearly verbatim, by almost everyone in the gold community. ''This is the blow-off phase for the Great Dollar Era. We're in an unsustainable trend right now,'' Wiggin told me, ticking off the miscalculations that have brought us to the brink of an economic apocalypse. To begin with, the U.S. has become the world's biggest debtor, with three outstanding obligations at alarming highs: consumer debt, or our mortgages and credit cards; the federal deficit; and our current account deficit with foreign countries. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Wiggin continued, has simply shifted one bubble -- the 90's bubble in stocks and bonds -- into another, in real estate and ''overconsumption,'' or the American propensity to pay for an ever-more-lavish lifestyle on credit.
 But the real nightmare involves the U.S. dollar. If Asian central banks weary of buying Treasury bonds -- an asset denominated in the weakening dollar -- then look out below. ''What is that Dylan Thomas quote?'' Wiggin wondered over his fusilli. ''The dollar will not go gently into that great night.''
 Wiggin offered up his analysis with a confident and steady aplomb. And for good reason. While no one in the mainstream financial elite seriously advocates a return to the gold standard -- the modern global economy is too fluid and dynamic for such austere discipline -- at this moment, the gold bugs' grim prognosis for the dollar happens to align with a more mainstream view. A low-level panic about the debt crisis, and its possible effect on the American economy, is gathering strength. ''Our little post-bubble workout is not over, not by any stretch of the imagination,'' Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley and himself a noted pessimist, told me recently by phone. Roach says he firmly believes that an adjustment is necessary and inevitable, and that when it comes, it will be very, very painful. From appearances, Warren Buffett, the savviest investor who ever lived, agrees. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has placed a $21 billion bet against the U.S. dollar. 
 Meanwhile, the general tone is darkening. In February, Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, publicly stated in a speech that ''there are disturbing trends'' undergirding the U.S. economy, including ''huge imbalances, disequilibria, risks.'' These demand ''a strong sense of monetary and fiscal discipline,'' he said, gently chiding both the U.S. government and its citizens to live within their means. Volcker, a man known for his prudence and a cautious tone, let his words ring ominously. ''Altogether, the circumstances seem to me as dangerous and intractable as any I can remember,'' Volcker continued, referring to the very same warning signs as Addison Wiggin, ''and I can remember quite a lot.'' 
 Recently, Comptroller General David Walker, surveying America's debt crisis, uttered a one-word synopsis for the long-term future: ''Argentina.''
Money is entirely conventional. It's a system of equivalence, a medium of exchange. In a society of any sophistication whatsoever, money is used reflexively. You hand me 50 cowrie shells, I give you a head of cattle. I give you a 20, you give me a tuna on rye and some change. As the greatest theorist of money, the German sociologist Georg Simmel, recognized, money is only money when it is in motion: ''When money stands still, it is no longer money according to its specific value and significance.'' Furthermore, the set of conventions that lend money its credibility as a medium of exchange must be universal and stable, so that the shells for which I relinquished my good cow today will be worth as much tomorrow, when I exchange them for something else. Money is built on motion and trust. 
 Gold, like everything else, is a commodity whose price is established by supply and demand. But gold is unlike everything else in that an ancient fantasy of solidity attaches to it. We produce things, but to exchange them efficiently, we throw over them what economists refer to as ''the veil of money.'' Interest rate swaps, swap curves, swaptions -- the veil only thickens with time. If the gold bugs are apocalyptic, it's worth recalling the etymology of the word ''apocalypse'': to uncover or reveal. Gold holds out the promise, however chimerical, that one day we might pierce the veil of money.
 On the final leg of my tour of gold bugs, I visited the Blanchard Company in New Orleans. Blanchard is the largest retailer of gold to the American public, and it is owned and run by Donald Doyle, a soft-spoken man who might well be the living embodiment of the metal he sells: there is something soft but indestructible about his courtly Southern manner. After talking gold for the better part of an hour, we descended to the company vault. There he picked up two coins and placed one into each of my hands. They were ''Saint-Gaudens,'' named after the great American sculptor who designed them for Teddy Roosevelt. They had a face value of $20 and a value based on the amount of gold they contain -- probably a few hundred dollars. But the ornate coins were impossible to stack, and had been discontinued after a short run. On the open market now, thanks to their rarity, the coins together might fetch $800,000. They were heavy, and transfixingly beautiful, and even as I did the math in my head -- five coins, Brooklyn town house -- I heard Doyle say over my shoulder, ''And they sure feel good in your hands, don't they?''

HEADLINE: Coast Guard Assesses Risks of Gas Plant

BYLINE: By LAURIE NADEL; Avi Salzman contributed to this article.

 BODY:
SINCE Broadwater Energy announced plans to build a platform and pipeline for liquefied natural gas in the middle of Long Island Sound last November, opinions on the proposal have flourished.
 The company has pointed to the possibility of lower natural gas prices. Opponents have pointed to the potential for fires or environmental problems from accidents or terrorism. And politicians have begun weighing in on whether the platform and pipeline should be built.
 But the task of collecting data and assessing potential risks falls to the Coast Guard, which must present its findings to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The commission could rule on Broadwater's request for a permit next year. 
 Among its regular duties, the Coast Guard patrols the Sound, but its mission has become more complicated with the fact-finding mission and risk assessment of a heavily used waterway. 
 Rick Ball II, a chief boatswain's mate in the Coast Guard, pointed to a nautical map of the western Sound and said, ''We're the backdoor to Manhattan.'' 
 As the executive petty officer at the Coast Guard station at Eatons Neck, on Long Island, Chief Ball supervises the daily Homeland Security patrols of the western Sound. He assigns four Coast Guardsmen, who carry 9-millimeter pistols, to a 25-foot cutter commissioned by the Coast Guard for just such purposes. 
 ''We have what we like to call a regular random scheduled activity,'' Chief Ball said. ''We go into the nooks and crannies of our area of responsibility, and we stop certain boats and ask, 'Where have you been?''' 
 Now the question is whether the Coast Guard might be checking natural gas tankers, too.
 In November, Shell U.S. Gas and Power and the TransCanada Corporation formed Broadwater, which has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a permit to build the storage platform and pipeline, which it would open in 2010. Broadwater plans to complete the formal filing later this year.
 Public debate began immediately after the announcement. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, vowed to fight the project.
 ''The Broadwater project is a monstrosity in the making,'' he said. ''It would create huge environmental and security dangers without any real benefits.''
 He expected that Connecticut and New York officials would find common ground in opposing the proposal, unlike some previous disputes over the use of the Sound.
 ''I believe we'll forge a very powerful alliance against it,'' he said.
 The Suffolk County Legislature has voted to oppose the Broadwater plan, Senator Charles E. Schumer announced his opposition and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed reservations after speaking with commission officials.
 ''We recognize that having a project of this nature will engender a lot of strong feelings,'' said John Hritcko Jr., the senior vice president at Broadwater. 
 The Coast Guard will study both the safety and security implications of the Broadwater plant. There, tankers would unload liquefied gas, or L.N.G., which is mostly methane that has been frozen at minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit. It would then be warmed to a gaseous state and pumped underwater to New York City, Connecticut and Long Island for retail sale and to fuel power plants.
 The Coast Guard undertook a two-day Ports and Waterways Safety Assessment last month in Port Jefferson, and as part of the process, it invited 30 people -- commercial fishermen, recreational boaters, ferry captains and representatives from environmental groups and from Broadwater -- to give their opinions. Although the assessment dealt with both security and safety, security issues are scheduled to be addressed separately in closed meetings conducted by the Coast Guard this summer and fall.
 ''Although there are relationships between safety and security, there are differences,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Alan Blume, the chief of the prevention department in the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office for Long Island Sound. 
 Capt. David Scott testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last February. ''The Coast Guard has long recognized the unique safety and security challenges posed by transporting millions of gallons of L.N.G. or 'cryogenic methane,''' he said.
 If there were an accident involving the Broadwater platform or a ship carrying liquefied natural gas, a vapor cloud of the methane could travel two to four miles, said Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale, N.Y. The vapor cloud could also ignite, and the cold gas could crack any metal structure and asphyxiate those on board the tanker, she said. 
 Ms. Esposito cited a December 2004 report on liquid natural gas accidents, a document produced for the Department of Energy by a Sandia Corporation laboratory in Albuquerque. 
 ''The report concludes that an intentional breach of the L.N.G. containers could occur,'' she said. ''There could be an initial ignition. They don't like to call it an explosion. If that occurs, this fire would burn so hotly there's no way to extinguish it.'' 
 Leah Schmalz, the director of legislative and legal affairs for Save the Sound in Norwalk, said the group has held forums in communities along the Connecticut and New York coastlines to educate local residents.
 ''It's surprising how many people haven't really heard about this project yet,'' Ms. Schmalz said. ''Although it's in New York waters, it will have a severe impact on Connecticut,'' Ms. Schmalz said.
 Among other critiques, Save the Sound has argued that no one company should have so much control over the Sound.
 ''This water belongs to you, to your neighbor, and it doesn't belong to one energy company,'' she said. ''We would be giving this portion of the Sound to one energy company to the exclusion of other citizens.''
 Broadwater's proposed location, 11 miles from New Haven and nine miles from Wading River on Long Island, is also under scrutiny. Nautical charts distributed at the safety assessment meeting showed that the site could obstruct commercial traffic. 
 But Mr. Hritcko said that the Broadwater plant ''would fit in quite nicely'' in the Sound and would not be in a major shipping lane.
 ''Long Island Sound is not an isolated backwater,'' he said. ''Broadwater is consistent with the use of the Sound, with ships entering the Sound.''
 In 2004, Commander Blume said, some 570 ships under foreign flags arrived in the Sound, and more than half were tankers carrying petroleum products. The Broadwater proposal would add 100 to 150 arrivals, each subject to provisions of the Maritime Transportation Safety Act, including 96 hours' notice of arrival. 
 Each ship's host government must also provide lists of crew members and their passports, the ship's previous ports of call and cargo information. The Coast Guard routinely boards ships carrying liquefied natural gas, checking for security violations, and monitors their transit. 
 ''The Maritime Transportation Safety Act, that's a pretty big deal,'' Chief Ball said. ''Any boats that come into here, we're going to know about ahead of time if they're playing legit. If they're not playing legit, I'm sure we're still going to know about it.'' 
 But Brian Lee, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission spokesman in Washington, said that there was no denying the potential for terrorism involving a project like Broadwater.
 ''There is no energy infrastructure in the country that is not a potential terrorist target, whether it's a transmission line or a natural gas pipeline,'' he said. ''As a society, we assume a certain level of risk for the benefit the activity provides. It doesn't take rocket science to analyze this. We need to look at the severe economic threat that high demand and insufficient supply for natural gas provide.''
 Mr. Hritcko said the plant's economic and environmental benefits would outweigh the risks. ''The biggest gains from Broadwater will be an economic supply of natural gas, a means of clearing the air in this region by replacing fossil fuel,'' he said. ''It will contain prices, bringing a net economic benefit to the tristate area.''
 Economics notwithstanding, the possibility of a fire involving liquefied natural gas emerged from the Port and Waterways Safety Assessment as a concern.
 ''Firefighting capabilities on the Sound, it's limited,'' Commander Blue said. ''The firefighting equipment on commercial tugs are pretty good, but the one fireboat operated by a fire department is in the Port of New York and New Jersey.'' The boat is stationed in the East River just south of the Brooklyn Bridge, about 80 miles from the Broadwater site. 
 Although Broadwater would be required by law to have firefighting equipment on the platform and to prepare an emergency plan, the provisions would cover only employees.

HEADLINE: Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
When F. Scott Fitzgerald pronounced that the very rich ''are different from you and me,'' Ernest Hemingway's famously dismissive response was: ''Yes, they have more money.'' Today he might well add: much, much, much more money. 
 The people at the top of America's money pyramid have so prospered in recent years that they have pulled far ahead of the rest of the population, an analysis of tax records and other government data by The New York Times shows. They have even left behind people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. 
 Call them the hyper-rich.
 They are not just a few Croesus-like rarities. Draw a line under the top 0.1 percent of income earners -- the top one-thousandth. Above that line are about 145,000 taxpayers, each with at least $1.6 million in income and often much more. 
 The average income for the top 0.1 percent was $3 million in 2002, the latest year for which averages are available. That number is two and a half times the $1.2 million, adjusted for inflation, that group reported in 1980. No other income group rose nearly as fast. 
 The share of the nation's income earned by those in this uppermost category has more than doubled since 1980, to 7.4 percent in 2002. The share of income earned by the rest of the top 10 percent rose far less, and the share earned by the bottom 90 percent fell. 
 Next, examine the net worth of American households. The group with homes, investments and other assets worth more than $10 million comprised 338,400 households in 2001, the last year for which data are available. The number has grown more than 400 percent since 1980, after adjusting for inflation, while the total number of households has grown only 27 percent.
 The Bush administration tax cuts stand to widen the gap between the hyper-rich and the rest of America. The merely rich, making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, will shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden.
 President Bush said during the third election debate last October that most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. In fact, most -- 53 percent -- will go to people with incomes in the top 10 percent over the first 15 years of the cuts, which began in 2001 and would have to be reauthorized in 2010. And more than 15 percent will go just to the top 0.1 percent, those 145,000 taxpayers. 
 The Times set out to create a financial portrait of the very richest Americans, how their incomes have changed over the decades and how the tax cuts will affect them. It is no secret that the gap between the rich and the poor has grown, but the extent to which the richest are leaving everyone else behind is not widely known. 
 The Treasury Department uses a computer model to examine the effects of tax cuts on various income groups but does not look in detail fine enough to differentiate among those within the top 1 percent. To determine those differences, The Times relied on a computer model based on the Treasury's. Experts at organizations representing a range of views, including the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and Citizens for Tax Justice, reviewed the projections and said they were reasonable, and the Treasury Department said through a spokesman that the model was reliable. 
 The analysis also found the following:
 Under the Bush tax cuts, the 400 taxpayers with the highest incomes -- a minimum of $87 million in 2000, the last year for which the government will release such data -- now pay income, Medicare and Social Security taxes amounting to virtually the same percentage of their incomes as people making $50,000 to $75,000.
 Those earning more than $10 million a year now pay a lesser share of their income in these taxes than those making $100,000 to $200,000.
 The alternative minimum tax, created 36 years ago to make sure the very richest paid taxes, takes back a growing share of the tax cuts over time from the majority of families earning $75,000 to $1 million -- thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars annually. Far fewer of the very wealthiest will be affected by this tax.
 The analysis examined only income reported on tax returns. The Treasury Department says that the very wealthiest find ways, legal and illegal, to shelter a lot of income from taxes. So the gap between the very richest and everyone else is almost certainly much larger. 
 The hyper-rich have emerged in the last three decades as the biggest winners in a remarkable transformation of the American economy characterized by, among other things, the creation of a more global marketplace, new technology and investment spurred partly by tax cuts. The stock market soared; so did pay in the highest ranks of business. 
 One way to understand the growing gap is to compare earnings increases over time by the vast majority of taxpayers -- say, everyone in the lower 90 percent -- with those at the top, say, in the uppermost 0.01 percent (now about 14,000 households, each with $5.5 million or more in income last year).
 From 1950 to 1970, for example, for every additional dollar earned by the bottom 90 percent, those in the top 0.01 percent earned an additional $162, according to the Times analysis. From 1990 to 2002, for every extra dollar earned by those in the bottom 90 percent, each taxpayer at the top brought in an extra $18,000.
 President Ronald Reagan signed tax bills that benefited the wealthiest Americans and also gave tax breaks to the working poor. President Bill Clinton raised income taxes for the wealthiest, cut taxes on investment gains, and expanded breaks for the working poor. Mr. Bush eliminated income taxes for families making under $40,000, but his tax cuts have also benefited the wealthiest Americans far more than his predecessors' did.
 The Bush administration says that the tax cuts have actually made the income tax system more progressive, shifting the burden slightly more to those with higher incomes. Still, an Internal Revenue Service study found that the only taxpayers whose share of taxes declined in 2001 and 2002 were those in the top 0.1 percent. 
 But a Treasury spokesman, Taylor Griffin, said the income tax system is more progressive if the measurement is the share borne by the top 40 percent of Americans rather than the top 0.1 percent. 
 The Times analysis also shows that over the next decade, the tax cuts Mr. Bush wants to extend indefinitely would shift the burden further from the richest Americans. With incomes of more than $1 million or so, they would get the biggest share of the breaks, in total amounts and in the drop in their share of federal taxes paid. 
 One reason the merely rich will fare much less well than the very richest is the alternative minimum tax. This tax, the successor to one enacted in 1969 to make sure the wealthiest Americans could not use legal loopholes to live tax-free, has never been adjusted for inflation. As a result, it stings Americans whose incomes have crept above $75,000. 
 The Times analysis shows that by 2010 the tax will affect more than four-fifths of the people making $100,000 to $500,000 and will take away from them nearly one-half to more than two-thirds of the recent tax cuts. For example, the group making $200,000 to $500,000 a year will lose 70 percent of their tax cut to the alternative minimum tax in 2010, an average of $9,177 for those affected. 
 But because of the way it is devised, the tax affects far fewer of the very richest: about a third of the taxpayers reporting more than $1 million in income. One big reason is that dividends and investment gains, which go mostly to the richest, are not subject to the tax. 
 Another reason that the wealthiest will fare much better is that the tax cuts over the past decade have sharply lowered rates on income from investments. 
 While most economists recognize that the richest are pulling away, they disagree on what this means. Those who contend that the extraordinary accumulation of wealth is a good thing say that while the rich are indeed getting richer, so are most people who work hard and save. They say that the tax cuts encourage the investment and the innovation that will make everyone better off. 
 ''In this income data I see a snapshot of a very innovative society,'' said Tim Kane, an economist at the Heritage Foundation. ''Lower taxes and lower marginal tax rates are leading to more growth. There's an explosion of wealth. We are so wealthy in a world that is profoundly poor.''
 But some of the wealthiest Americans, including Warren E. Buffett, George Soros and Ted Turner, have warned that such a concentration of wealth can turn a meritocracy into an aristocracy and ultimately stifle economic growth by putting too much of the nation's capital in the hands of inheritors rather than strivers and innovators. Speaking of the increasing concentration of incomes, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned in Congressional testimony a year ago: ''For the democratic society, that is not a very desirable thing to allow it to happen.'' 
 Others say most Americans have no problem with this trend. The central question is mobility, said Bruce R. Bartlett, an advocate of lower taxes who served in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. ''As long as people think they have a chance of getting to the top, they just don't care how rich the rich are.''
 But in fact, economic mobility -- moving from one income group to another over a lifetime -- has actually stopped rising in the United States, researchers say. Some recent studies suggest it has even declined over the last generation.

The data on income growth come from government tax return records analyzed by Emmanuel Saez, economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Thomas Piketty, economics professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris. The data on wealth come from the Federal Reserve's Consumer Finance Survey, analyzed by Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University. The estimates of taxes come from a computer model of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, and include income, corporate and estate taxes and proposals in the president's 2006 budget to extend the cuts indefinitely. The data on the 400 highest-income taxpayers come from an Internal Revenue Service report, with 2004 tax rules applied to 2000 data. All data are the most recent available.

HEADLINE: U.S. Challenged to Increase Aid to Africa

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
A powerful consensus is building for a doubling of aid to Africa among the world's heavyweight donors, except the United States, a divide that is likely to come into sharp relief this week when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain arrives in Washington to meet with President Bush.
 Mr. Blair, America's closest ally, hopes to shake loose more American aid for Africa. He is expected to ask Mr. Bush on Tuesday to join the leaders of other rich nations in forging a kind of Marshall Plan for Africa; Mr. Blair has called the continent's deepening poverty ''the fundamental moral challenge of our time.'' 
 Britain is far from alone. The European Union has found its collective voice on global poverty, too. Its 25 member nations agreed unanimously on May 24 to almost double assistance to poor countries over the next five years. Japan this week reaffirmed its pledge to double aid to Africa in just three years.
 But when President Bush was asked this week about Mr. Blair's effort, as well as a British proposal to raise money for development on capital markets, he replied, ''It doesn't fit our budgetary process.'' 
 The president hastened to add that he hoped to advance a ''compassion agenda'' when Mr. Blair plays host to leaders of the Group of 8 industrialized nations in Scotland next month, but any new Africa pact would certainly be weakened without American support. 
 Underlying this debate are differences over Africa's readiness to absorb the additional $25 billion in aid Mr. Blair advocates. The Europeans favor a quick and bold surge in spending that officials in Paris and London say will make it possible for Africa to join the global economy. 
 Their view is buttressed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Blair's Africa commission and a panel of experts appointed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
 All have said that many African nations are improving governance, fighting corruption and growing economically, and could make good use of more aid.
 Bush administration officials say they, too, believe aid can help. They note that the United States has tripled aid to Africa to $3.2 billion since Mr. Bush took office, with initiatives to tackle AIDS and to assist well-governed countries. Financing for those programs will grow in coming years, they say. 
 But the United States favors a more gradual buildup of aid, the officials said. It contends that the problem is less a lack of money than the ability of poor countries with weak institutions to spend it wisely.
 ''If you want to spend money well, it takes time,'' said an administration official who declined to be quoted by name. 
 The administration has said that decades of extensive aid have failed to encourage economic growth. In 2002, Mr. Bush announced plans for a Millennium Challenge Account intended to change the way aid was given out, assisting only countries that controlled corruption, invested in health and education and encouraged trade and private investment. 
 It was financed by Congress in 2004. So far, only eight African countries have been found eligible under its stringent standards and only one -- Madagascar -- has closed a deal for an aid package.
 More grants will be closed in coming months. Paul V. Applegarth, who heads the program, says its approach is in the intellectual forefront. 
 But critics complain that the money is being spent too slowly and in amounts that are still too stingy.
 ''They're fighting wars for hundreds of billions of dollars and what they've done for Africa is start one program for AIDS,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who led a United Nations-sponsored report on poverty. ''The Millennium Challenge Account hasn't disbursed a penny yet.''
 The aid debate is likely to heat up between now and September, when world leaders assess progress toward goals they set in 2000, among them to halve extreme poverty. 
 In the longer run, if Europe does rapidly accelerate aid, it will intensify a trend, more than a generation in the making, that has left European nations the world's dominant donors. 
 While the United States is still the single largest donor, giving about a quarter of the total, it is next to last in the share of national income it gives -- 16 cents of each $100. On average, major European nations give more than twice as much -- 36 cents of each $100. And they plan to raise that level to 51 cents of $100 by 2010.
 In Europe, the issue of African poverty has greater traction than in the United States because of its historical links to Africa as colonial powers, the clout of nonprofit groups like Oxfam, and the proximity of Africa, which makes the prospect of African poverty and social breakdown a security threat.
 Alongside the British plan, France is advocating a levy on airline tickets, either as a tax or a voluntary contribution by passengers. Thierry Breton, the French finance minister, said in an interview in Paris that he had broached the idea with John W. Snow, the United States Treasury secretary. 
 ''I said, 'John, maybe it's a good idea you join,''' he recalled. '''If you feel comfortable with it and want to do it on a voluntary basis, fine.'''
 But Tony Fratto, a Treasury spokesman, said the United States was not interested in either the British or the French proposals. ''We're happy to go to Congress and ask for money,'' he said. ''We don't need a scheme or an alternate way to increase funding for development.''

HEADLINE: Another Drink? Sure. China Is Paying.

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
GUESS who's paying for America's spending binge -- for the ballooning credit card bills, the scramble for homes, the country's gaping budgetary hole? Poor countries have become the financiers of the United States, fueling one of the most extravagant consumption drives in world history.
 From 1996 to 2004, the American current account deficit -- which includes the trade deficit as well as net interest and dividend payments -- grew to $666 billion from $120 billion, swelling the nation's demand for foreign financing by $546 billion. 
 The cash has come mostly from what the International Monetary Fund defines as emerging markets or developing countries -- nations that have piled up mountains of cash even though most of their citizens are poor. High on the list is China, whose per-capita gross domestic product of $1,300 last year was a thirtieth that of the United States. Others are Russia, where G.D.P. per head was $4,100, and India, where it barely topped $600. 
 The current accounts of developing countries swung from a deficit of $88 billion in 1996 to a surplus of $336 billion last year -- a $424 billion change that has covered some four-fifths of the increase in the deficit of the United States. 
 This pattern troubles some policy makers in the United States. In speeches in March and April, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve governor nominated by President Bush to be chief economic adviser, argued that a main reason for America's swelling external deficit is ''the very substantial shift in the current accounts of developing and emerging-market nations, a shift that has transformed these countries from net borrowers on international capital markets to large net lenders.''
 The poor-country money, Mr. Bernanke said, pushed the current account of the United States deeper into the red. As the money arrived, it first lifted stock prices, encouraging both consumption and investment. When stocks tanked, it moved to the bond market, fueling the housing boom and yet more spending.
 There's nothing inherently wrong with taking money from poor places -- it's not as if the United States is stealing it. Developing countries are providing the funds willingly. 
 But it is rather odd. Conventional economic thought suggests that funds should flow the other way. Capital-rich industrial nations like the United States, where workers already have a large stock of capital goods to work with -- like high-tech factories and advanced information technology networks -- should be sending money to places rich in labor but with a meager capital stock. 
 Developing countries, of course, use this money to grow out of poverty, investing in their own factories and schools. And precisely because capital is scarce and labor abundant, money invested in these countries should achieve a higher return.
 ''For the developing world to be lending large sums on net to the mature industrial economies is quite undesirable as a long-run proposition,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 So what's going on? The efforts of China and other developing countries to keep their currencies from rising against the dollar help explain why the flow of global money is trumping conventional wisdom. Yet other forces are at play. The climb in oil prices, for one, has produced big gains for countries like Nigeria, Russia and Saudi Arabia, which have put much of the cash in dollar assets. 
 Most important, running a current-account surplus has become a matter of self-defense throughout the developing world. 
 Many of the poor countries that are now lending money to richer ones previously were big borrowers and spenders themselves. Then they were hit by a series of financial crises. Starting with the currency collapse in Mexico in 1994, and continuing with the Asian currency crisis of 1997, the Russian debt crisis of 1998, the Brazilian currency devaluation of 1999 and the Argentine default of 2002, developing countries experienced large-scale capital flight, which forced painful devaluations and sharp economic contractions.
 Naturally enough, they took measures to reduce the chance of further jolts. Countries stricken by crisis or just trying to avoid it tightened their belts. They stimulated exports and inhibited imports -- working to keep their exchange rates low. They reduced domestic investment and paid down foreign debt. 
 And they amassed vast foreign reserve war chests to protect themselves in case investors ever decided to bolt again and take their capital with them. Russia's international reserves, for instance, mushroomed to $124 billion at the end of 2004 from $18 billion at the end of 1997. India's jumped to $126 billion from $24 billion over that period.
 Last year alone, according to the Institute of International Finance, a lobby group of big banks, international reserves of developing countries grew nearly $400 billion. 
 The good news for the United States is that these forces are unlikely to change direction imminently. In an interconnected world, where investors can move billions across oceans at the touch of a button, these countries have little reason to shift strategies.
 Guillermo Calvo, the chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank, who has seen his share of financial crises in Latin America, put it succinctly: ''Every country seeks more security. The only thing they can do is build up their war chest.'' The United States gets to spend it.

HEADLINE: G-8? GEE WHIZ!

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere

 BODY:
Setting aside decades of practice as a diplomat, Richard C. Holbrooke, former ambassador to the United Nations, had some pointed advice for President Bush last week at the Asia Society's annual dinner in New York: Update the Group of 8. 
 Mr. 
Holbrooke, chairman of the Asia Society and vice chairman of Perseus, a private equity firm, called next month's G-8 summit in Scotland a ''complete anachronism'' because it would not include two of the most dynamic economies on earth. 
 ''How can you have a meeting with such mighty economic powers as Russia -- whose G.D.P. is about the size of that of the county of Los Angeles -- and Italy and Canada, but not China and India?'' he asked. Mr. Bush should add them to the G-8, he suggested.
 The dinner was for five Asian-American entrepreneurs: David Chu of Nautica; Vinod Khosla, founding chief executive of Sun Microsystems; Chong-Moon Lee of Diamond Multimedia Systems; Lulu C. Wang of Tupelo Capital Management; and Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo. Jane L. Levere

HEADLINE: College Aid Rules Change, and Families Pay More

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
No matter how she parses it, Roberta Proctor cannot make sense of her son's college bill. Her income and her assets have not changed. If anything, she says, her family's finances have deteriorated somewhat. 
 So, she wonders, how could she possibly owe an extra $6,000 for the coming school year, when tuition has not increased anywhere near that amount? 
 But she does. Like the Proctors, Californians whose son just finished his freshman year at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, thousands of American families might find it harder to qualify for financial aid this year and might be asked to contribute more money toward the cost of college because of changes to a complicated federal formula they barely know about, much less understand. 
 Taken together, these changes, some based on overly optimistic predictions of inflation, have required families to count a greater share of their incomes and assets toward college expenses before becoming eligible for financial aid. As a consequence, tens of thousands of low-income students will no longer be eligible for federal grants; middle-class families are digging deeper into their savings; and some colleges are putting up their own money to make up the difference.
 ''This is not what we intended,'' said Joe Paul Case, the financial aid director at Amherst College, in Massachusetts, who helped develop the formula that the government now uses for the bulk of the nation's students. ''There is certainly more duress than we had in mind.'' 
 The New York Times did an analysis of the formula on middle-class incomes in more than a dozen states to see whether families would have to spend a greater part of their income and assets before qualifying for financial aid than they did five years ago. Though the effects of the formula changes vary from state to state, The Times found that families with the same earnings and assets as in 2000 would typically have to pay an extra $1,749 before clearing the eligibility bar for financial aid in 2005, after adjusting for inflation. 
 Though the formula will change in the future, sometimes to a family's advantage, the impact on campuses now is obvious, many university officials say, and often cuts across class lines. The University of California, Berkeley, for example, says that 1,000 of its middle- to upper-middle-class students will probably lose eligibility for federal subsidies on their student loans in the coming year, a change that typically means higher debts because of accrued interest. On the other side of the economic spectrum, Northeastern University, in Boston, says that 300 of its low-income students will not receive the federal grants they would have been eligible for last year. 
 ''For some of those students, it's the difference between enrolling and not enrolling,'' said Seamus Harreys, dean of student financial services at Northeastern. ''We're trying to figure how to get them through to graduation.''
 For millions of students, financial aid arrives in a mixture of grants and low-interest loans from the federal government, the states and the colleges themselves. The amount students receive is mostly based on an intricate formula, administered by the Department of Education, that looks at many aspects of a family's circumstances, including its income, its tax bill, its investments, its size and even the parents' ages.
 The Department of Education says that any changes to the formula are driven by a legal obligation to keep it current, reflecting what families can truly afford to pay. For example, the administration determined that more of a parent's assets must be counted toward college expenses this year because it predicted better economic circumstances, including substantially lower inflation. Under that scenario, the administration argues, families need to save less money for retirement. 
 ''This is all statutory,'' said Sally Stroup, assistant secretary for postsecondary education for the department.
 Some economists consider the administration's economic assumptions deeply flawed. The department's estimates for inflation were, in fact, far enough off that it has now revised the formula it will use for the 2006-2007 school year, much to the benefit of families with assets. But the latest round of changes will not help parents in the coming school year. 
 Politics have also come into play. In 2003, Congress blocked the department from changing how the financial aid formula treats state taxes. That move would have rendered 92,000 students ineligible for Pell Grants, the nation's largest scholarship program at more than $12 billion a year, and reduced government spending for the program by $290 million, according to the Government Accountability Office. Last year, the administration found support among Congressional leaders seeking to constrain the growing cost of Pell Grants, and the changes have now taken effect. 
 Much as with federal income tax, the federal financial aid formula allows families to deduct some of what they pay in state taxes to determine how much they have left over for college. With the consent of Congress, that amount was cut significantly in almost all states this year, in some cases by half. On paper, at least, that leaves families with more money to pay tuition and other expenses. 
 In The Times's analysis of the current formula, the increase in what families must pay before clearing the eligibility bar for financial aid was larger for families in New York, Iowa and Colorado, where the consideration of a family's state tax burden has changed significantly under the formula in an effort to make it reflect typical tax payments. The increase was smaller in states like New Jersey and Connecticut, where the treatment of state taxes did not change or became more favorable for students. 
 Even so, the formula dictates that more of a family's assets can be tapped this year to cover college expenses than in 2000, in many cases almost twice as much. So, assuming the average savings, stocks and other financial investments of middle-class families with assets, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board, all families in the analysis ended up owing more money before qualifying for financial aid, regardless of where they lived. 
 The analysis looked at the changing requirements under the formula for families earning from $65,000 in 2000 to about $85,000 in 2005. That is the middle of the income range and slightly above it for parents from 45 to 54, peak ages for sending children to college. 
 Finally, the analysis also took into account whether there was one parent or two. Without exception, single parents experienced larger increases -- typically $549 larger -- in the amount they would have to pay before reaching the eligibility mark for financial aid. The reason is that the rules shield less of their savings from college expenses, on the theory that they will need less for retirement. Families have vastly different financial circumstances, so the analysis cannot be used as a predictor of what any individual will owe. 
 Nonetheless, many colleges say they have witnessed the effects of previous changes, some in the last year alone. At Washington & Jefferson College, in Pennsylvania, parents will typically have to contribute an additional $1,947 compared with last school year before qualifying for financial aid next year -- an extra 17 percent -- even though their incomes have risen only 4 percent. At DePaul University, in Chicago, the bar for financial aid will typically go up by $4,215, or 39 percent, though incomes have increased by only 12 percent. 
 Emory University, in Atlanta, says the incomes of its students' families have generally not increased, yet they would typically have to pay an extra $4,000 before becoming eligible for financial aid under the government's rules.
 ''If there had been a $1,000 difference, that would be one thing. But when we saw these $6,000 and $7,000 differences routinely, we got really concerned,'' said Julia Padgett, director of financial aid at Emory. 
 The difference was drastic enough that Emory, like a few of its well-endowed counterparts, abandoned the government's rules for many of its families, a decision that required it to surrender federal money for those students and substitute it with its own.
 ''We just felt as if we had no ethical choice,'' Mrs. Padgett said.
 Most colleges, however, say they are not wealthy enough to forsake federal aid, which includes money to pay students in work-study jobs. In fact, passing up federal money might only worsen a student's financial outlook, they say.
 ''It's really hard to explain to the family that although the federal formula may not make sense, and I may not agree with it, I have to go along with it,'' said Michelle Vettorel, director of financial aid at Washington & Jefferson. 
 When the bar for financial aid goes up, students may also lose the state grants, sometimes worth thousands of dollars a year, that are often tied to the federal formula. ''That's a huge concern,'' said Gerard Cebrzynski, director of financial aid at Lake Forest College, outside of Chicago. ''We've seen several students who have lost their entire awards this year.''
 Still, some college officials say the hand-wringing is unwarranted. Whatever the changes to financial aid, they say, students as a whole have rarely stopped pursuing degrees and college attendance rates remain high nationally. 
 ''I would not deny that this has impacted some people seriously,'' said Joe Russo, director of student financial services at the University of Notre Dame. ''But nationally, has this caused enrollment to drop? It doesn't appear to have.''
 What the changes will probably do, many university officials and parents contend, is have a disproportionate impact on middle-class families, especially when it comes to tapping their assets. 
 ''For the middle class, it means greater pressure put upon them to cobble together college funding at schools that are becoming increasingly expensive,'' said James Boyle, president of College Parents of America, an advocacy group. ''It's another middle-class squeeze.''

HEADLINE: Plan Would Expand Ocean Fish Farming

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is expected to announce a proposal on Tuesday to allow greatly expanded offshore fish farming, up to 200 miles from shore. 
 The draft proposal of the National Offshore Aquaculture Act calls for development of regulations to permit farming in federal waters and the addition of species to farming, like cod, halibut and tuna, which are farmed in other countries. Fish farming, or aquaculture, is currently confined to state waters, closer to shore. 
 According to the draft, which intends to quintuple fish farming by 2025, ocean resources would be divided into privatized zones with renewable leases good for 10 years. 
 ''Fisheries are a collapsing industry, and even though aquaculture comes with a lot of baggage, it is absolutely the future of seafood production,'' said Dr. Daniel D. Benetti, director of aquaculture and chairman of marine affairs and policy at the University of Miami. 
 Dr. Benetti is working with the Snapper Farm off Puerto Rico, a recipient of a NOAA grant.
 But critics are worried that NOAA, a branch of the Commerce Department, has not addressed the health and environmental problems of existing fish farms: pollution from wastes, chemicals and drugs; the impact of escapes on wild fish, including transference of disease and parasites; the dependence on wild fish, which are used as feed for the farmed fish; and the impact on traditional fishing.
 In 2003, the Pew Oceans Commission, a private panel of scientists, economists, fishermen and other experts financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, said expansion of fish farms should cease until national standards and rules were in place for ecologically sustainable aquaculture. 
 ''I believe aquaculture is incredibly important,'' said Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a professor of zoology at Oregon State University and member of the commission. ''Now is the time to make sure it grows in a way that is good for human health and the environment. I would like to see the right kinds of checks and balances before we launch into this massive offshore experiment and it is too late.''
 Dr. William T. Hogarth, NOAA Fisheries Service director, agrees. ''I'll be the first to admit there is a lot of controversy,'' he said. ''We have to do aquaculture in an environmentally safe and compatible way.''
 NOAA's manager of aquaculture, Michael Rubino, said the proposal was over 10 years in the making. It has the support of the Bush administration.
 So far there are few answers to the critics' questions, in part because the draft proposal has no environmental rules. Dr. Hogarth said the agency intended to create regulations through workshops and public hearings if the legislation is passed. 
 Dr. Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist with Environmental Defense, an advocacy group often at odds with the food and agriculture industries, said: ''If aquaculture is to be pursued in offshore waters, Americans want it to be with very stringent safeguards. They have to think through the potential for fish escapes, where fish farms can be located to minimize impacts of water pollution and spread of disease.''
 Each year around two million farmed fish escape in the Atlantic. For that reason, Dr. Hogarth says, pens should be stocked with only native species.
 But Dr. Goldburg said even escapes of indigenous species could cause problems. For example, the fertilized eggs of cod cannot be contained in ocean pens, and the fish that hatch from them could have an impact on the seriously depleted stocks of wild cod. 
 Proponents of offshore fish farming believe that if the farms are placed in the deep ocean, strong currents could dilute waste, uneaten food and medications from the pens. Ocean pens would also put the farms out of the reach of state authorities.
 Dr. Goldburg said scattering the farms might ease the pollution problem, but she added, ''They do tend to cluster the farms because of proximity to feed and processing plants.''
 The environmentally acceptable size of fish farms is another unknown. Dr. Benetti of the University of Miami said, ''We are not economically sustainable, so we must scale up, and as you scale up you might see some impact.'' 
 Rather than increasing the overall food supply, most fish farms provide substitutes for expensive wild species. ''The perception of aquaculture is that it plays a key role in providing food for a burgeoning human population,'' Dr. Lubchenco said, ''but most segments of aquaculture, like salmon and shrimp, are not providing food for the poor but for white-tablecloth restaurants.'' 
 The fish that should be farmed, because of their smaller environmental impact, said Dr. Lubchenco, are herbivores and omnivorous freshwater fish like tilapia, carp and catfish, and mollusks like oysters and mussels. But the money is in carnivores. And farming tuna, salmon and swordfish depletes populations of wild fish, which are needed to make fish meal. It takes about three pounds of wild fish to produce one pound of farmed salmon.
 One of the most environmentally sensitive methods of aquaculture is integrated fish farming, in which mussels, seaweeds and other species are grown in close proximity with fin fish to recycle waste. In Canada, Dr. Thierry Chopin, professor of marine biology at the University of New Brunswick in St. John, has been growing seaweed, salmon and mussels in the Bay of Fundy since 2001. The seaweed and mussels consume some of the waste from the salmon. Studies have shown that the chemicals fed to the salmon are not passed on to the mussels or the seaweed, making them safe to eat.
 Dr. Chopin's program has grown but is not yet commercial. Few companies are interested because integrated farming, in which several species must be monitored, is much more complicated. 
 Some states are worried about the federal government's plans and have already taken action. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, has introduced a bill to prohibit the development of new offshore aquaculture operations until there is legislation to address all the potential problems. 
 California recently passed stringent regulations governing aquaculture off its coast. ''If we get anything close to the California bill, I think we will be doing well,'' Dr. Lubchenco said. ''But I'm skeptical.''

HEADLINE: The Mobility Myth

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT; Paul Krugman is on vacation.. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The war that nobody talks about -- the overwhelmingly one-sided class war -- is being waged all across America. Guess who's winning.
 A recent front-page article in The Los Angeles Times showed that teenagers are faring poorly in a tight job market because of the fierce competition they're getting from older workers and immigrants for entry-level positions.
 On the same day, in the business section, the paper reported that the chief executives at California's largest 100 companies took home a collective $1.1 billion in 2004, an increase of nearly 20 percent over the previous year. The paper contrasted that with the 2.9 percent raise that the average California worker saw last year. 
 The gap between the rich and everybody else in this country is fast becoming an unbridgeable chasm. David Cay Johnston, in the latest installment of the New York Times series ''Class Matters,'' wrote, ''It's no secret that the gap between the rich and the poor has been growing, but the extent to which the richest are leaving everybody else behind is not widely known.''
 Consider, for example, two separate eras in the lifetime of the baby-boom generation. For every additional dollar earned by the bottom 90 percent of the population between 1950 and 1970, those in the top 0.01 percent earned an additional $162. That gap has since skyrocketed. For every additional dollar earned by the bottom 90 percent between 1990 and 2002, Mr. Johnston wrote, each taxpayer in that top bracket brought in an extra $18,000.
 It's like chasing a speedboat with a rowboat.
 Put the myth of the American Dream aside. The bottom line is that it's becoming increasingly difficult for working Americans to move up in class. The rich are freezing nearly everybody else in place, and sprinting off with the nation's bounty. 
 Economic mobility in the United States -- the extent to which individuals and families move from one social class to another -- is no higher than in Britain or France, and lower than in some Scandinavian countries. Maybe we should be studying the Scandinavian dream.
 As far as the Bush administration is concerned, the gap between the rich and the rest of us is not growing fast enough. An analysis by The Times showed the following:
 ''Under the Bush tax cuts, the 400 taxpayers with the highest incomes -- a minimum of $87 million in 2000, the last year for which the government will release such data -- now pay income, Medicare and Social Security taxes amounting to virtually the same percentage of their incomes as people making $50,000 to $75,000. Those earning more than $10 million a year now pay a lesser share of their income in these taxes than those making $100,000 to $200,000.''
 The social dislocations resulting from this war that nobody mentions have been under way for some time. But the Bush economic policies have accelerated the consequences and intensified the pain.
 A big problem, of course, is that American workers have been hurting badly for years. Revolutionary improvements in technology, increasingly globalized trade, the competition of low-wage workers overseas and increased immigration here at home, the decline of manufacturing, the weakening of the labor movement, outsourcing and numerous other factors have left American workers with very little leverage to use against employers.
 Many in the middle class are mortgaged to the hilt, maxed out on credit cards and fearful to the point of trembling that all they've worked for might vanish in a downsized minute. 
 The privileged classes, with the Bush administration's iron cloak of protection, avoid their fair share of taxes, are reluctant to pay an honest dollar for an honest day's work (the federal minimum wage is still a scandalous $5.15 an hour), refuse to fight in their nation's wars, and laugh all the way to their yachts.
 The American dream was about expanding opportunities and widely shared prosperity. Now we have older people and college grads replacing people near the bottom in jobs that offer low pay, no pensions, no health insurance and no vacations.
 A fellow named Mark McClellan, who was bounced out of a management position when Kaiser Aluminum closed down in Spokane, Wash., told The Times in the ''Class Matters'' series: ''I may look middle class. But I'm not. My boat is sinking fast.''

HEADLINE: Trying to Lift Morale and Profile, Paris Goes Out to Play

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH; Helene Fouquet contributed reporting from Paris for this article, and Mike McIntire from New York.

DATELINE: PARIS, June 5 

 BODY:
Paris on Sunday shut down the Champs-Elysees for a huge street party in support of its effort to be selected as the host of the 2012 Olympic Games. The event provided a poignant counterpoint to the gloomy political mood that has pervaded France since it rejected the European Union's constitution last month.
 While Madrid, another contender for the Games, held a similar event on Sunday, the daylong sports festival in Paris carried more symbolism as both officials and citizens tried to look beyond France's economic and political malaise toward what most agree would be a prize around which people could unite.
 ''The French have had it with politics, the social situation, everything,'' said Raphaelle Monteau, a television producer watching a table tennis match on the avenue with her two children. ''The Games would boost morale.'' 
 The Olympic committee will issue a report on Monday evaluating the efforts of the five cities in contention. Their decision will be announced on July 6. Many people regard Paris as the front-runner for the 2012 Games, partly because the city already has about two-thirds of the required venues in place and its plans to build the rest are neither prohibitively expensive nor politically difficult.
 New York, by contrast, has yet to win $300 million in public financing for a stadium it would build on the West Side of Manhattan. If the stadium issue is not resolved, New York's chances of landing the games may be diminished. On Friday, supporters postponed a vote on the financing in Albany when they appeared destined to lose.
 In New York on Sunday, intense lobbying by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg failed to break the political logjam. The leader of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, met several times with the mayor throughout the day, but said he remained opposed to the stadium proposal.
 Madrid would have to do far more building than would Paris: one proposed stadium would cost more than all of the construction planned by Paris combined.
 Moscow, another candidate, has already been the host for more international championships in Olympic sports than any of the other candidates and, plagued by power failures and organized crime, is not believed to be the likely choice.
 London, which plans a new rail line to connect the city with Stratford, where most of the events would be held, is considered the most serious competition to Paris.
 There is a widespread feeling in France that this country needs a lift and that losing the Olympics again -- the city lost the chance to be host for the 2008 Games to Beijing -- would only deepen the sense that it has lost its direction.
 France has been gripped in a torturous struggle between the government and powerful unions over the future of expensive worker entitlements that the government insists that the country can no longer afford. The economy has sputtered and unemployment has surged, while frequent strikes have played havoc with people's lives.
 One result has been widespread popular discontent, which found an outlet in the May 29 referendum on the European Union constitution. The overwhelming no that voters delivered was less about the constitution, which few people read or understood, than it was about frustration with the status quo. In response, President Jacques Chirac reshuffled his already well-shuffled cabinet in a vain effort to appease the public, but the national temper remains grim.
 That was the context to the festivities on Sunday, which turned the Champs-Elysees into a long series of sporting arenas, from a running track near the Arc de Triomphe to a swimming pool near Place de la Concorde. Olympic athletes and sporting clubs put on exhibitions of everything from fencing to baseball. Children were invited to participate between events.
 Of course, no one believes that if Paris is chosen the host for the Olympics, it will solve the country's many problems. There was still plenty of pessimism to go around on Sunday. ''The reality is that companies are moving to the countries in the East,'' said Philippe Wramour, a mechanic, when asked if Paris's being chosen would help France. The loss of jobs to the European Union's new members in the former Soviet bloc is among the most emotional issues causing anger toward the government. ''It's a mess here,'' Mr. Wramour said.
 Many people worry that the country's frequent strikes could cost Paris its chance to be the host. Unions angry at the government's effort to loosen the rules around the country's 35-hour workweek called a strike the day that the Olympic inspection committee came to town in March.
 But the Olympics is a popular cause here. Even many of the striking workers wore Paris 2012 T-shirts.
 ''To have the games would bring a little fun, as you say, a breath of fresh air,'' said Benoit Genuini, president of the French operation of Accenture, a global consulting company, on a balcony of the Louvre last week during an event to highlight the city's cultural attractions as an Olympic host. He remarked that the country was morose and that the city itself had become a sort of museum. ''The games would put Paris back in the saddle and lead it into the 21st century,'' he said, ''get it out of its stupor.''

HEADLINE: Above the Arctic Circle, a Gulag Nightmare for Tourists?

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: VORKUTA, Russia, May 30 

 BODY:
This broken-down Arctic coal town does not offer much when it is comes to economic prospects. The mayor works with what he has.
 ''My dream is to build a gulag,'' the mayor, Igor L. Shpektor, declared the other day in an outburst that stung like the bitter chill of late May in a place whose history is inseparable from the Soviet Union's notorious system of penal labor.
 He meant a gulag for tourists. ''Extreme tourism,'' he explained. 
 Then he spun an improbable vision of hard times and hard bunks, where tourists could eat turnip gruel and sleep in wooden barracks in a faux camp surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers, patrolled by soldiers and dogs.
 ''Americans can stay here,'' he went on. ''We will give them a chance to escape. The guards will shoot them'' -- with paint balls, naturally, not bullets.
 Whether Mr. Shpektor's idea is madness or an act of civic desperation is hard to say, but reaction to the idea, which he first floated in 2003 at a town meeting that included survivors of Vorkuta's camps, has been mixed.
 ''I think it is sacrilege,'' said Tatyana B. Andreyeva, a teacher who conducts expeditions for schoolchildren to the ever-disappearing remains of Vorkuta's camps.
 ''It is worse than sacrilege,'' said Yevgeniya A. Khaidorova, the co-director of the local branch of Memorial, the human rights organization that has done more than any other to chronicle the horrors of the gulag.
 Mr. Shpektor, though, is not easily daunted. He is blunt and brusque, governing this city with an authoritarian fist and a mercurial temper. (He publicly excoriated aides at a parade honoring children and border guards and furiously berated a group of foreign visitors for arriving late for a meeting with him.)
 A dictatorial will might have been enough for Stalin to build the gulag -- the vast networks of camps that swallowed millions during the Great Terror of the 1930's and afterward, often for little more than offending the man in charge -- but Mr. Shpektor faces hurdles Stalin never could have imagined.
 ''We need investment,'' he said, articulating what might prove to be the project's biggest hurdle.
 The most significant foreign investment in Vorkuta (pronounced vor-ku-TA) since the collapse of the Soviet Union, after all, has been a program by the World Bank to relocate people out of here, encouraging them to abandon the Far North for better prospects elsewhere.
 Vorkuta, a city built by gulag labor in the tundra 1,200 miles northeast of Moscow and 100 miles above the Arctic Circle, is slowly dying -- and those who remain in many cases cannot afford to leave.
 A Soviet-era sign that remains atop a central building exhorts people to mine more coal, the resource that first attracted the gulag's architects in the 1930's and resulted in forced labor by two million prisoners before the camps shut down in 1950's.
 The mines, however, are closing.
 Once, 13 mines were arrayed in settlements around Vorkuta like the hours of a crazy clock. Only six still operate. The other settlements have been abandoned to the Arctic elements, their services cut and their buildings intentionally gutted or leveled, lest the truly desperate try to reoccupy them. In 1990, just before the Soviet implosion, 217,000 people lived here; today about 130,000 do.
 Mr. Shpektor's plans remain vague, but he cited one of the abandoned settlements as a prime spot for his gulag. It is called Uzhny -- which means simply Southern -- and was one of 132 camps that existed in and around Vorkuta at the gulag's peak.
 It stands on a bend of the Vorkuta River, abutted by a looming escarpment and marred both by the detritus of Soviet economics and the new Russian ones. A recreational park still operates nearby. Or did -- a recent flood swept away most of the park's facilities.
 Mr. Shpektor said he had blueprints for his gulag camp, but neither he nor his aides produced them. The idea generally, he explained, was to recreate the sensation of Arctic imprisonment.
 ''It should look like the Stalin camps,'' he said, ''so that people today can understand what those prisoners went through.''
 He brushed aside questions of whether the idea would offend. ''People should see what should not be repeated again,'' he said.
 Plus, once here, visitors might use the camp as a base for trekking, hunting or fishing in the tundra around Vorkuta. There is precedent of a sort. Outside of Perm, a city in the Urals, a group has preserved the remains of Perm-36, the only camp of the gulag system that remains more or less intact. A few years ago they began to offer a handful of rooms for rent, but mostly for scholars and mostly to raise money for preserving the site as a reminder of a past not often discussed in today's Russia.
 Ms. Andreyeva, the teacher, welcomed any effort to recognize the Vorkuta's grim history, but she accused the mayor of hypocrisy, saying that almost nothing, officially, had been done to preserve the remnants of the camps that were here. 
 She would like to see a museum built. So far the only acknowledged memorial to the gulag's victims here is a weed-choked graveyard, near the abandoned settlement called Industrial, where 53 prisoners were shot and buried after an uprising in 1953.
 A theme camp is different, though. ''It is like restoring Buchenwald,'' she said.
 The gulag is not Mr. Shpektor's first outlandish proposal. In 2001, he created a stir with a proposal to open Russia's first legal brothel. Political opposition to prostitution -- and a failure to attract investors -- doomed the idea. He also dreams of using a nearby military airfield, built for the Soviet Union's space shuttle program, as a layover for trans-Arctic passenger flights. That idea, too, has failed to attract investors.
 With the mines privately owned and managed and not sustained by the state, the need to diversify Vorkuta's economy is indisputable.
 Vorkuta will not survive otherwise, Mr. Shpektor said.
 ''Capitalism in its worst form,'' he said, ''has come to this place.''

HEADLINE: New Vaccines Prevent Ebola and Marburg in Monkeys

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
Scientists trying to develop vaccines against Africa's deadly Marburg and Ebola viruses are reporting an important milestone, a new type of vaccine that prevents the diseases in monkeys. Successfully immunizing monkeys is an essential step toward producing human vaccines. 
 Two new vaccines, one for Marburg and one for Ebola, were 100 percent effective in a study of 12 macaques being published today in the journal Nature Medicine. Monkeys given just one shot of vaccine and later injected with a high dose of virus did not even get sick. Normally, all the animals would be expected to die. 
 The Marburg and Ebola viruses are closely related, and in both people and monkeys they cause hemorrhagic fevers that can be fatal within a week. There is no vaccine or treatment for either disease. Death rates in people can be high, sometimes exceeding 80 or 90 percent. 
 Angola, where a Marburg epidemic was first detected in March, is still struggling to contain the disease, which has killed 340 of 408 victims. The virus is spread by contact with blood, saliva, vomit or other fluids from sick patients. 
 The two new vaccines are still experimental, and will not be ready to be tested in people for at least two years. If human trials are successful, products might be ready for licensing five or six years from now, the researchers said. The vaccines would not be used for routine immunization, but would be given to health workers in high risk areas, virus researchers and people who had been exposed to the disease, such as relatives and others in close contact with sick patients. Eventually, it might be possible to combine the vaccines to protect people from both diseases with a single shot.
 The new vaccines are not the first to protect monkeys. An earlier one, first proved in 2003, may go into safety studies in people in the United States later this year. Each vaccine has its advocates, and researchers say it is advantageous to have several candidates on the horizon.
 The work described in Nature Medicine today was done by scientists from the United States and Canada, led by Dr. Steven M. Jones and Dr. Heinz Feldmann of the Public Health Agency of Canada in Winnipeg, and Dr. Thomas W. Geisbert of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Md. 
 Dr. Jones said the goal of the research was to provide a vaccine that could be used to stop outbreaks like the one in Angola or to protect people from germ warfare. He and other researchers said that governments and the military developed a strong interest in making vaccines against Ebola and Marburg during the 1990's after a Soviet defector said that Russians had stockpiled the Marburg virus, weaponized it and packed it into warheads for possible use in attacks on cities or battlefields.
 ''Marburg and Ebola are not as significant threats as smallpox would be, but one could wreak incredible human health tragedies in this country and could probably create a huge economic burden even if the diseases didn't spread like wildfire,'' said Dr. Peter B. Jahrling, an author of the article and an expert on viruses and bioterrorism who used to work for the Department of Defense and is now a chief scientist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of the National Institutes of Health. ''But I think a lot of people here also see the humanitarian aspects of providing vaccine to people who need it.'' 
 Dr. Cathy Roth, head of the emerging and dangerous pathogen team at the World Health Organization, said: ''This work is very interesting, very exciting and very promising. There's a long way to go before this vaccine could be put into people. But we really do hope it is pursued.'' 
 To make the vaccine, the scientists used another virus, V.S.V., for vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people. They chose it because it has a similar genetic structure to the Marburg and Ebola viruses, and because other researchers have had success with it in developing vaccines. 
 They altered V.S.V. by removing one of its genes -- the change makes it harmless -- and replacing it with a gene from either the Marburg or Ebola virus. The transplanted gene forced V.S.V. to produce Marburg or Ebola proteins on its surface. The proteins cannot cause illness, but they provoked an immune response that protected the animals. 
 The monkeys were housed at a high-level biohazard laboratory at Fort Detrick, where the researchers, wearing space suits, watched them intently for signs of illness after they were injected with Marburg or Ebola. 
 ''By Day 6, I have a very good idea of whether it's going to work or not,'' Dr. Geisbert said. ''On Day 6 I was feeling really good. By the time we get to Day 10, if the animals haven't become sick or had any problems, we pretty much know it's worked. It is an incredibly good feeling. All the people on the team are high-fiving. I was communicating with Heinz and Steven every day, two and three times a day. 'How are the monkeys? How are the monkeys?'''
 As the team pursues its research, other scientists are moving ahead with the previously developed Ebola vaccine, based on an inactivated version of another type of virus, an adenovirus, which can cause common cold symptoms in people. That vaccine, tested in 2003, also protected monkeys, and studies in people may begin this year. 
 Dr. Jahrling, who has worked on both types of vaccine, said the government was paying for both approaches to cover its bets. He said he thought a vaccine based on an adenovirus would be ready before one based on V.S.V. 
 ''They've got a runner on third with that one,'' he said, ''and the other guys have a runner on first.'' 
 Dr. Jahrling added: ''A little competition is good. It accelerates everybody. If nobody's behind them they kind of slow up.'' 
 But Dr. Gary Nabel, head of the Vaccine Research Center at the N.I.H. infectious disease institute, who has been working on the adenovirus vaccine, said: ''I don't look at it as a race. For me, the adversary is the virus and whatever gives us the best opportunity to defeat the virus is what we need to go with.''

HEADLINE: On a Discount Shopping Strip in Brooklyn, Immigrants Report Illegal Wages 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Like many shopping strips in immigrant neighborhoods, Knickerbocker Avenue in Bushwick is overflowing with 99-cent stores, cuchifrito stands, sneaker shops -- and egregious wage and hour violations.
At the Super Star 99 discount store at 353 Knickerbocker, employees say they work 63 hours a week for $260, which works out to $4.13 an hour, far below the state minimum wage of $6 an hour and the federal minimum of $5.15. 
 At the Nuevo Mexico restaurant at 276 Knickerbocker, Patricia Reyes, a 29-year-old waitress and cook, said she received just $165 a week, including tips, for 72 hours of work, which comes to $2.29 an hour.
 And at Footco, a bustling sneaker shop at 431 Knickerbocker, workers said they earned $4.75 an hour working more than 50 hours a week.
 For many workers in Bushwick, Brooklyn, the possibility of receiving the legally required time and a half for overtime, even when they work 80-hour weeks, seems as likely as winning the lottery. 
 ''They always told us work faster, faster, and the money was really bad,'' said Deisi Cortes, who worked as a stocker at Super Star 99 until April when she was fired, she said, for being pregnant. ''We'd ask for a raise, and all they'd say is, 'Maybe later on.'''
 Knickerbocker Avenue is in many ways the face of New York's traditional retail life outside of central Manhattan's wealthy shopping locales, with bodegas, low-cost stores, and ethnic restaurants jumbled together in a confusion of awnings and blaring signs. Immigrant shopping strips like this one in Bushwick and others in Corona, Jamaica, Sunset Park and Washington Heights not only serve the working class but just as often exploit it with widespread wage violations, according to economists, sociologists, immigrant advocates and community groups. 
 ''New York is like the wild, wild West,'' said Annette Bernhardt, a senior policy analyst with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. ''The violations are on such a scale that nobody can monitor all of them.'' She said widespread violations in Bushwick mirrored those in many businesses that rely on immigrants -- greengrocers, laundries, restaurants and garment factories.
 The large number of unskilled immigrant workers, many of them here illegally, helps create a fertile climate for wage violations on streets like Knickerbocker. In addition, many immigrant storeowners are unfamiliar with wage laws and not much concerned about them, and the government has been less than vigorous in enforcing them.
 ''It's pretty stunning the extent to which stores here break wage and hour laws,'' said Deborah Axt, a lawyer with Make the Road by Walking, an immigrant advocacy group in Bushwick. ''The violations seem epidemic.''
 Robert C. Smith, a sociologist at Baruch College, said recent interviews and surveys he conducted showed that half of New York's illegal immigrants were paid less than the minimum wage, partly because many are too scared to speak out. But many legal immigrants also face wage violations, and some say storeowners offer them less than the minimum wage if they do not speak passable English.
 It might seem odd that federal and state officials demand that employers pay the minimum wage to illegal immigrants. But officials say enforcing wage laws, even for those workers, is important to prevent the exploitation of any employees, legal or not, and to discourage employers from hiring illegal immigrants for cut-rate wages when jobs might have gone to Americans or legal immigrants at $7 or $8 an hour. In addition, wage enforcement helps deter off-the-books work that deprives the government of tax revenue. 
 Concerned about the high rate of wage violations, Make the Road by Walking and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union have adopted an unusual strategy. They are collecting information about violations from scores of workers on Knickerbocker Avenue. The two groups plan to confront storeowners with this evidence and give them a choice: either face a lawsuit or government action seeking maximum back pay, or agree to unionization and face a less aggressive push for back pay.
 Bushwick teems with newcomers from Mexico, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, and Knickerbocker Avenue, as with many immigrant-dominated retail strips, is characterized by low prices, low wages and shoppers with low incomes. At stores like National 99 Cent or Less, LaCasa Discount and Barato Variety, shoppers can find cans of Coke for 49 cents, flower-print bedspreads for $14.99 and pinstriped suits for $79.99.
 At Minimax, a discount store at 437 Knickerbocker, Sofia Campos said she earned $3.80 an hour until she was fired when she missed work one day because her daughter had a high fever. Other Minimax workers said they also were getting $3.8o an hour for 63 hours of work before the owners paid $65,000 last year to settle a lawsuit over wage violations. The workers said the store now paid the minimum wage. 
 Emilio Cortes said he received $320, or $4.38 an hour, for his 73-hour workweeks at S & S Farms before it reached a $28,000 settlement in March with the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Cortes said he was paid $6 an hour now.
 Morris Cohen, the owner of Minimax, did not respond to three phone messages, and Khubib Masoud, the manager of Super Star 99, declined to comment. The owner of Footco, the sneaker store, did not return two phone calls, but workers at the store refused to give their names because they feared they would be fired for complaining. A manager at Nuevo Mexico restaurant denied any wage violations. 
 Some storeowners acknowledged that the intense competition on Knickerbocker Avenue created pressure to flout wage laws to save money. 
 ''Some new people, they come, and they try to squeeze people,'' said Adelo Jreige, who has owned Adelo's Shoes for 20 years, making him a respected veteran on the ever-changing avenue. ''Rent is going crazy, and it's hard to operate, and people do what they can to manage.''
 Mr. Jreige said he complied with labor laws. ''I have people making $7 an hour, $6.50 and $5.75,'' he said, apparently unaware that on Jan. 1, New York's minimum wage rose to $6, from $5.15.
 Steve Kim, the manager of Morris Discounts, at 348 Knickerbocker, acknowledged that his store paid some workers $5 an hour in cash. ''If you make $6 on the books, wouldn't it be smarter to make $5 off the books?'' he said. ''Some people prefer to get cash. It's good, and they don't pay taxes.''
 The retail union and Make the Road by Walking say that a half century ago, half of Knickerbocker Avenue's stores were unionized, but that just two were now. The groups assert that unionization would be preferable to occasional back-pay settlements because it would mean long-term improvements in wages and benefits. 
 ''The State Department of Labor is completely overwhelmed and doesn't seem to have enough commitment or resources to do the job properly,'' said Andrew Friedman, a co-director of Make the Road by Walking. ''My sense is many folks are very scared to stand up and complain because they worry about losing their jobs and because they have a perception that the State Labor Department isn't interested in protecting the rights of immigrants.''
 Robert Lillpopp, the department's spokesman, said its investigators pursued complaints, regardless of a worker's immigration status. He noted that the agency recently expanded the mandate of its Apparel Industry Task Force to include many low-wage industries. 
 But Julia Ortiz, a Dominican immigrant, faulted the department's investigation of the discount store where she worked. In November, Ms. Ortiz and a coworker, Consuelo Echeverry, protested to the department, saying the store, Save Smart, paid them $35 for 11-hour workdays, equal to $3.18 an hour. Shortly after the state sent investigators to the store, Ms. Ortiz said, the manager fired her and Ms. Echeverry because he was angry that they had complained to the state. 
 Ms. Ortiz said that when she complained to the Labor Department that it had violated its promise to keep their names confidential, officials told her their identities had been divulged at the store owner's insistence. ''We felt totally betrayed,'' Ms. Ortiz said. 
 Ali Hamad, Save Smart's manager, declined to comment. Mr. Lillpopp said the investigators would not have disclosed the names because state regulations bar officials from revealing the identities of complaining workers while investigations are in progress. ''It didn't happen,'' he said, adding that the department was still investigating the store. 
 ''Sometimes it felt like we were working for nothing,'' Ms. Ortiz said. ''I don't know why we didn't leave. We were afraid that we would end up without jobs.''

HEADLINE: Dreaming of Cars in Armchair Comfort

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
Searching for a gift? If a car is out of the question, perhaps a book about cars is within reach. Here are some possibilities, just in time for Father's Day:

Automotive Atrocities
The Cars We Love to Hate
By Eric Peters
Illustrated. 128 pages. Motorbooks International. $19.95
 Though awful cars have existed throughout automotive history, Eric Peters focuses on recent eyesores of the highways, especially the rich decade following the energy shock of 1974. This era of downsizing, disco and double-knit leisure suits produced innovation borne of desperation and was an especially rich period for hateable vehicles. 
 Mr. Peters, described in the jacket blurb as an automotive columnist for America Online, Netscape and CompuServe, divides his losermobiles into three categories: fake muscle cars, loathsome luxury vehicles (think ''Corinthian leather'') and egregious economy cars. He recalls the greatest hits of ugly: American Motors' Gremlin and Pacer; the Ford Pinto and Mercury Zephyr; the Cadillac Cimarron and Pontiac Aztek from General Motors; and imports like the Yugo GV and Daihatsu Charade.
 The prose is sometimes as charmingly overstyled as the cars described. For example, he argues that ''there's no such thing as 'the elder statesman years' for a Gremlin.''
 Still, some of the ugly cars have become lovable, in a twisted way. Hating cars is part of loving them, as the book's subtitle suggests, and the real danger to car culture is designs that are merely unobjectionable. Many drivers today, scanning the parking lots at America's malls, might cry (as Mr. Peters does, in effect), ''Give us the ugly over the dull.'' PHIL PATTON

HEADLINE: Just Do Something

 BODY:
Next month could be a historic turning point for the more than 300 million Africans who live on less than a dollar a day. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has been busily lining up international support for his proposal to attack poverty in Africa by ramping up foreign aid. Serious studies commissioned by the British government and the United Nations have identified promising new paths toward economic and human development. The leading nations of Europe have pledged long-term financial support. Leading entertainers like Madonna, Bono, Will Smith and Elton John have announced a set of simultaneous concerts to take place in London, Rome, Berlin and Philadelphia to mobilize grass-roots enthusiasm. 
 Only one crucial element is still missing -- the wholehearted support of the United States government. Unless President Bush joins this effort in the five weeks remaining before the summit meeting to be held in July in Scotland, Africa's hopes will be disappointed and America's image in the eyes of a world that once looked to it for enlightened leadership will be further diminished. 
 Mr. Blair will be in Washington this week trying to persuade Mr. Bush to do the right thing. 
 This really should be a no-brainer. At a time when the image of the United States abroad is at rock bottom in many parts of the globe, President Bush could go a long way toward re-establishing the world's richest country as the moral leader it was in the last century. He can do that by supporting his most reliable international ally in this crucial effort and taking to heart the world's poorest and most wretched place.
 Two weeks ago, the European Union announced that its members would double their aid to poor countries by 2015. The announcement came after France, Britain and Germany -- all members of the G-8 -- had each laid out timetables for meeting the United Nations' target of increasing foreign assistance to poor countries to 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015. The European announcements further isolated the American government, which gives only 0.18 percent, and has remained mute about getting to 0.7 percent.
 Africans, after long years of accepting the rule of brutal and corrupt dictators, are finally dragging themselves to their feet to say, ''Enough.'' But there are two paths they can take. With help, African countries can take the route of development and progress, and finally enjoy lives that are about more than just scrounging day in and day out for food in one's stomach and shoes on one's feet. Without that help, those same countries can take the path that cycles back into civil war, poverty and life expectancies so low that 13-year-old girls are considered old women.

HEADLINE: Grounding a Pandemic

BYLINE: By Barack Obama and Richard Lugar. 
Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, is its chairman.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
WHEN we think of the major threats to our national security, the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation, rogue states and global terrorism. But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores, one from nature, not humans -- an avian flu pandemic. An outbreak could cause millions of deaths, destabilize Southeast Asia (its likely place of origin), and threaten the security of governments around the world. 
 Earlier this year, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the possibility of avian flu spreading from Southeast Asia ''a very ominous situation for the globe.'' A killer flu could spread around the world in days, crippling economies in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. From a public health standpoint, Dr. Gerberding said, an avian flu outbreak is ''the most important threat that we are facing right now.'' 
 International health experts say that two of the three conditions for an avian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia have already been met. First, a new strain of the virus, called A(H5N1), has emerged, and humans have little or no immunity to it. Second, this strain can jump between species. The only remaining obstacle is that A(H5N1) has not yet mutated into a form that is easily transmitted from human to human. 
 However, there have been some alarming developments. In recent months, the virus has been detected in mammals that have never previously been infected, including tigers, leopards and domestic cats. This spread suggests that the virus is mutating and could eventually emerge in a form that is readily transmittable among humans, leading to a full-blown pandemic. In fact, according to government officials, a few cases of human-to-human spread of A(H5N1) have already occurred. 
 The precedent that experts fear is the 1918 flu pandemic, which began in the American Midwest and swept the planet in the era before air travel, killing 20 million to 40 million people. As John M. Barry, author of ''The Great Influenza,'' has observed, ''Influenza killed more people in a year than the Black Death of the Middle Ages killed in a century; it killed more people in 24 weeks than AIDS has killed in 24 years.'' 
 At the moment, effective responses to an avian flu pandemic are limited and will come far too late for many people in Southeast Asia. Indeed, so far more than 60 percent of those diagnosed with the avian flu have died. There is no proven vaccine for the A(H5N1) strain and it could take months to produce a fully effective one. Moreover, while some antiviral treatments may help flu sufferers, they are not widely available and must be administered to patients within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. 
 It is essential for the international community, led by the United States, to take decisive action to prevent a pandemic. 
 So what should we do? Recently, the World Health Organization called for more money and attention to be devoted to effective preventive action, appealing for $100 million. 
 Congress responded promptly. A bipartisan group of senators obtained $25 million for prevention efforts (a quarter of the request, the traditional contribution of the United States), allowing the C.D.C., the Agency for International Development, the Health and Human Services Department and other agencies to improve their ability to act. 
 In addition, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved legislation directing President Bush to form a senior-level task force to put in place an international strategy to deal with the avian flu and coordinate policy among our government agencies. We urge the Bush administration to form this task force immediately without waiting for legislation to be passed. 
 But these are only modest first steps. International health experts believe that Southeast Asia will be an epicenter of influenza for decades. We recommend that this administration work with Congress, public health officials, the pharmaceutical industry, foreign governments and international organizations to create a permanent framework for curtailing the spread of future infectious diseases. 
 Among the parts of that framework could be these: 
 Increasing international disease surveillance, response capacity and public education and coordination, especially in Southeast Asia. 
 Stockpiling enough antiviral doses to cover high-risk populations and essential workers. 
 Ensuring that, here at home, Health and Human Services and state governments put in place plans that address issues of surveillance, medical care, drug and vaccine distribution, communication, protection of the work force and maintenance of core public functions in case of a pandemic. 
 Accelerating research into avian flu vaccines and antiviral drugs. 
 Establishing incentives to encourage nations to report flu outbreaks quickly and fully. 
 So far, A(H5N1) has not been found in the United States. But in an age when you can board planes in Bangkok or Hong Kong and arrive in Chicago, Indianapolis or New York in hours, we must face the reality that these exotic killer diseases are not isolated health problems half a world away, but direct and immediate threats to security and prosperity here at home.

HEADLINE: Britain Showing Signs of a Slowdown

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, June 6 

 BODY:
In grim procession, some of Britain's best-known retailers from Boots to Marks & Spencer -- have lined up recently to report or warn of lower profits. But these days, the gloom has an impact far beyond the dwindling profits from sales of digital cameras at Jessops or food at Sainsbury's. 
 The reduced profits, real and expected, may be signs of a significant slowdown in an economy that has distinguished itself from the sluggish ones in Continental Europe through reliable growth -- most of it driven by free-spending consumers. 
 ''There are signs of stress,'' said Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy here. ''There has been a sharp rise in personal bankruptcies and a rise in mortgage arrears and repossessions. You are starting to see some signs of trouble.'' 
 Just as this week's rejection by French and Dutch voters of a new European constitution will have different consequences for Britain and Continental Europe, Britain's economy is on a largely separate track from the economies of Europe. 
 If the slowdown in Britain does take hold, it would raise complex tensions; for instance, Britons' need to save for pensions versus the economy's hunger for spending to keep growing and the government's promises not to raise taxes set against a swelling budget for schools, hospitals and other public services.
 Above all, a slowdown would illustrate the stunning change in the British economy over the last decade -- a time when industrial jobs have been lost to the service industry, when retail spending has taken over as the engine of growth, when personal debt has soared and when the government, bucking its own advice to the rest of Europe, has made its spending a bigger proportion of the overall economy. 
 While public spending as a share of national wealth has remained static in Europe's big economies -- the European Union average is about 48 percent -- public spending in Britain, fueled by higher taxes, rose to about 41 percent last year from around 37 percent in 1999 and is likely to continue rising, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a private research group based here. 
 And at the core of Britain's economy lies a phenomenon more familiar to Americans than to Europeans -- a boom in real estate.
 For much of the late 1990's -- and particularly in the early 2000's as investors sought alternatives to falling stock markets -- soaring real estate prices encouraged Britons to embark on a collective spending spree, running up unheard-of debt on credit cards and mortgages, now totaling more than $:1 trillion ($1.83 trillion).
 This year, a commission appointed by the opposition Conservative Party and led by Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach, who was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher when she was prime minister, concluded that personal debt had become a problem for 15 million Britons. The commission blamed banks for making credit too easily available.
 ''The sheer scale of consumer debt has made millions of households extremely vulnerable to shocks in the economy, both from fiscal mismanagement and external factors such as oil price rises, acts of terrorism and wars,'' the report said. ''Debt is a time bomb which could be triggered by any number of shocks to the economy, at any time.''
 The credit-driven boom persuaded the Bank of England to raise interest rates from a low of 3 percent to 4.75 percent, their level for the last nine months. Now the higher rates are biting on the debt the spending has produced, turning spendthrifts, in some cases, into paupers.
 In one sign of the slowdown, the British Bankers' Association said that the number of mortgages initiated in February was down 35 percent from a year ago despite other signs that a slowdown in the housing market might be ending. Not only that, according to the British Retail Consortium, retail sales in April fell by 4.7 percent compared with April 2004. 
 The slide brought ''the most difficult trading conditions in living memory,'' said Kevin Hawkins, the director general of the consortium. Just last week, the Office for National Statistics said that the economy grew just 0.5 percent in the first quarter, the slowest in two years.
 The slowdown, said Ms. Redwood of Capital Economics, could well be prolonged ''given that it's a response to fundamental factors like a slowing housing market and high levels of debt.'' 
 In a service-driven, retail-fed economy, suddenly tight purse strings are not what the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, needs to meet the growth figures in his ambitious, third-term public spending plans for schools and hospitals. 
 Mr. Brown had forecast annual growth in the range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent in an economy that has grown consistently for more than 12 years -- before the Labor Party came to power in 1997. ''Let us remember when some are pessimistic, I am not,'' Mr. Brown said at a meeting of labor leaders two weeks ago. 
 But most economists, along with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, are expecting growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent, still healthy by Continental European standards. 
 If growth does not meet Mr. Brown's forecast, Ms. Redwood said, ''We think he will have to compensate by raising taxes as it becomes apparent that he has a black hole in his finances.'' 
 An economist at the Bank of America here, Lorenzo Codogno, said, ''Should the economy start slowing markedly, there will be some kind of shortfall in revenues, while on the spending side, you have a long-term commitment.''
 The most common forecast predicts that the Bank of England will begin to ease rates this summer or in the fall. Some economists are forecasting that the benchmark rate will decline to 4 percent by the end of this year, and fall further in 2006.
 With most of Europe's interest rates at 2 percent, however, the debate over the cost of borrowing -- like so much in the British economy -- shows just how distinct in economic terms Britain is compared with the Continent. Indeed, with the plan for a 25-nation European constitution now in trouble, the prospect of Britain's joining and adopting the euro as its currency looks even more remote than it did during the recent British election campaign. 
 At that time, both Mr. Brown and Prime Minister Tony Blair indicated that membership was unlikely for now because the British and Continental European economies were not on the same track. That trend is only likely to be reinforced by the stinging ''no'' votes in France and the Netherlands. 
 ''We've got a recession in Italy; we've got low growth in Germany; we've got a downturn in France,'' Mr. Brown said recently. ''Britain is continuing to grow.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about signs of a slowdown in the British economy misstated the timing of the French and Dutch votes that rejected the European Union constitution. They were last week, not this week.

HEADLINE: Europe Is Still Europe

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 6 

 BODY:
Does Europe have a soul? Would anybody die for Europe?
 Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, was asked those questions the other day by an American wondering whether the rejection of the European Union's constitution in France and the Netherlands last week meant that the European Union lacked a core, that it could never be to its citizens what the United States is to Americans.
 ''European soldiers,'' Mr. Fischer said, answering the question about who dies for Europe. European soldiers are facing danger in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo, he continued, speaking at a forum at the American Academy in Berlin. They are there as members of national contingents, but they are serving a wider interest -- Europe's. 
 ''There is a soul,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''There is a sprit. And people die for Europe, and have died.''
 To be sure, few experts are denying that the European Project, as an ever-higher integration and cooperation is called, is in a deep crisis.
 Its central element, many of those who follow European Union affairs say, is the failure of the organization to make the citizens of its member countries feel that the project belongs to them -- that it is accountable, and not controlled by unelected bureaucrats in the European capital, Brussels, who make rules about everything from how many Muslim immigrants Europe will have, to the length of window washers' ladders. 
 There is no doubt that on some important questions, most notably the negotiations on Turkey's membership, the ''no'' votes in France and the Netherlands will make agreement vastly more difficult, maybe impossible.
 But it would be premature to write the European Union's obituary or to declare it a failure. The plain fact is that there are numerous reasons to declare it a success.
 It has 25 member states, making it the world's largest single market, and will grow to 27 with the addition of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. It has 450 million citizens, a Parliament, a Convention on Human Rights that states must sign as a condition for membership. Most members share a common currency, the euro. While the European Union divided over the Iraq war, it has forged many common security policies and goals, from its joint military missions in Macedonia and Congo to the negotiations being carried out on its behalf by Britain, France and Germany with Iran about its nuclear program.
 There are, as Mark Leonard, director of foreign policy at the Center for European Reform in London, points out, about 80,000 pages of common European law, policed by the European Court of Justice, a final legal recourse that transcends national boundaries. 
 Some Europeans of course complain that all that law is exactly the problem -- that a third to a half of all national legislation now is forged in Brussels, not in the national capitals, and that some of that law regulates the way windows are washed in the canal houses of the Netherlands or the number of hours Welsh fisherman can spend at sea.
 But the fact that all member states have to abide by that law is the point; Europe enters into everyday life in a major way, and like it or not, that is not about to change.
 ''It's 50 years old, this month,'' John Palmer, political director of the European Policy Center in Brussels, said in an interview on Monday, referring to the agreement in Messina, Italy, in 1955, when the six founding European Union countries declared the intention of creating a common market for Europe. ''It's gone far too far for it to be reversed.''
 Measured by the mood in France and the Netherlands, the sense is that the European Union's momentum has ground to a halt. European heads of state will meet in an emergency session in Brussels next week to try to decide how to get the machine in motion again.
 But measured against European history, European integration is a remarkable accomplishment, helping to transform a large war-torn, politically afflicted and economically divided region into an immense international club where war has become unthinkable. It has done so, not by eliminating nationalism, but by changing it.
 ''People aren't less patriotic,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''National identities haven't waned at all. If anything, they've become stronger. But the E.U. has changed the nature of nationalism within Europe, so it's no longer about fighting wars with each other, but managing diversity peacefully.
 Over the weekend, even the strenuously neutral Swiss, not European Union members, voted to get a lot closer by becoming what is called a Schengen country, after an agreement in 1985 in Schengen, Luxembourg, that eliminated border formalities among 15 countries, all of them except Norway in the European Union.
 In other words, at a time when the Dutch and the French are worried that the European Union means uncontrolled and unwanted immigration -- because anybody getting in to one member country essentially gains admission to them all -- the Swiss decided that becoming a sort of ex-officio member of the club was worth the risk.
 Moreover, every member country has had groups all along that are convinced the European Union is not worth the price or the effort -- because it is too regulatory, or that it crushes the national identity of the smaller countries, or that it cedes control to its big members, especially Germany and France. But it is unlikely that majorities in any of the member states would forgo membership altogether.
 As Mr. Fischer put this in his remarks at the American Academy, in his view, if the French had faced a situation where a ''no'' vote on the constitution would have meant getting out of the European Union altogether, the constitution would have won by a big margin.

HEADLINE: Social Security: Migrants Offer Numbers for Fee

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: TLALCHAPA, Mexico 

 BODY:
Gerardo Luviano is looking for somebody to rent his Social Security number.
 Mr. Luviano, 39, obtained legal residence in the United States almost 20 years ago. But these days, back in Mexico, teaching beekeeping at the local high school in this hot, dusty town in the southwestern part of the country, Mr. Luviano is not using his Social Security number. So he is looking for an illegal immigrant in the United States to use it for him -- providing a little cash along the way.
 ''I've almost managed to contact somebody to lend my number to,'' Mr. Luviano said. ''My brother in California has a friend who has crops and has people that need one.'' 
 Mr. Luviano's pending transaction is merely a blip in a shadowy yet vibrant underground market. Virtually undetected by American authorities, operating below the radar in immigrant communities from coast to coast, a secondary trade in identities has emerged straddling both sides of the Mexico-United States border. 
 ''It is seen as a normal thing to do,'' said Luis Magana, an immigrant-rights activist assisting farm workers in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley of California.
 The number of people participating in the illegal deals is impossible to determine accurately. But it is clearly significant, flourishing despite efforts to combat identity fraud.
 Hundreds of thousands of immigrants who cross the border from Mexico illegally each year need to procure a legal identity that will allow them to work in the United States. Many legal immigrants, whether living in the United States or back in Mexico, are happy to provide them: as they pad their earnings by letting illegal immigrants work under their name and number, they also enhance their own unemployment and pension benefits. And sometimes they charge for the favor.
 Martin Mora, a former migrant to the United States who these days is a local politician preparing to run for a seat in the state legislature in next October's elections, said that in just one town in the Tlalchapa municipality, ''of about 1,000 that fixed their papers in the United States there might be 50 that are here and lending their number.'' 
 Demand for American identities has blossomed in the cracks between the nation's increasingly unwelcoming immigration laws and businesses' unremitting demand for low-wage labor. 
 In 1986, when the Immigration Reform and Control Act started penalizing employers who knowingly hired illegal immigrants, most employers started requiring immigrants to provide the paperwork -- including a Social Security number -- to prove their eligibility to work. 
 The new law did not stop unauthorized immigrant work. An estimated 10 million illegal immigrants live in the United States today, up from some 4 million before the law went into effect. But it did create a thriving market for fake documents. 
 These days, most immigrants working unlawfully buy a document combo for $100 to $200 that includes a fake green card and fake Social Security card with a nine-digit number plucked out of thin air. ''They'll make it for you right there at the flea market,'' said David Blanco, an illegal immigrant from Costa Rica who works as an auto mechanic in Stockton, Calif.
 This process has one big drawback, however. Each year, Social Security receives millions of W-2 earning statements with names or numbers that do not match its records. Nine million poured in for 2002, many of them just simple mistakes. In response the agency sends hundreds of thousands of letters asking employers to correct the information. These letters can provoke the firing of the offending worker.
 Working with a name linked to a number recognized by Social Security -- even if it is just borrowed or leased -- avoids these pitfalls. ''It's the safest way,'' said Mario Avalos, a Stockton accountant who every year does tax returns for dozens of illegal immigrants. ''If you are going to work in a company with strict requirements, you know they won't let you in without good papers.''
 While renting Social Security numbers makes up a small portion of the overall use of false papers, those with close ties to the immigrant communities say it is increasingly popular. ''It used to be that people here offered their number for somebody to work it,'' said Mr. Mora in Tlalchapa. ''Now people over there are asking people here if they can use their number.''
 Since legal American residents can lose their green cards if they stay outside the country too long, for those who have returned to Mexico it is useful to have somebody working under their identity north of the border. 
 ''There are people who live in Mexico who take $4,000 or $5,000 in unemployment in the off season,'' said Jorge Eguiluz, a labor contractor working in the fields around Stockton, Calif. ''They just lend the number during the season.''
 The deals also generate cash in other ways. Most identity lending happens within an extended family, or among immigrants from the same hometown. But it is still a hard-nosed transaction. Illegal immigrant workers usually earn so little they are owed an income tax refund at the end of the year. The illegal immigrant ''working the number'' will usually pay the real owner by sharing the tax refund. 
 ''Sometimes the one who is working doesn't mind giving all the refund, he just wants to work,'' said Fernando Rosales, who runs a shop preparing income taxes in the immigrant-rich enclave of Huntington Park, Calif. ''But others don't, and sometimes they fight over it. We see that all the time. It's the talk of the place during income tax time.''
 Done skillfully, the underground transactions are virtually undetectable. They do not ring any bells at the Social Security Administration. Nor do they set off alarms at the Internal Revenue Service as long as the person who lends the number keeps track of the W-2's and files the proper income tax returns. 
 In a written response to questions, the audit office of Social Security's inspector general acknowledged that ''as long as the name and S.S.N. on an incoming wage item (i.e., W-2) matches S.S.A.'s record'' the agency will not detect any irregularity.
 The response noted that the agency had no statistics on the use of Social Security numbers by illegal immigrants. It does not even know how many of the incorrect earnings reports it receives every year come from immigrants working unlawfully, though immigration experts estimate that most do. 
 Meanwhile, with the Homeland Security Department focused on terrorism threats, it has virtually stopped policing the workplace for run-of-the-mill work violations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested only 450 illegal immigrants in the workplace in 2003, down from 14,000 in 1998.
 ''We have seen identity fraud,'' said John Torres, deputy assistant director for investigations. But ''I haven't heard of the renting of identities.'' 
 Immigrants on both sides of the transactions are understandably reluctant to talk about their participation.
 A 49-year-old illegal immigrant from Michoacan who earns $8.16 an hour at a waffle factory in Torrance, Calif., said that she had been using a Social Security number she borrowed from a friend in Mexico since she crossed illegally into the United States 15 years ago. ''She hasn't come back in this time,'' the woman said.
 There are risks involved in letting one's identity be used by someone else, though, as Mr. Luviano, the beekeeping instructor, learned through experience.
 Mr. Luviano got his green card by a combination of luck and guile. He says he was on a short trip to visit his brother in California when the 1986 immigration law went into effect and the United States offered amnesty to millions of unauthorized workers.
 Three million illegal immigrants, 2.3 million of them from Mexico, ultimately received residence papers. Mr. Luviano, who qualified when a farmer wrote a letter avowing he had worked for months in his fields, was one. Once he had his papers, though, he returned to Tlalchapa.
 He has entered the United States several times since then, mostly to renew his green card. But in the early 1990's, concerned that long absences could put his green card at risk and spurred by the chance to make a little extra money, he lent his Social Security number to his brother's friend. ''I kept almost all the income tax refund,'' Mr. Luviano said. 
 Mr. Luviano decided to pull the plug on the arrangement, however, when bills for purchases he had not made started arriving in his name at his brother's address. ''You lend your number in good faith and you can get yourself in trouble,'' he said.
 But Mr. Luviano is itching to do it again anyway. He knows that Social Security could provide retirement income down the line. And there's always the tax refund.
 ''I haven't profited as much as I could from those documents,'' he said ruefully.

HEADLINE: 2 Police Officers Assassinated in Separate Attacks; U.S. and Iraqi Forces Press Insurgents

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; An Iraqi employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Mosul for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 6 

 BODY:
Two Iraqi police officials have been shot to death in Baghdad and a family has been killed in a mortar attack in northern Iraq, Iraqi officials said Monday, as a relative lull in insurgent attacks stretched into a second day. 
 Attacks on Sunday and Monday have left a handful of people dead, far fewer than have been killed in daily attacks during the past month, and came as Iraqi and American forces continued to bear down on insurgents in Sunni Arab areas south and west of Baghdad that are friendly to insurgents.
 The bloodshed included two assassinations, an increasingly common method of attack as insurgents try to intimidate Iraq's public officials and its professional class. 
 The first happened about 10:30 p.m. on Sunday in central Baghdad, when attackers gunned down Lt. Maj. Mazin Muhammad of the Interior Ministry. Then, on Monday, gunmen shot and killed Capt. Rafid Fadil, a police officer in charge of security at a court in the neighborhood of Karada, in central Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. 
 Such killings are often effective in frightening officials. In Mahmudiya, a farm town just south of Baghdad where American and Iraqi forces have focused most of their efforts against insurgents in recent days, the town's police chief said he was considering moving his family out of Iraq after insurgents attacked his house and killed his cousin. In the same town, an Iraqi Army commander, Gen. Muhammad Issa Bhaear, moved his family to Lebanon after insurgents killed his two teenage sons and attacked his houses.
 In search operations south of Baghdad, the American military said it had destroyed another underground bunker and weapons storage facility used by insurgents near the town of Yusifiya, less than a week after soldiers found a huge bunker network in Anbar Province. 
 The searches were part of a broader effort by Iraqi authorities in which thousands of American and Iraqi troops have been looking for insurgents in Baghdad and the surrounding areas. On Monday, the Defense Ministry announced some recent success in that offensive, reporting that 887 people had been detained in raids that began May 22, and that more than 190 checkpoints had been installed.
 Civilians were among the victims when insurgents fired mortars at a police station in the northern city of Mosul, also hitting a nearby car with a family inside, a witness said. At least one police officer was killed, as were several members of the family. Agence France-Presse reported that six people, including two children, were killed in the attack. 
 Iraqis, particularly civilians, have died by the hundreds as insurgents have intensified their attacks in the five weeks since the Shiite-led government took power. 
 Al Qaeda in Iraq, the group associated with the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for some of the recent attacks, including one that it said it carried out on Iraqi police recruits returning from Jordan by bus. The attack was not confirmed. 
 Insurgents also detonated two car bombs, in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown, and in Haswa, near Hilla, the capital of Babil Province, south of Baghdad, but no one was killed in either explosion. A third bomb exploded near the commando unit of the Ministry of the Interior, wounding seven police commandos, officials said.
 An American soldier was killed on Sunday when his vehicle hit a land mine near the northern city of Kirkuk, the American military said Monday in a statement. 
 In a welcome relief to Baghdad residents who have been suffering from long power failures in recent weeks, the American military announced that it had completed eight months of work at a power plant just outside Baghdad and that the improvements added 90 megawatts of electricity to the Baghdad power grid. 
 Iraq's minister of electricity, Muhsin Shlash, said last month that Baghdad's power grid produces about 1,000 megawatts less than the city needs. The grid fell into disrepair from the time of economic penalties in the 1990's and now is plagued by theft and other sabotage. 
 In an unconfirmed report from Iraqi authorities, a driver in the Directorate of Roads and Bridges, Shallal Jnedel, was shot to death by American troops in the northern Baghdad suburb of Baab Asham as he drove to work shortly after 8 a.m. on Monday. A spokesman for the 42nd Infantry Division, the American unit that covers the area, said he had no information about the shooting.

HEADLINE: School Policy In New Jersey To Take Junk Off Lunch Tray

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLL

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE, N.J., June 6 

 BODY:
New Jersey students will soon say goodbye to soda and other lunchtime junk foods under a new school nutrition policy announced Monday by Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey.
 The policy, which will take effect on Sept. 1, 2007, will apply to all public schools and private schools that provide federally financed meals and cover students from pre-kindergarten to high school. New Jersey is the latest of a handful of states to limit or ban foods considered minimally nutritious. 
 Mr. Codey made the announcement at South Orange Middle School, one of several schools in the state that already prohibit junk foods. He noted that of New Jersey's 1.4 million students, roughly 20 percent were obese and that another 18 percent were overweight and faced added risks for diabetes, heart disease and even depression. The new rules, he said, will ''give our children a head start on a longer, healthier and more enjoyable life.''
 The Codey administration is putting the new rules into effect by revising the state's school nutrition guidelines and thus avoids the need for legislative approval. In Connecticut, the Legislature recently approved its own junk food ban, but exempted diet sodas and sports drinks in high schools after hours. The legislation now goes to Gov. M. Jodi Rell.
 Under the New Jersey plan, soda, candy and foods listing sugar as the first or principal ingredient will be banned from school cafeterias. Snacks and drinks with more than eight grams of total fat per serving and two grams of saturated fat will be banned, and cafeterias will have to restrict amounts of foods with trans fats.
 The only beverages that can be served in amounts of 12 ounces or more will be water or milk with 2 percent fat or less.
 In lesser amounts, elementary schools will be restricted to water, milk or 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice. In middle and high schools, at least 60 percent of the beverages offered, in addition to milk and water, must be 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice. Soda will still be prohibited, but sports drinks and bottled iced teas will be available.
 The policy applies to all vending machines, school stores and snack bars, a la carte lines, fund-raisers during the school day, and after-school programs. There are exceptions for special events, like a classroom pizza party.
 School districts must agree on a nutrition plan by Sept. 1, 2006, and put it into effect by Sept. 1, 2007. Schools that do not adopt the nutrition guidelines face the loss of state and federal financing, said Kathy F. Kuser, director of food and nutrition for the New Jersey Department of Agriculture. 
 Joy Johanson, senior policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C., said that New Jersey was taking a significant step toward promoting nutrition.
 ''We hope that other states will follow suit,'' she said. 
 But not everyone is happy with the changes. 
 ''I think it's whack,'' Malcolm Jones, 13, an eighth grader at South Orange Middle School, said while munching on a baked chicken patty sandwich. A carrot stick sat untouched on his plate. ''They took away French fries, pizza, all the good stuff. A lot of students aren't happy.''
 In the middle school's cafeteria, many vegetables, like corn on the cob and celery sticks, were discarded in trash bins.
 Robert Earl, senior director of nutrition policy for the Food Products Association in Washington, D.C., said there were flaws with the plan because it excluded many foods that children want and need as part of a whole diet.
 ''Things like cheeses, nuts, peanut butter, flavored milks and normal foods that are part of a healthful diet could be excluded,'' Mr. Earl said. ''It seems like the better objective is perhaps having a lot of variety instead of restrictions.''
 Education officials also expressed reservations with the plan, among them the potential loss of revenue that soda vending machines can bring to school districts. 
 ''There are some that really rely on that extra income,'' said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman with the New Jersey School Boards Association.
 But over all, Mr. Belluscio said, the plan could help in the classroom. He said teachers had reported that students were less likely to misbehave and more likely to pay attention in class after having a nutritious meal. 
 State officials said schools probably would not suffer economically because soft drink companies would be able to replace their carbonated sodas with their own bottled water and fruit juices.

HEADLINE: In County Made Rich by Golf, Some Enclaves Are Left Behind

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: PINEHURST, N.C., June 2 

 BODY:
Golf has made Moore County rich. There are spas, country clubs and new $2 million homes. The United States Open, to be held later this month on the most famous of the county's 43 golf courses, is expected to bring $124 million to the state.
 But as developers rush to provide ''resort quality'' amenities in the newest subdivisions, some neighborhoods have been left behind -- without sewers, police service, garbage pickup or even, in some cases, piped water.
 These enclaves, Jackson Hamlet, Midway and Waynor Road, are virtually all black. They butt up against, or are even completely surrounded by, affluent towns that are mostly white: Pinehurst, Aberdeen and Southern Pines. 
 The 500 residents of these unincorporated enclaves are close enough to point out sewer lines that run past their properties en route to new developments, or to watch garbage trucks trundle past without stopping. 
 Though the towns have not annexed these hamlets about 60 miles southwest of Raleigh, and their residents cannot vote in municipal elections, they are subject to the towns' land use and zoning rules under what is called extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
 When asked about extending basic services, the towns' officials say they must take care of those within their existing boundaries before taking on new neighborhoods. The county, on the other hand, says that many of its rural constituents do not have the services the enclaves are requesting, and that the problems of these more densely populated areas can be better addressed by towns.
 Excluding heavily minority areas from town boundaries is a common but little examined practice, particularly in small towns in the South, civil rights advocates and geographers say. With the U.S. Open beginning on June 16 on the Pinehurst No. 2 golf course, residents of the three black neighborhoods and their advocates are making a concerted effort for the first time to win more services, holding news conferences and giving tours. 
 Historically, they are the very people who provided much of the labor that built the hotels in the Sandhills, as the area is known, tended the greens at the golf courses or worked on the all-black crew of caddies, long since replaced by electric carts.
 Ida Mae Murchison lives in Jackson Hamlet, a shady neighborhood of dirt roads hemmed in by Aberdeen and Pinehurst but claimed by neither. On one corner, a new apartment complex juts in; it was annexed by Pinehurst, which often expands to include areas where a developer has already paid for the infrastructure. At the rear, a place once called Buckety Ford, where Jackson Hamlet children fetched water, has been dammed to create a 200-acre lake surrounded by houses, also part of Pinehurst.
 ''I get the feeling that we're just forgotten, put on the shelf or the back burner or something,'' Ms. Murchison said. ''But like I say, I don't want to offend anyone. I don't want to cause trouble.''
 Ms. Murchison was the first black chambermaid at the Carolina Inn, the gracious centerpiece of the 110-year-old Pinehurst resort, where she worked for nearly 50 years. Now 84 and retired, she lives alone, worrying because there are no police officers for her to call in case of trouble. Despite two nearby municipal police forces, her neighborhood is the responsibility of the county sheriff -- whose deputies, she says, take at least 10 minutes to appear.
 In Midway, a black community almost surrounded by Aberdeen, the yards are teeming with flowers, grapevines, statues and birdbaths. But the languid perfume of honeysuckle is punctuated by an equally heavy stench of raw sewage.
 Randy Thomas, a food service manager at the Department of Corrections who has just adopted four young children, said he had to haul in sand every two months to cover the septic system leaks that trickle down his driveway. 
 Mr. Thomas's neighbor James McDougal said his mother had to move out of her house down the street when she got too old to use the outhouse. The county will not allow a septic tank because the lot is too small, Mr. McDougal said.
 County Commissioner Michael Holden says the residents' request for services puts the county in a ''delicate situation,'' in part because of competing demands for resources.
 ''I will admit Moore County waited way too long and should have been doing this stuff 20, 25 years ago,'' Mr. Holden said, pointing out that in the past 10 years the county has used grant money to extend water or sewer service to some minority communities. But, he added, ''It's a matter of biting it off little by little, and doing chunks of it and moving forward.''
 In 2000, the state allotted a federal development grant to pay for water and sewer lines for a black enclave called Monroe Town. Every well there was substandard; county officials found a dead possum in one. But Monroe Town, which lies inside the subdivision that surrounds the Pinehurst No. 6 golf course, remains unincorporated and lacks other services, like garbage pickup.
 Without a grant, the county is disinclined to pay for infrastructure for the enclaves. Those seeking services are quick to point out that the county ranks 18th out of 100 in the state in median income, even though it has no major urban center, and that its tax burden is low, with a rate in the bottom 10 percent. In the past 10 years, the county's property tax revenue has more than doubled, and it ended the 2004 fiscal year with a $9.3 million surplus. 
 Asked if the county could just pay outright for the pipes and other necessities (one estimate is that it would cost $1.5 million to $1.75 million to establish sewer services for Jackson Hamlet), Mr. Holden said, ''Then where do you stop?''
 Officials also say that these enclaves have been wary of annexation in the past, fearful of the higher taxes that come with being part of a municipality or of the potential destruction of their communities by developers.
 ''Some of the ones who are really pushing all this don't have everybody on board like they would like you to think,'' said Bill Zell, the town manager of Aberdeen.
 Once services are established, the costs seem modest. A family in Jackson Hamlet that pays $270.96 a year in property taxes now, on a $50,000 home, would pay $382.56 if annexed by Pinehurst and $452.64 if annexed by Aberdeen. According to figures provided by the University of North Carolina Center for Civil Rights, which is helping the black communities, the actual cost to these families could decrease because they would no longer pay for septic tank maintenance, private garbage pickup and other expenses that their municipal taxes would cover. 
 Andy Wilkison, the town manager of Pinehurst, said Jackson Hamlet and Monroe Town declined to consider being annexed in 1990 and 1991, respectively, in part to avoid higher taxes. ''I know what the maps look like and stuff,'' Mr. Wilkison said, ''but the annexations have largely been places where people have come to us wanting to be annexed.''
 Waynor Road, which has neither sewer nor water service, is seeking annexation by Southern Pines, and the town is studying the economics of such a move. To officials, town boundaries are not a matter of race but money. Parcels are annexed after a developer pays for sewer and water hookups or if the area's tax base is likely to generate enough revenue to pay for itself.
 When Frank Quis, the mayor of Southern Pines, was asked about racial exclusion, he said: ''Are you telling me everyone on Waynor Road is of a certain race? I mean, that's kind of odd.''
 But Anita S. Earls, a lawyer with the University of North Carolina Center for Civil Rights, said that even if officials were not motivated by racism, historic racial inequities were part of the equation. ''We have not found a densely populated, small lot size, poor white community on the edge of a town,'' Ms. Earls said.
 The exclusion of minority neighborhoods, sometimes called municipal underbounding, occurs across the country. In Modesto, Calif., Hispanics have exchanged visits with the Moore County residents and are suing for services. In 2003, a black community outside Zanesville, Ohio, got tap water after filing a civil rights complaint. But civil rights advocates say it is most prevalent in small towns across the South. 
 ''I don't think it happens even in larger cities in North Carolina because the political dynamics are so different,'' said Allan Parnell, the vice president of the Cedar Grove Institute for Sustainable Communities in Mebane, N.C., which did a study of racial exclusion by North Carolina towns. ''In larger towns there may be a larger black population that has some say in running the community.'' 
 Underbounding denies blacks political power while putting them at the mercy of politicians who do not represent them, Ms. Earls said. All of the Moore County Commissioners, elected at large, are white, and black officials, elected or appointed, are scarce in the three towns. 
 Several elected officials said the lack of diversity in government was not an issue because they treated their constituents equally.
 ''Honey, I work with blacks and I love to work with the blacks,'' said Virginia Saunders, in her 10th year as a county commissioner. ''I wish you could talk to some of the black people that I have helped.'' 
 But Maurice B. Holland Sr., who lives in Midway and is the only black member of the Aberdeen planning board, had a different view.
 ''There's no one in power to address the issues of the black community,'' Mr. Holland said. ''The attitude seems to be, 'We know what's good for you.'''

HEADLINE: In Manhattan, Apartments Still Selling at Record Highs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Look, up in the air! Is it a bubble? Is it froth? It's Manhattan real estate prices.
 But if there is kryptonite out there that could bring the gravity-defying housing market crashing to earth, it has not surfaced yet, as sales prices for apartments hit new highs last month.
 The median price for all sales in Manhattan that closed last month was $750,000, which was 23 percent higher than the median price for May 2004, according to a monthly market report prepared by Halstead Property, a real estate brokerage. 
 The average price also reached a new high, at $1,276,202, which was 34 percent higher than the average price the same month a year ago. The report is based on 674 sales of co-ops and condos. 
 Sales in May were generally the product of contracts signed two or three months earlier, so the figures most accurately reflect market conditions in the first few months of the year. 
 But the report also showed that last month, the extremely tight supply of apartments for sale in some neighborhoods, like the Upper West Side, may have begun to ease. 
 ''If we look at the conditions going on in the last couple of months, they were very favorable to price appreciation,'' said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead. He said that large end-of-the-year Wall Street bonuses, low interest rates and the small number of apartments on the market helped fuel high prices in the first half of the year. 
 ''I think we don't expect prices to continue to rise at this pace, however, we don't see a bubble bursting either,'' he said. ''I don't recall a real estate bubble ever bursting that wasn't preceded by bad economic conditions or some dramatic shock, and nobody is predicting any of that right now.''
 On the Upper West Side, according to the report, apartment listings fell 2 percent compared with the listings for May 2004. But that was a significant change from April, when new listings were down 14 percent from the previous year, and in March, when they were 26 percent lower. 
 New listings for smaller apartments dropped most sharply on the Upper West Side. There were 45 new listings for studios in the neighborhood in May, compared with 57 the year before, a drop of 21 percent.
 In April, 36 studios became available on the Upper West Side. There were 116 new listings for one-bedroom apartments in the neighborhood in May, compared with 128 new listings in the same month in 2004, a 9 percent decrease. 
 Across town, new listings on the Upper East Side were down 8 percent in May, which was lower than the new listings in May 2004. But that is less extreme than the 16 percent drop in new inventory in April. 
 As real estate prices continue to reach new heights, concern has risen that there might be a bubble in the market that could pop and lead to a crash in home values. Last month, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, helped stoke fears by saying that some metropolitan areas were showing signs of ''froth'' in the real estate market, referring to some local markets that have had high increases in prices. 
 However, many professionals in the New York market predict a more gradual change. 
 ''The interesting thing we're seeing is, it's a very stable, brisk market,'' said Steven B. Schnall, the president of the New York Mortgage Company, a mortgage lender. Mr. Schnall pointed to continued low interest rates as the most important factor in the market.
 ''I don't see prices continuing to skyrocket,'' he said. ''They've reached a very high level and this almost appears to be a new normal, and interest rates are helping that.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Professor Is Called Terrorist Leader

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., June 6 

 BODY:
A federal prosecutor charged Monday that Sami al-Arian, a fired Florida professor who was a well-known and outspoken advocate for Palestinian issues, lived a double life for more than a decade as the American leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, ''one of the most deadly terror organizations on earth.''
 But at the start of Mr. Arian's trial here on terrorism charges, his defense lawyer countered that the case should be seen as essentially a debate over the First Amendment and Mr. Arian's vociferous anti-Israel positions. 
 ''The outstanding feature in this case is freedom of speech,'' the defense lawyer, William Moffitt, told jurors. ''Dr. Al-Arian's right to speak, your right to hear him, and the ability of the powerful to silence him.''
 The conflicting portraits of Mr. Arian came as the two sides gave their opening statements in United States District Court here in a trial that is expected to last at least six months. Mr. Arian and three defendants who are being tried with him face terrorism and racketeering charges. Prosecutors say they raised money and helped to organize operations for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group based in Syria that is blamed for the deaths of more than 100 people in Israel. The case is one of the Bush administration's most significant terrorism prosecutions since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Mr. Arian, whose pro-Palestinian activities have been investigated by American intelligence officials since 1991, became a controversial figure in Florida in the mid-1990's after making sometimes incendiary statements on the Palestinian issue, including using slogans like ''death to Israel.'' Weeks after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the University of South Florida suspended him because of remarks he made on Fox News, and after a lengthy debate, fired him in 2003 after his indictment. 
 An anonymous jury is hearing the case, and the marshals service erected yellow barricades around the perimeter of the courthouse for the start of the trial, prompting concerns from defense lawyers, who said the heightened security measures could prejudice the jury against their clients.
 About a dozen supporters of Mr. Arian's held a rally in his defense over the lunch break, as his wife, Nahla al-Arian, hailed him as ''a good man, a courageous man.'' A few yards away, an Israeli woman, Yaffa Elharar, who flew to Florida for the start of the trial, stood quietly holding an enlarged photograph of her 18-year-old daughter, who was killed in a 1994 attack that Palestinian Islamic Jihad was blamed for. 
 In a three-and-a-half-hour opening statement outlining the government's case, Walter E. Furr III, an assistant United States attorney in Tampa, provided new details about what he described as ''economic jihad'' by Mr. Arian and ''an elitist group of intellectuals'' with whom he was associated in Tampa. Mr. Furr said the government would show that in a three-year period in the early 1990's, the Tampa group received some $1.8 million from overseas to finance its support for terrorist operations.
 Mr. Arian, who was born in Kuwait, became a computer engineering professor at South Florida in 1986 and started a research group and other organizations dedicated to the Palestinian cause. But Mr. Furr maintained that the groups were essentially fronts for a more militant agenda devoted to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and that Mr. Arian served as the group's American leader and, for a time in the 1990's, was ''maybe the most powerful man in the world for the organization.'' 
 Mr. Furr acknowledged that the government's long-running investigation produced no evidence linking Mr. Arian or his associates directly to the execution of any terrorist attack in Israel or the occupied territories.
 ''Other people did that,'' Mr. Furr said. ''They ran the organization to make that happen.''
 The prosecutor said the Tampa group's role in Palestinian Islamic Jihad was three-fold: to help organize the group's structure and operations, to publicize attacks to try to extort concessions from the Israelis, and to raise money ''so they could kill more people.''
 The opening of the government's case also shone a light on usually secret efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Using secret warrants, the government in 1993 began monitoring Mr. Arian's communications, taping some 470,000 phone calls. Much of that information was not shared with criminal prosecutors until 2002, however, and Justice Department officials now credit the law known as the USA Patriot Act for breaking down the wall that had hindered the sharing of such information.
 Mr. Moffitt, the defense lawyer for Mr. Arian, challenged central parts of the government's claims in often sarcastic terms on Monday, questioning how a man now seen as so dangerous was allowed to remain free for more than a decade under government monitoring. 
 As an influential Muslim leader, Mr. Arian was active in politics, and he met with President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, whom he supported in the 2000 election. 
 Saying the defendant had access to the White House and senior officials throughout the government, Mr. Moffitt questioned whether ''anyone ever really thought that Dr. Al-Arian represented a violent threat to the United States.''
 Mr. Moffitt suggested that Mr. Arian's arrest was driven more by pro-Israeli politics and post-Sept. 11 pressures than by the evidence.

HEADLINE: Crushing Upward Mobility

 BODY:
The United States is rapidly abandoning a longstanding policy aimed at keeping college affordable for all Americans who qualify academically. Thanks to a steep decline in aid to poor and working-class students and lagging state support for the public college systems that grant more than two-thirds of the nation's degrees, record numbers of Americans are being priced out of higher education. This is an ominous trend, given that the diploma has become the minimum price of admission to the new economy. 
 Greg Winter of The Times reported yesterday that the federal government has rejiggered the formula that determines how much families have to pay out of pocket before they become eligible for the student aid package, which consists of grants and low-interest loans. The new formula, which will save the government about $300 million in federal aid under the Pell program, will cause some lower-income students to lose federal grants entirely. The families of others will have to put up more money before they can qualify for financial aid. Perversely, single-parent households will have to pay more than two-parent households before they become eligible. 
 The federal Pell Grant program, which is aimed at making college possible for poor and working-class students, has fallen to a small fraction of its former value. The states, meanwhile, have trimmed aid to public colleges, partly as a consequence of soaring Medicaid costs. The states have deepened the problem by shifting need-based tuition to middle-class and upper-class students under the guise of handing out so-called merit scholarships. 
 The political clamor around the new formula is likely to lead to changes, but they will be aimed at upper-income families who are most able to pay. Tinkering with formulas in Washington will not solve this problem. The nation as a whole has been disinvesting in higher education at a time when college has become crucial to work force participation and to the nation's ability to meet the challenges of global economic competition. 
 Until the country renews its commitment to making college affordable for everyone, the American dream of upward mobility through education will be in danger of dying out.

HEADLINE: Another Big Idea Brought Down by Politics

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
The death of the West Side stadium underscores the excruciatingly difficult process that almost every ambitious civic project in New York City faces from inception, calling into question whether anyone can build big in New York anymore.
 The city once had a reputation for pulling off daunting municipal projects: creating a huge watershed upstate to ensure its water supply, building the bridges that awed other cities, constructing vast public housing complexes and highway systems in the age of Robert Moses, the master planner.
 But since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, when the city lost most of its fiscal autonomy to the state, the will of City Hall has often been thwarted by the desires of lawmakers in Albany, who control public financing for most large projects in the city. 
 During roughly the same period, federal and state environmental laws have increasingly created hurdles for major projects, and community groups have used those laws to kill or delay, often for parochial interests, all sorts of projects under the guise of environmental review. 
 As a result, major projects ranging from the giant housing complex called Battery Park City, to the Westway highway project to the proposed Second Avenue subway line, to rail links to the airport, to the restoration of Pennsylvania Station, and perhaps most tellingly, the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, have all faced tortuous paths. 
 Often, they never happen at all, as was the case of Westway, which fell to concerns about its impact on striped bass in the Hudson River.
 The frustration of many elected officials and business leaders was echoed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in an interview shortly before his death in 2003: ''New York was always singular for the dynamism with which the Brooklyn Bridge went up and skyscrapers went up and roads were built,'' he said. ''Then, in the 1970's, civic reputation began to be acquired by people who prevented things from happening. There are some things you shouldn't do, but many things now get stopped for no reason.'' 
 Many of the land use and environmental review processes stemmed from the public outcry during the middle of the 20th century when Robert Moses's highway and bridge projects destroyed neighborhoods and became reality despite community opposition. 
 But now, projects also fall victim to the horse trading in Albany, where leaders freely exercise their substantial oversight over how public money is spent in New York City.
 This view was articulated by Senator Charles E. Schumer in a recent speech to business leaders. ''A culture of inertia has set in,'' he said. ''Criticism predominates over construction; critics are given more weight than those trying to build. It doesn't matter how small a constituency or flawed an argument the critic possesses.
 ''He or she always seems to predominate in political circles, in the news media, and in the public debate.''
 Indeed the Bloomberg administration's central error may have been trying to bypass the State Legislature altogether. Several people involved in the process said that Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff calculated from the beginning that the city and the Jets did not need the Legislature. 
 This was clearly in evidence last year when the mayor, the governor and Jets officials held a news conference to announce the project with no state legislator on hand.
 Later, however, Mr. Doctoroff decided that he also could not trust the City Council to pass a stadium proposal through its land use process, which in hindsight seems like a bad decision since the Council later threw its support behind the stadium. 
 But the city's tactics came apart when the city and state decided to get the stadium paid for partly by the Empire State Development Corporation, which then had to answer to the Public Authorities Control Board, a tiny board set up in the 1970's to keep a check on state borrowing of money for capital projects. As it turned out, the leaders of the State Assembly and Senate controlled that board.
 In an interview before the stadium vote yesterday, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, said that Bloomberg administration officials thought they ''don't have to deal with me. They found out they were wrong.''
 In the case of the stadium, Mr. Silver apparently could simply not be convinced that the focus on the Far West Side would not compete with his interests in development projects in Lower Manhattan. 
 But projects are just as often stalled or killed when elected officials reflect the will of -- or are superseded by -- community opposition to a project, wearing down developers.
 A case in point was the Coliseum property on Columbus Circle, which the city tried to sell to Boston Properties, owned by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, in 1985, who was backed with financing from Salomon Brothers. 
 Appalled by the design of the proposed replacement building, the local community board, aided by opponents like Jacqueline Onassis and Lauren Bacall, protested that it would cast a shadow across Central Park. 
 Salomon Brothers eventually pulled out, the stock market collapsed, and only years later did the Giuliani administration reconfigure the entire bid, which led to the construction of the Time Warner Center on the site.
 The Bloomberg administration, which even its critics assert has initiated some of the most ambitious public projects in decades, is not giving up on an ambitious development agenda. 
 It recently announced plans to rezone 175 waterfront blocks in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, one of many economic development projects throughout the five boroughs.
 ''Contrary to what the stadium has shown there is redevelopment when the city took steps to satisfy the right people,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the research director of the Center for an Urban Future, which supports many of the mayor's projects. ''No, this isn't the time of Robert Moses. And I think thankfully so.''

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind'' and ''Old Nantucket Warily Meets the New'' (front page, ''Class Matters'' series, June 5):
 I am not proud at the flush of envy that rose in my secure, middle-class body while reading your ninth installment on class. 
 I tried to interpret my rising indignation as directed solely at the decadence and destruction of the super-rich. I shook my head at their shallow and selfish behavior and at a society that allows such disparity to flourish.
 Yet somehow I managed to read the earlier installments of the series with nothing more than a calm concern and benign sympathy. The empathy I felt toward those less fortunate, although sincere, did not generate this palpable excitement. 
 I did not rush off a letter to the editor expressing my outrage.
 It is certainly tempting to locate our own humble position on the wealth charts and to stare upward with envy. Rather than denying this natural human weakness, I suggest that we direct the passion kindled toward the vast numbers of the truly needy. 
 This is an opportunity that I do not want to miss.

HEADLINE: The Island of the Really, Really Rich

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your chart about the percentage of income earned by the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers was fascinating, but ''Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind'' failed to draw the obvious conclusions from it.
 The data show that the rich take a rising share of income when the economy is booming, such as during the 1920's and 1990's. Their share declines when the economy hits hard times, such as during the Great Depression and the most recent recession. 
 The rich took their smallest slice of the economic pie during the 1970's -- a period when productivity growth was low and unemployment and inflation were rising.
 Here's the lesson: If policy makers' primary goal is to reduce income inequality, they should put the economy through the wringer. But if they want economic prosperity for all, they should avoid focusing on the politics of envy.

HEADLINE: ProLogis to Acquire a Real Estate Rival in a $3.6 Billion Deal

BYLINE: By ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
ProLogis, a real estate investment trust, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Catellus Development Corporation, a rival, for $3.6 billion in cash and stock.
 The deal, which continues a trend in the commercial real estate industry, pairs two companies that specialize in industrial warehouse and distribution properties.
 ProLogis, which owns or manages 310 million square feet of distribution centers in North America, Europe and Asia, will pay $33.81 a share for Catellus, valuing it at a premium of 16 percent to its Friday close. Catellus shareholders can opt to receive $33.81 a share in cash or 0.822 ProLogis shares. 
 Shares of Catellus, which is based in San Francisco, rose $3.75, or 13 percent, to $32.99 a share. ProLogis, which is based in Denver, fell $1.26, to $40.11. 
 ProLogis expects the acquisition to increase its estimated 2006 funds from operation, a preferred industry financial measure, in a range of 3 percent to 5 percent. The deal is expected to close by year-end.
 ''This will add quality to ProLogis,'' said Matthew D. Gallino, an analyst with Fitch Ratings who covers real estate investment trusts. He said the merger would create a company with a 13 percent share of the domestic distribution and bulk real estate development market. 
 Catellus, which became a real estate investment trust last year after it was spun off from the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad in 1990, has a 95 percent occupancy rate and an average property age of seven years. ProLogis owns or manages more than 2,000 distribution centers globally.
 The acquisition, the largest deal so far this year in commercial real estate, will particularly bolster ProLogis's California presence and nearly double its buildable land holdings over all; Catellus's investment portfolio includes mostly industrial sites in California, Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Georgia and New Jersey.
 Mr. Gallino said the deal was indicative of a growing desire to take advantage of high prices for commercial property.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Thin Volume As Market Awaits Reports

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks edged up yesterday in slow trading. Oil prices retreated from a six-week high, and companies including Wal-Mart Stores and eBay led the gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 6.06 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 10,467.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.49 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,197.51. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index rose 4.33 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,075.76. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks gained 2.64 points, or 0.43 percent, to close at 622.94. 
 Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced those declining by nearly 3 to 2. Volume fell to 1.17 billion shares, the second-slowest day of 2005, from 1.31 billion shares on Friday. A drop in the price of I.B.M. weighed on the Dow industrials. I.B.M. fell after Apple Computer said it would use Intel semiconductors in its computers.
 Investors may have remained on the sidelines awaiting testimony on Thursday by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Intel and Texas Instruments will also update their second-quarter sales forecasts this week.
 Crude oil for July delivery settled in New York yesterday at $54.49 a barrel, down from $55.03 on Friday. Midway through trading, though, oil reached as high as $55.55 a barrel, the highest intraday price since April 25. The decline came on speculation that inventories were sufficient to meet refinery demand.
 An index of retailers climbed 0.9 percent, the best performance among 24 industry groups in the S.&P. 500. Wal-Mart, the largest retailer, advanced 38 cents, to $47.73. The company said that June sales at its United States stores open at least a year were rising within its forecast range of 2 percent to 4 percent. Sales gained 2.5 percent in May.
 EBay, the biggest Internet auction site, increased 84 cents, to $38.64. The company is invigorating growth by earning more from electronic payments and drawing shoppers online, Barron's reported, adding that the stock might gain 20 percent.
 I.B.M. dropped 79 cents, to $75, after Apple announced that its personal computers would contain Intel chips starting in 2006. I.B.M. has supplied Apple's chips for 21 years. Freescale Semiconductor, Apple's other supplier, fell 49 cents, to $20.25.
 Intel dropped 16 cents, to $27.17. Last Thursday, it reached a recent high of $27.59. Apple stock fell 32 cents, to $37.92.
 Shares of Google rose $10.68, to $290.94. An RBC Capital Markets analyst, Jordan Rohan, said the stock might reach $330 in the 12 months. RBC was the fourth investment bank or brokerage house in a week to increase its estimate for Google.
 In the bond market yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32, to 101 7/32, with the yield below 4 percent for the fifth consecutive day. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.95 percent, from 3.98 percent late Friday.
 Some traders and investors are pushing longer-term yields lower on speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon end its series of interest rate increases. In addition, the government said it would sell less in debt securities this week than some analysts had forecast.
 Here are the results from yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.250	98.453	High Rate	2.965	3.060	Investment Rate	3.029	3.151	Low Rate	2.920	3.040	Median Rate	2.950	3.050	Total applied for	$43,114,318	$43,639,241	Accepted	$25,058,681	$21,178,342	Noncompetitive	$1,542,740	$1,123,514

HEADLINE: Bank to Buy Credit Card Business for $6.45 Billion

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Washington Mutual, which grew rapidly from a Seattle savings institution to a home loan giant, said yesterday that it would buy Providian Financial for $6.45 billion in cash and stock, its first major foray into the credit card business. 
 The deal will accelerate Washington Mutual's effort to diversify its consumer banking products away from mortgages, home equity and commercial loans, which have fed the company's growth in the last decade. Rising short-term interest rates have put pressure on profit margins, while the demand for home mortgages and refinancing has shown signs of slowing. 
 Even during the housing and refinancing boom, Washington Mutual fumbled through several quarters of volatile earnings, unable to consistently hedge its interest rate risk, while rivals like Wells Fargo and Countrywide flourished. 
 ''If you look at the products we have available to our customers, the credit card is a major hole in that offering,'' said Kerry K. Killinger, Washington Mutual's chairman and chief executive. ''We are looking at developing a balanced business model that has diversification, and credit cards gives us an improvement in that.''
 Still, Washington Mutual will be entering a business where there is intense competition for new customers. Providian is also the largest acquisition Washington Mutual has made in the last seven years. And there are questions over whether the company, which has struggled in absorbing some businesses, can smoothly bring the credit card unit under its umbrella.
 ''Over all, it is hard to see Washington Mutual being a competitive card player; the credit card market is exceedingly competitive,'' said David Hendler, an analyst who covers Washington Mutual for CreditSights, a research firm based in New York. ''And we still think that WaMu hasn't completely convinced investors it could manage its core business well.''
 Shares of Washington Mutual fell $1.03 yesterday to close at $40.54. Providian shares declined 33 cents, to $17.63. 
 Providian, the nation's ninth-largest issuer with about 9.4 million cards, once focused on customers with poor credit histories before it ran into problems with regulators. Since 2001, the company has undergone a turnaround led by its chief executive, Joseph W. Saunders, after suffering through hefty losses. 
 Being part of Washington Mutual and its stronger balance sheet would allow Providian to reduce its borrowing costs and to free money for marketing. Mr. Saunders will stay on to run the business as a stand-alone unit within Washington Mutual. Providian expects to retain nearly all of its employees and its San Francisco headquarters. Details of those contracts have not yet been disclosed. 
 The deal would also provide Washington Mutual with an opportunity to cross-sell credit cards to its 13 million middle-market customers.
 Still, Mr. Hendler of CreditSights said that Providian's card member base was risky. ''If you give them more credit cards or a home equity loan, you are doubling down on a high-risk segment,'' he said. ''If WaMu wants to upgrade its portfolio quality, then you are getting into heated competition.''
 The deal comes amid a recent pickup of consolidation in credit cards. Last week, Citigroup agreed to pay $760 million for Federated's and May's Department Stores' private-label cards. Morgan Stanley announced plans earlier this year to spin off its Discover Financial unit. Some people have thought MBNA was a possible takeover target, with Wachovia, alone among the nation's big banks without a credit card unit, seen as a possible suitor. 
 Yesterday's deal may also sweep aside speculation that Washington Mutual, long considered a potential target, is up for sale.
 ''If it is going to be for sale or be acquired, it's longer into the future than most people realized,'' said Paul Miller, a mortgage banking analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey in Arlington, Va. ''A lot of people own WaMu for the takeout.''
 Under the agreement, Providian stockholders would receive 0.45 Washington Mutual shares for each Providian share, paid 89 percent in stock and 11 percent in cash. Based on Friday's closing price, the implied per-share purchase price is $18.71, the company said.
 For some time, Washington Mutual planned to enter the credit card business by early 2006. But earlier this spring, Mr. Killinger of Washington Mutual approached Mr. Saunders of Providian at an industry meeting and suggested there might be potential for a deal. Talks intensified over the last several weeks. 
 How well the two companies will be able to work together may be one of their major challenges. Washington Mutual has previously stumbled as it tried to consolidate the back-office systems of seven mortgage operations it acquired in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Miller, the analyst, questioned the wisdom of trying to absorb a new unit when the dust from the old ones was still settling.
 Mr. Killinger, however, brushed the criticism aside. Since the ''process is pretty much complete'' and the credit card division would operate as a free-standing unit, Mr. Killinger said, he thought integrating Providian would be ''low risk'' and ''seamless.''
 Washington Mutual said it expected to complete the acquisition by the end of 2005, and to add to its earnings within a year of that date. The company expects to take one-time charge later this year of about $200 million related to accounting and legal costs, as well as the integration of certain back-office systems. The deal is subject to the approval of shareholders and the Office of Thrift Supervision, Washington Mutual's federal regulator.
 Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett advised Washington Mutual. Goldman, Sachs, Citigroup Global Markets and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Providian.

PERSON: Adolfo Aguilar Zinser

HEADLINE: Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, Blunt Mexican Envoy, Dies at 55

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, the scholarly Mexican diplomat and politician whose independent struggle for democracy helped end 71 years of single-party rule but whose outspokenness infuriated leaders on both sides of the border, was killed Sunday in a traffic accident while driving back from his country home in Tepoztlan, south of Mexico City. He was 55. 
 The Mexican federal police said Mr. Aguilar Zinser was returning to Mexico City on Sunday afternoon when he lost control of his Jeep Liberty and struck a bus near the Tepoztlan toll booth. A car behind Mr. Aguilar Zinser's vehicle was also involved in the crash, which injured four people, including Cecilia de la Macorra, his assistant. 
 A forceful writer and uninhibited critic in Mexico for decades, Mr. Aguilar Zinser became best known in the United States when, as Mexico's representative to the United Nations, he strongly opposed the Bush administration's effort to gain approval for military force against Iraq in 2003. 
 Mr. Aguilar Zinser's position caused trouble for President Vicente Fox and put Mexico, then a non-permanent member of the Security Council, in the uncomfortable position of choosing between raising the ire of the Bush administration and offending the majority of Mexicans, who opposed a war in Iraq. 
 A final vote on the issue was avoided when the United States decided to go ahead with plans for an attack without the passage of a second resolution by the United Nations. 
 But Mr. Aguilar Zinser had already strained his relations with Mr. Fox and the Foreign Ministry. The breaking point came when Mr. Aguilar Zinser said in a speech in late 2003 that the United States wanted a ''relationship of convenience and subordination'' with Mexico, and saw Mexico not as a partner but as ''a backyard.'' 
 After Secretary of State Colin L. Powell strongly objected to the comments, Mexico's Foreign Ministry removed Mr. Aguilar Zinser from office. 
 In his letter of resignation, he conceded that while he might have been ''a diplomat who is not very diplomatic,'' he was also ''an independent, principled man without prejudice.''
 At a memorial service yesterday in Mr. Aguilar Zinser's home in the Coyoacan neighborhood of Mexico City, Mr. Fox called him ''a man who always contributed much to government and policy with his clear vision.'' 
 Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, said Mr. Aguilar Zinser ''served his country with dedication, wit and independence of spirit at a crucial time for the multilateral system.'' 
 Adolfo Aguilar Zinser was born in Mexico City Dec. 2, 1949, the son of Carmen Zinser and Adolfo Aguilar y Quevedo, and the grandson of Miguel Angel de Quevedo, who was considered Mexico's first environmentalist. 
 He studied law and international relations at the Colegio de Mexico and completed a master's degree in international and public affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. 
 In the mid-1970's, he was selected by President Luis Echeverria to lead the Center for Third World Economic and Social Studies, a showcase for Mr. Echeverria's campaign to distance Mexico from the influence of the United States. 
 Disillusioned by the politics of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mr. Aguilar Zinser in 1994 aligned himself with the leftist presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party. After Mr. Cardenas's defeat, Mr. Aguilar Zinser took a seat in the lower house of Congress where, as an independent, he headed a legislative investigation into the questionable operations and financial dealings of a national commodities program headed by Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
 A stylish dresser, Mr. Aguilar Zinser spoke English fluently and wrote powerfully in both Spanish and English, contributing weekly opinion columns to the newspaper Reforma even while he held office. 
 In 1997, he represented the Green Party in the Mexican Senate, and in 2000 he became an instrumental part of the campaign team that helped elect Mr. Fox, an opposition candidate, to the presidency. Mr. Fox then made Mr. Aguilar Zinser his first national security adviser. In that post, he tried to provide limited public access to information and to make protecting Mexico's environment a matter of national security, but after about a year his post was abolished. 
 His appointment as Mexico's permanent representative to the United Nations in January 2002 coincided with Mexico's election to the National Security Council. Most recently, he was the host of a weekly public affairs television program and continued to write his newspaper column. 
 Mr. Aguilar Zinser is survived by his wife, Martha Ketchum, and two sons, Adolfo Patricio and Nicolas.

HEADLINE: Blair, Due to Meet Bush, Will Push 2 Issues

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, in his first visit to the United States since winning re-election last month, will meet here on Tuesday with President Bush in the hope of securing American backing for two initiatives at the top of his agenda: increasing aid to Africa and doing more to fight global warming.
 Despite his status as Mr. Bush's most stalwart ally in Iraq -- and the political difficulties he has endured at home for sticking to that position -- Mr. Blair is likely to come away from the meeting with far less than he is seeking, administration officials, diplomats and outside analysts said. 
 In what appeared to be an effort to take some of the sting out of its differences with Mr. Blair, the White House plans to announce Tuesday that it will release $674 million in aid to Africa, drawn from money that has already been appropriated by Congress, an official of the National Security Council said late Monday, requesting anonymity in order to provide the information before its official public release.
 Nearly $500 million of the money will go to food aid, with much of it directed to Ethiopia and Eritrea, the official said. 
 The meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair will cover a broad array of topics, including Iraq. The leaders are expected to reiterate their commitment to bring stability to Iraq in the face of pressures in both of their countries to begin bringing troops home, officials said.
 It will be the first meeting between them since the disclosure last month of a memo written by a foreign policy aide to Mr. Blair in 2002 that reported, based on a visit to Washington by a top British intelligence official, that the White House was fixing its ''intelligence and facts'' about the threat from Saddam Hussein ''around the policy'' of removing him from power through military action.
 They will also probably present a united face on their efforts to bring peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, American and British officials said, despite pressure from Mr. Blair on Mr. Bush to take a harder line with Israel.
 While the prime minister is under intense domestic pressure to show that his alliance with the president has yielded benefits for Britain, the view among some White House officials is that Mr. Blair will win political points at home on those issues on which he and Mr. Bush agree and that he will also win by standing up to him over issues on which they disagree. 
 Since signing on to back the White House over Iraq, Mr. Blair has at times been portrayed at home as Mr. Bush's ''poodle,'' an eager follower whose loyalty is never really rewarded.
 ''There is widespread concern in Britain that the Blair government has been on the giving side without having much to show policy-wise in return,'' said Philip Lader, who was the United States ambassador to Britain under President Bill Clinton.
 In some ways, Mr. Blair comes to Washington in a position of strength. Not only did he survive domestic opposition to his backing of the Iraq war, albeit with a sharply reduced parliamentary majority, but he is arguably the strongest European leader left on the stage. President Jacques Chirac of France has been wounded politically by his voters' rejection last week of the proposed European constitution. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany is fighting for his political survival, as is Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy.
 With his re-election out of the way, Mr. Blair has made attacking poverty and disease in Africa the centerpiece of the summit meeting for the Group of 8 major industrialized nations for which he will be the host next month in Scotland.
 American officials had expressed some optimism in recent days about reaching a deal on the goal, backed in principle by both the United States and Britain, of eliminating debt payments by the poorest nations to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But there was no agreement by the end of the day Monday, and it was unclear whether one could be reached during Mr. Blair's visit.
 Mr. Bush has already rejected Mr. Blair's call for creation of an international body that could raise money to help Africa by borrowing against future pledges of governmental aid.
 Administration officials have also signaled that the White House is not inclined to commit itself to Mr. Blair's call for doubling aid to Africa. The officials said that in the last four years, the United States had roughly tripled, to $3.2 billion, the amount of money it provided to Africa. They said American aid would continue to increase, especially as existing programs to battle AIDS and provide financial assistance to well-functioning governments get more fully under way.
 They said the levels of aid the United States provides in the future should depend primarily on what African governments and aid organizations are able to use effectively. They also said government aid in any case was only part of the economic equation for Africa, with increased trade and private flows of investment capital capable of playing a far more potent role in the continent's development.
 On climate change, the administration and Downing Street are far apart. Mr. Bush has pushed an approach to reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases built around encouraging the development of technology that could be harnessed by industry. 
 Mr. Blair, by contrast, is a supporter of mandatory limits on those emissions, a stance shared by the other big European powers and one that is leading to higher energy costs in their nations. The White House has repeatedly rejected such an approach, saying it would extract too big a cost from the American economy.
 ''The common ground is in research and in developing technologies that will deal with climate change and increase energy efficiency,'' said William K. Reilly, who was the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President Bush. ''The real difference of opinion between Bush and Blair is over measures that go beyond voluntary measures by industry.''
 James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, said there was a ''strong consensus for a broad portfolio of actions'' that the United States, Britain and other nations could take together. He cited as an example an initiative worked out by the United States, India and other nations to reduce emissions of methane.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Low Rates Tempt Investors to Risk More

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned Monday night that the baffling persistence of low long-term interest rates was driving investors to hunt for higher returns by plowing money into hedge funds that will not be able to deliver on their promises.
 Speaking to a conference of central bankers in Beijing, Mr. Greenspan reiterated that he is perplexed that long-term Treasury bond rates are lower today than they were a year ago, when the Federal Reserve began systematically raising short-term rates. 
 The persistence of cheap money is ''clearly without recent precedent'' and defies simple explanation, Mr. Greenspan said.
 Mr. Greenspan warned that low rates are driving investors to seek higher returns by taking on higher financial risks -- particularly in hedge funds and private equity funds that hold out the prospect of higher profits through sophisticated trading strategies. He took particular aim at packages of debt known as collateralized debt obligations, which have been one of the fastest- growing businesses on Wall Street.
 Mr. Greenspan raised worries about the proliferation of hedge funds based on arcane but not fully tested trading strategies.
 ''I have no doubt that many of the new hedge fund entrepreneurs are embracing a strategy of pinpointing temporary market inefficiencies, the exploitation of which is expected to yield above-average rates of return,'' Mr. Greenspan said. But, he cautioned, ''most of the low-hanging fruit of readily available profits'' has already been picked. 
 Normally, long-term rates climb when the Fed raises short-term rates. But rates on 10-year Treasury bonds, which directly affect rates for mortgages and corporate bonds, have declined nearly one percentage point, to less than 4 percent, since the Fed began raising rates in June 2004.
 Mr. Greenspan said the phenomenon was global because interest rates have been falling around the world, not just in the United States.

HEADLINE: Justices Say U.S. May Prohibit The Use of Medical Marijuana

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the power of Congress to prohibit and prosecute the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes, even in the 11 states that permit it.
 The 6-to-3 decision, a firm reassertion of federal authority, revealed a deep fissure within the coalition that over the past decade has provided the majority for a series of decisions curbing Congressional power and elevating the role of the states within the federal system. Two members of that coalition, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, voted this time to uphold federal authority.
 The decision overturned a 2003 ruling by a federal appeals court that shielded California's Compassionate Use Act, the medical-marijuana initiative adopted by the state's voters nine years ago, from the reach of federal drug enforcement. 
 The appeals court had held that Congress lacked constitutional authority to regulate the noncommercial cultivation and use of marijuana that did not cross state lines. 
 But ''the regulation is squarely within Congress's commerce power,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said for the majority on Monday. He added that the court's precedents interpreting Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution had clearly established ''Congress's power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic 'class of activities' that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.''
 The decision, Gonzales v. Raich, No. 03-1454, was not necessarily the last word on medical marijuana, either from the courts or from other branches of government. Under the terms of the opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, will now consider other challenges to the application of federal drug law.
 These include an argument made by the two women who brought the case that it is a violation of their constitutional right to due process to deprive them of what they say is the only drug that eases their suffering from a variety of painful conditions.
 Because the two patients, Angel McClary Raich and Diane Monson, prevailed in the Ninth Circuit on their Commerce Clause argument, the appeals court did not address the other issues they raised.
 Advocates for medical marijuana, meanwhile, emphasized on Monday that the state laws remained in effect, meaning that state officials would not prosecute patients who used medical marijuana, and that the prospect of federal enforcement was fairly remote. Allen Hopper, a lawyer with the Drug Law Reform Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the federal government handles only about 1 percent of marijuana prosecutions.
 Justice Stevens, noting that ''perhaps even more important than these legal avenues is the democratic process,'' suggested that the executive branch might reclassify marijuana for medical purposes or that Congress might take up the matter.
 The first option appeared quite unlikely, given the response by John P. Walters, the Bush administration's ''drug czar,'' the director of national drug control policy. ''To date, science and research have not determined that smoking a crude plant is safe or effective,'' his official statement said, adding, ''We have a responsibility as a civilized society to ensure that the medicine Americans receive from their doctors is effective, safe and free from the pro-drug politics that are being promoted in America under the guise of medicine.''
 The House of Representatives is due to vote next week on an appropriations amendment that would prohibit the Justice Department from spending money to enforce federal drug laws against patients using marijuana for medical purposes. While the amendment failed last year, 19 Republicans voted for it. It was not brought to a vote in the Senate.
 Mrs. Raich, one of the plaintiffs, speaking along with her husband and lawyers in a telephone news conference, said she would continue to use the marijuana that was prescribed by her doctor and is grown for her by friends. ''I don't have a choice but to continue because if I stopped I would die,'' she said. She suffers from a wasting syndrome, among other ailments, and said that only marijuana gave her the appetite to eat enough to maintain her weight.
 The women brought the case after federal agents arrived at Ms. Monson's home in 2002 and, after a three-hour standoff, seized and destroyed her six plants. The two women sued for a declaration that the federal Controlled Substances Act did not apply to their situation.
 The opinion by Justice Stevens was joined by his allies in many recent battles over federalism, Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, and by Justice Kennedy, who did not provide an explanation for his vote. 
 Justice Scalia, by contrast, explained himself at length. He did not sign the majority opinion, instead offering a separate concurring opinion that was no less definite in its support for federal authority.
 ''Where necessary to make a regulation of interstate commerce effective, Congress may regulate even those intrastate activities that do not themselves substantially affect interstate commerce,'' Justice Scalia said. He cited opinions from the early 1940's, after the Supreme Court rallied to support the New Deal and gave Congress a degree of power over national affairs that was not seriously challenged until the Rehnquist Court began invalidating federal laws in the mid-1990's.
 Chief Justice Rehnquist was one of the dissenters on Monday. He and Justice Clarence Thomas joined a dissenting opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; Justice Thomas also wrote a separate dissenting opinion.
 As a prime mover of the court's federalism revolution, Justice O'Connor did not hide her dismay. The court's opinion provided a roadmap to ''removing meaningful limits on the Commerce Clause'' and ''threatens to sweep all of productive human activity into federal regulatory reach,'' she said.
 Justice O'Connor said that while she did not support the medical marijuana initiative as public policy, it represented the kind of innovation and ''experiment'' that came within the latitude the Constitution allows the states. 
 ''The states' core police powers have always included authority to define criminal law and to protect the health, safety and welfare of their citizens,'' she said, adding that ''whatever the wisdom of California's experiment with medical marijuana, the federalism principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for experiment be protected in this case.''
 Justice Thomas said that ''if Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate virtually anything, and the federal government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.''
 The sharpest dispute was over the meaning of two of the core decisions of the Rehnquist Court's approach to federalism. Both struck down federal laws, the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act, on the ground that they exceeded Congressional authority, and both were decided by five-member majorities that included Justices Kennedy and Scalia.
 While Justice O'Connor declared that the marijuana decision was ''irreconcilable'' with the earlier ones, Justice Scalia disagreed. Neither of the earlier decisions ''involved the power of Congress to exert control over intrastate activities in connection with a more comprehensive scheme of regulation'' comparable to federal drug laws, he said.
 Besides California, states allowing use of marijuana for medical purposes are Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Vermont.

HEADLINE: Pension Law Loopholes Helped United Hide Its Troubles

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Loopholes in the federal pension law allowed United Airlines to treat its pension fund as solid for years, when in fact it was dangerously weakening, according to a new analysis by the agency that guarantees pensions. That analysis is scheduled to be presented at a Senate Finance Committee hearing today. 
 A second report, by the comptroller general, found that most companies that operate pension funds are using the same loopholes. Those loopholes give companies ways -- all perfectly legal -- to make their pension plans look healthier than they really are, reducing the amount of money the companies must contribute. 
 United's pension fund failure is now the biggest since the government began guaranteeing pensions 30 years ago. Most companies are able to keep their pension plans going, despite the chronic, hidden weakness, because they are generating enough cash to meet their obligations to current retirees. Only when a company files for bankruptcy, as United did in December 2002, and terminates its pension plan, as United has, does the government step in and make the plan's true economic condition apparent. 
 ''We saw similar practices and events at Enron, but unfortunately, this time it's perfectly legal,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the finance committee. He said he had scheduled today's hearing because he wanted to find ways to keep pension disasters like the $10 billion failure at United from happening at other companies. 
 ''The rules are full of serious holes that need to be fixed as soon as possible,'' Senator Grassley said. ''No one should make the mistake that this is an airline-only problem. The reality is that companies everywhere have used the same arcane pension-funding rules'' to shrink their contributions.
 Many analysts believe that the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will one day require a bailout because it has been forced to pick up a number of large failed private pension plans. The more big defaults there are in the meantime, the more the eventual bailout will cost.
 The federal pension law was enacted in 1974 after a number of scandals in which companies went bankrupt and their workers discovered there was little or nothing set aside to pay the pensions they had been promised. The law was supposed to make pension failures a thing of the past by requiring companies to set aside money in advance -- enough each year to pay the benefits the work force earned that year.
 The law also required that if a pension fund got into trouble, its sponsor was to quickly pump in more money, warn its employees about the problem and pay higher premiums to the federal pension insurance program. 
 United did none of those things, even as its pension fund withered, because its calculations were making the fund look healthy. The fund is made up of four individual plans for various groups of employees. 
 United's calculations followed the letter of the law until July 2004, when the airline announced that it owed $72.4 million to its pension fund but would not make the contribution. By that time, the company had filed for bankruptcy protection.
 The $72.4 million would have done little good by then, because the pension guaranty agency told the bankruptcy court that the pension fund had a shortfall of $8.3 billion. 
 In its analysis, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation found that in 2002, when United was determining how much it had to contribute to its four plans, it calculated that the plans for its pilots and its mechanics each had more money than needed. It further calculated that the plans for its flight attendants and its managerial workers were close to being fully funded, and did not need any special attention. 
 On the basis of those calculations, United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, made no pension contributions that year.
 Those numbers are on file with the Labor Department. But they do not square with the pension numbers United provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission. That agency requires companies to calculate pension values in a different way. At United, that method showed the four pension plans to be only 50 percent funded; that is, they had only half as much money as they needed to make good on United's promises to its workers. 
 Pension calculations done for S.E.C. filings have nothing to do with the rules for calculating contributions. But had United been required to use the S.E.C. pension numbers to determine its contribution that year, it would have had to pump money into the plans quickly. The pension law requires companies to make special catch-up contributions any time their pension funds fall below an 80 percent funded level, or even when they fall below 90 percent funded, if they stay at those levels for several years. A plan that was only 50 percent funded would be considered a real emergency.
 But the law allowed United to say its pension plans were fully funded, or nearly so, and, therefore, no more money was needed. United's employees were not informed that anything was amiss, as the law requires of badly weakened plans. Nor did United have to pay the higher premiums to the pension guaranty agency that the law expects.
 The discrepancy between a company's pension report to the S.E.C. and the Labor Department is but one example of the problems. At today's Senate hearing, David M. Walker, the comptroller general, is expected to testify that companies have so many ways of tweaking their pension calculations that they almost never have to make the special catch-up contributions that Congress required of plans that are slipping. 
 A recent study by the Government Accountability Office, which Mr. Walker runs, examined eight years of records for the nation's 100 largest pension funds, and found that only six plans in the entire group ever had to pay the special contributions in that period. 
 For two of the plans, it was already too late by the time the special contributions came due. Years of insufficient contributions had taken their toll, and those plans collapsed and were taken over by the government. 
 The G.A.O. study attributes some of the misleading pension math to the use of inappropriate actuarial assumptions in projections and some to a process called ''smoothing,'' in which actuaries attempt to eliminate short-term volatility by spreading changes over several years. 
 But the pension agency's analysis of United's case shows that the rules for tracking contributions made in prior years have also caused a great deal of trouble. The rules allow companies that put in more than the required minimum in any given year to keep the excess amount on their books and to use it to offset their required contributions in years when cash is tight. 
 These excess contributions from the past are kept in a running tab called a credit balance. 
 The trouble is that at United, as at many companies, money contributed in the 1990's was invested in assets that lost value during the bear market that began in 2000. But the pension rules allow companies not only to keep their pension credit balances on the books at the original amount, but they are even permitted to allow their credit balances to compound in value at some interest rate determined by the plan's actuary. 
 When United's calculations finally began to show that contributions were quickly needed, in 2003, the airline was able to satisfy the requirement with just a small amount of cash and lots of bookkeeping entries from its credit balance.
 Senator Grassley said he believed many companies were ''booking phony investment gains to hide that workers' pensions are going down the tubes.'' 
 He said he hoped the hearing would lead to legislation that would eliminate the loopholes that made such maneuvers possible. 
 In a later session today, the finance committee is scheduled to hear from executives of some of the major airlines, and from the leaders of some of the unions for airline employees.

HEADLINE: Beckham's Visit Brings Interest And Speculation

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
Imagine the world's highest-paid soccer player coming to play in the world's most frugal league.
 The notion of David Beckham -- who earned $8.23 million last year playing for Real Madrid and an additional $24 million from a blizzard of endorsement deals -- playing in Major League Soccer was unabashedly advanced last week, when Beckham played for the English national team against Colombia at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
 Beckham, a soft-spoken midfielder with all the buzz, is the personification of the business world's favorite buzzword: the dreaded ''synergy.'' Last week, Adidas, which signed a $150 million sponsorship deal with M.L.S. this year, introduced a line of Beckham gear. The next day, Beckham jetted to Los Angeles to unveil a soccer academy in a deal with the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which runs five M.L.S. clubs, produces movies, runs the Regal chain of movie theaters, owns Staples Center, developed the Home Depot Center and promotes concerts. 
 The relationships are obvious and tantalizing. Beckham is signed to play for Real Madrid through the 2006-7 season, but then it may be time to Brand It Like Beckham in the United States.
 ''I went into a partnership with A.E.G. for the academy,'' Beckham said last week in an interview in New York. ''Obviously the connection is there if I ever want to play soccer over here. It will make it easier for me. I never thought I would leave Manchester United, never, but things came up and I ended up going.''
 Could one player really make a difference? M.L.S. is a single-entity operation; the league owns all player contracts and imposes a tight budget for player salaries, which is about $2 million for each of the 12 teams. The league is proud of its role in developing American players; many of them have moved to European clubs and many now play on the United States national team. But players like Landon Donovan draw few people to games. 
 ''I don't think signing one player makes a long-term difference,'' M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber said in a telephone interview. ''There has been a lot of buzz about David playing in the league; he had some positive comments. Without a doubt we are looking at raising the quality of our player pool, and we need to do it in a responsible way. As for David, it's way too premature to say anything more than we're encouraged by his openness in thinking about playing in the United States at some point in his career.''
 Beckham is polished (and has incredibly white teeth), polite and well prepared, and he rarely lets anything controversial or provocative burble from his mouth. He can stay on message with the best of politicians. But he also showed that he could be gentle, patient and accommodating with fans.

TWO BRIDGES -- After enduring a crush of paparazzi and popping flashes at the Adidas store in SoHo last week, Beckham and his entourage were whisked to Brooklyn Bridge Park, a postage stamp of greenery between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, for a promotional gambit. Wearing his new signature Dragon line of $200 soccer shoes and a smoke-gray training suit, he was asked to take shots at a goal on a barge floating 50 yards out in the East River.
 He strolled up to the rutty patch of grass. When asked how far away the barge was, he smiled and said ''too far.'' He finally scored on the last of 20 kicks (more a long goal kick than his signature swerving free kick). He sat for an interview with MTV, then signed autographs and stood for photographs with a random collection of fans.

OFF TO LOS ANGELES -- ''We understand and respect David's current situation with Real, but if he chose to make the jump, it is within our world to make it happen,'' Tim Leiweke, the president of A.E.G., said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ''We think he can be as big or bigger than Pele was 30 years ago. Making it work economically is the easy part, and there are really only two things at issue for David -- L.A. or New York -- and it's really his choice.''
 Leiweke added: ''We have done the Grammys, the N.B.A. All-Star Game, and this is the most media I've ever seen. He's an icon. The most popular soccer player, if not the most popular athlete in the world. Our society is driven by stars, and David proved it: he conquered the U.S. in two days.''
 After last weekend's games, attendance in M.L.S. this season is nearly 15,000 a game, a figure that has been padded by international and national team doubleheaders in New Jersey (England-Colombia), Chicago (Mexico-Poland and United States-England) and Salt Lake City (United States-Costa Rica).
 Beckham also spoke about other topics:

MANCHESTER UNITED AND MALCOLM GLAZER -- ''I don't think it really matters that Malcolm Glazer now owns the club. I know there has been a reaction from the majority of Man. U fans, but I think once it's explained to them, they will understand that Glazer is putting a lot of money into the club and he is not going to let Man. U go down.''

LEAVING REAL MADRID TO RETURN TO ENGLAND -- ''I know the truth. I know there are rumors out there, but I'm signed to Real Madrid for the next two years. I guess there are people in England who don't get bored saying I'm going back. I am not looking to go back to England to play football.''

THE WORLD CUP -- ''It is possible this one could be my last, but if my legs are healthy and my body is healthy, I don't see any reason why I can't play in South Africa in 2010. I want to play as long as I can, and I also want to stay at the highest level I can.''

LOVE OF BASKETBALL -- ''I think it's a very exciting game and the athletes are the best in the world.'' Because his No. 7 jersey was taken when he went to Real Madrid, Beckham chose No. 23 in a nod to Michael Jordan.

Corner Kicks

WORLD CUP -- The World Cup qualifying match between the United States and Panama tomorrow night in Panama City will not be broadcast live on TV in the United States. Telemundo will show the game at 11:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific times; ESPN2 will show it on tape delay at 1 a.m. Eastern.

LENGTH: 668 words

HEADLINE: New Hope for the Fabulously Wealthy

 BODY:
With all of the debate about taxes, the economy and domestic spending, it is hard to imagine anyone supporting the notion of taking money from programs like Medicaid and college-tuition assistance, increasing the tax burden of the vast majority of working Americans, sending the country into crushing debt -- and giving the proceeds to people who are so fantastically rich that they don't know what to do with the money they already have. Yet that is just what is happening under the Bush administration. Forget the middle class and the upper-middle class. Even the merely wealthy are being left behind in the dust by the small slice of super-rich Americans.
 In last Sunday's Times, David Cay Johnston reported that from 1980 to 2002, the latest year of available data, the share of total income earned by the top 0.1 percent of earners more than doubled, while the share earned by everyone else in the top 10 percent rose far less. The share of the bottom 90 percent declined. 
 President Bush did not create the income gap. But the unheralded effect of his tax policy is its unequal impact on the modestly well to do. By 2015, those making between $80,000 and $400,000 will pay as much as 13.9 percentage points more of their income in federal taxes than those making more than $400,000, assuming the tax cuts are made permanent. Below $80,000, most taxpayers will see their share of taxes rise slightly or stay the same. 
 Mr. Johnston's article quotes a prominent economist who argues that people care more about the chance to move from one income class to another (upward, of course) than about income distribution. But during the Bush years, the two main sources of class mobility -- a good job and money for higher education -- have increasingly failed to materialize for those who most need them. Last week's jobs report from the Labor Department confirmed that a strong labor market recovery has not taken hold. Wages for most working people failed even to outpace inflation in the past year. 
 That might be more bearable if things were rough all over. But the share of economic growth that is going toward corporate profits, which flow to stockholders and bondholders who are concentrated at the top of the income scale, is at historic highs. 
 Which brings us back to the super wealthy and the merely rich. The divide between rich and poor is unfortunately an old story, but income-class warfare among the top 20 percent of the scale is a newer phenomenon. One cause is that the further up the scale one goes, the more of one's income comes from investments, which under the Bush tax cuts enjoy about the lowest rates in the tax code. But many families making between $100,000 and $200,000 are not exactly on easy street. They don't face choices anywhere near as stark as those encountered further down the income ladder, but they face serious tradeoffs not experienced by the uppermost crust, particularly when hit with the triple whammy of college for the children, care for aging parents and preparing for their own retirement. 
 There is something deeply wrong about a system that calls into question a comfortable retirement or a top-notch education for people who have broken into the top 20 percent of income earners. It starts to seem politically explosive when you consider that in a decade, those making between $100,000 and $200,000 will pay about five to nine percentage points more of their income in federal taxes than those making more than $1 million, assuming the Bush tax cuts are made permanent.
 This is not about giving wealthy people more money to invest back into the economy. At this level, it's really about giving more money to those who have nothing to do with it except amass enormous estates for their heirs. Fixing the problem will require members of Congress to summon the courage to say no to a president who wants more for the richest of the rich at the expense of everyone else. We're not holding our breath.

To the Editor:
 ''A Race to the Top,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 3), seems to assume that working ever more hours is making progress. 
 We in the United States have an ever-increasing gap between rich and poor despite longer work hours. The Europeans strike a balance between economic success and social well-being. Europe as a society has determined that spending time with family and engaged in cultural enrichment is as valuable as financial success. 
 The choice for a shorter workweek and a longer vacation schedule does not reflect a culture of laziness, but rather the understanding that there is more to life than work and money.

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman assumes a dismal social Darwinism rewarding only those desperate enough to work ''a 35-hour day.'' In his world we're stripped of freedom, strapped to a treadmill controlled by an inexorably globalizing ''market.'' Many can't make it to his ''top,'' and even the lives of those who do are unsustainable.
 No. We have choice. Instead of assuming a corporate globalized everything, we can further ecologically sound local production and exchange. Instead of resigning workers to increasing powerlessness, we can seek universal enforcement of international labor standards. Building on these and other practical strategies, we can reject economic determinism and choose a sustainable, satisfying future that includes all of us.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Stadium Quest Fails; Olympic Bid Is Hurt

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and MICHAEL COOPER; Charles V. Bagli reported from New York for this article and Michael Cooper from Albany. Al Baker, in Albany, and Jim Rutenberg, in New York, contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's nearly four-year quest to build a Manhattan football stadium that could spark the redevelopment of the West Side and lure the Olympic Games to New York was defeated yesterday when two of Albany's leaders refused to approve the $2.2 billion project. The decision threw into serious doubt the city's bid to bring the 2012 Olympics to the United States.
 By far the most contentious development project proposed for New York City in years, the stadium became a victim of the city's and state's clashing rebuilding priorities after the World Trade Center attack.
 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who held veto power over the stadium, said yesterday that he could not support the project on the West Side, along with the large commercial redevelopment plan the mayor has proposed, because it would undermine the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, his district. 
 ''Am I supposed to turn my back on Lower Manhattan as it struggles to recover?'' Mr. Silver asked at an Albany news conference. ''For what? A stadium? For the hope of bringing the Olympics to New York City?'' 
 Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, also declined to support the project, saying he had not been given enough information about it. He tried, but failed, to win support for a plan to authorize the stadium only if the city won its bid for the Olympics. 
 Yesterday's decision, by the state's Public Authorities Control Board, makes it far more difficult, if not impossible, for the city to guarantee the construction of an Olympic stadium, a prerequisite to its bid. Just hours earlier, the International Olympic Committee released a report generally praising New York's bid, but calling attention to the stadium's uncertainty. Paris's proposal drew unqualified praise. In less than four weeks, the Olympic committee plans to pick Paris, London, Madrid, Moscow or New York for the site of the Summer Games. [Page D1.]
 ''I had not been able to persuade him,'' Mr. Bloomberg said after Mr. Silver's announcement. ''As for our Olympic bid, rejection of the stadium will seriously damage our chances at winning the 2012 Games.'' Those who opposed the stadium would have to explain why they were against jobs and economic growth, he said. Aides to the mayor added that he was furious at Mr. Silver, believing the speaker had failed to negotiate in good faith after promising to do so over the weekend.
 The vote also raises questions about Mr. Bloomberg's ambitious plans to redevelop the low-scale industrial neighborhood on the Far West Side and expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The mayor had planned the stadium as the centerpiece of a huge commercial and residential development in the old maritime district along the river, including a subway-line extension and broad new boulevards. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, along with the Jets, the city's construction unions and some business groups, had said the stadium would help create thousands of new jobs, new tax revenues and a new commercial district.
 ''Without it, we won't have the catalyst for the growth of this neighborhood, and we'll have to revise our plans to make up for it,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''This delay will be measured in years, not months.'' He said the vote would also mean a loss of millions of dollars to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which had planned to sell the stadium site to the Jets.
 In his pursuit of the stadium, the mayor failed to reckon with the power of the little-known state board, which is controlled by Albany's three leaders -- Mr. Silver, Mr. Bruno and Gov. George E. Pataki. Without a unanimous decision from the board, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority could not transfer the land, and the state could not contribute its half of the $600 million public subsidy. Because Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno each ordered their representatives on the board to abstain -- the equivalent of a no vote -- the project cannot go ahead.
 Mr. Bloomberg could not overcome Mr. Silver's determination to fight for his downtown district, which has never recovered the economic vitality it held before the terrorist attacks. Aides to the mayor, saying they were baffled by Mr. Silver's vote, said they had offered him any number of incentives to keep businesses downtown, including commercial rent tax exemptions and penalties for moving from downtown to the West Side.
 The proposals, offered in last-minute negotiations over the weekend, were met by stony silence from Mr. Silver, the aides said. 
 Mr. Silver objected to the 24 million square feet of development that City Hall envisioned for the West Side, saying that the administration's fever for the area would inevitably have hurt downtown's growth.
 ''The 2012 Summer Games are being used as a shield to hide another goal: to shift the financial and business capital of the world out of Lower Manhattan and over to the West Side,'' Mr. Silver said. To get his vote supporting a stadium, he said, it would have to be built somewhere other than the West Side -- ideally, near Shea Stadium in Queens -- and the big development project for the West Side would have to be stopped.
 Many of the city's largest civic groups, many economists and West Side neighborhood groups agreed with Mr. Silver's opposition, though sometimes for different reasons, saying the stadium would hurt development by discouraging office tenants and residents who would not want to work and live next to it. 
 ''This was never an economic development project,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, which opposed the stadium while favoring the redevelopment of the West Side. ''Virtually every independent observer concluded that the impediment to the redevelopment of the West Side was the stadium.''
 Many in the real estate industry had warned Mr. Bloomberg and his deputy mayor, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the former investment banker and architect of the city's Olympic bid for the last decade, that the stadium would be the Achilles heel of the Olympic bid. 
 At a founding meeting of the pro-stadium Hudson Yards Coalition four years ago, Jerry I. Speyer, a developer and a minority owner of the Yankees, warned the group that building over the West Side railyards was folly because of community opposition, potential lawsuits and environmental regulations. He was not the only one. ''Everyone in town gave the Olympic organizers that advice,'' Mr. Yaro said.
 At the time, though, no one predicted that James L. Dolan, whose family controls Cablevision and Madison Square Garden, would come to view the stadium as competition and begin an all-out effort to stop the project, hiring lobbyists and spending millions on television ads.
 The Jets had proposed building a $2.2 billion stadium, nearly quadruple the $630 million cost of the most expensive stadium in the United States, the new Soldier Field in Chicago. The Jets promised to pay $1.6 billion themselves, more than any other professional team, while the city and state were to invest a combined $600 million.
 The team designed the stadium to double as an exhibition hall, to work in conjunction with the Javits convention center, but that feature did little to blunt criticism of the project.
 The Jets will probably stay in New Jersey, Mr. Bloomberg said, and the state's acting governor, Richard J. Codey, said he was confident the team would remain there in a new Meadowlands stadium.
 The meeting of the Public Authorities Control Board, which usually meets in out-of-the-way rooms in the Capitol and draws only a handful of mild-mannered observers in pinstripe suits, met in a large convention room yesterday, and drew hundreds of angry union members, some in hard hats, who noisily called for the stadium. 
 The tensions reached a boiling point when State Senator Thomas K. Duane, a Democrat who represents the West Side, went over to talk with the stadium opponents. Suddenly he was swarmed by stadium boosters who began screaming at the opponents. The standoff was defused when several state troopers entered the room, and some of the cooler-headed union members urged their colleagues to sit down. 
 After the vote, a moan went up in the crowd of ironworkers, who got louder. The members of the board were escorted into a back room.
 One ironworker shouted, ''We'll see Silver in the morning.'' As the members of the board filed out, the ironworkers chanted, ''Silver's got to go! Now!''

He has one of three votes on the Public Authorities Control Board, and his representative voted in favor of the stadium plan.AGAINSTSheldon SilverThe Democratic Assembly speaker has said the stadium plan would diminish efforts to redevelop Lower Manhattan. Since he has a vote on the Public Authorities Control Board, the mayor showered Mr. Silver with offers of civic improvement and other projects for his downtown district.James L.

He sees the stadium as a threat to Cablevision because it would compete with the company's Midtown arena, Madison Square Garden.Joseph L. BrunoThe Republican leader of the state Senate also has a vote on the Public Authorities Control Board, and has spoken out against the stadium plan, but promoted a compromise in which Olympics officials would be assured a stadium if the Olympics came to New York in 2012.

HEADLINE: In a Spotlight, Baath Congress Opens in Syria

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Katherine Zeopf contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, June 6 

 BODY:
President Bashar al-Assad opened a landmark Baath Party congress on Monday, promising modest political reform and calling for a renewed focus on the economy. But the most dramatic change likely to come out of the meeting is the transformation of the party from a pan-Arab movement to a Syrian one. 
 The changes are likely to emphasize a loose Arab federation and trade connections, delegates said, as well as raise the Syrian character of the party. Instead of creating a single government, the party will seek something more akin to the European Union, said George Jabbour, a member of Parliament. 
 Mr. Assad announced the meeting in March as he pledged to withdraw from Lebanon, promising Syrians major changes in an effort win back support. 
 ''The president had to promise people something in March, and now he's got to oblige,'' said Joshua Landis, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Oklahoma. ''The larger promise is that he will get the Baath out of the nation, and people have understood that as getting corruption and graft out.''
 The 1,200 delegates went into the closed-door meetings with an agenda that included clearing the way for political parties to operate, loosening the Baath Party's grip on the economy and bringing in new blood. 
 The first change occurred Monday when Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam resigned. Other resignations were expected as Mr. Assad works to bring in his supporters and try to take charge of the party.
 In his opening speech, Mr. Assad presented few specifics. ''The economic situation and improving living standards represent a priority for us,'' he said. The congress ''should push the reform process forward to respond to the majority of people,'' he added, without elaborating.
 Ahmed Hajj Ali, an adviser to the information minister and a nonvoting delegate, predicted that results from the meeting would be minor, adding, ''It is what happens after the meeting that really counts.''
 The party took hold in Syria and Iraq in 1963, with the objectives of secularism, socialism, and pan-Arab union as a means to regenerate a common heritage and drive off outside influence. The party was outlawed in Iraq after the American invasion, and Syria has been the flag bearer since then. 
 Mr. Assad reiterated many party themes, including the threat to fundamental Arab identity, but he also emphasized the new focus on Syria.
 ''Every decision you take and every recommendation you make should express only our internal needs,'' he said, ''regardless of any considerations that aim at pushing us in directions that harm our national interests and threaten our stability.''
 Mr. Hajj Ali said, ''The Arab nationalism will remain in the party, but it will become a cultural and economic connection with others.'' 
 Mr. Landis's reading was: ''They are graduating away from the romantic vision of Arab nationalism to a more constitutionally based sense.''

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Capital Reels From Surging Protests

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, June 7 

 BODY:
Thousands streamed into the Bolivian capital, La Paz, on Tuesday as Indian protests against the ruling elite gained force even after President Carlos Mesa offered his resignation. 
 The critical highway to the highlands, where the international airport is situated, remained cut off by roadblocks, and the city of one million people was hit by food shortages and a transport strike.
 Demanding that the government expropriate foreign energy installations and call new elections, miners in hard hats and indigenous women in derby hats and colorful, multi-layer skirts marched into La Paz in a show of force punctuated by blasts of dynamite that demonstrated the depth of the crisis buffeting the government. 
 The police fired at the protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons, photographers at the scene said by phone from La Paz. Soldiers armed with rifles were, for the first time, patrolling the streets and guarding the seat of power in La Paz's main square, Plaza Murillo.
 In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where the Organization of American States was meeting on Tuesday, Bolivia's foreign minister, Jose Ignacio Siles, asked the member nations for a resolution pledging to ''support the person who, in accordance with constitutional succession procedures, takes over the presidency'' of Bolivia, according to Agence-France Presse.
 Mr. Mesa submitted his resignation Monday night, and Congress is widely expected to accept it at an emergency session on Wednesday -- if adequate security can be provided. 
 If Congress accepts Mr. Mesa's resignation, it must then decide who will finish out his term, which would have ended in August of 2007. 
 The two men next in line, the presidents of the Senate and lower house of Congress, are not acceptable to the protesters. But opposition leaders have indicated they would accept the third in line, the president of the Supreme Court, Eduardo Rodriguez, who has said he would take the post only to preside over early elections. Those could be held as early as August. 
 New elections have been demanded by Evo Morales, the congressman and indigenous leader who is head of the Movement Toward Socialism and is considered among the top candidates for president in the country of nine million. Mr. Morales, an Aymara Indian who gained prominence leading coca farmers protesting American-backed eradication efforts, seemed to be supporting nationalization of the energy industry.
 ''If we do not recover the natural resources for the Bolivian state we will never resolve the social, political and economic problems,'' he told CNN en Espanol late on Monday. ''The oil fields should pass over to the Bolivian state.''
 The president of the senate, Hormando Vaca Diez, tried to reassure Bolivians on Tuesday, saying there was no vacuum of power. ''President Mesa is still in the palace,'' he said late Monday night.
 Indeed, Mr. Mesa, in his late-night televised speech to the nation on Monday night, assured Bolivians that he would remain in charge until Congress acted. Bolivia's previous president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, fled Bolivia after resigning in the face of violent protests in October 2003.
 ''It's not in my plans to travel to Miami or Washington,'' Mr. Mesa said. ''That's my responsibility. You have a president who always shows his face and will be in the place where he has to be until the moment he completes his obligation.''

HEADLINE: A Winemaker, Transplanted

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: PAARL, South Africa 

 BODY:
ZELMALONG has cut a broad swath through the California wine world for a quarter-century and more. Soon she will see whether her widely acknowledged expertise as a winemaker will enable her to do the same thing in this country's heart-stoppingly beautiful Cape vineyards, more than 10,000 miles from the Napa Valley.
 ''This place is made for fine wines,'' Ms. Long told me over a lunch of calamari and shredded oxtails in saffron cream sauce at Tokara, the winery where her new wines will be made for the next few years. ''It has all the advantages of soil and climate you could want, plus a viticultural tradition stretching back many centuries.''
 Ms. Long and her husband, Phil Freese, a leading authority on the planting and cultivation of vines, will introduce two cutting-edge blends bearing the Vilafonte label to the South African and American markets later this year: an ''M'' series, mainly merlot and malbec, and a ''C'' series, mostly cabernet sauvignon. The prices will be hefty: $50 and $70 a bottle respectively, on a level with California's classic reds. 
 With the globalization of the wine trade, French and Australian and a few Italian winemakers have taken on consulting jobs around the world. ''Flying winemakers,'' they are called, because they flit from country to country. But Ms. Long and Mr. Freese intend to play a role more sustained than that. She said that she planned ''to be as hands-on as I can possibly be,'' spending three to four months here every year.
 Although some local growers privately expressed skepticism that Ms. Long would find her American experience quickly applicable in this country, and others predicted that her prices would prove too high, John Platter, a prominent South African wine writer, said that so far Ms. Long and Mr. Freese had been warmly welcomed by their peers.
 ''There's no sense at all that they're interlopers,'' he added, ''because they've been coming here for such a long time.''
 Now 61, Ms. Long was one of the first women to study for a master's degree in oenology at the University of California, Davis, the top wine school in the United States. She honed her craft under Mike Grgich at Robert Mondavi's vineyards, later serving there as chief winemaker for almost a decade. In 1979, she shifted to the Sonoma Valley, scoring a notable triumph at Simi Winery, which she restored to its former eminence before stepping down as president and chief executive in 1999.
 For the last 28 years, she has also owned Long Vineyards in the hills east of the Napa Valley with her first husband, Bob Long, turning out rich and very long-lived chardonnays in the European style, as well as several other superb wines. That, too, helped to establish her as the most important woman in American wine, a trailblazer who helped open the door for later stars like Helen Turley and Cathy Corison. 
 A rangy woman who looks a lot taller than her 5 feet 8 1/2 inches, Ms. Long is a bluejeans-and-khakis, plain-talking type who seems equally at home in the vineyard, the boardroom and the barrel room.
 She and Mr. Freese own 50 percent of Vilafonte; the other 50 percent belongs to Michael Ratcliffe, scion of the family that has operated the highly regarded Warwick Estate in nearby Stellenbosch for more than four decades. The founder of a group of young and progressive winemakers called Rootstock, he will oversee Vilafonte's operations when Ms. Long is out of the country.
 A fourth major player at Vilafonte, the San Francisco-based wine merchant Bartholomew Broadbent, has an equally impressive pedigree: he is the son of Michael Broadbent, the celebrated London wine auctioneer and commentator. He will import Vilafonte wines to North America.
 Vilafonte's initial production, the 2001 and 2002 vintages, was privately bottled; now comes the big test, the 2003, which was bottled last January at Tokara, a showplace hillside winery outside Stellenbosch. It will reach stores sometime this autumn. An initial tasting of both the ''M'' and ''C'' series showed great promise, the ''M'' suppler and fruitier, the ''C'' more commanding.
 The two demonstrate what modern techniques and liberation from bureaucratic shackles have done for the best new South African wines. Stale, musty flavors and ham-handed heaviness have been supplanted by clarity, subtlety and finesse.
 Attracted first to South Africa by Gyles Webb, the Indiana-educated pioneer who made some of this country's first and best modern wines at Thelema, Ms. Long paid her initial visit in 1990 and returned in 2001 to make a speech ''defining the unique position that I believe South Africa can build for itself'' in world wine markets.
 It came at an apt time. The country and its winemakers were just emerging from the long, dark tunnel called apartheid, which not only stunted the sales of South African wines in many foreign markets but also blocked the importation of virus-free clones. Ms. Long gave her audience every reason to be confident about the future.
 She noted the country's ''enormously old and diverse soils,'' which support more than 8,000 species of often vividly flowering plants, including the magnificent proteas. As a result, she continued, ''along with California, South Africa has more potential for varietal diversity in a relatively small area than any wine-growing country in the world.'' It also benefits from coastal fogs rolling in from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, which converge at South Africa's southwestern tip, near the main winefields.
 A relatively cool climate, low rainfall and moderate humidity, Ms. Long argued, ''give wines that have personality and flavor length'' without the aggressive tannins that mar reds in some growing zones.
 Since then, dozens of South African wines have achieved world-class quality, and many others stand on the verge of excellence. Far-flung new wine areas like Swartland and Walker Bay are thriving. My friend Anthony Hamilton Russell's pioneering Hamilton Russell vineyard, situated above Walker Bay in the well-named Hemel-en-Aarde (''Heaven on Earth'') valley, makes superlative pinot noir, as does Bouchard Finlayson. New varietals like mourvedre, shiraz, viognier, riesling and semillon (new to South Africa, that is) have been more extensively planted, and chenin blanc is staging a comeback.
 In addition, a few black South Africans are slowly moving into ownership and management positions in the wine industry --- far too slowly, many complain, but at least the transformation is under way.
 Vilafonte was laid out in 1998 and 1999 in a shallow bowl on the northern slope of the Simonsberg, one of the stark peaks that lend the Cape region such drama. It was planted with classic Bordeaux varietals, including cabernet sauvignon, malbec, cabernet franc and merlot, using global positioning satellite data to establish vine rows in harmony with sun and drainage patterns.
 Mr. Freese, who holds advanced degrees from Davis, also uses a technique that he developed while working at Mondavi, called the Normalized Differentiated Vegetative Index, to monitor the plants' vigor. With the aid of aerial photos taken by a special camera at particular wavelengths, the index helps to pinpoint weaker vines and to detect any early symptoms of the infestation by phylloxera lice that is fatal to vines.
 Ms. Long told me there were no plans to build a winery for now. By 2007, she and her husband hope to have found and converted a building for such use, with a built-to-order facility to follow later if the economic climate makes it practical.
 About 30 acres have been planted so far, with a potential for 50 more on the same property. The present 30 produced 1,700 cases of ''M'' and 1,300 cases of ''C'' in the 2003 vintage. When fully planted, the vineyard will produce 15,000 to 18,000 cases, which is a fair-to-middling total, certainly well outside the boutique range.
 Ms. Long grew up in the Pacific Northwest and graduated from Oregon State University. She is especially attracted to the wines from the Walla Walla district in southeastern Washington, a few miles north of the Oregon border, most of all the merlots made there, which she said she considers some of the best in the world.
 Those merlots -- powerful, well-structured wines with big, soft tannins rather than the lightweights often made elsewhere -- bear a strong resemblance to those being produced by some South African wineries. Vilafonte intends to join them.
 A bit later, Ms. Long said, she and Mr. Freese also plan to ''take another look at pinotage.'' That grape, uniquely South African, resulted from a crossing in the 1920's of cinsaut and pinot noir. Wines made from it are sometimes coarse, with an unpleasant aftertaste, but winemakers at vineyards like Kanonkop and other estates near Vilafonte's property have been producing well-oaked pinotage with a fruity aroma.
 Under the umbrella of Zelphi, their new company, Ms. Long and Mr. Freese have kept busy as consultants, working with clients in South Africa, Washington State (Abeja), California (Gundlach-Bundschu) and Israel (Golan Heights Winery).
 But they have been less successful in their own small-scale projects abroad. Simunye, their initial South African effort, a joint venture with Michael Back of Backsberg, also in Paarl, foundered because of disagreements among the partners. It was discontinued a few years ago.
 In Germany's Nahe Valley, through which flows a small tributary of the Rhine, the two teamed with Monika Christmann, a leading German wine educator and writer, to produce a riesling that they called Sibyl. From the first vintage in 1998 it attracted highly favorable comment, but with Germany's depressed wine prices, Sibyl was not big enough (four and a half acres, 450 to 900 cases a year, depending on the harvest) to prosper.
 ''It cost much too much to market the wine,'' Ms. Long said, ''so we have just closed the whole operation down.''
 All of which serves as a reminder that even for people as obviously talented and widely experienced as Ms. Long and Mr. Freese, there are plenty of pitfalls in starting new ventures in far-off winelands.

HEADLINE: BUSH AIDE EDITED CLIMATE REPORTS

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
A White House official who once led the oil industry's fight against limits on greenhouse gases has repeatedly edited government climate reports in ways that play down links between such emissions and global warming, according to internal documents. 
 In handwritten notes on drafts of several reports issued in 2002 and 2003, the official, Philip A. Cooney, removed or adjusted descriptions of climate research that government scientists and their supervisors, including some senior Bush administration officials, had already approved. In many cases, the changes appeared in the final reports.
 The dozens of changes, while sometimes as subtle as the insertion of the phrase ''significant and fundamental'' before the word ''uncertainties,'' tend to produce an air of doubt about findings that most climate experts say are robust. 
 Mr. Cooney is chief of staff for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the office that helps devise and promote administration policies on environmental issues. 
 Before going to the White House in 2001, he was the ''climate team leader'' and a lobbyist at the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade group representing the interests of the oil industry. A lawyer with a bachelor's degree in economics, he has no scientific training.
 The documents were obtained by The New York Times from the Government Accountability Project, a nonprofit legal-assistance group for government whistle-blowers. 
 The project is representing Rick S. Piltz, who resigned in March as a senior associate in the office that coordinates government climate research. That office, now called the Climate Change Science Program, issued the documents that Mr. Cooney edited. 
 A White House spokeswoman, Michele St. Martin, said yesterday that Mr. Cooney would not be available to comment. ''We don't put Phil Cooney on the record,'' Ms. St. Martin said. ''He's not a cleared spokesman.''
 In one instance in an October 2002 draft of a regularly published summary of government climate research, ''Our Changing Planet,'' Mr. Cooney amplified the sense of uncertainty by adding the word ''extremely'' to this sentence: ''The attribution of the causes of biological and ecological changes to climate change or variability is extremely difficult.''
 In a section on the need for research into how warming might change water availability and flooding, he crossed out a paragraph describing the projected reduction of mountain glaciers and snowpack. His note in the margins explained that this was ''straying from research strategy into speculative findings/musings.''
 Other White House officials said the changes made by Mr. Cooney were part of the normal interagency review that takes place on all documents related to global environmental change. Robert Hopkins, a spokesman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, noted that one of the reports Mr. Cooney worked on, the administration's 10-year plan for climate research, was endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences. And Myron Ebell, who has long campaigned against limits on greenhouse gases as director of climate policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian group, said such editing was necessary for ''consistency'' in meshing programs with policy.
 But critics said that while all administrations routinely vetted government reports, scientific content in such reports should be reviewed by scientists. Climate experts and representatives of environmental groups, when shown examples of the revisions, said they illustrated the significant if largely invisible influence of Mr. Cooney and other White House officials with ties to energy industries that have long fought greenhouse-gas restrictions. 
 In a memorandum sent last week to the top officials dealing with climate change at a dozen agencies, Mr. Piltz said the White House editing and other actions threatened to taint the government's $1.8 billion-a-year effort to clarify the causes and consequences of climate change.
 ''Each administration has a policy position on climate change,'' Mr. Piltz wrote. ''But I have not seen a situation like the one that has developed under this administration during the past four years, in which politicization by the White House has fed back directly into the science program in such a way as to undermine the credibility and integrity of the program.''
 A senior Environmental Protection Agency scientist who works on climate questions said the White House environmental council, where Mr. Cooney works, had offered valuable suggestions on reports from time to time. But the scientist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because all agency employees are forbidden to speak with reporters without clearance, said the kinds of changes made by Mr. Cooney had damaged morale. ''I have colleagues in other agencies who express the same view, that it has somewhat of a chilling effect and has created a sense of frustration,'' he said. 
 Efforts by the Bush administration to highlight uncertainties in science pointing to human-caused warming have put the United States at odds with other nations and with scientific groups at home. 
 Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who met with President Bush at the White House yesterday, has been trying to persuade him to intensify United States efforts to curb greenhouse gases. Mr. Bush has called only for voluntary measures to slow growth in emissions through 2012. 
 Yesterday, saying their goal was to influence that meeting, the scientific academies of 11 countries, including those of the United States and Britain, released a joint letter saying, ''The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.'' 
 The American Petroleum Institute, where Mr. Cooney worked before going to the White House, has long taken a sharply different view. Starting with the negotiations leading to the Kyoto Protocol climate treaty in 1997, it has promoted the idea that lingering uncertainties in climate science justify delaying restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases. 
 On learning of the White House revisions, representatives of some environmental groups said the effort to amplify uncertainties in the science was clearly intended to delay consideration of curbs on the gases, which remain an unavoidable byproduct of burning oil and coal. 
 ''They've got three more years, and the only way to control this issue and do nothing about it is to muddy the science,'' said Eileen Claussen, the president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a private group that has enlisted businesses in programs cutting emissions.
 Mr. Cooney's alterations can cause clear shifts in meaning. For example, a sentence in the October 2002 draft of ''Our Changing Planet'' originally read, ''Many scientific observations indicate that the Earth is undergoing a period of relatively rapid change.'' In a neat, compact hand, Mr. Cooney modified the sentence to read, ''Many scientific observations point to the conclusion that the Earth may be undergoing a period of relatively rapid change.''
 A document showing a similar pattern of changes is the 2003 ''Strategic Plan for the United States Climate Change Science Program,'' a thick report describing the reorganization of government climate research that was requested by Mr. Bush in his first speech on the issue, in June 2001. The document was reviewed by an expert panel assembled in 2003 by the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists largely endorsed the administration's research plan, but they warned that the administration's procedures for vetting reports on climate could result in excessive political interference with science.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Rises, but Less Than Expected

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
Americans increased their borrowing for auto loans and other types of consumer debt at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in April, the slowest increase in five months, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday.
 The Fed reported that consumer credit rose $1.26 billion in April, significantly below the $7.5 billion increase that many analysts had been expecting.
 The 0.7 percent April rate of increase came after a revised 3.9 percent gain in March and was the smallest gain since a 0.2 percent increase last November. 
 The consumer has been the star of the economic recovery from the 2001 recession, increasing personal borrowing to record levels to support continued strong gains in spending.
 Total consumer debt now stands at a record $2.13 trillion, a figure that does not include an estimated $8 trillion that Americans owe on their home mortgages and home equity loans. The Fed's consumer credit report does not cover real estate loans.
 Loans on credit cards and other types of revolving credit fell for a second consecutive month, dropping at a rate of 0.6 percent in April after a 0.9 percent decline in March. The declines were the first back-to-back ones since consecutive drops in June and July 2003.
 Demand for nonrevolving debt, a category that includes car loans, rose at an annual rate of 1.5 percent in April after a much bigger 6.7 percent increase in March.
 Some analysts suggested that the slower increase in borrowing in April might indicate that consumers chose to use their tax refunds to pay down some existing debt. 
 ''It was a surprisingly weak number,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York. ''The consumer may be adopting a more prudent role and paying down some old loans.''
 But Mr. Yamarone noted that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, had risen for 52 consecutive quarters going back to 1992, when the country was still struggling to pull out of the 1990-91 recession.
 ''I suspect the slowdown in borrowing will be temporary,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Fiction, a Long History of Fixation on the Social Gap

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
On television and in the movies now, and even in the pages of novels, people tend to dwell in a classless, homogenized American Never-Never Land. This place is an upgrade, but not a drastic one, from the old neighborhood where Beaver, Ozzie and Harriet, and Donna Reed used to live; it's those yuppified city blocks where the friends on ''Friends'' and the ''Seinfeld'' gang had their apartments, or in the now more fashionable version, it's part of the same exurb as One Tree Hill and Wisteria Lane -- those airbrushed suburbs where all the cool young people hang out and where the pecking order of sex and looks has replaced the old hierarchy of jobs and money. 
 This is progress of a sort, but it's also repression, since it means that pop culture has succeeded to a considerable extent in burying something that used to be right out in the open. In the old days, when we were more consumed by social class, we were also more honest about it. 
 There is an un-American secret at the heart of American culture: for a long time, it was preoccupied by class. That preoccupation has diminished somewhat -- or been sublimated -- in recent years as we have subscribed to an all-purpose, mass-market version of the American dream, but it hasn't entirely disappeared. The subject is a little like a ne'er-do-well relative; it's sometimes a shameful reminder, sometimes openly acknowledged, but always there, even, or especially, when it's never mentioned. 
 This was particularly true in the years before World War II, when you couldn't go to the movies or get very far in a novel without being reminded that ours was a society where some were much better off than others, and where the class divide -- especially the gap separating middle from upper -- was an inescapable fact of life. The yearning to bridge this gap is most persistently and most romantically evoked in Fitzgerald, of course, in characters like the former Jay Gatz of Nowhere, N.D., staring across Long Island Sound at that distant green light, and all those moony young men standing in the stag line at the country club, hoping to be noticed by the rich girls. 
 But there is also a darker version, the one that turns up in Dreiser's ''American Tragedy'' (1925), for example, where class envy -- a wish to live like his rich tycoon uncle -- causes Clyde Griffiths to drown his hopelessly proletarian sweetheart, and where the impossibility of transcending his lot leads him inevitably to the electric chair. (In the upstate New York town of Lycurgus, where the story takes place, Dreiser reminds us that ''the line of demarcation and stratification between the rich and the poor was as sharp as though cut by a knife or divided by a high wall.'' )
 Some novels trade on class anxiety to evoke not the dream of betterment but the great American nightmare: the dread of waking up one day and finding yourself at the bottom. This fear gets an earnest and moralizing expression in early books like P.H. Skinner's 1853 novel, ''The Little Ragged Ten Thousand, or, Scenes of Actual Life Among the Lowly in New York,'' which is pretty much summed up by its title. By the turn of the century, though, in works like Stephen Crane's ''Maggie: A Girl of the Streets'' and Frank Norris's ''McTeague,'' about a San Francisco dentist who, unmasked as a fraud, sinks to a life of crime and degradation, the treatment had turned grim and unflinching.
 These books were frankly meant to shock their middle-class readers -- to scare the daylights out of them -- even as they played on their sympathies. They suggested that the worst thing that could possibly happen to an American was to topple from his perch on the class ladder, as happens to poor Hurstwood in Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie.'' In his besotted pursuit of Carrie (who meanwhile trades on her beauty and charm to move up from her Chicago boarding house to the bright lights of Broadway), he loses everything and crashes all the way from restaurant-owning prosperity to scabbing for work as a trolley car driver.
 The poor are noticeably absent, however, in the great artistic flowering of the American novel at the turn of the 19th century, in the work of writers like Henry James, William Dean Howells and Edith Wharton, who are almost exclusively concerned with the rich or the aspiring middle classes: their marriages, their houses, their money and their stuff. Not accidentally, these novels coincided with America's Gilded Age, the era of overnight fortunes and conspicuous spending that followed in the wake of the Civil War.
 To a certain extent James, Wharton, et al. were merely writing about the world around them, though in James there is sometimes a hint of aesthetic snobbery, a sense that refined writing required a refined subject matter. (In ''The Ambassadors,'' for example, he explains that the Newsomes made their fortune in manufacturing, but can't quite bring himself to be so vulgar as to tell us exactly what they made.) In Wharton and Howells, on the other hand, there is frequently an edge of satire, and sometimes a hint of seismic rumble.
 Wharton's most vivid characters are not the aristos, the sons and daughters of the great New York families, who are all a little bloodless and sexually underpowered, but people like Lily Bart, whose lifestyle outstrips her pocketbook and who winds up in economic freefall. And then there are the climbers and the nouveaus, people like Undine Spragg in ''The Custom of the Country,'' who arrives in New York from provincial Apex City, Kan., determined to rise up in society the old-fashioned way -- by marrying, which she does not just once but three times, if you count the one that was supposed to be a secret. One of the messages of the novel is that in America new money very quickly, in a generation or less, takes on the patina of old; another is that the class structure is necessarily propped up by deceit and double standards.
 But to a generation of writers after Wharton that structure -- the lives and mores of the rich, the well born and the climbers -- proved endlessly diverting. Young men and women on the make, and older ones trying anxiously to cling to their perch, throng an entire bookcase full of American fiction. 
 John O'Hara, for example, made a whole career of chronicling the upper and upper middle classes from before the First World War until after the Second, and no one ever observed more astutely the little clues that indicated precisely where one stood on the class ladder: the clubs and fraternity pins, the shoes, the shirt collars. J.P. Marquand pored over much the same territory and, like O'Hara, became both a popular and a critical success. Every now and then a racy book about lowlife -- ''Tobacco Road,'' for example -- would catch the public fancy, but for a surprisingly long time middle-brow fiction in America was about upper-middle-class life.
 What was the appeal? Vouyerism, in part. (It didn't hurt O'Hara's sales one bit that he saw it as part of his mission to inform us that upper-class people had very busy sex lives.) Fiction back then had a kind of documentary function; it was one of the places Americans went to learn about how other Americans lived. In time novels ceased to be so reportorial, and after World War II, moreover, as the middle class in America swelled in numbers and importance, the world of the upper crust lost some of its glamour and importance. 
 The old kind of class novel -- about striving and trying to move up by learning the upper-class code -- is still being written. ''Prep,'' a first novel by Curtis Sittenfeld, about an ambitious scholarship girl who finds herself in over her head, smoldering with class resentment, at a school that closely resembles Groton, recently became a surprise best seller. But more often the upper class is portrayed these days as a little beleaguered and merely trying to hang on, like the members of the New England family in Nancy Clark's 2003 novel ''The Hills at Home,'' all failures in one way or another, who have retreated back to the ancestral manor, or like Louis Auchincloss's WASPy lawyers and businessmen, who have a sense of themselves as the last of a breed.
 Elsewhere in the fictional landscape, a number of young writers -- short-story writers especially -- are still working in the afterglow of our once very hot literary romance with the world of Wal-Marts and trailer parks, so vividly evoked in the writing of Raymond Carver, Bobbie Ann Mason and Frederick Barthelme, among others. But to a considerable extent novels these days take place in a kind of all-purpose middle-class America, in neighborhoods that could be almost anyplace, and where the burdens are more psychic than economic, with people too busy tending to their faltering relationships to pay much attention to keeping up with the neighbors.
 It's a place where everyone fits in, more or less, but where, if you look hard enough, nobody feels really at home. Our last great middle-class hero, someone who really enjoyed his vacations and his country club, was John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom, and he died a premature death. Nowadays when a writer like Richard Russo, Russell Banks or Richard Price comes along, with an old-fashioned, almost Dickensian vision of life among the poor and working classes, it's a little startling; they seem like explorers who have returned from some distant land. 
 Novel reading is a middle-class pastime, which is another reason that novels have so often focused on the middle and upper classes. Mass entertainment is another matter, and when Hollywood took up the class theme, which it did in the 1930's, it made a crucial adjustment. During the Depression, the studios, which were mostly run by immigrant Jews, turned out a string of formulaic fantasies about life among the Gentile upper crust. 
 These movies were essentially twin variations on a single theme: either a rich young man falls for a working girl, as happens in, say, ''Easy Living,'' to take one of many examples, or an heiress takes up with a young man who has to work for a living (in a number of cases he's a newspaperman, which was Hollywood's idea of a truly disreputable profession back then). 
 Joan Crawford made a specialty of the working girl role, in movies like ''Sadie McKee'' and ''Dancing Lady,'' and also did the heiress in ''Love on the Run'' and ''I Live My Life.'' But the great example of this genre is ''It Happened One Night,'' with Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, who famously dispensed with wearing an undershirt.
 ''It Happened One Night'' implicitly answered the question of what an upper-class woman got in return for trading down: great sex. In other versions of the story the upper-class person is merely thawed and humanized by the poorer one, but in every case the exchange is seen as fair and equitable, with the lower-class character giving as much as he or she gets in return. Unlike the novels of class, with their anxieties and sense of unbridgeable gaps, these are stories of harmony and inclusion, and they added what proved to be an enduring twist on the American view of class: the notion that wealth and privilege are somewhat crippling conditions: if they don't make you an out-and-out twit, they leave you stiff, self-conscious and emotionally vacant until you are blessed with a little lower-class warmth and heart. 
 The formula persisted right up through movies like ''Love Story'' and ''Pretty Woman,'' though it seems to be in disuse now that films, like novels, are increasingly set in an upscale, well-scrubbed America where WASP's are an endangered, pitiable species. Like the in-laws in ''Meet the Fockers'' and ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding,'' they are still hopelessly uptight but not that wealthy anymore. 
 Television used to be fascinated with blue-collar life, in shows like ''The Honeymooners,'' ''All in the Family,'' ''Sanford and Son'' and ''Roseanne,'' but lately it too has turned its attention elsewhere. The only people who work on televison now are cops, doctors and lawyers, and they're so busy they seldom get to go home. The one vestige of the old curiosity about how other people live is in so-called reality television, when Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie drop in on rubes in ''The Simple Life,'' or when upper- and middle-class families trade moms on ''Wife Swap'' and experience a week of culture shock.
 But most reality television trades in a fantasy of sorts, based on the old game-show formula: the idea that you can be plucked out of ordinary life and anointed the new supermodel, the new diva, the new survivor, the new assistant to Donald Trump. You get an instant infusion of wealth and are simultaneously vested with something far more valuable: celebrity, which has become a kind of super-class in America, and one that renders all the old categories irrelevant.
 Celebrities, in fact, have inherited much of the glamour and sexiness that used to attach itself to the aristocracy. If Gatsby were to come back today, he would come back as Donald Trump and would want a date not with Daisy but with Britney. And if Edith Wharton were still writing, how could she not include a heavily blinged hip-hop mogul?
 But if the margins have shifted, and if fame, for example, now counts for more than breeding, what persists is the great American theme of longing, of wanting something more, or other, than what you were born with -- the wish not to rise in class so much as merely to become classy. If you believe the novels of Dickens or Thackeray, say, the people who feel most at home in Britain are those who know their place, and that has seldom been the case in this country, where the boundaries of class seem just elusive and permeable enough to sustain both the fear of falling and the dream of escape. 

About the Series

This article is the 10th part of a series examining the role of social class in America today. A team of reporters spent more than a year exploring ways that class -- defined as a combination of income, education, wealth and occupation -- influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of unbounded opportunity.

HEADLINE: Bangalore: Hot and Hotter

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: BANGALORE, INDIA 

 BODY:
Every time I visit India, Indians always ask me to compare India with China. Lately, I have responded like this: If India and China were both highways, the Chinese highway would be a six-lane, perfectly paved road, but with a huge speed bump off in the distance labeled ''Political reform: how in the world do we get from Communism to a more open society?'' When 1.3 billion people going 80 miles an hour hit a speed bump, one of two things happens: Either the car flies into the air and slams down, and all the parts hold together and it keeps on moving -- or the car flies into the air, slams down and all the wheels fall off. Which it will be with China, I don't know. India, by contrast, is like a highway full of potholes, with no sidewalks and half the streetlamps broken. But off in the distance, the road seems to smooth out, and if it does, this country will be a dynamo. The question is: Is that smoother road in the distance a mirage or the real thing? 
 At first blush, coming back to Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley, that smoother road seems like a mirage. The infrastructure here is still a total mess. But looks can be deceiving. Beneath the mess, Bangalore is entering a mature new phase as a technology center by starting to produce its own high-tech products, research, venture capital firms and start-ups.
 ''The ecosystem for innovation is now starting to be created here,'' said Nandan Nilekani, the C.E.O. of Infosys. For several years now, when venture capitalists funded companies in the U.S., they insisted that the R.&D. for the products be done in India. But now, increasingly, Western companies will come up with a new idea and then tell Infosys, Wipro or Tata, India's premier technology companies, to research, develop and produce the whole thing.
 As one Wipro executive put it, ''You go from solving my problem to serving my business to knowing my business to being my business.'' What will be left for the Western companies is the ''ideation,'' the original concept and design of a flagship product (which is a big deal), and then the sales and marketing. 
 ''We're going from a model of doing piecework to where the entire product and entire innovation stream is done by companies here,'' Mr. Nilekani added. All of this means that innovation will happen faster and cheaper, with much more global collaboration.
 The best indication that Bangalore is becoming hot is how many foreign techies -- non-Indians -- are now coming here to work. P.Anandan, an Indian-American who worked for Microsoft for 28 years in Redmond, Wash., just opened Microsoft's research center in Bangalore, which follows the ones in Redmond, Cambridge and Beijing.
 ''I have two non-Indians working for me here, one Japanese and one American, and they could work anywhere in the world,'' Mr. Anandan said. He added that when he got his engineering degree in India 28 years ago, all the competition was to get a job abroad. Now the fiercest competition is to get an I.T. job in India: ''It is no longer, 'Well I have to stay here,' but, 'Do I get a chance to stay here?''' 
 In the past year, Infosys received 9,600 applications from abroad, including from China, France and Germany, for internships, and it accepted 100. I asked one of these interns, Vicki Chen, a Chinese-American business student from the Claremont Colleges, why she came. ''All the business is coming to India, and I don't see why I shouldn't follow the business,'' she said. ''If this is where the center of gravity is, you should go check it out, and then you become more valuable.''
 Even more interesting is how Indian firms are taking the skills they learned from outsourcing and using them to develop low-cost products for the low-wage Indian market: a medical insurance plan for the poor for as little as $10 a year, a $2,000 car, a $200 laptop, supercheap cellphones, a low-fare airline ($75 one-way for the three-hour Bangalore-Delhi flight) that sells tickets from Internet kiosks in gas stations. Indian companies know that if they can make money producing low-cost technology for poor Indians, it gives them an incredible platform to then take these products global. (Imagine the profit potential if they work in the West?) China is doing the exact same thing.
 Indeed, I now understand why, when China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, visited India for the first time last April, he didn't fly into the capital, New Delhi -- as foreign leaders usually do. He flew directly from Beijing to Bangalore -- for a tech-tour -- and then went on to New Delhi.
 No U.S. president or vice president has ever visited Bangalore.

HEADLINE: After Lowering Goal, Army Falls Short on May Recruits

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT; Damien Cave contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
Even after reducing its recruiting target for May, the Army missed it by about 25 percent, Army officials said on Tuesday. The shortfall would have been even bigger had the Army stuck to its original goal for the month. 
 On Friday, the Army is expected to announce that it met only 75 percent of its recruiting goal for May, the fourth consecutive monthly shortfall in the number of new recruits sent to basic training. Just over 5,000 new recruits entered boot camp in May. 
 But the news could have appeared worse. Early last month, the Army, with no public notice, lowered its long-stated May goal to 6,700 recruits from 8,050. Compared with the original target, the Army achieved only 62.6 percent of its goal for the month. 
 Army officials defended the shift on Tuesday, saying it was not uncommon to change monthly goals at midyear. They said that the latest change reflected the reality that the Army was not going to meet its May goal, and that it made more sense to shift some of that quota to the summer months, traditionally a better season for recruiters to attract new high school graduates. 
 ''We typically reallocate monthly goals during the course of the year,'' said Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty, an Army spokesman, who said that the Army still expected to meet its overall annual goal of shipping 80,000 new recruits to boot camp. ''The summer is relatively easier for recruiting.'' 
 Because of a series of recent incidents in which Army recruiters were found to be breaking or bending rules to meet their monthly quotas, two senior Army officials acknowledged that the shift in May could leave the impression that the Army was playing ''a shell game'' with its recruiting figures, shifting its goals to make the numbers look better than they are. But the two officials, who were speaking on condition of anonymity because the monthly figures have not yet been made public, said that impression was not justified. 
 The Pentagon has delayed until Friday the public release of May recruiting figures for all the armed services, a decision some military officials say is an effort to minimize what has become a drumbeat of bad news for the Army and the Marine Corps at the beginning of each month. Previously, each service, as well as the National Guard and the Reserve, released their monthly figures on different days at the start of each month, with each gaining some media attention. 
 But a Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman, said, ''Any large organization with data that is of public interest would want to present it in a way that makes sense and is complete for the entire organization.'' 
 The Army's figures for May put the service about 8,300 soldiers behind its projected year-to-date number of enlistees sent to basic training by now. ''The trend line is going against them,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. 
 The Army has tried to reverse the trend by adding 1,000 recruiters since last September, starting a new advertising campaign, offering selected enlistment bonuses of more than $20,000 and pairing returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan with recruiters to attract soldiers. 
 Harvey Perritt, a spokesman for the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, said the original May quota was set months ago when officials expected an early surge in recruiting. That did not happen. By April, only 50 percent of the training positions at the Army's five major training centers were filled, down from 92 percent in the corresponding period a year earlier, Mr. Perritt said. The Army then reallocated some of the May quota. 
 ''The shifting of the goal suggests to me that the Army is aggressively working the problem and not passively sitting by and letting the mission slip away,'' said Beth J. Asch, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation.
 Two recruiters in the New York area, insisting on anonymity because the Army has ordered all recruiters not to talk to reporters, said their mission for June had not been changed, nor had the goals for July, August and September.
 One of the recruiters said he doubted that the summer would yield more recruits than the spring. ''The summer is supposed to be big, but I don't think it's going to happen,'' he said. ''I don't see much interest among the high school seniors.''
 To help offset the recruiting shortfalls, the Army is also trying to keep more soldiers. A memorandum from the Army's top personnel officer last month outlined a plan to reduce attrition among first-term enlistees by 1 percent, and retain 3,000 soldiers. 
 The memorandum, first reported last week by The Wall Street Journal, requires the approval of more senior-level brigade commanders, instead of battalion commanders, to discharge soldiers for pregnancy, drug or alcohol abuse, or poor fitness. 
 Colonel Hilferty said the Army was ahead of this year's goal to re-enlist 64,162 soldiers, which is 8,000 more than last year's target. Aided by tax-free re-enlistment bonuses, virtually every Army unit that has served or is serving in Iraq or Afghanistan has exceeded its re-enlistment goals in the past two years.

HEADLINE: Will It Take a Tariff to Free the Yuan?

BYLINE: By Charles E. Schumer and Lindsey O. Graham. 
Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, is the senior senator from New York. Lindsey O. Graham, a Republican, is the senior senator from South Carolina.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
DISMAYED by China's failure to play fair on free trade, we have offered legislation to impose a tariff on Chinese exports to the United States if Beijing continues to keep the value of its currency, the yuan, artificially low compared with the dollar. While our efforts to pressure China to change have been called protectionist, nothing could be further from the truth. Pushing China to reform is the free trade position. Those who favor the status quo are the real protectionists; they are protecting China. 
 China seems to want to obtain the benefits of free trade but not bear any of its responsibilities. Remember, a major tenet of free trade is that currencies need to be free to float in value against other currencies. When that happens, the free market self-corrects in the face of trade imbalances. 
 For example, the currency of the country with a trade deficit falls in value, causing imports to shrink (because they become more expensive) and its exports to rise (because they become cheaper). Eventually, this reduces the trade deficit. But if a currency is artificially fixed, the cost of exports and imports is distorted. 
 Since China artificially keeps the value of its currency low, American companies are placed at a competitive disadvantage with their Chinese counterparts. Furthermore, pegging a major trading country's currency to another country's, as China does with the dollar, throws the world's trading system out of balance. That is why the European Union and Japan also favor a revaluation of the yuan. 
 If China were simply a developing country that needed time to adjust to free trade, we could be more patient. But China is already a trading giant -- one whose political leadership, against the advice of its own Finance Ministry, seems more interested in accumulating wealth and maximizing exports than in competing fairly. 
 Indeed, China's mercantilist approach explains why currency is not the only area where Beijing fails to play by the rules. Beijing acquiesces in Chinese companies' appropriation of our intellectual property and routinely keeps American companies from selling products in China, in defiance of the World Trade Organization. But China's manipulation of currency is the most pressing complaint because it is at the nub of the world trading system. 
 China's manipulation has another unhappy effect: it undermines support for free trade. Globalization isn't easy. Jobs are phased out even as other jobs are created. When a major trading country like China can resist the rules in areas where America might gain jobs, it discourages our people from fully embracing free trade and causes them to fixate on the jobs that are lost.
 To us, the only real debate about currency is how to get China to play fair. At the administration's request, we withheld bringing our legislation to the floor for two years while our government tried the art of quiet diplomacy. But given the attitude of the Chinese leadership, it should come as no surprise that gentle persuasion has not worked.
 When our legislation finally came before the Senate in April as an amendment, it won bipartisan support. We agreed to withdraw the amendment with assurance that we would be guaranteed a vote by August. Since then, we have begun to see the first real signs of progress. The administration appears to be taking a tougher line on China, saying that Beijing's currency policies are ''highly distortionary,'' and the Chinese have begun to reconsider their currency manipulation. 
 However, the time has come for actions, not more words. That is why the Senate should pass our bill this summer, sending a signal to China. Our ultimate goal is not to impose a tariff on all Chinese exports, but to prod the Chinese to take the concrete steps to allow the yuan to float freely. Under our proposal, the Chinese would not have to float their currency immediately, but they should take immediate and concrete steps toward that goal. 
 We realize that our proposal is seen by many as strong medicine. But given that Chinese policies are unfair to American businesses and workers -- and that they jeopardize the increasingly important but fragile regime of global free trade -- we believe our strategy is the best way to insure that China finally plays by the rules.

HEADLINE: Talk of Linking China to Latin Trade Pact

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER; Robin Toner contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
Representative Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday that the House leadership was willing to sponsor legislation aimed at pressing China to obey trade laws if such a measure would help win passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.
 ''It's difficult to vote on any trade agreement without getting any movement on China,'' Mr. Thomas said at a speech before the United States Chamber of Commerce.
 Anger at China has become the recurring theme of much of this year's Congressional debate over globalization, outsourcing and trade. The country's economic behavior has faced increased scrutiny, whether the issue is the flood of textile exports or the violation of intellectual property rights including piracy of movies, software and luxury goods. 
 Mr. Thomas said the legislation he would support would require China to let its currency fluctuate, a problem that has risen to the forefront.
 The United States trade deficit with China reached $162 billion last year, the largest imbalance ever recorded by the United States with a single country. It led first Democrats, and now some Republicans, to ask the administration to push China to revalue its currency, which is blamed for the poor performance of American exports.
 But Democratic leaders who favor free trade but oppose Cafta say that promoting a remedy for China's currency will not change their minds.
 Instead, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Trade of the House Ways and Means Committee, said any link between Cafta and China would weaken the United States position.
 ''We should have had remedies for China's currency problem before now, but legally you can't link it to Cafta,'' he said. ''And it will only weaken our position with China.''
 With Congress moving closer to enacting some legislation on China, the White House said that such action was unnecessary since the administration was committed to ensuring that China followed trade laws. 
 Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said the administration thought the best approach was to let Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, and other members of the administration make ''it clear to China what our concerns are.''
 ''We're also going to continue acting to make sure that the playing field is level for our farmers and for our producers and for our businesses,'' Mr. McClellan said. Republicans and Democrats agree that the administration does not have the votes to pass Cafta, the centerpiece of its trade agenda. Mr. Thomas said he also wanted to add money to the legislation to help the five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic better enforce and monitor the pact's labor provisions.
 Democrats are unusually united in their opposition to the pact with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and many cite the labor provisions as too weak.
 Mr. Thomas said that on the contrary, the labor provisions were the best of any United States trade agreement. Moreover, he said, the United States needs ''to have low-cost labor'' in nearby countries.
 What will persuade China to change its currency was debated in at a separate hearing on Tuesday by the Banking Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance.
 Randal Quarles, the acting under secretary of Treasury for international affairs, told the subcommittee that the administration thought that its discussions with China about its exchange rates had been fruitful and that China was preparing to move on the issue. 
 But C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, disagreed and said that it was time for the International Monetary Fund to step in and enforce international rules prohibiting manipulation of currency. 
 Mr. Bergsten said that the United States trade deficit would decrease by as much as $60 billion by raising the value of the Chinese currency by 25 percent.
 But there is serious debate about the economic impact of China's increasing the value of its currency and Mr. Thomas deplored the fact that China has become the all-purpose scapegoat. 
 The Senate is expected to vote next month on a bill that would impose tariffs of up to 27.5 percent on all Chinese imports if China fails to let its currency float more freely. The measure, which was sponsored by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Lindsey O. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, reflected what its sponsors said was the depth of anxiety over China's trade practices. 
 Mr. Thomas said the House could come up with its own bill on currency.
 Surveying the economic legislation facing Congress this summer -- the energy bill, Social Security, the highway bill and Cafta -- Mr. Thomas raised the issue of heath care. 
 He argued that the problems in health care were a direct result of the comprehensive benefit plans that emerged after World War II, which insulated the consumer from the cost of services. 
 He said that such plans had created ''ignorant consumers'' with few incentives to ask ''what are you doing to me and how much does it cost,'' but rather, ''does my insurance cover it.'' 
 He said he would work to ''empower consumers'' with more information, and new incentives through devices like health savings accounts.

HEADLINE: Rights Group Calls Deadly Uzbek Crackdown a 'Massacre'

BYLINE: By C.J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 7 

 BODY:
Uzbekistan's crackdown on a prison break and mass protest last month has been labeled a massacre in a report by a prominent human rights group, which says responsibility for many of the deaths lies with the Uzbek government.
 The group, Human Rights Watch, based in New York, issued the report on Tuesday, providing the most extensive independent review to date of the failed uprising in the northeastern Uzbek city of Andijon.
 Drawing from interviews with more than 50 witnesses, it corroborates and expands upon previous reports of a brief armed revolt that became an antigovernment protest, which the authorities broke up with rifle and machine-gun fire.
 The report also provides accounts from two witnesses of Uzbek troops moving among the bodies on the street the morning after the crackdown, shooting wounded people who had survived the night. ''There was a systematic effort to slaughter,'' said Kenneth Roth, the organization's executive director. 
 The violence in Andijon on May 13 has fueled renewed worries about the stability of Uzbekistan, a repressive post-Soviet state that is an ally of the Bush administration in the fighting in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism efforts. 
 With the release of the report, Human Rights Watch renewed calls by several international organizations and Western governments for an independent investigation.
 Uzbekistan had flatly refused to allow such an investigation in the weeks after the crackdown but has since signaled it might offer limited cooperation. State Department officials say they are not yet sure what degree of cooperation the Uzbek government would consent to. 
 Human Rights Watch also urged the United States to suspend negotiations for a long-term American presence at the Uzbek air base, situated near the Afghan border, unless Uzbekistan accepted an investigation. ''There is something unseemly, to say the least, about negotiations for a base agreement with a country that has just massacred hundreds of its own citizens,'' Mr. Roth said.
 Also on Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Geneva-based aid organization, announced that it still had not yet been able to get access to those injured and arrested in the crackdown, in spite of repeated attempts. 
 The committee noted that many Uzbeks still do not know whether their missing kin are dead or injured or were arrested or fled. It said a response from the Uzbek government ''has become urgent.'' 
 The Uzbek government has shown flashes of intransigence toward Western organizations in recent weeks. On Monday the United States Peace Corps announced that it had suspended its program in the country after the Uzbek Foreign Ministry denied visas to the corps' volunteers.
 Uzbekistan, strategically situated but economically underdeveloped, has been racked by ruinous economic policies, corruption, clan rule and harsh restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and conscience. The United Nations has criticized it for its extensive use of torture.
 Since the crackdown, it has defended itself with a mix of defiance and blame directed at the armed men who raided the prison. 
 Human Rights Watch said those men, whose number it estimated at 50 to 100, had committed serious crimes. But it said the government response was indiscriminate and out of proportion. 
 The report echoed another independent report, written by the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, which found no public evidence that the revolt was led by Islamic extremist groups or had religious aims.
 The Uzbek president, Islam A. Karimov, has insisted, without providing public evidence, that the uprising was carried out by international terrorist groups that seek to create an Islamic state. Human Rights Watch said it found no evidence of the president's assertion.
 ''The protesters spoke about economic conditions in Andijon, government repression and unfair trials and not the creation of an Islamic state,'' the report says. It described the crowd as shouting ''Freedom!'' and not ''God is Great!''
 Spokesmen for Uzbekistan's Foreign Ministry did not return several phone calls on Tuesday.
 Mr. Roth said an investigation would be important in part because many details of the uprising remained unknown, including the number of victims, the identities of all the armed units present at the crackdown and the nature and origin of orders given to troops who fired into the crowds.
 Human Rights Watch did not estimate the number of dead, and avoided endorsing opposition accounts of as many as 745 dead civilians, which have not been independently verified. But it dismissed the official Uzbek claim of 173 dead, writing that ''hundreds'' were killed on one street alone.
 The report also noted Uzbek efforts to restrict the flow of information about the crackdown, and to intimidate and harass witnesses. 
 Fears for the safety of witnesses have intensified since a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty correspondent's report last month of being led by a local guide to a mass grave outside Andijon; the next day, the radio service said, the guide was fatally stabbed.
 There have also been broader fears about safety for Westerners in the country. Last week, the American Embassy in Uzbekistan authorized the departure of nonessential embassy staff and family members, citing new terrorist threats. 
 On Tuesday, the embassy expanded the warning, advising embassy personnel not to send their children to school for the rest of the school year.

HEADLINE: Arms Fiascoes Lead to Alarm Inside Pentagon

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

 BODY:
Nine years ago, the Navy set out to build a new guided missile for its 21st-century ships. Fiascoes followed. In a test firing, the missile melted its on-board guidance system. ''Incredibly,'' an Army review said, ''the Navy ruled the test a success.''
 Recently, the Navy rewrote the contract and put out another one, with little to show for the money it already spent. The bill has come to almost $400 million, five times the original budget.
 Such stories may seem old hat. But after years of failing to control cost overruns, the most powerful officials at the Pentagon are becoming increasingly alarmed that the machinery for building weapons is breaking down under its own weight. 
 ''Something's wrong with the system,'' Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld recently told Congress.
 The Pentagon has more than 80 major new weapons systems under development, which is ''a lot more programs than we can afford,'' a senior Air Force official, Blaise J. Durante, said. Their combined cost, already $300 billion over budget, is $1.47 trillion and climbing. 
 In the civilian world, next-generation technologies, like cellphones and computers, rarely cost much more than their predecessors. But the Pentagon's new planes and ships are costing three, four and five times as much as the weapons they will replace. As prices soar, the number of new weapons that the American military can afford shrinks, even with the biggest budget in decades. 
 ''We're No. 1 in the world in military capabilities,'' said David M. Walker, who runs the Government Accountability Office, the budget overseer for Congress. ''But on the business side, the Defense Department gets a D -- giving them the benefit of the doubt. If they were a business, they wouldn't be in business.''
 Neither the Pentagon nor Congress nor the weapons contractors have any prescription to cure the problem. But in interviews and public testimony, military leaders, arms makers and government auditors generally agreed on why the nation's arsenal costs so much.
 They said the military conjures up dream weapons, like the Extended Range Guided Munition that the Navy had such trouble with. It sets immensely expensive technological requirements that are far beyond the state of the art of war, weapons executives say. Officials at the handful of major military contractors cross their fingers and promise to fulfill those visions. 
 Almost no one flatly rejects the wish list for weapons and requirements. The military adds new technologies to many weapons already under development. Those systems add complexity and weight, which add costs to planes, ships and tanks.
 Military officials routinely understate the anticipated costs of weapons, said Winslow T. Wheeler, who analyzed armaments spending as a Senate staff member advising both Republicans and Democrats for 31 years. 
 When costs rise far beyond the promised ceilings, he said, almost no one takes responsibility. 
 Oversight is dwindling, Pentagon officials acknowledge. While the dollar value of weapons contracts doubled over the last decade, the Pentagon halved the size of the work force that polices their costs. The government work of managing the design, development and production of weapons has been largely outsourced to the weapons contractors themselves. 
 Technological troubles add billions to the cost of armaments, Congressional auditors said. But no one knows precisely how much, since the Pentagon often cannot keep track of the money it spends.
 Testing is often unrealistic, the equivalent of an open-book exam. For example, Pentagon officials overseeing the 22-year, $100 billion effort to build a missile defense say the program has not passed realistic tests. It is an example, one among many, of daunting weapons technology taking two decades or more to produce -- and time is money.
 Finally, the costs of new weapons are sometimes concealed by secrecy and creative bookkeeping. 
 They now total nearly $148 billion a year, and almost one in five of those dollars is hidden from public view, in the classified ''black budget.'' 
 Of that amount, research and development spending on new weapons has gone up 77 percent since 2000, and now totals $69 billion a year. The price of buying new weapons is scheduled to rise nearly 50 percent, to almost $119 billion annually in 2011, from $78 billion today. 
 ''The Pentagon does get it right from time to time,'' Mr. Walker, the Congressional auditing chief, said. ''There have been some systems where things have gone well. Unfortunately, that's tended to be the exception rather than the rule.''
 The military gets only a fraction of the bang for the buck it once did, the Air Force chief of staff, Gen. John P. Jumper, said. ''We have got to do something about it,'' General Jumper said in an interview, calling for ''a national debate'' on the costs of weapons. The Navy's top admiral, Vern Clark, echoes that view.
 Franklin C. Spinney, who spent three decades at the Pentagon analyzing the cost of weapons, said their growing costs constituted ''a time bomb with a slow fuse that is now going off.'' 
 ''No one has a clue what it will all cost,'' Mr. Spinney added. 
 The cost of many weapons is growing faster than the Pentagon's budget authorization of $442 billion, which has increased almost 35 percent above inflation in the last six years. ''When you add money to the budget, the contractors' costs go up just as fast as you can add it,'' he said. ''As costs go up, production rates decline,'' providing less value for each dollar spent.
 Some members of Congressional armed services and appropriations committees have raised alarms about the Army's Future Combat System, a network of 18 weapons and vehicles for about 45,000 soldiers. First advertised at $78 billion, it may cost nearly twice that. 
 They worry aloud that the Navy's DD(X) destroyers are crushingly expensive at roughly $20 billion for as few as five ships. Navy requirements for the ships added thousands of tons of weight, and billions in costs.
 They asked why the Air Force needed three different new jet fighters, including the F-22. That program was first sold, more than two decades ago, as 760 planes for $35 million each. It is now planned for about 180 jets, costing at least $330 million each. 
 Congress has continued to conduct business as usual, approving more money for more armaments programs, including some the military does not want. These include C130 transport planes, which cost 500 percent more today, adjusted for inflation, than they did in the 1980's. Lawmakers also pressed the Pentagon to spend $23 billion to lease refueling tankers from Boeing until the prosecution of senior Air Force and Boeing officials put the program on hold.
 Senior uniformed officers and top military contractors pointed to the ''requirements process'' -- the conception and birth of ideas for new weapons -- as a key to the problem.
 General Jumper said requirements often exceeded realities. ''We have to make sure we are controlling requirements,'' he said. A senior executive at a major military contractor said the Pentagon had yet to impose that self-control.
 The Army, Navy and Air Force ''push the technology beyond what a contractor is capable of achieving,'' said the executive, a former weapons-buying official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 Yet the contractors say, ''We can do it!'' the executive continued. ''Why? Because you're competing with another guy who says he can do it.''
 Mr. Wheeler, the longtime Senate analyst, said the requirements system served ''to feed the technological dreams of an overactive bureaucracy.'' 
 ''Nobody's saying 'no' to new weapons proposals in Congress, at the uniformed military services or at the Pentagon,'' he said. ''The system is out of control because nobody's controlling it.''
 After a decade of mergers and acquisitions, just a handful of military-contracting giants are left to handle the bulk of the work. Only General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman now build Navy warships. 
 Billions of dollars for that work are allocated between them, not competitively bid, Admiral Clark said. The danger, General Jumper said, is that concentration and consolidation could distort the costs and capabilities of Air Force planes and other multibillion-dollar armaments. 
 '' The promise,'' he said, ''was that the newly consolidated companies would be endowed with core competencies, and we could turn over quality control'' to the contractors. 
 ''The results have not been there,'' General Jumper added, raising the question of whether ''leaving it all up to industry without the right oversight on costing and pricing'' was a good idea. Several industry executives voiced similar doubts. 
 The Pentagon dismissed its own auditors in the name of ''acquisition reform,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''They thought they were copying private-enterprise practices by removing this monitoring bureaucracy.'' 
 The old bureaucracy ''was a pain in the neck to deal with,'' he added. ''But without them, things are much worse. Things are taking even longer. Cost growth has accelerated. And performance degradations have gotten worse.''
 When weapons finally move from the drawing board to the assembly line, the military services employ a practice Mr. Walker calls ''plug and pray.'' ''They plug how many they can buy with the amount of money they have,'' he said. ''Then they pray that they'll get more money in order to be able to buy more.''
 But by then, he warned, many weapons of the future may prove too costly to bear.
 ''There's no way we're going to be able to afford them,'' Mr. Walker said. ''We're going to have to rationalize what people want and reconcile it against what we really need, and what we can afford, and what we can sustain.''

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Ever-Shrinking Labor Force

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Eric O'Keefe, in Arlington, Tex., and Aaron Nathans, in Janesville, Wis., contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., June 7 

 BODY:
Jayne Atwell describes herself as a ''G.M. gypsy,'' a name General Motors workers have for people who have been shuffled from plant to plant over the years as the company has closed factories and cut its labor force.
 ''I've had five plants in the last 10 years and I'm still hanging in there,'' said Ms. Atwell, 42, who now builds dashboards at the G.M. Flint Truck Assembly plant here.
 For Ms. Atwell and many other G.M. workers in Flint, the prospect of deeper cuts to the company's labor force was not a matter of if, but when. So on Tuesday, when word spread that G.M. plans to eliminate more than 20 percent of its blue-collar jobs in the United States, it made more of a rustle than a thud. 
 ''I just more or less roll with the punches,'' Ms. Atwell added as she was getting into her Chevrolet Trailblazer after her shift. ''I live on my faith, and God is going to take care of it one way or another.'' 
 Barney Morgan, who has worked for G.M. for 28 years, said he was used to watching the number of workers around him shrink. At G.M.'s Flint Metal Center, where Mr. Morgan is a crane operator, the number of jobs is down about a third since 1998, when the plant had close to 3,400 employees. 
 ''We're downsizing everywhere,'' Mr. Morgan added. ''What used to take 15 people to run now takes 6 or 7.''
 The news that G.M. will shed even more jobs was not a surprise, he said. ''We knew it was coming.'' 
 Workers at the Flint Metal Center, which makes sheet metal pieces for cars and trucks, know a bit about strife with G.M. management over jobs. In the summer of 1998, a strike at this factory and another across town brought G.M.'s North American operations to a halt. For nearly eight weeks, 9,200 striking workers here held up G.M.'s vehicle production, forcing the company to shut almost all of its North American factories for much of the summer and to temporarily lay off almost 200,000 workers.
 G.M. has not said where this latest round of employee cutbacks will hit the hardest or which factories will close. But in Flint, many workers said they had reluctantly grown to accept the fact that job insecurity comes with working in the auto industry these days. 
 ''It's not like it used to be,'' said Bridget Campbell, 49, a welder at Flint Metal who has worked for G.M. for 27 years. ''When I hired in, just about everybody could get a job. Nowadays, you have to know somebody to get in.'' Ms. Campbell, who has three years left before retirement, said she hoped she would still have a job that long. ''I'm just looking to make my last three years.'' 
 At G.M. plants across the country on Tuesday, workers shrugged off news of the job cuts. For many, it was not the first time they had heard the company was reducing its work force. 
 ''I've been here 29 years; they've been about to close this plant since I started; we just take it as it comes,'' said Ron Pohlman, 49, a worker at the assembly plant in Janesville, Wis., where 3,900 employees make some of the company's most profitable sport utility vehicles like the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet Tahoe.
 C.E. Williams, 55, a supervisor at the S.U.V. plant in Arlington, Tex., which has a total of 2,800 employees, said simply: ''No guarantees in this business.'' Mr. Williams, who has worked for G.M. since 1976, said he viewed the cutbacks as a regular part of doing business. ''Most big companies get a crisis attitude when things go wrong -- happens every five or six years. They talk about downsizing, cost of benefits.''
 Like many G.M. employees with decades of seniority, 61-year-old Jim Palso, a millwright at Flint Metal, said he was confident his job was safe. ''I haven't got any discomfort,'' he said. ''I've got 38 years, so they wouldn't try to lay me off.''
 Manny Salazar, 47, the communication coordinator for the United Automobile Workers at the Arlington plant, expressed optimism that the plant would remain open but did offer a note of caution about demand for large S.U.V.'s.
 ''They've been out there in the market for five, six years now,'' he said. ''People want a change. People like change. And look at the price of gas? I don't care how much money you make, everyone notices how high the price has gone, don't they?'' 
 Few G.M. employees expressed outright concern about losing their jobs, but it seemed the possibility had crossed many workers' minds.
 Chuck Peters, a painter at Flint Metal who also owns a tanning salon in nearby Grand Blanc, said that as a business owner, he knew just how bad the economy was. He has seen business slow lately, he said, because people in the area have less money for luxuries like electric tanning. 
 ''Everybody is downsizing, everybody is reorganizing,'' Mr. Peters, 45, said. ''It's cyclical and it's something that everyone has to go through. 
 Mr. Peters described as inevitable either a reduction in pay or a cut in benefits, if not both. ''What else are you going to do?'' he said. ''I'd rather not have to, but I don't have a choice.''
 Mr. Pohlman, the Janesville worker, said he worried about the younger G.M. workers who do not have seniority to fall back on and may be forced to leave Janesville if they are laid off. ''Nobody wants to leave their family, friends, favorite hunting and fishing spot,'' he said.
 Mr. Williams, the supervisor in Arlington, said he knew that no plant, including his, was ever bulletproof. ''I don't think you're ever totally comfortable,'' he said.
 Other workers were preparing themselves for a transfer to another plant, one possibility for workers in plants that G.M. will close. 
 ''If they tell me I've got to go to Illinois or something, then I'd be a little upset,'' said Ms. Atwell, the self-described G.M. gypsy. ''I just try not to think about it.''

HEADLINE: House Ethics Chief Is Tied to Lobby Figures

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
Newly disclosed lobbying records and other documents show that the chairman of the House ethics committee, Doc Hastings, a Washington State Republican, has had a close relationship for years with lobbyists at the Seattle-based law firm that is at the center of ethics accusations involving Tom DeLay, the House majority leader. 
 The records from the law firm, Preston Gates & Ellis, show that the firm's former star lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, a close friend of Mr. DeLay who is now the focus of a federal corruption investigation, boasted to a client in the mid-1990's that the firm had ''excellent'' ties to Mr. Hastings. The firm repeatedly billed the client for meetings and telephone conversations between Mr. Abramoff's lobbying team and Mr. Hastings's staff. 
 The records do not show any direct contact between Mr. Hastings and Mr. Abramoff; the contacts were always with others in Mr. Abramoff's lobbying operation. The billing records, which were obtained by The New York Times from the Northern Marianas government, do not show that Mr. Hastings introduced any legislation or cast any vote requested by Preston Gates. 
 But they do show that Preston Gates pressed Mr. Hastings and his staff several years ago for help on behalf of Mr. Abramoff's most important lobbying client at the time, the government of the Northern Mariana Islands, a small American commonwealth in the Pacific, in blocking the imposition of the federal minimum wage on the islands' clothing factories; human rights groups have long described the factories as sweatshops.
 A spokesman for Mr. Hastings, a six-term House member who was named chairman of the ethics panel in February, said that the lawmaker and his staff had been in regular contact with Preston Gates lobbyists since Mr. Abramoff left the firm in 2001. 
 The spokesman, Ed Cassidy, the congressman's chief of staff, said such contacts were routine since Preston Gates is ''one of our home-state firms'' and ''represents important community interests'' in Mr. Hastings's district.
 Federal Election Commission records show that the firm and its partners have been consistent campaign contributors to Mr. Hastings, donating more than $14,000 since he entered Congress a decade ago, $1,000 of that from Mr. Abramoff.
 Ethics watchdog groups said they were surprised to learn of how closely and for how long Mr. Hastings and his staff had worked with Preston Gates, which reaped millions of dollars in fees from the Northern Marianas and other lobbying clients brought to the firm by Mr. Abramoff.
 ''This totally reaffirms the need for an outside counsel in the case against DeLay,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a group that has called on the ethics committee to appoint an outside investigator for the majority leader. ''At a minimum there are several potential conflicts of interest here, given Representative Hastings's relationship with both the law firm and, possibly, with Abramoff.''
 Last month, two other Republican members of the ethics committee recused themselves from any investigation of Mr. DeLay because they had contributed to the majority leader's legal defense fund. 
 The firm's billing records show that after lobbying contacts on behalf of the Northern Marianas in 1996, Mr. Hastings placed statements in The Congressional Record in opposition to the minimum-wage proposal; he praised the islands' government for ''moving in the right direction toward self-sufficiency.'' 
 Mr. Cassidy, the chief of staff, said Mr. Hastings was barred from commenting on whether he faced a conflict of interest on the ethics committee on issues involving Preston Gates, since the comments might be seen as a reference to an investigation before the panel.
 But he described the relationship between the congressman and the law firm as routine, and insisted that there had never been any lobbying contact of any sort with Mr. Abramoff. He said that Mr. Hastings did not know what Mr. Abramoff looked like until his photograph appeared in damaging newspaper accounts last year about his lobbying activities. 
 ''Until we saw his picture in the paper, we wouldn't have known Jack Abramoff from Jack and the Beanstalk,'' Mr. Cassidy said. ''Neither Chairman Hastings nor I -- nor to our knowledge any member of our staff -- has ever met or spoken with Abramoff or taken any action at his request.''
 Mr. Hastings was handpicked by Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to be chairman of the ethics committee. The panel has been unable to open any investigation this year -- of Mr. DeLay or any other House member -- because of the disputes between Mr. Hastings and the committee's Democrats. 
 Mr. DeLay has said he is willing to meet with the ethics panel to resolve allegations made against him recently by Democratic opponents over his ties to Mr. Abramoff, who while at Preston Gates arranged lavish overseas trips for Mr. DeLay, including one to the Marianas in 1997. 
 It was at Preston Gates that Mr. Abramoff established his reputation as one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington and where he solidified his relationship with Mr. DeLay, who in the past has described Mr. Abramoff as among his ''closest and dearest friends.'' 
 In a statement, Preston Gates suggested that there was nothing unusual about its lobbying contacts with Mr. Hastings. ''We have the largest lobbying practice of any Pacific Northwest law firm,'' it said. ''We have relationships with and support every member of the Pacific Northwest delegations.''
 Although Mr. Hastings has had repeated contacts with the firm's lobbyists over the years, the billing records from the Northern Marianas show that he was a special target of Mr. Abramoff's lobbying team in 1996, when Mr. Hastings was a junior member of a House Resources subcommittee that had jurisdiction over the Northern Marianas.
 The records show repeated lobbying contacts in June and July of 1996, when Preston Gates was eager to have Mr. Hastings take action in support of the Northern Marianas government in blocking the minimum-wage proposal.
 According to the records, there was a flurry of contacts in the days before and after a June 26, 1996, subcommittee hearing, including a June 20 meeting with an aide to Mr. Hastings at which a Preston Gates lobbyist discussed proposed questions for the lawmaker to ask at the hearing.
 A transcript of the hearing shows that in brief remarks, Mr. Hastings said he had a ''particular interest'' in hearing from witnesses about the Northern Marianas and then introduced a prepared statement into the record in which he praised the islands' government for ''moving in the right direction toward self-sufficiency'' and warned that the imposition of the minimum wage ''could crush its fragile economy.'' 
 At the hearing, he also asked that an opinion article that had been published in The Washington Times in support the position of Northern Marianas government on labor issues be placed in The Congressional Record; the billing records show that the article's author was a paid consultant to Preston Gates.
 Mr. Cassidy, the spokesman, said Mr. Hastings had no idea that the author was affiliated with Preston Gates, adding that the lawmaker ''reads that paper every day, rain or shine, and doesn't typically call up the columnists to ask who paid their salaries that week.''

HEADLINE: Polishing Up Chicago's Theater District

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
The final phase of a decade-long effort to establish a theater district in the Loop, the central business district here, has begun with a $36 million project to restore the historic Shubert Theater and to convert the upper floors of the Majestic Building, which houses the Shubert, into a hotel. 
 The Shubert has been a prime venue for Broadway shows -- including ''South Pacific,'' ''A Chorus Line'' and ''Rent'' -- and most recently for the pre-Broadway run of ''Monty Python's Spamalot.'' 
 The Nederlander Organization, which has owned the Majestic Building, at 22 West Monroe Street, since 1991, is renovating it in partnership with the Northern Realty Group, a Chicago-based real estate services firm that both develops and manages properties. Nederlander will retain ownership of the theater and will be part owner of the hotel, along with Northern and its hotel partner, First Hospitality Group of Rosemont, Ill. 
 ''There is no question that Chicago is finding a very unique place within the theater industry,'' said Lou Raizin, vice president of the Nederlander Organization. ''This is an evolution that has been taking place over the last several years that to a large degree has been brought about by the city's commitment to creating a theater district.'' 
 Denise Casalino, the city's planning commissioner, said the new district had already blossomed. ''This is something Chicago has never really had before,'' Ms. Casalino said. ''In the past, the Loop was offices and Randolph Street had some movie theaters, which finally became pretty seedy. Now, however, it's a very lively entertainment district.''
 The financial side of the project is complex, involving a $5.5 million tax increment financing grant from the city, the sale of a facade easement donation and various tax credits.
 ''It was relatively easy to make financial decisions about the hotel,'' said Michael Tobin, a managing principal with the Northern Realty Group. ''The theater, however, is a different story. A lot of time has been spent figuring out what needs to be done in order to operate the theater in a first-class manner, and a lot of decisions have been made that cannot be justified solely on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis.''
 In addition, the developers have sold the naming rights to the theater to the LaSalle Bank Corporation, a Chicago-based subsidiary of ABN Amro Bank, a large Netherlands-based bank. When the theater reopens this fall, it will be known as the LaSalle Bank Theater. 
 ''We live or die on the success of our bank in Chicago and anything we can do to restore or build or encourage the cultural and economic viability of this community raises our profile in a very good way,'' said Norman Bobins, president and chief executive of the bank. 
 The Shubert -- originally the Majestic Theater -- opened on New Year's Day in 1906 as a vaudeville house. It was closed for 13 years during the Depression, and reopened in 1945 as a legitimate theater after being acquired, and renamed, by the Shubert Organization in New York. 
 Mr. Raizin noted that aside from routine maintenance very little had been done to the building for many years. The highlights of the restoration include installing an elevator as well as restoring and expanding the lobby and other public spaces. One of the biggest surprises so far came with the removal of a dropped ceiling in the outer lobby, revealing a two-story space ringed with classical colonnades.
 The architect for the project is Laurence Booth of Booth Hansen, a local firm noted for its innovative historical restoration work. 
 The hotel phase of the project, which involves gutting the top 17 floors of the 20-story building, will not be finished until late spring of 2006. The plan is for a midprice Hampton Inn of about 160 rooms. 
 ''It's the direction hotels are going in these days for business travelers, and we like the combination of a hotel and a theater because it allows us to book packages that will help the hotel on weekends,'' Mr. Tobin said. 
 The project gets good marks from hotel analysts. ''The location is good and over the long term is going to get better,'' said Melinda McKay, senior vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate services firm here. ''There's a lot of development going on in that area.''
 Ms. McKay added that the local hotel market is reviving after declining in the wake of 9/11. ''I'm very bullish on Chicago,'' she said. ''A number of hotels had good first quarters. The performance has definitely turned a corner.''
 In the early 1990's, the city developed a plan for a live-theater district on and near Randolph Street in the Loop that included renovating four historic theaters -- the Chicago, the Oriental (now the Ford Center for the Performing Arts/Oriental Theater), the Palace (now the Cadillac Palace) and the Shubert -- as well as constructing a new home for the Goodman Theater, the city's oldest and largest nonprofit theater. 
 Along the way, the city awarded tax increment financing grants worth about $55 million to developers to get the projects started. All but the Shubert have now been completed.
 ''Within a 30-square-block area, you have the theater district, the opera, the symphony, the Art Institute and Millennium Park,'' said Roche Schulfer, executive director of the Goodman Theater, whose new $44 million two theater complex at Randolph and Dearborn Streets opened in 2000. ''It's an example of a city that said the arts are important to the health of downtown and that put its money where its rhetoric is.''
 According to the League of Chicago Theaters, a trade association, the downtown area now has more than 22,000 live theater seats, up from 14,000 before the creation of the theater district. 
 The project also consolidates the leading position that Broadway in Chicago, a joint partnership of the Nederlander Organization and Clear Channel Entertainment, has in the theater district. Broadway in Chicago, which owns or controls four of the leading downtown houses for live theater, was founded five years ago to handle the booking and management. Clear Channel Entertainment owns the Ford Center for the Performing Arts/Oriental Theater and is co-owner -- with Nederlander -- of the Cadillac Palace. Broadway In Chicago also handles theatrical bookings for the Auditorium Theater, which is owned by Roosevelt University. 
 One goal of the partnership has been to establish Chicago as an ideal locale for trying out new productions.
 ''The whole concept of out-of-town tryouts has been very successful in Chicago,'' said David Anderson, president and chief operating officer for Clear Channel Entertainment's theatrical North American division. ''The ability to try things out, see what works and what doesn't work in a sophisticated market and in a first-rate technical theater that mirrors what they're going to experience in New York'' is invaluable for producers, he added.
 William Haber, a producer of ''Monty Python's Spamalot,'' said: ''We had a wonderful experience there and are looking forward to going back. The audiences are very honest, open and willing to let you try new things.''
 In fact, Mr. Haber plans to return next fall. The first production to play the newly renovated Shubert will be the pre-Broadway run of Mr. Haber's production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''Woman in White.''

HEADLINE: Appetite For Stocks Slackening In China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Wednesday, June 8 

 BODY:
Investors are showing signs of losing interest in Chinese stocks just as investment banks are preparing a long list of Chinese initial public offerings. That combination could make it hard to sell all the shares coming to market and could slow China's efforts to privatize its state-owned industries.
 Delays in Chinese initial public offerings could also set back big banks like Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS. China has become the world's second-largest generator of investment banking fees for such offerings, ahead of Europe but behind the United States. All of these banks have been successful lately in winning the right to sponsor such offerings, most of them done in Hong Kong. 
 The world's largest initial public offering so far this year, the China Shenhua Energy Company, a big coal mining concern seeking to raise $3.6 billion, attracted lukewarm demand as bidding closed Tuesday, with lower oversubscription rates than seen on big China issues last year. It was expected to be priced toward the low end of expectations at a meeting in New York. 
 Earlier Tuesday, the China Minsheng Banking Corporation, the largest bank in China organized by private investors, unexpectedly canceled meetings here to promote its $800 million offering to investors. The stock sale was previously planned for early July. And on Monday, the Bank of Communications, China's fifth-largest state-owned bank, disclosed a lower price range than expected for its $1.9 billion initial public offering on June 23.
 Even money managers at funds specializing in China stocks are expressing worry about a glut of offerings. ''I really think it's too much, particularly given that the market is not performing that well,'' said Romeo Dator, the portfolio manager of the U.S. Global China Region Opportunity Fund in San Antonio. ''We're not planning to participate in any of these.''
 Some money managers see a broad decline in enthusiasm for China. Wary of trade disputes with the United States and possible Chinese interest rate increases, and weary of stagnant prices here and eight-year lows on the Shanghai stock market, investors are steering more money toward other emerging markets.
 ''By and large, the fascination with China has waned'' in the last several months, said Choo Yoon-lai, the portfolio manager of the Comgest Growth Greater China Fund here.
 Leaders of the biggest investment banks in Asia, all based here, said in interviews over the last week that they knew the risks of bringing big initial public offerings to market now, but still thought they could find buyers.
 ''Investors love China. These offerings are the growth of China, and when priced appropriately, can be'' completed, said Robert Morse, the chief executive of Citigroup's corporate and investment banking operations in Asia. But Mr. Morse also acknowledged that some investors, large and small, were looking at the China stakes they had accumulated after years of large initial public offerings by Chinese companies.
 ''Investors want to make sure they don't put too many eggs in one basket,'' he said. ''Individual investors have to define what aggregate exposure they want for China relative to other Asian opportunities.'' 
 Gokul Laroia, the head of Asian capital markets for Morgan Stanley, said investors were cautious about some companies but still interested in Chinese stocks.
 ''It's entirely deal-specific,'' he said. ''We don't sense China fatigue.''
 Some investment bankers say it is not new for Chinese companies to be selling a lot of shares, as the country's gradual transition from central planning to capitalism has inevitably meant putting many shares into private hands.
 ''There is a lot of Chinese paper, but historically there has been a lot of Chinese paper coming to the market,'' said Matthew Koder, UBS's head of Asian equity capital markets. ''Is there too much paper coming? Not really.''
 The Shenhua Energy deal was oversubscribed by at least four times by institutional investors and by at least 15 times by retail investors, bankers said. That was easily enough to get the deal done and quite adequate by international standards, especially for a large deal for a stock in an unglamorous industry.
 But it was a far cry from the 60 or more times oversubscriptions by institutional investors on Chinese initial public offerings early last year, and even higher oversubscription ratios for retail investors. And with money managers leery of Chinese stocks, the fairly modest subscription rate for Shenhua means bidders for shares will have to pay for large allotments, so they will have less cash for future Chinese stock deals.
 Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch and the China International Capital Corporation were the lead advisers to Shenhua. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Deutsche are handling the Minsheng deal, while Goldman Sachs and HSBC are sponsoring the Bank of Communications offering.
 More big deals are ahead. The China Cosco Holdings Company, the country's biggest container line, is planning an initial public offering of up to $2 billion in the next month, but a recent plunge in shipping rates could make its shares harder to sell.
 The biggest offering of all, a $5 billion transaction by the China Construction Bank, is supposed to happen later this year, sponsored by Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. But the deal has had difficulties as China Construction has struggled to curb corruption and find a big foreign bank willing to take a strategic stake as part of the initial offering.
 This has prompted some investment bankers to predict that China Construction will have to reduce the number of shares sold; accept a fairly low price for the shares; delay the deal until next year; or all three.
 Raising money is often not the top priority of Chinese companies that hold initial public offerings. Chinese banks are famously generous with loans to large state-owned enterprises, one reason the banks have so many nonperforming loans.
 The biggest reason Beijing officials encourage many companies to sell stock is to improve corporate governance in China, said Rodney G. Ward, the chairman of UBS's Asian investment banking operations.
 ''It's only once you're in the public eye you're subject to public pressure, to analyst pressure and to investor pressure,'' he said.
 While some investors seem to be losing their enthusiasm for placing bets on stocks in Hong Kong, others remain intrigued by the potential to buy stocks on Chinese exchanges, which may rise in dollar terms if the yuan is revalued as the Bush administration demands.
 This interest has persisted even though the Chinese government has strictly limited such investments; even though Chinese exchanges have reputations for listing troubled companies and tolerating irregular trading practices; and even though Chinese investors have pushed prices to eight-year lows.
 UBS has gathered $800 million from investors to buy stocks on the mainland, and Mr. Ward said, ''If we were given the chance to open the spigots, we could double that in as little as 24 hours.''

HEADLINE: Oil Company From China Is Weighing Bid for Unocal

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 7 

 BODY:
A leading Chinese oil producer, CNOOC, is considering making a competing bid to Chevron's $16.4 billion offer for Unocal, as soaring demand puts pressure on China to find new oil supplies. 
 ''The company announces that it is continuing to examine its options with respect to Unocal,'' CNOOC said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday. ''These options include a possible offer by the company for Unocal, but no decision has been made in this respect.'' 
 Energy industry analysts in Beijing say that divisions between CNOOC's foreign nonexecutive directors and its Chinese management have delayed any firm decision on Unocal, which has extensive oil and natural gas reserves in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand and Myanmar. 
 Energy consumption has been soaring in China, which is the world's fastest-growing economy and is now the second-largest consumer of oil, behind the United States. To increase energy security, the government has urged CNOOC and two other major oil companies, PetroChina and China Petroleum and Chemical, to seek investments in offshore oil and gas reserves. ''We think China will rely on imports for the next 20 years, especially crude oil, and the government is also trying to increase the amount of natural gas in the consumption mix,'' said Ma Shang, an energy analyst for Fitch Ratings. A bid for Unocal would be ''a good chance for CNOOC to get a large amount of reserves,'' he said. 
 If CNOOC did win Unocal, it would be China's biggest overseas investment, dwarfing the Lenovo Group's $1.75 billion purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer business. That purchase was completed last month. 
 China's demand for oil has far outstripped domestic production, and the country last year imported 123 million metric tons of oil, according to Chinese news reports. These imports accounted for more than half of consumption. 
 If CNOOC does make a bid for Unocal, it would need to top Chevron's cash-and-stock offer made on April 4. Unocal had earnings of $1.2 billion on revenue of $8.2 billion last year. 
 A successful bid would also have to take into account a $500 million fee that Unocal agreed to pay Chevron if its offer was terminated for another deal. 
 Energy industry analysts said the size of the potential deal had revived divisions on the board of CNOOC. The government owns 70 percent of the company.
 Mr. Ma said the Chinese directors, including the chief executive, Fu Chengyu, backed a bid because it would deliver oil and gas reserves, and provide some relief as dependence on imports is set to climb. The foreign independent directors, however, say a bid would force the company to take on excessive debt. 
 Market analysts point to the departure of Erwin Schurtenberger, a high-profile independent director and former Swiss ambassador to China, who resigned soon after the Chevron offer was announced, as possible evidence of high-level disagreement and tension. CNOOC said Mr. Schurtenberger resigned for health reasons.

HEADLINE: North Korea Said to Offer To Rejoin Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations for this article, and Joel Brinkley from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
The United States and China said Tuesday that North Korea had committed itself to returning eventually to multinational negotiations over its nuclear program, but officials said the North had set no date.
 That left both American and Asian officials wondering whether North Korea was simply trying to defuse talk about the United States going to the United Nations to ask for sanctions.
 The North Korean statements, after a yearlong suspension in the six-nation talks, came during a meeting on Monday in New York between the North's representatives to the United Nations and two American diplomats, Joseph DeTrani and Jim Foster. 
 But after a day of conflicting signals in Washington about what the North Koreans actually said, and an optimistic prediction by the Chinese representative to the United Nations that talks would resume ''in the next couple of weeks,'' both American and Asian officials expressed caution. 
 They noted that President Bush was just days away from a luncheon meeting on Friday with the South Korean president, Roh Moo Hyun, in which Mr. Bush is expected to raise the subject of how long the United States and its allies should continue with a diplomatic process that so far has yielded no results.
 Mr. Roh has opposed any move toward sanctions that would cut off trade with North Korea, and he has counseled deeper engagement with the North. Even the ambiguous prospect of a return to talks, officials note, could bolster his case during the lunch with Mr. Bush.
 One Asian official deeply involved in the process was skeptical about whether real progress had been made in the New York meeting, saying that the North Korean statement ''may be designed to keep us hanging in the air.''
 The chief American official in charge of the talks, Christopher R. Hill, was also cautious. Emerging from Congressional testimony about China and North Korea, he told reporters that the North Koreans had said in New York that they were ''committed'' to the negotiations. But he also cautioned, ''our concern now is to get a date.'' 
 ''We need to be careful how we characterize'' the North Korean statements at the New York meeting, he added.
 Inside the Bush administration, the question of how long to pursue the talks -- which also involve Russia, China, Japan and South Korea -- has been a source of continuous debate. Some officials, both in the Pentagon and the White House, have argued that the time has come to move to sanctions, noting that the previous negotiations resulted in nothing, and that no talks had been held since the United States put a modest offer on the table to North Korea a year ago. 
 But when a senior Defense Department official traveling with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld suggested over the weekend that a decision to move to sanctions might be only weeks away, he was quickly corrected by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who told reporters there were no deadlines and little likelihood a decision would come that soon. Mr. Rumsfeld, half a world away, then told reporters the same thing.
 But here in Washington, teams in several agencies have been drawing up plans for potential sanctions, including what would amount to a quarantine of the country, involving ships and aircraft searching for illicit shipments of missiles, drugs and counterfeit cash.
 Those tactics, however, would probably be doomed to failure unless the United States won the cooperation of China, the North's largest trading partner and its main source of food and fuel. So far, the Chinese have shown no interest in making that threat. 
 Instead, Beijing has urged patience and optimism. 
 ''I think it will be pretty soon, in the next few weeks,'' Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, said about the prospect of new talks.
 ''It is already one year,'' he said. ''It has been postponed for too long. All agree that the six-party talks is the best way for settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.''
 Asked about suggestions that the matter be brought to the Security Council, he said, ''For China, to bring this issue to the Security Council at this stage would be premature.''
 Mr. Hill, who is the new assistant secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, expressed frustration on Tuesday that more pressure had not been brought to bear on North Korea. 
 ''We have asked China to do more'' to persuade North Korea to return to the talks, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''North Korea depends on China every single day for fuel and food. We expect more.''
 ''China needs to use its leverage,'' Mr. Hill said, noting at one point that ''clearly China has been reluctant to use economic sanctions.''
 Mr. Hill, a veteran negotiator, is reported by his State Department colleagues to be arguing internally that the administration should be clearer to the North about what it would gain by giving up the weapons it claims to hold. But he gave no hint of that on Tuesday, telling the committee: ''Sometimes, Americans are known for our impatience. But I think one year is a long time.''
 Through more than hour of testimony, Mr. Hill made no mention of the North Korean statements during the meeting in New York on Monday.

HEADLINE: Bush and Blair Deny 'Fixed' Iraq Reports

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain presented a united front on Tuesday against a recently disclosed British government memorandum that said in July 2002 that American intelligence was being ''fixed'' around the policy of removing Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
 ''There's nothing farther from the truth,'' Mr. Bush said in his first public comments about the so-called Downing Street memo, which has created anger among the administration's critics who see it as evidence that the president was intent to go to war with Iraq earlier than the White House has said. 
 ''Look, both of us didn't want to use our military,'' Mr. Bush added. ''Nobody wants to commit military into combat. It's the last option.'' 
 Mr. Blair, standing at Mr. Bush's side in a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House, said, ''No, the facts were not being fixed in any shape or form at all.'' 
 The statements contradicted assertions in the memorandum, which was first disclosed by The Sunday Times of London on May 1 and which records the minutes of a meeting of Mr. Blair's senior policy advisers more than half a year before the war with Iraq began.
 The contents of the memo have dogged Mr. Blair, who has taken years of political criticism at home for joining Mr. Bush in the Iraq war and has come to Washington on his first trip since his re-election in May expressly to seek support on his plans for more aid to Africa and for fighting global warming. 
 Mr. Blair, generally unsmiling through the 25-minute news conference, went home after dinner at the White House on Tuesday night with much less than he had wanted.
 The two leaders pledged to cancel the debts of 27 of the world's poorest nations to the World Bank and the African Development Bank, although no deal has yet been reached. And as expected, Mr. Bush announced that the White House would release $674 million in aid to Africa, mostly for food aid to Ethiopia and Eritrea, drawn from money already appropriated by Congress. 
 But Mr. Blair failed to persuade Mr. Bush to agree to a doubling of aid to Africa, to $25 billion, from the world's richest nations, or to close the gap with the administration on policy toward climate change. Mr. Blair has cited the two areas as top foreign policy priorities.
 Mr. Bush defended his decision not to join with Mr. Blair by repeatedly saying that the United States has already tripled aid to Africa to $3.2 billion during his administration. But he promised, ''We'll do more down the road.'' The United States has one of the lowest levels of aid among developed countries in the share of national income it gives, or 16 cents to each $100. 
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair also appeared far apart on the issue of global warming -- ''I think everyone knows there are different perspectives on this issues,'' the prime minister acknowledged -- as the president sidestepped a question about whether climate change was man-made. Instead Mr. Bush reiterated his longstanding position that the development of new technology was the best way to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases.
 Such differences were pushed aside in the public formalities of the news conference, where the two leaders seemed happy to have survived their re-elections after the war in Iraq. 
 ''Glad you're here,'' Mr. Bush said to Mr. Blair. ''Congratulations on your great victory. It was a landmark victory, and I'm really thrilled to be able to work with you to be able to spread freedom and peace over the next years.''
 The two expressed common ground most emphatically on the Downing Street memo, which was written by Matthew Rycroft, a top aide to Mr. Blair. 
 In particular, it reports that Sir Richard Dearlove, the chief of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, had been in talks in Washington and had told other senior British officials that Mr. Bush ''wanted to remove'' Mr. Hussein ''through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and W.M.D.,'' or weapons of mass destruction.
 ''But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,'' Sir Richard was reported in the memo to have told his colleagues. 
 Since the disclosure by The Sunday Times, 89 Democrats in the House of Representatives have written to the White House to ask if the memorandum accurately reflected the administration's thinking at the time, eight months before the American-led invasion of Iraq began. Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, has said there is ''no need'' to respond to the letter.
 In his comments at the news conference, Mr. Bush noted of the memorandum that ''they dropped it out in the middle of his race,'' indicating that he thought it had been made public last month to hurt Mr. Blair's chances for re-election.
 Mr. Blair, who spoke frequently about the memorandum during his campaign, said it was written before the United States and Britain went to the United Nations seeking a resolution to justify military action in Iraq.
 ''Now, no one knows more intimately the discussions that we were conducting as two countries at the time than me,'' Mr. Blair said. 
 The White House has always insisted that Mr. Bush did not make the decision to invade Iraq until after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented the administration's case to the United Nations Security Council on Feb. 5, 2003, which relied heavily on claims, now discredited, that Iraq had illicit weapons. But as early as Nov. 21, 2001, Mr. Bush directed Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to begin a review of what could be done to oust Mr. Hussein.

HEADLINE: How a Studio Got a Good Start Just East of the East River

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Hollywood on the Hudson, it is not. 
 In truth, the new $118 million Steiner Studios overlooks the East River. But the movie factory's growing presence on the Brooklyn waterfront is starting to produce ripples far beyond that borough. 
 The 280,000-square-foot studio with its five stages will not even be finished until the winter. But already there is a measure of pride in blase, forget-about-it Brooklyn, which, despite its rocketing condo prices and feisty, Manhattan-is-Satan esprit, still smarts from being relegated to a laugh line in so many Hollywood movies. 
 After all, when the movie version of ''The Producers: The Movie Musical'' started production at Steiner last November, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman, Will Ferrell and Mel Brooks traversed local streets -- though invisible behind smoked limo glass. And even Brooklynites who would rather be banished to the Bronx than be caught gawking at marquee names were peering over the walls of the studio's home in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. 
 Now the cameras are whirring for ''Fur,'' a film about the early life of the photographer Diane Arbus, with Robert Downey Jr. and Nicole Kidman in the lead roles. And since Spike Lee has finally signed a deal to direct ''Inside Man'' there, Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster will also be toiling in Brooklyn. 
 Steiner has joined Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria and Silvercup Studios in Long Island City and a collection of smaller studio spaces to form the backbone of New York's thriving film and television-production industry, which pumps billions of dollars a year into the city's economy and provides tens of thousands of jobs. 
 Steiner's arrival comes at a time when the industry has been blessed ''with some very happy coincidences,'' said Harold L. Vogel of Vogel Capital Management, an independent media analyst. Most important, he said, in January the city began an incentive program to induce more film and television producers to shoot in the city. One provision offers a 15 percent city and state tax credit for films that complete 75 percent of their studio work in New York. 
 ''Without the tax benefits, the horrible truth is, this movie would probably be made in Kabul, or you know, wherever it's the cheapest place in the world for us to shoot,'' said Mr. Brooks, the creator of ''The Producers,'' a hugely successful musical and now a $50 million movie, which was shot entirely in the city. 
 Steiner has also benefited from a weakened dollar, Mr. Vogel said, which makes it cheaper now to shoot foreign productions in New York. And a strong Canadian dollar could reduce the number of so-called runaway productions, which use New York for exterior scenes, but shoot the bulk of a film more cheaply in Toronto or Vancouver. 
 ''It's amazing to see this up and running, considering that recently it was just dirt,'' said Douglas C. Steiner, the chairman of Steiner Studios, referring to the weed-choked, rubble-strewn lot that preceded Hollywood East. 
 Steiner is 90 percent complete. Still under construction are a 100-seat screening room, a 200-seat cafe for workers and visitors (to be named Cafe Isabel, after Mr. Steiner's 9-year-old daughter) and Stage Six, a third-floor special-events space for wrap parties, weddings and bar mitzvahs that can accommodate 500 people. An open-air fourth-floor rooftop space with an enclosed glass pavilion is also planned.
 So far, the city's craft unions like what they see. ''Steiner has been a home run for us, and it's made New York more competitive,'' said John R. Ford, president of Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents more than 2,000 electricians, sound technicians and other craft workers in the New York metropolitan region. ''Often, producers with big films had no place to go, and through the years we lost a lot of that type of work.'' 
 Steiner also has something that, while unglamorous, is vital to making movies in New York -- a 1,000-vehicle parking lot. On peak production days, 500 to 800 vehicles belonging to carpenters, actors, dancers, caterers and technical workers have been parked at Steiner. 
 But Steiner's early days have not been bump free. There was the day when the new roof leaked. And as the studio's first tenant, the crew of ''The Producers'' found itself ''the beta tester,'' said Jonathan Sanger, the movie's executive producer. 
 ''It was scary to commit to a new facility, one that was still under construction,'' he said. ''It was a gamble to come here, and when we did, at the beginning of November, we advised them on the things we thought they needed to do.'' So, dressing rooms were relocated and reconfigured and Mr. Sanger gave a thumbs down to the studio's small makeup rooms ''We suggested breaking through walls,'' he said. 
 Still, from the start, Mr. Sanger said, he was impressed by Steiner's 35 and 45-feet ''grid heights,'' the space between a stage and the top of a lighting grid, because they made it easier to shoot large dance scenes.
 ''If our cameras tipped up during a shot, you didn't see the ceiling,'' he said. ''A 45-foot grid -- this is a standard that you only see in Hollywood stages.'' Having the production's studio, office and support space under one roof also saved money, Mr. Sanger said. 
 In the early days of Steiner's construction, ''everyone in town was asking us -- 'is it nice?''' said Nick Miller, the construction coordinator who supervised the building of the sets. ''We realized we could answer yes.'' 
 Film and television production in New York City contributes $5 billion a year to the city's economy, provides work for 100,000 people in the region and benefits 4,000 related businesses, said Katherine Oliver, the commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. Mr. Steiner said he hoped to establish local work-force training and business-development programs, as well as an internship program with New York City Technical College.
 Ernie Rodriquez, the owner of Bear Security Locksmiths, at 24th Street and Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn, said he had already benefited from Steiner's presence. Since October, his 25-year-old business has supplied more than 100 locks, 150 cylinders and thousands of keys to Steiner to supplement its security system. 
 ''It may be glamorous and exciting, but they pay their bills quickly and that makes it even better,'' Mr. Rodriquez said. Publicly, so far, Kaufman Astoria Studios and Silvercup Studios have reacted cordially to their splashy new competitor, even though Steiner's 27,000-square-foot stage has taken the city crown from Kaufman's ''Big House,'' the 26,000-square-foot Stage E. 
 Hal G. Rosenbluth, the president of Kaufman, said the advent of Steiner was ''an exclamation point to the growth of the industry in New York.'' It was also a validation, he added. ''The investment they made shows that there is someone else as crazy as we are.'' Mr. Rosenbluth is planning to build another 18,000-foot stage and support structure across the street from the original 300,000-foot studio, where ''Sesame Street'' is taped. 
 Stuart Match Suna, the president of Silvercup, home of ''The Sopranos,'' said that ''Steiner has helped the industry,'' though he acknowledged that it will eventually mean more competition for future productions. 
 Still, he also is planning to add to Silvercup's 18 stages, which occupy more than 400,000 square feet. 
 Mr. Steiner wants to expand, too. ''We aren't done,'' he said. ''We want to build additional stages and support buildings.''
 The studio hopes to make money in three to five years, Mr. Steiner said, despite studios' traditionally skimpy profit margins and high fixed costs. But the future is still as murky as the nearby Gowanus Canal. ''Though Steiner brings something to the city that was needed -- large space that is conveniently located -- I think it is too early to know how this will work financially,'' said Mr. Vogel, the entertainment analyst. 
 Already, though, Steiner has an alumni society. Some of the crew members of ''The Producers'' are working on the production of ''Fur.'' 
 ''This,'' said Mr. Rodriquez, the locksmith, ''is the biggest thing happening in Brooklyn.''

HEADLINE: Accepting A Webby? Brevity, Please

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
One of the more charming idiosyncrasies of the Webby Awards, the annual awards for achievement in Web creation, requires that recipients use five words, and five words only, to make their acceptance speeches.
 So after a night full of award innuendos and one-line haiku at Gotham Hall in Manhattan, the 550 people in attendance were wondering how Al Gore, the loquacious former vice president, would respond to his lifetime achievement award.
 He did not disappoint. 
 ''Please don't recount this vote,'' he said. The place went nuts. 
 Mr. Gore, who was politically savaged during the 2000 presidential campaign for a remark that seemed to imply that he had created the Internet, was introduced by Vinton Cerf, one of the scientists credited with actually having built the architecture behind the Web. He had his own five-word speech -- ''We all invented the Internet'' -- before pointing out that Mr. Gore had been responsible for spearheading critical legislation and providing much-needed political support -- not exactly creating a new medium, but not bad for a politician. 
 Mr. Gore, by virtue of his resume, was dragged back to the dais to say a few more words.
 ''It is time to reinvent the Internet for all of us to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy,'' he said, again to thunderous applause.
 It was an awards banquet where hype and self-congratulation were mixed with huggy messages about the cultural and civic good that can come from the Internet. Once a raucous San Francisco celebration of the World Wide Web's potential to change everything, the awards slimmed down along with the digital economy after the bust, forgoing a huge party for an online event the last two years. But the Web is no longer a bad word among business people, and the awards ceremony has left the hermetic, homey confines of San Francisco for New York for the first time in its nine-year history. That decision was less a recognition of New York's growing role in digital culture than its longer-running one as the media capital of the Western hemisphere. 
 ''Every year we have done something different to reflect the pulse of the Web, and tonight we are in New York because the Web has been dispersed,'' said Tiffany Shlain, a founder of the ceremony. ''Great Web sites are being created and accessed everywhere.''
 Including Amarillo, Tex. Tyler Morgan, 19, was getting all of a dozen hits a day on the personal Web site he built in his bedroom -- Rtm86.com -- until Yahoo named it as a site of the day and he was listed as a nominee for the Webby. In May he had 1.2 million hits. 
 After he learned he had won the Webby, there was the problem of getting to New York.
 ''I put a personal plea on my Web site, and people sent in something like $1,700 and here I am,'' he said, wearing one of the red corsages that identified the winners. His five-word speech was to the point: ''Desperate -- need money for college.'' (It worked: at the after-party at the Bryant Park Hotel, the Creative Group, the lead sponsor of the event, announced it was going to pitch in.) 
 Mr. Morgan took his place in a line that included the likes of Pfizer, the C.I.A. and Geico Insurance, but also The Paly Voice, the Web site of Palo Alto High School; and Rathergood.com, a compendium of weirdly wonderful things. The range of winners was a reminder of the Web's elastic nature, which allows both mass and granular manifestations of what people are thinking about.
 Because the Webby sculpture is shaped like a large spring, it invited short-form, salacious annotations, with many speeches that drew hoots from the crowd. One of the more demure, low-tech speeches came from Abigail Chisman, a staff member at Vogue.co.uk, who stepped up to get her award in a gorgeous white frock.
 ''Do you like my dress?'' she said. Yes, they did, and her speech as well.
 The event was as businesslike as an awards ceremony whose central icon is a cartoonishly large spring can be, with the host Rob Corddry, a funny guy on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' lending an air of knowing befuddlement to the proceedings.
 To the extent that any awards serve as a mood ring on the industry they celebrate -- not all that farfetched, if you deconstruct the average year for the Tonys and the Oscars -- the Web has become a sandbox where anarchy and commerce play. While these may not be the heady, freaky days of 2000 and 2001, the Web is still making noise after the boom.
 The Webby for Person of the Year went to Craig Newmark of craigslist.org, whose once-tiny community bulletin board now attracts more than eight million people monthly in 120 cities, including Sydney, Australia, and Bangalore, India. Mr. Newmark's various sites have given fits to the classified-ad business of both daily and weekly papers. 
 Innovators in both music and images, two hot buttons of Internet culture, were cited as well. The Kleptones, a band from Britain, received an award for their music site, which features ''Night at the Hip-Hopera,'' an album that became a viral sensation after they plopped it out on their Web site for mashing and downloading. And Flickr.com, a photo management site that uses elements of Web ''tagging'' and RSS feeds, went to the podium to be honored for its groundbreaking approach to image sharing.
 Whimsy always gets a front-row seat at the Webbys, and this year Dogster.com, a San Francisco Web site, picked up a community award for its creation of a virtual playground for pets and their owners. BoingBoing.net, whose idiosyncratic approach to what constitutes information worth sharing -- robot bands, storm chasers or an Osama bin Laden cigarette lighter replete with World Trade Center towers -- received top blogging honors.
 As was only fitting, there was a significant populist element to the awards, with 200,000 people voting for the People's Voice Award in each of more than 60 categories in the program, which drew entries from all 50 states and 40 countries. Comedy Central's ''Indecision 2004'' on ''The Daily Show,'' won both a Webby and the People's Voice Award. (A complete list of the winners is at www.webbyawards.com.)
 The Webbys got off to a wobbly but impressive start in 1997. Ms. Shlain, an independent filmmaker and designer who was then designing the Web site for a print magazine called The Web put out by International Data Group, cobbled $30,000 and in-kind donations from 11 companies to gin up the first annual awards, which drew 700 people to Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco.
 Willie Brown, then the city's mayor, was at the event, sponsored by The Web. The following year, the company closed down The Web, but the Webby Awards lived on, with the second show featuring the likes of Scott Adams, the creator of the comic strip ''Dilbert,'' and the well-known Web savant Dennis Rodman -- well, he was well known, anyway. 
 The show, feeding off the growing hype surrounding the Web, attracted significant media attention, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, then mayor of New York City, made an offer in 1998 to bring the Webbys to Radio City Music Hall. Mayor Brown countered and the awards stayed on the West Coast, but this year the Webby Awards decided to switch coasts. 
 Also in 1998, Ms. Shlain and a partner, Maya Draisin, helped form the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences to oversee the awards, enrolling luminaries like the rock star David Bowie, the filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and the digital thinker Esther Dyson, and securing PricewaterhouseCoopers to oversee the judging process. But the competition for the best five-word speech was ferocious, including a woman who compared the trophy to an IUD. The winning winner on Monday night? It may have been Todd Sotkiewicz, the president of LonelyPlanet.com, the People's Voice winner in the travel category:
 ''Love your country. Leave it.''

HEADLINE: Crumbs for Africa

 BODY:
President Bush kept a remarkably straight face yesterday when he strode to the microphones with Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, and told the world that the United States would now get around to spending $674 million in emergency aid that Congress had already approved for needy countries. That's it. Not a penny more to buy treated mosquito nets to help save the thousands of children in Sierra Leone who die every year of preventable malaria. Nothing more to train and pay teachers so 11-year-old girls in Kenya may go to school. And not a cent more to help Ghana develop the programs it needs to get legions of young boys off the streets. 
 Mr. Blair, who will be the host when the G-8, the club of eight leading economic powers, holds its annual meeting next month, is trying to line up pledges to double overall aid for Africa over the next 10 years. That extra $25 billion a year would do all those things, and much more, to raise the continent from dire poverty. Before getting to Washington, Mr. Blair had done very well, securing pledges of large increases from European Union members. 
 According to a poll, most Americans believe that the United States spends 24 percent of its budget on aid to poor countries; it actually spends well under a quarter of 1 percent. As Jeffrey Sachs, the Columbia University economist in charge of the United Nations' Millennium Project, put it so well, the notion that there is a flood of American aid going to Africa ''is one of our great national myths.''
 The United States currently gives just 0.16 percent of its national income to help poor countries, despite signing a United Nations declaration three years ago in which rich countries agreed to increase their aid to 0.7 percent by 2015. Since then, Britain, France and Germany have all announced plans for how to get to 0.7 percent; America has not. The piddling amount Mr. Bush announced yesterday is not even 0.007 percent.
 What is 0.7 percent of the American economy? About $80 billion. That is about the amount the Senate just approved for additional military spending, mostly in Iraq. It's not remotely close to the $140 billion corporate tax cut last year. 
 This should not be the image Mr. Bush wants to project around a world that is intently watching American actions on this issue. At a time when rich countries are mounting a noble and worthy effort to make poverty history, the Bush administration is showing itself to be completely out of touch by offering such a miserly drop in the bucket. It's no surprise that Mr. Bush's offer was greeted with scorn in television broadcasts and newspaper headlines around the world. ''Bush Opposes U.K. Africa Debt Plan,'' blared the headline on the AllAfrica news service, based in Johannesburg. ''Blair's Gambit: Shame Bush Into Paying,'' chimed in The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia.
 The American people have a great heart. President Bush needs to stop concealing it.

HEADLINE: Requiem for West Side Stadium: Overtures Were Made Too Late

BYLINE: This article was reported by Charles V. Bagli, Jim Rutenberg, Michael Cooper and Jennifer Steinhauer and written by Ms. Steinhauer.

 BODY:
One night last December, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg squeezed next to Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, before a large menorah set up in a small Midtown kosher restaurant. 
 The Hanukkah ceremony was one in a series of chits that Mr. Bloomberg attempted to tally with Mr. Silver over the last year. The mayor attended the bris of two of Mr. Silver's grandsons, paid a condolence call when the speaker's brother died in August and held news conferences as often as possible in the speaker's Lower Manhattan district. 
 The mayor and the speaker lacked much of a personal relationship early in Mr. Bloomberg's administration. But these moves were all part of the effort by the mayor and his deputy, Daniel L. Doctoroff, to achieve a central goal, a new stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan. 
 The courtship culminated on Sunday in nearly $300 million worth of subsidies and other offers to draw business to Lower Manhattan, Mr. Silver's highest priority. The mayor proposed up to $5,000 in tax credits for each employee of any out-of-town company that agreed to locate in Lower Manhattan, his aides said, along with rent subsidies worth $5.5 million a year for tenants who would agree to go into 7 World Trade Center and the Freedom Tower. But the offers were dismissed with silence. Mr. Bloomberg's pursuit of Mr. Silver had come too late.
 On Monday, a seemingly indignant Mr. Silver exercised his veto over the stadium, all but extinguishing a goal that Mr. Doctoroff -- the leading champion of several of the city's Olympics bids -- had pursued for years. As a result, it now seems far less likely that the 2012 Summer Games will be held in the United States.
 In large part, according to interviews with many of the participants in the maneuvering, the project was doomed because Mr. Doctoroff calculated long before Mr. Bloomberg was even in office that the city could build the project while sidestepping lawmakers in Albany and New York. 
 As such, according to the administration's critics, Mr. Bloomberg and his aides failed to build a political coalition in Albany early enough to sway crucial lawmakers. It was only last summer that they realized that any one of Albany's three leaders would have veto power over the stadium project, at which point they began to cultivate Mr. Silver and, to a lesser extent, Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader. At the same time, the Jets scrambled to gain the support of minority lawmakers and others for the stadium the team would occupy. 
 ''They thought they could bypass the legislative process with something of this size and scope,'' said Richard Ravitch, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority and top state economic adviser, who has been critical of the project. ''That was just unrealistic.'' 
 Mr. Silver said yesterday that sidestepping the state's political process was the city's most serious misstep. ''I just think that nobody's opinion counted until it counted,'' he said. ''They never talked to Senator Bruno, they never talked to me. And they just proceeded ahead, and they used this Olympic timetable as the hammer that was going to make everything that was wrong with the bid suddenly right.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides differ sharply with this interpretation, saying they did everything possible to satisfy Mr. Silver, but were greeted with a stone wall of stubbornness that they now consider to be bad-faith negotiating. Several raised questions about Mr. Silver's motives, and said that even if they had courted him early on, it now seems unlikely that it would have changed his position.
 ''The mayor worked in good faith and presented substantive proposals that addressed what the speaker said his concerns were,'' said Edward Skyler, Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman. ''But the fact that he showed zero interest in any of them makes the whole thing look like a charade.''
 All sides agree that one of the most prominent and unforeseen impediments came from the intense and well-financed opposition by Cablevision, the owner of Madison Square Garden. Cablevision, which considered the stadium competition to the Garden, pushed forward with an attack against the stadium plan on a scale never attempted by a private company against a City Hall project.
 All told, the private-sector logic that guided Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Bloomberg for decades before their careers in public service, in which all projects succeed with the right combination of money and selling power, proved naive. And, for their stadium dream, fatal.
 The vision for a West Side stadium, which would house a football team, convention space and major events of a Summer Olympics, was one that Mr. Doctoroff has had since the 1990's, when he first began working to bring the Games to New York. 
 Back then, Mr. Doctoroff said repeatedly that he feared that going though the legislative process would dilute or corrupt his idea. So rather than develop a political coalition, Mr. Doctoroff did what he knew best from his success as an investment banker. He courted chief executives from Time Warner, Merrill Lynch and others, persuading hardened business executives that the Olympics could happen here, and raising money for the cause. 
 He did have one friend in government who shared his disdain for Albany and passion for stadium building: Rudolph W. Giuliani. At a 2000 news conference, Mr. Doctoroff stood with Mayor Giuliani, extolling the virtues of developing the West Side and seducing International Olympic Committee members. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki, who was at war with Mr. Giuliani, was not invited to attend, nor was any member of the State Legislature. A senior Pataki official groused at the time, ''I guess he's going to do this project with the mayor.''
 Real estate executives raised questions about the plan, but Mr. Doctoroff was undaunted. And when he was asked to serve under Mr. Bloomberg, also fresh from the private sector and a believer in pushing against the status quo, he pressed on.
 With Mr. Bloomberg's blessing, Mr. Doctoroff successfully formed a plan to sidestep the City Council by proposing to rezone the West Side, which required approval by the Council, with a boundary line drawn down the middle of 11th Avenue, leaving the stadium site out of the district's boundaries and outside the Council's purview, to which it agreed, apparently happy to stay out of the fight, at least for a time. 
 The Bloomberg administration tried to bypass the State Legislature as well. It wanted to insert approval for the stadium into the governor's bill to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The Legislature passed the convention center bill, but without the stadium provision. 
 Strike one.
 In the meantime, there was another economic development program with its own set of troubles brewing. Progress on the site of the World Trade Center site began to slow because of a confluence of factors, from security problems to infighting among state officials. 
 Mr. Silver was growing uneasy that the commercial prospects for Lower Manhattan were being overshadowed by development on the West Side, while the neighborhood became increasingly residential. 
 But Mr. Silver was by no means the lone critic of the proposal. In the final weeks, Mr. Bruno, an upstate Republican, became increasingly vocal in his criticism of the deal, questioning the $300 million state subsidy. 
 In June 2004, with its legislative options exhausted, the Bloomberg administration faced up to the reality of the state's control over the city's affairs: They could not legally proceed without the approval of a little-known board controlled by Governor Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno.
 Strike two.
 Then, there were the state's perennial budget problems. The plan called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to sell its land on the West Side to the Jets for well below its appraised value, at a time that the authority's officials were crying poverty to the state.
 Late on a Friday in February, Cablevision illustrated how the city had underestimated the authority's needs. The company sent the authority a letter offering to buy the West Side property for $600 million, far above the Jets' offer of $100 million. 
 This move caught both the Jets and Mr. Doctoroff unprepared, but they were no less blindsided by the response from the authority's head, Peter S. Kalikow, who had long loathed the idea of giving away a transportation authority asset for a bargain price. He opened up the bidding to the world. Ultimately the Jets prevailed, but only after a costly lawsuit and a significant cost in public opinion. 
 The stadium issue was not playing well in the polls, and Cablevision took advantage with a barrage of negative television advertisements. The company was aided by its close relationship with Mr. Silver, whose former chief of staff was a lobbyist for Cablevision, as was Mr. Bruno's son.
 All spring, the city waited to see what Albany would do. Lawmakers -- even those who supported the stadium idea -- took umbrage when the mayor would say that they had to approve the stadium by a certain date or else, and then, each time a deadline was blown, create another deadline. The Olympic committee, however, repeatedly raised the stadium's approval as central to the city's bid.
 Last month, Mr. Bloomberg revealed a menu of treats for Lower Manhattan at a news conference in Chinatown, paid for with federal money. That only angered Mr. Silver more, his aides said, because the money had long been earmarked for Lower Manhattan projects, and the news media portrayed it as an attempt to buy him off. (Those projects will continue.)
 The final push to sway Mr. Silver came together last Friday, after Mr. Bloomberg spoke with Mr. Silver early in the day and got what he believed was an agreement for more negotiations all weekend. As Mr. Silver took off for the Sabbath, Mr. Doctoroff and his staff worked through the night and into Saturday, coming up with a final package. 
 Officials said they were certain as of Saturday afternoon that they had met all of Mr. Silver's concerns and believed he would finally come on board. ''Saturday everybody thought there was a deal,'' said an official involved in the planning. ''It was far beyond what everyone thought he wanted.'' But on Monday, it became clear that none of it had worked, as Mr. Silver approached the microphones with a long statement.
 Strike three. 


CORRECTION-DATE: June 10, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Wednesday about missteps that led to the demise of a plan for a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan -- including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's failure to win support from Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker -- misstated the title of a former aide to Mr. Silver who is now a lobbyist for Cablevision, which opposed the stadium. The aide was Mr. Silver's communications director, not his chief of staff.

HEADLINE: So Long to a West Side Stadium

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I fail to understand Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's unhappiness with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and others who opposed the West Side stadium proposal.
 Mayor Bloomberg said, ''As for our Olympic bid, rejection of the stadium will seriously damage our chances of winning the 2012 Games.''
 But the mayor could have easily preserved our chances for the Games by proposing a backup plan for a stadium in Queens, where there is both land and a more appropriate neighborhood. 
 Mr. Bloomberg also said those who opposed the stadium will have to answer for lost jobs and economic growth. But he never explained why a thriving mixed-use residential and commercial development along the successful Battery Park City model would not have brought just as many if not more jobs and just as much if not more economic development as a hulking waterfront stadium that would lie empty most of the time.
 It is the Bloomberg administration's own failure to answer these obvious questions that led the West Side stadium proposal to its rightful defeat.

HEADLINE: Global Chip Sales Exceeding Forecast

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 8 

 BODY:
Semiconductor manufacturers worldwide are selling more chips this year than previously forecast because high energy prices have not damped electronics sales as the industry had feared, according to revised figures released on Wednesday by the Semiconductor Industry Association. 
 The organization, based in San Jose, Calif., said worldwide sales would reach $226 billion this year, a 6 percent increase over 2004. 
In November, the association predicted that the sales of semiconductors this year would be even with the $213 billion in 2004 because of excess inventory and high energy prices. 
 George M. Scalise, the trade group's president, said the chip industry was seeing better-than-expected sales of personal computers and handsets for cellphones. He also said that the industry had largely worked off the excessive inventories that had been a drag on its growth in the last few years. The inventory buildup was in large part responsible for the business downturn that struck the chip industry in 2000 and persisted into 2004.
 In addition to cellphones and PC's, there have been particularly strong sales of digital television sets and digital cameras. Sales of microprocessors, like those produced by Intel, the largest chip maker, are forecast to rise 11 percent this year, while sales of computer memory chips will decline about 14 percent, the group said. The report came a day before Intel is scheduled to update the forecast it issued in April.
 The Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing market for semiconductors and is expected to account for 46 percent of a worldwide market estimated at $309 billion in 2008.

HEADLINE: White House Lowers a Bit Its Forecast for '05 Growth

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration predicted on Wednesday that economic growth would be slightly slower and inflation slightly higher this year than it expected six months ago.
 Despite the revisions, the White House predicted that economic growth would be faster than normal, which could mean that in 2005, for the first time in four years, the federal budget deficit would be less than the previous year's. 
 The administration's new forecast calls for the economy to grow 3.4 percent in 2005, down from 3.9 percent in 2004 and slightly below the forecast of 3.5 percent issued in December. 
 The White House also predicted that the nation would add about 178,000 jobs a month this year and that the unemployment rate would hover at 5.1 percent -- the level it reached last month.
 The forecast is in line with Wall Street forecasts and takes into account the effect of high oil prices on inflation as well as on growth. 
 The forecast confirms that the economic expansion ''is expected to continue at a healthy and sustainable pace,'' said Harvey S. Rosen, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. 
 But the forecast could be optimistic. Job creation has been fairly strong, but erratic; the pace has been about 152,000 a month in the last three months.
 American manufacturers have been cutting their work forces in recent months, and General Motors announced on Tuesday that it would eliminate 25,000 blue-collar jobs in the United States by the end of 2008. 
 The White House forecast also assumes that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates very little in the next four years. It assumes that rates on three-month Treasury bills will remain below 4 percent through 2009.
 The Fed has already raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to 3 percent, and many analysts predict the rate will climb to 4 percent by early next year.
 Mr. Rosen said the White House based its assumption about interest rates on levels indicated by the futures markets, not by the administration's predictions of what the Fed will do.
 That said, administration officials are counting on higher tax revenue to reduce the budget deficit in 2005. 
 The administration will update its budget outlook for this year later in the summer. 
 Tax revenue rose by $183 billion, or about 15 percent, in the first eight months of the 2005 fiscal year, which began in October. 
 Congressional analysts predict that the deficit could decline to about $350 billion in 2005, from $412 billion in 2004.
 That would be the first decline in the budget deficit since Mr. Bush took office in 2001, but the administration's budget problems would be far from over. 
 Administration officials have already indicated that they will need to ask Congress for more money for forces in Iraq, and Mr. Bush's budget called for most domestic programs, outside of entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, to be reduced over the next five years.

HEADLINE: Retreat or Retrench?

BYLINE: By CURTIS BRAINARD

DATELINE: Santa Barbara, Calif. 

 BODY:
SOUTHERN California's second wettest winter on record has left its mark. Last week a landslide in Laguna Beach severely damaged 21 homes and sent hundreds of residents packing. In January a deluge in La Conchita melted a hillside, destroying homes and killing 10.
 Heavy rains and hurricanes may grab the headlines, but a more relentless force chews away at coastlines every day. Erosion slowly destroys about 1,500 American homes and the land they sit on annually, according to a report prepared for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
 Wherever beachfront real estate lies, from California to Delaware, communities are torn by competing forces: the relentless loss of shoreline and the relentless desire of some people to live on the scenic edge.
 ''A person doesn't move from a location like the one I have unless you have to,'' said Mae Bergman, whose house is perched on a 40-foot cliff in the Mesa area of Santa Barbara. For one thing, she said, during her 48 years as an owner the value of the house has zoomed from $26,000 to about $2 million, a legacy she plans to pass down to her daughters. For another, ''I have the best coast spot in the whole state,'' she said. ''As long as I am living, the house won't be for sale.''
 In Santa Barbara County, where waves can carve a foot a year from seaside bluffs, some officials are less sanguine. Last fall, about 10 miles from Mrs. Bergman's house, they evicted about 90 tenants in five apartment buildings that used to be inland but are now hanging about 35 feet above water at high tide. The evictions, in the Isla Vista area, caught many by surprise, but Santa Barbara's erosion problem is not news. Since the mid-1970's, about 30 blufftop houses on the south-central coast, which extends down to Ventura, have been demolished or rebuilt, their seaside rooms lopped off to stabilize their foundations.
 The five apartment buildings, together worth about $20 million, were built in the 1960's, when erosion was a recognized problem but the cliffs were still protected by a wide beach. Photographs taken during the 1970's show swaths of sand dotted with volleyball courts where waves now lap against the bluffs at high tide. 
 The county also moved to evict tenants of four other buildings on the same road, but after some owners contested the decision, saying that danger was not imminent, the county agreed to let the tenants stay. All nine buildings sit on relatively fragile sedimentary shale, which tilts toward the beach at a 45-degree angle, making it less stable. Erosion has exposed pillars that were installed to stabilize the soil. Their exposure, which invites waves to bounce among them and the cliff, is quickening erosion, said the county geologist, Brian Baca. 
 The owners of the evacuated buildings declined to comment because they are appealing the evictions before the county building and safety department. James Wilson, a lawyer representing them, said that his clients were well aware of the geologic environment, but were never given a deadline for leaving the area; in his words, ''there was no expectation that it was going to end at some point.'' 
 Whatever the outcome of the appeal, Mr. Baca says, the problem extends beyond nine buildings to the entire south-central coast. ''The whole system is moving landward, and there's no stopping it,'' Mr. Baca said. 
 The report done for FEMA, by the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment, a nonprofit research group, said some 338,000 structures, strung along 9,500 miles, were susceptible to erosion, with property damages amounting to more than $500 million a year. Communities regularly lobby Congress to sponsor sand-infusing ''beach nourishment'' programs: for this year it allocated $112 million. 
 Sand naturally shifts around, changing the shoreline. But before California was so heavily settled, its beaches could rebuild with sediment swept down rivers. That natural process no longer occurs in the same way. Meanwhile, the ocean keeps eating away at the bottoms of cliffs, periodically claiming large chunks of land.
 Santa Barbara is one of several communities in a hilly, 10-mile-wide corridor between the ocean and the nearly mile-high Santa Ynez Mountains, which stretch about 45 miles along the coast. The topography creates an erosive vise, with pounding waves on one side and water pouring down from the mountains on the other. 
 During the 1980's and 1990's, county officials considered various ways to control the impact of waves and weather. They concluded that seawalls would be ineffective. But in 1982 they tightened the building code, limiting construction to areas expected to remain stable for at least 75 years. 
 Property owners and county officials are dealing with older buildings case by case. 
 Most tenants at the five buildings evacuated last fall were students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who learned about the order weeks before school started. Nathan Simarro, a sophomore, said that he and his five roommates were caught in a frustrating, ill-timed back-and-forth. 
 ''The landlord was saying one thing,'' he said. ''The county was saying another.'' 
 Winnie Wong, a senior, had lived in her apartment for a year and described a similar state of confusion after receiving the eviction notice in September and being told by her landlord, she said, ''not to worry'' because ''it was all politics.''
 ''The day that we signed the lease, we asked how safe is the house because of its position, how well it would survive an earthquake or erosion,'' Ms. Wong said. ''You can feel it when a wave hits the cliff and the house shakes a little bit, but we never felt unsafe to the point that we'd have to move.'' 
 Other property owners seem similarly ready to believe the best. Ms. Bergman, 96, who lives on the aptly named Edgewater Way, said that after El Nino-induced rain consumed 10 feet of her backyard in 1997, she built $200,000 worth of terraced parallel contoured walls of concrete, at strategic elevations. She said she saw no reason to move the house or herself.
 A neighbor, Gail Ward, 55, said that she and her husband, Richard, 57, were also determined to stay put. She said they bought their house in 1980 after a geological survey conducted by a neighbor found little risk of rapid or excessive erosion. An engineer checks drainage yearly.
 ''It's the risk homeowners take to live in areas along the coast,'' Mrs. Ward said. ''It's like homeowners that live in areas prone to fire and clear away dry brush around their property.''
 George Mearce, a real estate agent at Re/Max in Montecito, Calif., said that despite erosion, housing values on the coast are going up. ''Here, you've got people with some money,'' he said. ''They want a view. They want sunshine. So they say, O.K., I'm buying this home. It may have a 75-year life expectancy, but if you are 50 years old, how long are you going to stay in that house? 
 ''And even if you're younger,'' he said, ''erosion is an imperfect science.''

HEADLINE: The Frill Is Gone

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from Detroit for this article.

 BODY:
It all began with the olive. Nearly 20 years ago, American Airlines, in the face of competition, made the first cost-cutting move -- eliminating one olive from each salad it served its passengers. 
 But what began as a gradual decline in amenities at the big airlines has turned into the biggest attack ever on costs, particularly in coach class.
 Since Christmas, some of the airlines have taken away the free pillows, magazines and curbside baggage service. Today, Northwest is eliminating another ''frill'' -- the half-ounce bag of 18 braided pretzel sticks it hands out to passengers. Even though the cost works out to pennies a bag, the airline, which carried 40 million passengers worldwide in 2004, calculates that it will save $2 million a year. 
 The cutbacks mean that anyone flying during this summer's hectic travel season will find that a relatively cheap ticket on a big airline merely buys the flight from Point A to Point B, and little else. 
 But while passengers in the rear of the plane are getting bare-bones service, those in front on domestic flights -- in first and business class -- will receive greater attention. There, the airlines are competing for big spenders with better food, in some cases lie-flat seats once found only on overseas flights, and a choice of entertainment. 
 ''There has been a pretty fundamental change'' in the travel experience, said Klaus Bauer, director of passenger satisfaction and revenue at the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. 
 Paradoxically, this cost-cutting is making low-fare airlines like JetBlue, Southwest and Song look luxurious compared with coach on the big carriers. Even at their lower prices, they still give their passengers pillows and other extras like entertainment systems that the major airlines do not offer free on domestic flights, and several make a point of their leather seats. They can afford to do these kinds of things because, in general, their lower operating costs have kept them in the black.
 The traditional airlines, facing unrelentingly high fuel costs and warning of more bankruptcy filings, have lost more than $30 billion since the beginning of the decade. They have looked everywhere in making cost cuts, from employees' wages and benefits to retiring aircraft to eliminating unprofitable routes. Reducing amenities presents another way to save money. 
 But a result is that air travel, which once competed with plush railroad cars and ocean liners for a limited number of passengers, is now equivalent to other no-frills transportation, like long-distance buses.
 Still, air travel is within the reach of far more people than it was 40 years ago, when only 15 percent of the public had flown. Adjusted for inflation, air fares have dropped 30 percent on average this decade. 
 ''Everything is in a ticket price,'' said F. Robert van der Linden, curator of air transportation at the Smithsonian Institution. As passengers pay less, every frill is re-examined, he said. ''When you're competing on price, you have to be aware of costs and do your best to cut costs.''
 For Northwest, which has lost $3.3 billion since 2001, and more than half a billion dollars in just the first quarter this year, the decision to eliminate pretzels was pure economics. Instead of the free pretzels, coach passengers on Northwest's 1,500 flights a day across the United States will now be able to buy a $1 packet of raisin-nut mix to go with their still-free beverages -- which could be the next to disappear.
 And Northwest could join rivals like American, United and Alaska Airlines, which have begun charging passengers $2 a suitcase at some airports to check their bags at the curb. United, which tested the idea in Seattle, has expanded the per-bag charge to Tampa, Fla.; Oakland, Calif.; Midway Airport in Chicago; Boston; and Seattle.
 Some passengers are getting used to the idea of paying the fee. But skycaps, who rely on tips, are skeptical. ''It would cut down on my customers, that's for sure,'' said Julian Duncan, 45, who has worked as a United skycap in Detroitfor 19 years.
 The reason airlines offered amenities like curbside check-in, meals and magazines (which American and Northwest have now eliminated) was that they were trying to emulate plush railroad cars, and for overseas travel, luxury liners. 
 Before World War II, there was only one type of service, Mr. van der Linden said. Flying was for the elite, and passengers who had the money expected treatment equivalent to other forms of expensive travel. 
 In the years after the war, comfort began to fade away. Two classes, and later, three classes of air travel were offered. When deregulation in 1978 spurred the growth of low-fare airlines, the big players began doing away with perks, starting with the olives that American removed from its salads in 1986 as a cost-cutting move, and spreading to playing cards, postcards and souvenir captain's rings for children. Even so, some elementary niceties hung on until this past year. 
 In the front of the plane, by contrast, airlines are competing to offer more seat room to passengers willing to pay for it. United, which began premium service called p.s. last year between New York and San Francisco and New York and Los Angeles, plans to offer those travelers wireless Internet service as well. 
 The low-fare airlines are seizing upon the cuts in coach service as an opportunity to continue increasing their share of the market. Since 1990, that has quintupled, to about one-third of domestic passengers. 
 America West, which wants to merge with US Airways, has seized on some aspects of upscale flying, like first-class seats and airport clubs, to attract business travelers. Passengers who do not want to pay for an annual club membership can buy a single-day pass for $35 (an option also offered by other airlines).
 America West's goal is to find a balance between old-style comfort and the new reality of low costs, said H. Travis Christ, its vice president for marketing. It still offers pillows and blankets, but charges for food in coach and covers expenses in part by selling ads on tray tables, ticket jackets and even cocktail napkins. The airline is studying whether to charge for all checked luggage, not just bags dropped off at the curb. 
 Passengers seem to accept all this, Mr. Christ said, adding, ''They don't necessarily expect the kind of amenities that they used to get.'' 
 More cuts on other airlines may be coming. In Australia, the reduced-fare carrier Virgin Blue has begun charging coach passengers about $22 extra a flight to reserve the roomier seats in the first row of coach and in exit rows.
 But Mr. van der Linden at the Smithsonian cautions that airlines run the risk of annoying potential travelers, no matter what bargains they offer.
 ''There is a point where the airlines can look awfully cheap,'' he said. ''They may be alienating their passengers.'' 
 Eddie Trent, who has spent 15 years as a skycap in Detroit for American, shares that sort of fear. Mr. Trent, 35, says his tips are down by half in recent years. ''If we're making less in tips,'' he asked, ''what does that do to service?''

PERSON: Audrey G. Hochberg

HEADLINE: Audrey Hochberg, Assemblywoman And Democrat, 71

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Audrey G. Hochberg, a former New York State assemblywoman, died yesterday morning at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Scarsdale. 
 The cause was uterine cancer, her daughter Judith Hochberg said.
 A Democrat, Ms. Hochberg represented the 88th Assembly District, which includes Scarsdale, Eastchester, Pelham and parts of New Rochelle and White Plains. First elected in 1992, she retired in 2000 after four terms.
 Ms. Hochberg, who held public office for nearly three decades, was noted for her work on environmental, civil-rights and gun-control issues. She began her political career as a member of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, only the second woman, and at the time one of the few Democrats, to win a seat there.
 Audrey Elaine Golden was born in Stamford, Conn., on June 26, 1933, the daughter of Abraham H. Golden and the former Fannie Dodek. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Radcliffe in 1955 and married Herbert L. Hochberg the same year.
 Ms. Hochberg first worked as a security analyst with Shields & Company, a brokerage house, but later set her career aside to raise three children. She became politically active during the Vietnam era, working in the antiwar movement and in Democratic Party politics. In 1971 she was elected to the Westchester County legislature, where she served for 21 years.
 In the State Assembly, Ms. Hochberg, the chairwoman of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management, sponsored bills aimed at improving the state's recycling programs. 
 Besides her husband and daughter, both of Scarsdale, Ms. Hochberg is survived by a sister, Merle Bogin, of Manhattan; another daughter, Brenda Hochberg, of Brookline, Mass.; and seven grandchildren. A third daughter, Carol, died in 1998.

HEADLINE: When Large Events Are Writ Small, but Deep

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Nothing casts a sharper focus on the human cost of terrorism than an examination of its impact on a single family. In Pete Travis's film ''Omagh,'' the Gallaghers, who live in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh, are devastated when a car bomb explodes in August 1998 in the center of town killing more than two dozen people, including their son, Aiden. 
 The docudrama, which opens the 16th annual Human Rights Watch International Film Festival at the Walter Reade Theater this evening, is so skillfully assembled and powerfully acted that fiction merges with reality. 
 Responsibility for the bombing was claimed by dissident Irish Republican Army members, who call themselves the Real I.R.A. They were determined to disrupt the peace process that began four months earlier with the signing of the Good Friday peace accords. 
 Weeks after the bombing, Aiden's father, Michael (Gerard McSorley), a mild-mannered auto mechanic, becomes chairman of a support group for the victims' families. As he presses for an investigation and prosecution of the perpetrators, he is awakened to the painful realities of police incompetence, foot-dragging, coverups, and poor communication between investigative agencies. The resemblance between these events and the revelations of the mistakes and confusion surrounding 9/11 are inescapable. 
 ''Omagh'' exemplifies a principle guiding the selection of films in the festival, which is showing 26 movies from 20 countries through June 13. Most of these films view the struggles of ordinary people waging uphill battles against social, political and economic forces beyond their control from a ground-level perspective. The individual counts.
 David Redmon's punchy documentary critique of globalization, ''Mardi Gras: Made in China,'' looks at the conditions in a factory in the Chinese city of Fuzhou where young workers, mostly women, are paid $1.20 a day to work 14-to-20-hour shifts in enforced silence making the beads showered onto revelers in New Orleans in exchange for baring their breasts at Mardi Gras. 
 The Chinese factory owner, who sees himself as a good guy and model manager, boasts of the punishments he exacts in wages from the workers toiling in sweatshop conditions when they don't meet their quotas. In a nifty turnabout, the filmmaker asks the revelers if they know where the beads come from. They don't, of course, and even when told, few seem to care. When he also shows the Chinese workers pictures of how the beads are used, they giggle in embarrassment.
 The 15-year-old subject of the documentary ''The Education of Shelby Knox'' is a brave, smart, independent high-school-age crusader for sex education in Lubbock, Tex., a city that has one of the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers in the country. Because the local high schools teach abstinence as the only safe sex, Shelby's efforts are tolerated only to a point by the city's conservative, Christian political establishment. The movie, which has its premiere on June 21 on the PBS documentary series ''POV,'' is a pungent civics lesson on what can and cannot be accomplished by one plucky, idealistic girl.
 Margaret Loescher's ''Pulled From the Rubble,'' filmed and narrated by its creator, is an intimate, inspiring portrait of courage and resilience. On Aug. 19, 2003, her father, Gil Loescher, an expert on refugee issues, was attending a meeting at United Nations headquarters in Baghdad when a truck packed with explosives destroyed the building and killed everyone at the meeting but him. The movie is his daughter's journal of his recovery after losing both legs above the knee and much of his right hand. He subsequently learned to walk with prosthetic legs; he has said that the explosion was the beginning, not the end of his life. 
 That spirit, challenged but undefeated, goes to the essence of the Human Rights Watch Festival. At a moment in film history when documentaries and docudramas have shown signs of moving closer to the forefront of international cinema, this invaluable festival is helping show the way.

HEADLINE: Inventories Show Surprising Gain

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
Inventories at wholesalers rose 0.8 percent in April, twice as much as Wall Street expectations, as automotive stocks grew sharply, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
 The department also revised its March wholesale inventory advance to 0.6 percent from a 0.4 percent gain. 
 Rising inventories can signal either growing confidence about future demand or an unexpected sales decline that causes stocks to pile up. 
 Stocks of durable goods, products meant to last three years or more, rose 0.4 percent in April after a 0.2 percent advance in March.

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Losing Patience Over Promised Ballpark

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey is again pushing to ensure a prominent role for sports at New Jersey's sports complex, where the entertainment and shopping center known as Xanadu is rapidly taking shape.
 Mr. Codey is prodding the developers to build the minor league baseball park that they prominently listed among amusements promised for Xanadu; it has since been set aside, with no architectural plans or lease produced for the resident team, the Bergen Cliff Hawks. 
 ''It wasn't getting off the dime, much to my displeasure,'' Mr. Codey said in an interview. ''And it's something I'm committed to doing.''
 The owner of the Cliff Hawks, the state senator who represents the Meadowlands and officials of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority are also expressing impatience, putting pressure on the Xanadu developers while they are trying to strike a deal with the Giants over traffic and parking at the complex.
 Administration officials plan to meet today with the Xanadu developers, the Mills Corporation of Virginia and Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, to demand a schedule for work on the ballpark. 
 The developers insist that the plan for a ballpark has not been shelved but will be ready for the 2007 season. 
 The flare-up is the latest between Mr. Codey and the Xanadu developers. Since taking office last November, Mr. Codey has been pressing for a revitalized sports complex in the Meadowlands. But he has been rubbing up against the developers' plan for a Disney-like shopping and entertainment center, a legacy of former Gov. James E. McGreevey, who wanted to ease the state out of the sports business.
 Of the five resident teams at the Meadowlands complex, two, the New Jersey Devils and the MetroStars soccer team, are leaving soon, while the New Jersey Nets have made plans to move to Brooklyn. The New York Jets also made plans to move -- to Manhattan -- but the stadium that was to be their home was vetoed in Albany this week. But Mr. Codey helped secure an agreement in April for the New York Giants, the prime tenant, to build a new 80,000-seat stadium.
 Now the increasing demand for elbow room in the 750-acre Meadowlands complex is raising other concerns. 
 The Giants are in bumpy negotiations with the Xanadu developers over parking and traffic, now complicated by uncertainty over the Jets' plans. The Giants' new agreement with the state requires the team and the Xanadu developers to negotiate an agreement. 
 The actual construction of Xanadu has been under way for several months, with builders now sinking the foundation.
 The project is also under challenge in court by the neighboring borough of Carlstadt, the Sierra Club, and Hartz Mountain Industries, the biggest real estate developer in the Meadowlands; Hartz Mountain competed with Mills and Mack-Cali for development rights to the site surrounding the Continental Arena. The lawsuits have not stopped the Xanadu construction but are among many contingencies that could delay or pare down the project.
 The ballpark is supposed to house the Bergen Cliff Hawks, a new team in the independent, fast-growing Atlantic League, which has nine teams in the Northeast. The Cliff Hawks' principal owner, Steven B. Kalafer, is also an owner or partner in three other Atlantic League teams.
 ''I thought I'd have a ballpark by 2006,'' Mr. Kalafer said after a meeting in the governor's office this week, ''and we have to date never received any plan, design or lease.''
 The 6,500-seat park, wedged between buildings in the 5-million-square-foot Xanadu complex, is tiny in comparison to Giants Stadium, and the team is to be Mills's tenant, not the state's. It was a big selling point, however, when the Sports and Exposition Authority was reviewing competing proposals for the development site. 
 A spokesman for the developers, Bob Sommer, said there was no question that the ballpark would go forward. ''It's queued up to be built, but we've got priorities first based on the existing tenants,'' Mr. Sommer said, especially the construction of parking for the Giants. 
 When Mills's proposal was submitted to the sports authority in 2002, Mr. Sommer called the ballpark a ''signature component'' of Xanadu. 
 Some critics of Xanadu say, however, that they do not believe the ballpark will materialize. ''They just used this to sweeten the deal,'' said Jeff Tittel, the director of the state chapter of the Sierra Club, which contends in its lawsuit that the state improperly granted permits for the project. State Senator Paul A. Sarlo, a Democrat who represents the Meadowlands district and who sat on the advisory committee that reviewed proposals for the arena site, said: ''The ballpark was important to the overall scheme of things, a strong family entertainment component. It lent a lot of credibility to the Mills Corporation's proposal.''
 Mr. Sarlo said he was not accusing Mills of reneging. ''The frustrating part is the timeline, '' he said. 
 It is not clear whether Mills and Mack-Cali are legally required to build a ballpark.
 Their agreement with the state provides only that the park would be built ''assuming favorable economic and marketing conditions.'' Mr. Sarlo said the developers obligated themselves by including minor league baseball in the original proposal. Mr. Codey, too, said Mills and Mack-Cali ''don't have much choice.'' 
 George Zoffinger, the sports authority president, said he expected construction on the ballpark to start in the spring. ''It's part of the plan,'' he said. ''It's been approved.''
 Joseph Forgione, the sports authority board member who is representing the authority in the talks on the ballpark, said he planned to ask Mills today for ''a drop-dead date on finalizing this.'' 
 ''I was on the selection committee,'' Mr. Forgione said. ''The sports authority approved the plan, including the Bergen Cliff Hawks, and we want it done. End of story.''

HEADLINE: No. 1 Quits in Bolivia, and Protesters Scorn Nos. 2 and 3

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, June 8 

 BODY:
A worsening five-year political crisis in Bolivia reached a precarious impasse on Wednesday, with left- and right-wing adversaries so polarized that the departing president, Carlos Mesa, warned his country to step back from the brink of civil war.
 With Mr. Mesa's government collapsing and surging indigenous protesters demanding early elections and more say in economic policy, Bolivia, a country of nine million people, stands at a perilous moment. Five years of instability have already forced two presidents to quit. 
 In Santa Cruz, the eastern lowland province where much of the country's energy sector is located, peasants pressing for expropriation of private oil companies occupied installations belonging to Repsol YPF of Spain and British Gas, forcing the companies to shut down production.
 Here in the western Andes, Indians marched by the thousands and blocked key roads, keeping La Paz short of fuel and food and prompting two international airlines, American and LanChile, to cancel flights. 
 Two days after Mr. Mesa offered to leave office to defuse mounting protests, demonstrators vowed to topple the new government if it is led by the next in line to the presidency, the Senate president, Hormando Vaca Diez. Congress is preparing to accept Mr. Mesa's resignation on Thursday and anoint Mr. Vaca Diez as successor in a special session in Sucre, the judicial capital.
 Leaders of Bolivia's powerful indigenous movement vehemently oppose Mr. Vaca Diez, a wealthy land owner and long-time politician who has the support of the influential business elites in Santa Cruz, his home province. The conservative business class there wants more autonomy, giving it control over the natural gas reserves that the Indians in the highlands want to nationalize.
 Mr. Mesa, who remains president, warned the nation that Mr. Vaca Diez must stand down and permit early elections to prevent bloodshed. 
 ''Let us avoid lost lives, let us avoid a violence that devours us all,'' Mr. Mesa, who has been in office less than 20 months, said in a televised address late Tuesday. ''This is an exhortation for a country that is on the verge of civil war.''
 Since 2000, when a popular uprising forced an American water utility out of Cochabamba, a restive Indian majority has flexed its political muscle, protesting against foreign multinationals and market reforms prescribed by the United States and the International Monetary Fund. Before Mr. Mesa, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada was also forced out; he fled into exile in October 2003.
 Many Bolivians, especially the indigenous people, say market reforms put into practice by politicians like Mr. Sanchez de Lozada have left their country poorer than ever.
 That impatience has been evident across Latin America, where eight presidents have been ousted or forced to resign in popular uprisings since 2000. Left-leaning candidates have been swept into power in two-thirds of South America's countries.
 ''The bottom line is that Latin America is in open rebellion of the economic policies of the Washington consensus,'' said Jim Shultz, executive director of Democracy Center, a policy analysis group in Cochabamba. ''Sometimes it happens in the ballot box. Sometimes it happens on the street, like in Bolivia. It is, in essence, the same rebellion.'' 
 But in Bolivia, the movement against market reforms and the traditional ruling class has prompted a backlash from the right. ''The rejection by the right is called Hormando Vaca Diez,'' said Gonzalo Chavez, a political analyst at Catholic University in La Paz. 
 Protest leaders have vowed to stop Mr. Vaca Diez and the man who is next after him in line to the presidency, Mario Cossio Cortez, president of the lower house of Congress. Mr. Mesa and many others say the solution is for the two to step aside and permit the third in line, the Supreme Court president, Eduardo Rodriguez, to call elections.
 But Mr. Vaca Diez signaled to reporters that the military could be used to restore order. He also warned that the protests could lead to a crackdown from the right.
 ''The radicalism of the left leads to totalitarian governments,'' he said. 
 Mr. Vaca Diez has not explicitly said whether he will remain president once Mr. Mesa's resignation is accepted. But two powerful institutional parties that would benefit from the spoils if he takes power, the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement and his own Movement of the Revolutionary Left, support him. 
 Many Bolivians are infuriated by the possibility. ''If Vaca Diez is president, the remedy will be worse than the illness,'' said Mario Acarapi, 37, an office worker who took part in Wednesday's marches in La Paz. ''He is a man who will not listen to the people. He will listen to the old political class.''
 In a poll published Wednesday in La Prensa, 55 percent of respondents said they would support Mr. Rodriguez, while only 16 percent said they would support Mr. Vaca Diez.
 ''The country cannot play with the possibility of breaking into a thousand pieces,'' President Mesa said in his address. Speaking directly to Mr. Vaca Diez, Mr. Mesa called on him to ''resign his privilege to the constitutional succession.''
 ''It is in your hands to show the country a generosity that will make history,'' Mr. Mesa said, ''that will make you closer to the people than to continue insisting on the impossible.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Rebuffs Germans Anew on Bid for Security Council 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, in a move that is straining relations with the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, has again rebuffed Germany's effort to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, American and European officials said Wednesday.
 The officials said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice again relayed the United States' position in private to the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, on Wednesday, suggesting that expansion of the Security Council was secondary in importance to other changes in the United Nations, such as streamlining management. The United States had declined to endorse the German effort for weeks, but its tone became more emphatic in recent days. ''There are many reforms on the table,'' Ms. Rice told reporters with Mr. Fischer at her side after they met at the State Department. ''Now, in the context of broad reform, we also think that Security Council reform definitely needs to be examined.'' She said ''various ideas'' would be given ''a sober and reflective discussion'' to reach a consensus. German officials said that Ms. Rice told Mr. Fischer that the administration was not opposing Germany's effort per se but that it was wary of expanding the Security Council to 25 members from 15, as proposed by Germany, Japan, India and Brazil, which have united to advocate permanent membership for themselves. 
 ''We were given to understand by the United States that their concerns about this procedure are not motivated by any anti-German considerations,'' said Wolfgang Ischinger, the German ambassador to the United States, who was at the meeting with Mr. Fischer. ''She made that clear.''
 A senior administration official said that Ms. Rice had told Mr. Fischer that while not supporting the effort by the four nations, the United States ''was not opposed to any plan'' but wanted more discussion. Noting that China opposes a seat for Japan, Italy opposes one for Germany and Pakistan opposes one for India, the official said, ''We want to make sure there is a thorough discussion among all the parties, and we're not sure that has taken place.''
 But several other European and Asian diplomats say they have gotten the impression from top officials of the Bush administration that it opposes German membership, even if it eventually goes along with membership for other countries.
 Some diplomats said that they believed further that a factor in the United States' position was its continuing distrust of Mr. Schroder, who angered Mr. Bush when he campaigned for re-election against the war in Iraq in 2002, then opposed the war at the United Nations in 2003. Mr. Schroder faces another re-election battle this year.
 Expanding the Security Council needs the support of 128 nations, or two thirds of the 191 United Nations members. A vote is set for September, but diplomats involved in the effort say a consensus must emerge by July for a change to occur. Germany and the other countries acknowledge that they lack the necessary votes but contend they are making progress. American support is considered essential to any consensus.
 Officially, the Bush administration has only endorsed Japan's membership, even though Japan has made its own effort to gain permanent membership part of a package deal with Germany, India and Brazil. Some supporters of the other countries speculate that they may have to separate their efforts from Germany's to gain United States support.
 ''The German efforts have not met with great enthusiasm in Washington,'' said a senior European diplomat. ''I am using diplomatic understatement.''
 The Bush administration says it has made what it describes as ''reform'' at the United Nations a priority, and that the need for it was the reason cited when Mr. Bush nominated John R. Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations. What several diplomats called growing United States opposition to permanent Security Council membership for Germany has puzzled and dismayed many diplomats, who have said they could only speak candidly about it if they were not quoted by name or country. 
 A top European diplomat involved in delicate negotiations on many matters said the United States opposition was rankling Germany and could make it harder to work with Germany and other nations on such issues as preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
 Speaking to reporters before meeting with Ms. Rice, Mr. Fischer said he understood that Germany faced difficulties in convincing the United States of the merits of German membership but that expansion of the Security Council was necessary to strengthen its legitimacy throughout the world.
 Germany, he said, deserves to be a permanent member because it pays a large share of the United Nations' finances, has sent security forces to Afghanistan and the Balkans and is in the forefront of combating nuclear arms proliferation and promoting peace and economic development in the Middle East and the Arab world.
 Asked about the chances of convincing the United States, he said, ''We are trying our very best.''

4 Nations Drop Demand for Veto
 (By The New York Times)
 UNITED NATIONS, June 8 -- The four countries lobbying jointly for permanent seats on the Security Council -- Brazil, Germany, India and Japan -- said Wednesday that they were dropping their demand for the veto power that the five existing permanent members possess.
 In a revised resolution, which they hope to submit to a vote of the General Assembly this month, the four said they would delay pressing for veto rights for 15 years. In a cover letter, they acknowledged that the veto matter had caused particular concern to the wider membership in the campaign for the 128 votes needed to approve the measure. The resolution also calls for two more permanent seats for unnamed African nations. Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa are the front-runners. The resolution would expand to 25 the present 15-member Security Council, with four new nonpermanent members joining the six new permanent ones.

HEADLINE: Now, Money Is No Object; It's a Key Issue 

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; John Holl contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., June 8 

 BODY:
They got where they are today mostly because they were vastly richer than their opponents. Now, two multimillionaire businessmen-turned-politicians are facing off against each other for the first time to become the next governor of New Jersey.
 Fresh from their primary victories Tuesday night, the Republican nominee, Douglas R. Forrester, and the Democratic pick, Senator Jon S. Corzine, began their campaigns Wednesday by sketching out the themes they hope will carry them to victory in November: property taxes, health care and economic growth for Mr. Corzine; property taxes, corruption and Mr. Corzine's Senate record for Mr. Forrester. 
 Wasting no time, Mr. Corzine was out early greeting commuters in Iselin while Mr. Forrester appeared here with his six primary opponents in a show of unity following a caustic intraparty race.
 The campaign is expected to be one of the nation's most expensive this year, propelled by the decision by both men to opt out of New Jersey's pioneering system of public financing of campaigns so they can spend as much as they want. They are the state's first general election candidates to do so since the law was passed in 1974 in the wake of Watergate and a state fund-raising scandal.
 As one of only two governor's races this year, the campaign is also likely to be one of the nation's highest-profile political battles. While Virginia also has an open seat for governor, Mr. Forrester and Mr. Corzine are fighting for a seat after the resignation of James E. McGreevey seven months ago and the decision by Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, not to seek a full term.
 Though Republicans have fared poorly in statewide races in recent years, national Republican leaders say they see the chance to win control of the governor's office following nearly four years of scandal and corruption involving Democratic politicians. Indeed, as if to underscore that sense of importance and opportunity, Ken Mehlman, the party's national chairman, came here for the Republican unity lunch.
 ''We're united because the people of New Jersey understand that the status quo is unacceptable,'' Mr. Mehlman told an enthusiastic crowd.
 But Mr. Corzine, whose vast Wall Street fortune apparently scared away any potential major rivals, including Mr. Codey, did not act complacently, either. At 7 a.m., he showed up at the Metropark train station, in Iselin, and greeted bleary-eyed commuters, some of whom offered congratulations. An hour later, he held a news conference, and said that he hoped that the campaign would be conducted in a ''positive vein.''
 ''I'm looking forward to a really good debate this fall,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''I believe that there is a significant contrast between Mr. Forrester and myself.''
 On paper, at least, the race promises to be different from the last contest for governor in 2001 between Mr. McGreevey, who won, and Bret D. Schundler, who lost, then tried again this year, only to lose by five percentage points to Mr. Forrester.
 Mr. McGreevey and Mr. Schundler relied on public financing, and offered stark contrasts: Mr. McGreevey, a Democrat who had been the mayor of Woodbridge, was viewed as a career politician of modest means who had climbed dutifully up the political leader, while Mr. Schundler, the former mayor of Jersey City, was viewed as a conservative firebrand and disciple of Jack Kemp, an advocate of supply side economics.
 This time money figures to be a dominant theme. Both men have been willing to spend from their fortunes to pursue elective office.
 In 2000, Mr. Corzine, a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, spent more than $60 million of his own money on his successful bid for the United States Senate. This year, with a net worth of up to $261 million, he has not said how much he would be willing to spend. But he said he hoped that the voters would be more interested in a campaign about issues rather than in ''Mr. Forrester's bank account or mine.''
 ''I hope that if we stay focused on the issues this won't be an extraordinarily expensive campaign,'' he said today.
 In this year's primary, Mr. Forrester, who founded a company that manages pharmacy benefits, spent at least $10 million of his own money to defeat his rivals. He has not indicated how much he is prepared to spend. Most observers say that Mr. Forrester is worth much less than Mr. Corzine's $261 million, and his campaign says that he will release tax records soon.
 One question that Mr. Mehlman declined to answer, after Wednesday's Republican lunch, was how much money the Republican Party might be willing to pump into the race.
 But Mr. Forrester said that he believed whatever money he spent would be enough.
 ''We will be outspent in the campaign,'' Mr. Forrester said today. ''That's one thing we know. But we will have enough to get our message out.''
 Still, Norman J. Orenstein, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, said that Mr. Forrester's task would be daunting, because of New Jersey's status as an increasingly Democratic state and the likelihood that Mr. Corzine would strive to run a mistake-free front-runner's campaign.
 ''At this point, you have to say it's an uphill battle,'' he said. ''He will be an elusive target to bring down, unless he makes a huge personal mistake. But it's always possible people will say, 'It's time for a change, and let's roll the dice with the Republicans.'''
