DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, July 23 

 BODY:
Thomas H. Jacobsen, who led the Mercantile Bancorporation as it became one of the Midwest's largest banking companies before merging with Firstar, died on Saturday. He was 62. 
 The cause was leukemia, according to U.S. Bancorp, which merged with Firstar in 2000. 
 When it joined the Firstar Corporation in 1999, Mercantile, based in St. Louis, had $36 billion in assets and operated banks in nearly 500 places in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Illinois, Arkansas and Kentucky.
Born in Chicago, Mr. Jacobsen graduated from Lake Forest University and received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago.
Before coming to St. Louis in 1989, he was vice president of First National Bank of Chicago and vice chairman of the board of Barnett Banks Inc. of Florida.
He joined Mercantile as chief executive in March 1989 and led the corporation to record earnings, with profits increasing from $500,000 in 1989 to more than $500 million in 1998. 
He led Mercantile into the merger with Firstar in 1999.
Mr. Jacobsen was a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and president of the Federal Reserve Advisory Council, which represents the industry in advising Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, on monetary policy.
Survivors include his wife of 17 years, Diane DeMell Jacobsen; and a brother, Robert Jacobsen of Evanston, Ill.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Primedia to name an editorial director of sweeping scope.

BYLINE:  By David Carr 

 BODY:
PRIMEDIA is expected to announce this morning that Elizabeth Crow, a well-traveled magazine executive, has become editorial director of the company's consumer magazine and media group, which includes Seventeen and New York magazine, along with such hobbyist magazines as Kitplanes and Car Craft.
 In the newly created position, Ms. Crow, who most recently served as editorial director of the women's health group at Rodale, will oversee the editorial operations of Primedia's more than 150 consumer magazines, Internet operations and television programs. 
 Tom Rogers, the chief executive of Primedia, said Ms. Crow's comprehensive experience across a broad array of magazines made her an attractive addition.
"We couldn't ask for a person whose skills map any better with what our properties do," Mr. Rogers said. "She brings a track record of editorial excellence that will help make sure our core magazines are well differentiated and well positioned."
Ms. Crow has worked on both the editorial and publishing sides of the magazine business. She is the former chief executive of Gruner & Jahr USA, the owner of YM and Parents, and a former editor of Mademoiselle, which was published by Conde Nast Publications and has since ceased publication.
Ms. Crow, who took 2000 off to paint and write fiction before joining Rodale, said she took the Primedia job because of scale.
"When I was offered this job, I said, 'This is huge,' " she said. "I think I can exponentially leverage the experience I have. It is just a gigantic, wonderful job."
She will report to David Ferm, who recently became president of the consumer division after running the business-to-business group, a division of the company that has suffered mightily in a punishing ad market.
"It is our first editorial consumer director," Mr. Ferm said. "It presents a pretty significant opportunity for refreshing, repositioning and renovating these titles." Both Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ferm said Craig Reiss, an executive hired in a similar role at the business-to-business division, had been successful in improving editorial results there.
Ms. Crow said she was going to become involved in the day-to-day operations of magazine-making by intensely studying each of the company's products.
"I am a magazine doctor," she said. "And as a magazine doctor, what I do is become the best reader you ever had."
Ms. Crow joins a company that is in need of some rehabilitation. Primedia has been battered by the stock market.
Investors, concerned about its long-term debt load of about $2 billion and some questionable Internet-related acquisitions, including About.com, bid the company's stock down to a 52-week low of 95 cents during intraday trading yesterday. The stock closed at $1.01.
Primedia is hoping the overlay of a comprehensive editorial strategy will help draw readers and by extension create a more attractive environment for advertisers. While many of the company's special-interest publications are performing decently during this ad recession, some of the company's larger magazines, like Seventeen, are losing market share to their competitors. 
The hiring of Ms. Crow, however, may not be universally popular with people on the editorial side of the company who may resent another layer of management above them. Experienced editors who run some of the bigger magazines -- Caroline Miller at New York and Annemarie Iverson at Seventeen -- may not feel like they need additional oversight. 
But Ms. Crow said: "I love editors and art directors. I think that they should thank their lucky stars that I am between them and the purse strings."

HEADLINE: Retreat From Stocks Lifts Bond Prices 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices increased yesterday, driving two-year yields to record lows as more stock market losses sent investors into government bonds. 
 A late swoon in equities pushed bond prices higher and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, mostly lower. 
 The yield on the Treasury's two-year note dropped yesterday to 2.24 percent, down from 2.34 percent, on Monday and surpassing the low of 2.31 percent in November.
"As long as the equity market continues its free fall," said James Caron, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch Government Securities, "people are going to price in the fact that the Federal Reserve may have to cut interest rates to help boost the equity market."
The yield on the 10-year note dropped yesterday to 4.42 percent from 4.45 percent on Monday, as the price rose 6/32, to 103 17/32.
Yield on the 30-year note was unchanged at 5.28 percent, as the price rose 1/32, to 101 13/32.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.868
High Rate: 1.695
Coupon Yield: 1.695
Low Rate: 1.660

HEADLINE: Out of Stocks and Into What? Land, Cashand Bonds, That's What 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and JENNIFER BAYOT 

 BODY:
Some people have temporarily turned to cash as a safe haven. Others are hoping that real estate or bonds will be the coming decade's version of a can't-miss investment.
 Though most investors seem to be nervously holding to their belief that shares in American companies remain the best long-term investment, many others are looking for alternatives as the worst bear market in a generation deepens almost every day. 
 Deposits in money market funds and savings accounts have soared. Mutual funds made up of bonds, after years of being viewed as inherently inferior to stock funds, are stealing money from their rivals. Housing sales remain brisk, and people have begun increasing their spending on remodeling after a lull late last year. 
"I don't want to try to pick the market's bottom," said Adam Slone, 37, the president of a small executive search firm in Washington, who recently bought a bigger house than he had planned rather than investing money in the stock market. "I decided to be a little more conservative with my money."
From the start of June through July 17, investors sold about $46 billion more of mutual funds filled with stocks than they bought, according to Banc of America Securities. The $46 billion represents almost 1.5 percent of all stock mutual funds held in the United States. Barring a turnaround in the final week of this month, the redemption will be the largest over a two-month period since 1990. 
Whenever stocks declined during the long bull market of the 1990's, investors confidently bought shares, helping to create one of the biggest bubbles of the last century. The fall of the broad market by almost half since early 2000 has left many people questioning stocks, at least over the short term, for the first time in their lives.
So far, however, most are not abandoning them, turning instead to cash, in the form of money market funds and savings accounts, probably until they think the turmoil has ended. Money market funds captured more than three-quarters of the money that flowed out of stock mutual funds during the week ended July 17, Banc of America said.
Over the last year, the value of savings accounts has grown 22 percent, to $2.5 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. The recent increases appear to be the largest since at least 1959, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Economy .com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
Many of these investments offer a return of about 1 percent a year, roughly equal to the current level of inflation.
"That's earning peanuts, absolute peanuts," said David Cole, 53, a film producer in Morro Bay, Calif., who stopped buying stocks last year and moved some money into cash. "But that's better than getting losses."
Many people are able to remain sanguine about the market's drop because their homes are worth far more than their market investments, and housing prices have continued to rise smartly nationwide. A typical middle-class family has about 60 percent of its wealth tied up in its house and about 20 percent in pensions, 401(k) plans and other stocks, according to Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University.
Now, some people are increasing their real estate holdings. 
In the second quarter of this year, as the S.& P. 500-stock index was reversing its gains of last winter, the amount of money people spent on remodeling their homes -- from fixing roofs to renovating kitchens -- began rising. In the 12 months ended June 30, Americans spent $113.8 billion on such projects, up from $106.7 billion in the 12 months ended March 31, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.
Only a small part of that money probably came directly from stock sales, said Kermit Baker, director of the center's remodeling studies program, but the falling market made people more willing to improve their houses, hoping they would be increasing their value at the same time. With housing prices rising, "you don't need to spend much time justifying the expenditures on your home," Mr. Baker said.
Housing prices -- and the amount of real estate investing -- have also been helped by mortgage rates that have dropped in the last three months. Last week, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.54 percent a year, close to the three-decade low of 6.42 percent that it reached in November before rising early this year, according to Bankrate.com.
Most housing statistics are more than a month old and therefore offer little evidence of the effect that the recent market downturn has had on home buying. But investment advisers and real estate agents say that some affluent people selling stocks have used the proceeds to buy second homes in vacation centers.
"Over the last three months, we've seen a huge increase in the second-home market," said Ken Brunt, who tracks the market for EscapeHomes in Orinda, Calif. Mr. Brunt said traffic on his company's Web site and requests for referrals had each doubled since last year, with most of that growth in the last five months. He attributes people's interest to "a much greater awareness of the option to move directly out of the stock market" and into second-home investments. 
The unquestioning belief in housing prices has also raised some fears, however, that the real estate market could be following the path of once-celebrated technology stocks. 
"It scares me that it might be in a bubble," said Harold Evensky, the chairman of Evensky, Brown & Katz, a financial planning company in Coral Gables, Fla. "We've had a lot of clients buying property in Colorado."
Relatively few investors seem to share Mr. Evensky's concern, however. 
Philip Sheinbein, a venture capitalist in Phoenix, and his three younger siblings recently bought a vacation home in Park City, Utah, for $345,000, and they have reduced the part of their portfolio in stocks to less than 10 percent, from about 50 percent in 2000. 
"We're taking a fourth look and fifth look at everything," Mr. Sheinbein said, "whereas before we would have just taken a second look."
Mr. Sheinbein said he had also bought more bonds recently, and he has a great deal of company. 
Investors bought about $110 billion more of bond mutual funds than they sold from July 2001 to June 2002, bringing their total holdings to more than $1 trillion. In the previous two years -- when many investors liked to recite statistics about bonds always trailing stocks over the long term -- they sold a net $45 billion in such funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group for mutual fund companies.
As a group, however, investors do not appear to be making large transfers of money from one type of stock mutual fund to another. 
Investment in mutual funds made up of overseas stocks, which have fallen about as much as United States equities this year but remain less dearly priced relative to their earnings, has fallen marginally recently, for example. And in the two weeks that ended July 17, people took money out of all the major categories of mutual funds followed by Banc of America except one: gold and natural resources.
But the declines have not been nearly as drastic as the fall in stock prices, suggesting that the bull market of 1982 to 2000 remains as much a part of people's outlook as the recent bear market. 
"We haven't seen a lot taken out," said James P. Gorman, president of Merrill Lynch's retail business. "People have become used to the fact that this is a difficult market environment."
Above all, people seem to have adjusted the time frame over which they expect to make money in the stock market and shed the cockiness of the late 90's.
"I realized that single stocks are gambling; it's like going to the casino," said Mario Ruiz, 46, a consultant to the music industry who lives in Miramar, Fla., and lost about half of the $250,000 he had invested in Cisco Systems, Philip Morris, WorldCom and other companies two years ago.
"But do I believe in mutual funds for the long run? Absolutely," Mr. Ruiz said. "They've taken a drop, I know that. But I don't need that money now. In another 20 years, I think it will come back."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
MARKETS CONTINUE DOWNWARD TREND; BANKS LEAD WAY

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks fell again yesterday as concerns grew about the fate of telecommunications and energy trading companies and as Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill traveled to Wall Street to discuss the markets and economy with senior brokerage executives.
 On a day when news from Washington dominated the market, banks and energy stocks were hurt by the latest revelations regarding the Enron investigation, with officials of Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase defending their banks at a Senate hearing against accusations they had helped Enron cover up the extent of its debt. Those two stocks accounted for most of the 1.1 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. Page C1. 
 By the end of the day, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had fallen 2.7 percent, to a five-year low. And the Nasdaq composite index was off 4.2 percent, leaving it down more than 75 percent from the peak it reached less than two and a half years ago. 
"The investor is simply becoming more risk averse," said Frederick B. Taylor, chief investment officer at the United States Trust Company. "You are no longer playing with the house's money; this is real money, so preserve what you have."
Mr. O'Neill, who had faced criticism for his international travels while the stock market was plunging, had little to say publicly after he met with a few senior Wall Street executives in the morning and then had lunch with a larger group of investment strategists and economists at the New York Federal Reserve Bank.
"We had a wonderful lunch," he told reporters.
In the morning, according to people briefed on the meeting, Mr. O'Neill sat down with Philip J. Purcell, the chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley; David H. Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch; John Thain, co-president of the Goldman Sachs Group; and Stephen R. Volk, chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston.
They discussed the state of the economy, markets and investor confidence, these people said. One of them said that after hearing Mr. O'Neill's views, one Wall Street executive recommended that the Bush administration tone down its language on corporate misconduct because it clearly had not helped the markets. He did not disclose what Mr. O'Neill had said.
The Senate hearing also damaged shares of many energy companies, whose accounting is again being challenged. The Dow Jones utility average, which is dominated by electric utilities and includes some of the energy trading companies, fell 17.81 points, to 191.85, a drop of 8.5 percent. That was the steepest one-day decline for that index since the 1987 crash and left it at a seven-year low. That index has fallen 30 percent this month.
Reliant Energy, a member of the utility index, fell $5.77, to $7.90, after Senate investigators said it was among the companies that Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit had suggested use transactions similar to ones used by Enron.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the subcommittee that held a hearing on the role of banks in the Enron debacle, said he wanted to know the extent to which major financial institutions "knew of and aided Enron's accounting deceptions." Citigroup fell $5.04, or almost 16 percent, to $27, while J. P. Morgan Chase dropped $4.44, or 18 percent, to $20.08, trading at its lowest value since 1996.
Telephone stocks also dropped, with AT&T falling 72 cents, to $8.80, and trading at its lowest levels since the 1987 crash after it reported a record loss. Disappointing earnings news also came from SBC Communications, which dropped 66 cents, to $23.30, and Lucent Technologies, which fell 45 cents, to $1.65.
Early in the day, it appeared that Wall Street's string of losing days might be coming to an end. Stock index futures, which trade overnight while the stock market is closed, were up sharply, and the Dow managed to shoot up almost 110 points in early trading. But that gain soon faded, and the index ended down 82.24 points, at 7,702.34, its lowest close since September 1998.
The performance of the futures -- a market that is dominated by professional traders -- reflected the inability of many on Wall Street to believe that prices can keep going down and down. Ever since the market recovered from the 1987 crash, investors have been willing to step in and buy when prices fall, but that willingness seems to have vanished.
Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, rarely ventures into discussing stock prices. But in an interview with Bloomberg News yesterday, he noted that the S.& P. 500 was approaching the decline of 48.2 percent in the 1973-74 bear market, which was the worst decline since the Depression.
"We've just about matched that," Mr. Grasso said. "So I'm very optimistic that we're either at the bottom or very, very close to it." At yesterday's close, the S.& P. was off 47.8 percent from its peak in early 2000.
The failure of the Dow to finish the day up, leaving it with 11 losses over the last 12 trading sessions, could leave investors more worried about the outlook, even though the day's loss of 82 points was far less than the 234-point decline Monday and the 390-point plunge Friday. The fact that foreign stock markets also continued to fall yesterday is making more investors worry about the possibility that the American and other economies are slowing down or even falling back into a recession.
"Investors are beginning to think that the stock market will lead the economy into a slowdown," Mr. Taylor said.
Similarly, Donald Straszheim, an economist who runs his own advisory firm, warned that "the most serious risk at present" was that the stock market decline would begin to hurt spending by both consumers and businesses, as well as housing prices.
Cyclical stocks, which had been very weak in recent days as economic worries seemed to grow, rallied in the morning but gave up all their gains by the end of the day.
Henry Herrmann, the chief investment officer of Waddell & Reed, a money management firm in Overland Park, Kan., said even though there were some bargains, investors were not interested. "Things are a lot cheaper now, and there is a lot more to buy," he said. "But catching a falling knife is a bit of a problem. The market is still uncertain."
The stocks of big technology companies were also weak, with Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, Intel and Dell Computer dragging the Nasdaq lower. Microsoft, which fell $3.28, to $43.01, reached an 18-month low.
That helped push the Nasdaq down 53.60 points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,229.05, its lowest close since April 1997. The broader S.& P. 500 lost 22.15 points, or 2.7 percent, to 797.70, its first close below 800 since May 1, 1997, and its lowest close since April 29, 1997. 
Stock markets in Europe were up before New York trading began but fell when it became clear that the American market was not going to rally. The worst performance was turned in by the main German index, which fell nearly 5 percent.
The dollar, which had been weak most of the period when American stocks were falling in recent weeks, rallied, and the euro fell below $1, settling at 98.65 cents in New York trading. That could reflect a bit more optimism among foreign investors about American investments.

HEADLINE: Latin Companies Are Bargain Hunting in A rgentina 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 23 

 BODY:
Many North American and European companies in Argentina are still licking the wounds they suffered as the country's economy, South America's second largest, collapsed around them. But some Brazilian and Mexican companies have been waiting for the dust to settle and have slowly begun to seek out bargains that could increase their regional presence.
 That was the case Monday, as the Brazilian oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras, announced that it would buy a 58.6 percent stake in Perez Companc S.A., Argentina's top energy concern and one of the country's best-run companies, from the family owners for about $1.1 billion in cash and bonds. 
 "It was a slam-dunk for Petrobras," said Walter Molano at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. "It used the market downturn as an opportunity to pick up cheap assets." 
"The sale of Perez Companc," he added, "could shine a light on the excellent opportunities that are strewn throughout the region."
The deal was also the second major one in recession-wracked Argentina this year. In May, another Brazilian company, the brewer Bebidas das Americas, or AmBev, announced the first major deal since Argentina defaulted on its $141 billion debt and sharply devalued its peso five months earlier. AmBev agreed to acquire about 38 percent of Quilmes Industrial, Argentina's main beer producer, in a deal valued around $600 million, with plans to take control of the company eventually.
No one is expecting a sudden rush of mergers and acquisitions in Argentina. Though there is considerable wishful thinking, the continuing economic and political instability will scare off most investors.
But large companies in Brazil and Mexico with enough money and influence to play hardball with the Argentine government have started checking out the wares.
As President Vicente Fox of Mexico stepped off the plane in Buenos Aires early this month with a high-powered business delegation in tow, shares of Telecom Argentina shot up 20 percent when rumors spread that Carlos Slim Helu, the chairman of Telefonos de Mexico, was interested in buying the company, but was balking at its $3.2 billion of debt.
Although Telmex has repeatedly denied the rumors, analysts say that Mr. Slim is probably interested.
"Telmex and other big Mexican companies have enormous amounts of cash; they've had a good run; they have access to credit," Mr. Molano said.
That is not the case for their Argentine counterparts. Before the devaluation, the peso was pegged at parity to the dollar for a decade, tempting much of corporate Argentina to run up huge dollar-denominated debts because interest rates were lower.
Now, with their revenues dwindling and denominated in a peso worth about 30 cents, most cannot afford to pay those debts. Perez Companc's debt is $1.9 billion, for instance, and a spokesman for the family said that the prolonged economic crisis was a major factor in the decision to sell.
There are few signs of an end to the gloom. The economy shrank another 16 percent in the first quarter, and inflation could end up at more than 50 percent by the end of the year. Argentines are to vote in March to elect their sixth president since last December.
Petrobras's chief executive, Francisco Gros, acknowledged that the company was "concerned with the current macroeconomic scenario in Argentina, but in the long term we believe this will be a very good investment considering the good price we are paying for these assets."
"We didn't buy a dead chicken," Mr. Gros told reporters after a news conference here. "The chicken is very much alive, and it's laying eggs."
He said he expected to close a deal on another Argentine oil company, Santa Fe, soon.
According to Mr. Molano, as long as the Argentine government fails to rebuild a solid legal framework for business, it is easier for a state-owned company like Petrobras to risk investing than for other companies to do so.
"The bargains become more notable if you can enforce your property rights," Mr. Molano said. "A state-owned Petrobras from neighboring Brazil carries more clout than a private company from Spain. It's a government-to-government relationship."
Since the crisis began, Brazilian companies invested in Argentina have largely stayed put. And Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has been a vocal supporter of international assistance for Argentina.
By contrast, many European and North American companies have pulled up their stakes altogether, or have reduced or at least frozen their investments in Argentina. Several banks, which have written off billions of dollars in losses since the government froze Argentines' savings accounts last December, have decamped, including the Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Agricole and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.
Eloi Rodrigues de Almeida, who heads Grupo Brasil, a business lobby group based in Buenos Aires, said that had burnished the image of corporate Brazil, once spurned by the more urbane Argentines.
Much public anger at the banking freeze has been vented on branches of two Spanish banks with big Argentine operations, Banco Santander Hispano Central and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, and two American giants, Citibank and BankBoston Argentina, now part of FleetBoston Financial.
According to a recent poll in Argentina, residents of Buenos Aires and other major cities said they would still prefer that United States companies invest in Argentina, but Brazil came next, ahead of Spain.
Mr. Almeida said that Brazilian corporate raiders, no strangers to economic volatility at home, were ideally positioned to expand in Argentina, Brazil's main partner in the Mercosur trade bloc.
"It's not just a question of shares being cheap," he said. "For Brazilian companies wanting to expand abroad, the natural first stop should be Argentina."
Future acquisitions, he predicted, would be in industries like auto parts, processed foods and dairy production.

HEADLINE: Wearied by Reality, Television Returns To a 1980's Mind-Set 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., July 23 

 BODY:
David Morse, a television star of the 1980's, is returning to prime time this fall. In CBS's "Hack," he will play an ex-corrupt cop turned cabdriver who atones by helping strangers. The show is a moody drama that closely resembles "The Equalizer," an 80's series on CBS about a disillusioned ex-secret agent who atones by helping strangers.
 John Ritter is also returning. Nearly 20 years after his hit comedy, ABC's "Three's Company," went off the air in 1984, he's back with two sexy roommates in ABC's "8 Simple Rules." This time, however, they are his teenage daughters. 
 Fox's popular summer talent show, "American Idol," echoes the 80's "Star Search," with the poisonous Simon Cowell stepping in for the pleasant Ed McMahon. 
Television is no more immune to the pull of cyclical tides than fashion, music or the economy. When "The Cosby Show," "Family Ties" and the police drama "Hill Street Blues" were hits in the 80's, it was at a time when insider-trading scandals and the collapse of the junk bond market were souring the public's giddy embrace of Wall Street.
Once again economic jitters: the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the shakiness of mega-media conglomerates, the corporate accounting fraud scandal and insider-trading charges. And series being shown to critics and reporters here this week indicate that either by coincidence or unconscious design, the sensibility that molded 1980's television is saturating the new season.
Media scholars, who sift through torrents of programming seeking patterns, find a link even between the reality shows that defined the television of the late 90's and the prime-time soap operas that marked the early Reagan years. Sitcoms are comforting. Dramas are gritty and disturbing but offer some hope.
"Audiences are looking for normal families -- they found 'Everybody Loves Raymond' on CBS and 'Reba' on WB, and grabbed onto them," Bruce Helford, an executive producer whose own sitcom for ABC, "The George Lopez Show," is centered around a Cosby-ish Hispanic family. "People don't want to be alienated. They are looking for something safer."
Many dramas, on the other hand, mirror public disenchantment with institutions, including the Roman Catholic Church. On "Miracles," a drama that ABC is marketing as a "spiritual X-Files," the hero parts company with the church hierarchy because he feels its leaders do not really believe in miracles.
Shows that aim to provide mindless thrills, like "Fastlane," a new Fox drama showcasing two buddy cops -- one white, the other black -- flashy cars and MTV-style music in an homage to "Miami Vice," also carries a trace of that 80's show's world-weariness.
Dana Delany, whose greatest television success was as a Vietnam nurse in the late 80's show "China Beach," is back in scrubs this fall as a doctor on "Presidio Med," a CBS show that echoes "E.R." and also the 80's show "St. Elsewhere," which gave Mr. Morse his prime-time start. Blythe Danner, who starred in a short-lived 80's prime-time soap called "Tattingers," is a co-star.
Even "Grubbs," a barbed Fox sitcom about a steelworker father, Randy Quaid, who supports his wife and children by faking disability claims, is a paler shade of "Roseanne."
Like ordinary investors, television executives seem to be feeling bruised and less bold. They may envy HBO its 93 Emmy nominations this year for more avant-garde shows like "Six Feet Under," but these days they are as risk averse as portfolio managers. "Network executives are always asking, 'Will it be depressing?' " Mr. Helford said.
Plenty of other signposts of the era of Reagan, Milkin and Madonna are back, perhaps under the spell of what Simon Reynolds, a music critic who is writing a book about 80's post-punk music, called "the charm of remoteness." 
Designer jeans are once again a huge industry, and the revival of 80's techno-pop on MTV and youth radio has now drifted onto network television. On "Keen Eddie," a Fox show about a New York detective transplanted to London, much of the background music is from the 80's.
There is even another crocodile hunter in the movie theaters.
The 1980's are suddenly so compelling that two different shows, one on WB and another on ABC, have heroes who travel back in time to their Reagan-era high school years. NBC's nostalgia is centered on "American Bandstand" in the early 60's with its family drama "American Dreams," but even NBC is developing a made-for-television movie "Hunter: Return to Justice," reviving the exploits of the 1980's television detective Rick Hunter.
" 'Millionaire" and 'Survivor' are like such prime-time soaps as 'Dallas,' 'Dynasty' and 'Falcon Crest,' shows that celebrate people locked in Darwinian competition," said Ron Simon, the curator of the Museum of Television and Radio in New York.
All television shows of course are derivative. Almost any medical show can be traced back to "Ben Casey," just as "I Love Lucy," is at the root of countless comedies. At different times, however, different genres regain their resonance with audiences: screwball comedies that distracted moviegoers during hard economic times or dark satires like the film "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" that matched the country's disaffection after Vietnam and Watergate.
These days, after Sept. 11 and the bursting of the economic bubble, television executives say that television audiences remain skeptical about authority, but that they also seem to hunger for signs of stability.
"It's not like 'Baretta' in the 70's, a tough guy fighting the system, it's people in the system who can assert order over chaos," said Gil Schwartz, CBS's executive vice president in charge of communications. The CBS forensic science drama, "C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation," was so successful last year that the network is spinning off "C.S.I.: Miami," this fall, starring David Caruso, who was a star of "N.Y.P.D. Blue" in 1993.
One other explanation of 80's retro of course is that many of the people who are now in charge of making television shows came of age in the 1980's and find their youth fascinating.
Jeremy Miller, a creator and executive producer of "That Was Then," the ABC show about a 29-year-old who travels back to his 1988 high school traumas, said he set his show in 1988 because it was the year he graduated from high school. His show is noticeably bleaker in tone than "Do Over," the WB version which is set in 1980, a more optimistic period. 
One other explanation for the retro programming is that many of the people now making television shows came of age in the 1980's. They are hoping that people in the key demographic groups will find the 80's revival fascinating.
"I think right now we are at a time in our country of fear and economic pain, and we yearn for a simpler time," said Warren Littlefield, the executive producer of "Do Over," explaining the 1980's nostalgia. Mr. Littlefield, who as a top executive at NBC oversaw hits like "The Cosby Show" and "Cheers," has rosy memories. "For me, those years at NBC were a magical ride," he said. "I think of the 1980's as a time of infinite possibility."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Talks of Layoffs, but Some Hear Negotiation Tactic 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg raised the specter of layoffs this week just as his administration enters a crucial new phase with the city's labor unions.
 The city must negotiate a new contract with its largest union, District Council 37, whose contract expired June 30. A police contract is being decided for the first time by a state panel, which the main police union has long believed would yield generous raises. And the city still hopes to win $250 million more in union concessions on pensions and other fringe benefits to help balance the budget that took effect this month. 
 Some fiscal experts said they believed that the mayor, in hinting at layoffs, was seeking leverage to use in the many labor negotiations that his administration faces.
"We've seen six months of the carrot, and now we're seeing the stick," said Edmund J. McMahon Jr., a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who has previously criticized the administration for failing to make enough budget cuts. "If he's going to get anywhere in contract talks, and he's going to get anything in terms of meaningful concessions, he needs leverage."
Mr. Bloomberg has said he is simply exploring options to cut a billion dollars out of this year's $42.3 billion budget. He has begun to talk about the need to cut the size of the city's work force -- preferably, but not necessarily, by offering early retirement and severance packages.
The city's budget director, Mark Page, sent a letter to city commissioners on Friday directing them to come up with plans to reduce their spending by 7.5 percent, and telling them that they were free to consider layoffs.
Asked yesterday if he would be open to laying off workers if that was what his commissioners were to recommend, Mr. Bloomberg left the door open. "Nobody is in favor of layoffs," he said. "You want to write the story that somebody is in favor of firing people. Nobody wants to do that. We have no choice. We must cut our expenses, and each commissioner will come back with their ideas as to how they can do that, what the impact would be, first and foremost on the public, and second, on the work force." 
Union officials, City Council members and advocates for social service programs denounced the talk of layoffs, and used the opportunity to renew their calls for tax increases. The mayor has mostly ruled them out this year, explaining that it is an election year in Albany and the city would be unlikely to get legislative support.
"When you start talking about layoffs, you're talking about service reductions to New Yorkers, and before one considers service reductions that go to the heart and soul of what New York is about, you have to think about revenue enhancements," said Randi Weingarten, the chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee and the president of the United Federation of Teachers, which settled its contract with the city this year. 
Lillian Roberts, the executive director of District Council 37, said that her union still supports reinstating the commuter tax, which netted the city $300 million to $500 million a year but was repealed by the State Legislature in 1999.
Bonnie Brower, the executive director of the City Project, a budget watchdog group that has criticized the mayor for making too many budget cuts and not supporting tax increases, said: "I think the mayor's refusal to consider smart, targeted, modest tax increases makes the talk of layoffs almost inevitable. I think that the only thing surprising is that it's happening so quickly, while the ink is still drying on the budget."
And Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, which held numerous protests against budget cuts throughout the spring, said he was planning another one at City Hall today -- months before he thought he would need to.
Mr. Bloomberg was clearly sensitive to the concern that the word layoff arouses in a city where many people still remember the troubles caused by layoffs during the fiscal crisis in the 1970's.
He stressed that it was still too early to say if he would need them this year. But he noted again that the deficits that the city faces next year and the year after are "dismal." And, he added, he needs to act soon in a way that closes the gaps without harming the city and endangering its economic future.
"If you balance the budget today in such a way that you damage your long-term growth, you will always have a problem," he said. "We're trying to find that balance between making this still a place where people want to come, live and bring their business, at the same time finding a ways to balance the budget."

HEADLINE: Missing the 90's Bubble Looks Prescientin 2002 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
At the time, they must have felt left out at cocktail parties and dismissed as slightly crazy by many of their neighbors. But those who ignored stocks in the mid- and late-1990's -- and all the hype that was swirling around them at the time -- are now significantly better off than those who put their money to work on Wall Street.
 The decline in the stock market has been so steep in the last two and a half years -- including a 19 percent plunge in the Standard & Poor's 500 index since the end of June -- that anyone who put money in bonds between the mid-1990's and now is doing better today than those who trusted in stocks. On a total return basis, the starting date has to be pushed back to July 1995 before money invested in a broad portfolio of major stocks would have outperformed an investment made at the same time in Treasury notes and bonds. 
 The realization that bonds are not so bad is nothing new in a down stock market. But since the belief in stocks as the only investment has been in vogue so long, bonds have not been on the alternatives list of many investors.
Now they are, and those rushing into the bond market -- while too late to head off big losses in their stock portfolios -- could help buoy the economy and eventually contribute to a stock market recovery as well.
Rising bond prices push interest rates down, and that is fueling not only a housing and refinancing boom but also increased consumer borrowing at relatively low cost. Those actions seem to be what Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is counting on to carry the economy through a rough spot until the stock market settles down and businesses start spending again.
In the last four months, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note, which has a big influence on home mortgage rates but also affects equity loans and even other borrowing rates on everything from cars to college tuition, has dropped a percentage point to 4.42 percent.
This has brought mortgage rates near their lowest levels in decades, with the average national rate on a 30-year mortgage now at 6.49 percent. Falling mortgage rates prompt homeowners to refinance their home loans. In turn, homeowners can lower their monthly payments and borrow additional money. Both activities can free money for anything from home improvements to vacations.
As a result, the decline in interest rates serves as a stabilizer for the economy, offsetting the blow to consumer spending expected by some economists from the stock market decline.
"Greenspan is betting that the tail wind of a stronger property market will offset the headwind of the stock market," said Paul A. McCulley, portfolio manager and economist at the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif.
While Mr. Greenspan has plenty of supporters among economists, skeptics abound as well. Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, for one, has his doubts.
"If you go half a percentage point below where we are now on mortgage rates, then everybody in the United States will refinance their mortgage and that is a pretty potent force," he said. "Unfortunately, the driver on the other side, stocks, is also a potent force -- negatively."
Since stocks began their latest plunge four months ago, Merrill Lynch's index of Treasury notes and bonds has had a total return of 6.6 percent through Monday. The gains, though modest by the outsize standards of the 1990's, are far superior to bank deposits and a counterpoint to the total-return decline of 29 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the same period.
With investors putting more money into bonds, bond traders are dealing with an onslaught of new money.
The positive impact from falling interest rates and the negative consequence of falling stock prices work through the economy in many ways, but one of the most important comes from the so-called wealth effect. Under this theory, consumers are more willing to increase their spending when they feel richer because of the rise in the value of their stocks or their homes. The wealth effect, of course, can also move in the opposite direction. While estimates vary, economists think that many people might spend anywhere from 2 cents to 5 cents more for every dollar of increased personal wealth and cut their spending by a somewhat smaller amount when their wealth declines.
Mr. Greenspan indicated last week that he thought the housing wealth effect has the upper hand, for now. "Fixed mortgage rates remain at historically low levels and thus should continue to fuel reasonably strong housing demand and, through equity extraction, to support consumer spending as well," Mr. Greenspan said in his semiannual economic analysis for Congress.
It certainly was not Mr. Greenspan's intention, but there is one other consequence of the end of the stock boom, the fall in interest rates and the better performance of bonds. Mr. Greenspan's own portfolio -- invested in the Treasury market and money market funds to avoid any conflicts of interest -- now looks a whole lot better than when he was being celebrated for helping bring about an economic miracle.

The House approved a $28.5 billion emergency spending bill today to pay for military operations, domestic security and New York's recovery effort from the Sept. 11 attacks.
 The money for New York, totaling $5.5 billion, represents the final installment of the roughly $21.5 billion aid package that President Bush promised to provide New York to assist in its recovery. 
 The bipartisan House vote, 397 to 32, also includes $14.5 billion for the Pentagon to pay for the war in Afghanistan, as well as $6.7 billion for antiterrorism and other domestic security measures. The Senate is expected to approve the spending bill as early as Wednesday. 
Though it had widespread support, the bill had been held up for weeks in a clash between the White House and lawmakers from both parties. Mindful of the fall elections, lawmakers sought significantly more money than President Bush had requested for a host of initiatives, including bolstering port security, combating bioterrorism and assisting local law enforcement authorities.
Alarmed about the mounting federal budget deficit, the Bush administration balked. In the end, lawmakers cut $1.5 billion from the aid package, concerned that the momentum for a spending bill would fade and that no extra money would be approved before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.
The spending package, hammered out last week by House and Senate negotiators, was approved with little fanfare and with nothing approaching the bitterness of the last few weeks, when Republicans and Democrats complained that the White House was shortchanging national security by penny-pinching.
"We simply need to get on with it, and we need to get this down to the president," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee and a main author of the spending package.
Last night, a White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said, "the emergency spending bill is important for the Congress to act on, and we're pleased that it is doing so."
The $5.5 billion of aid to New York includes $2.66 billion for emergency response and debris removal at the World Trade Center site, $750 million to help utilities rebuild equipment destroyed in the attacks, $1.8 billion to build a transportation hub connecting PATH trains and subway lines running through Lower Manhattan, and $167 million to repair the West Side Highway and other roads.
The bill also expands the number of New Yorkers eligible for emergency housing aid as a result of the attacks. The provision was included in response to reports that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had denied thousands of people the aid they needed to avoid eviction or foreclosure.
While FEMA officials have said that they are moving to address the problem, the provision's supporters, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, argue that action by Congress takes the decision out of the agency's hands and ensures that the aid is distributed to the people who need it.
The spending package includes $522 million more than the president requested for the Pentagon and $2.4 billion more than he sought for domestic security measures.
House and Senate negotiators offset those increases by calling for cuts in other areas, including providing $550 million less than the $4.4 billion that the Transportation Security Administration requested. 
The $6.7 billion that the bill sets aside for national security includes $175 million for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's counterterrorism efforts, as well as $201 million to provide grants to local police, firefighters and emergency workers.
The bill also provides $2.1 billion in foreign aid. That includes $200 million to assist Israel in combating international terrorism, $50 million in humanitarian aid for the West Bank and Gaza and $211 million for enhanced embassy security.
Despite the White House's insistence on adhering to the bottom line, the spending bill also included items that, on the surface, at least, had little to do with national security: $1 billion in Pell grants for low-income students, $417 million to provide medical care for veterans, $400 million to help states upgrade voting systems, $205 million for Amtrak, $200 million for fighting AIDS and other diseases abroad, and $100 million for combating wildfires and floods out West.

 Re "Divided by a Call for a Common Language" (news article, July 19): 
 The cause of immigrants and old-timers alike suffers when pro-English ordinances are viewed as part of a xenophobic "backlash." Resolutions like the one passed in Green Bay, Wis., could greatly increase the social and economic opportunities of immigrants who are not yet fluent in English. 
Furthermore, immigrants and non-immigrants who have a language in common may be able to channel their conflict into constructive debate and discourse, building trust and even friendship across both communities.

HEADLINE: Trying to Elude The Google Grasp 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
THE Internet has reminded Camberley Crick that there are disadvantages to having a distinctive name. 
 In June, Ms. Crick, 24, who works part time as a computer tutor, went to a Manhattan apartment to help a 40-something man learn Windows XP. 
 After their session, the man pulled out a half-inch stack of printouts of Web pages he said he had found by typing Ms. Crick's name into Google, the popular search engine. 
"You've been a busy bee," she says he joked. Among the things he had found were her family Web site, a computer game she had designed for a freshman college class, a program from a concert she had performed in and a short story she wrote in elementary school called "Timmy the Turtle."
"He seemed to know an awful lot about me," Ms. Crick said, including the names of her siblings. "In the back of my mind, I was thinking I should leave soon."
When she got home, she immediately removed some information from the family Web site, including the turtle story, which her father had posted in 1995, "when the Web was more innocent," she said. But then she discovered that a copy of the story remains available through Google's database of archived Web pages. "You can't remove pieces of yourself from the Web," Ms. Crick said.
The gradual erosion of personal privacy is hardly a new trend. For years, privacy advocates have been spinning cautionary tales about the perils of living in the electronic age.
But it used to be that only government agencies and businesses had the resources and manpower to track personal information. Today, the combined power of the Internet, search engines and archival databases can enable almost anyone to find information about almost anyone else, possibly to satiate a passing curiosity. 
As a result, people like Ms. Crick are trying to reduce their electronic presence -- and discovering that it is not as simple as it would seem. The Internet, which was supposed to usher in an era of limitless information, is leading some people to restrict the information that they make available about themselves.
"Now it's much more common to look up people's personal information on the Web," Ms. Crick said. "You have to think what you want people to know about you and not know about you."
These days, people are seeing their privacy punctured in intimate ways as their personal, professional and online identities become transparent to one another. Twenty-somethings are going to search engines to check out people they meet at parties. Neighbors are profiling neighbors. Amateur genealogists are researching distant family members. Workers are screening co-workers. 
In other words, it is becoming more difficult to keep one's past hidden, or even to reinvent oneself in the American tradition. "The net result is going to be a return to the village, where everyone knew everyone else," said David Brin, author of a book called "The Transparent Society" (Perseus, 1998). "The anonymity of urban life will be seen as a temporary and rather weird thing."
Some believe that this loss of anonymity could be dangerous for those who prefer to remain hidden, like victims of domestic violence.
"If you are living in a new town trying to be hidden, it's pretty easy to find you now between Google and online government records," said Cindy Southworth, who develops technology education programs for victims of domestic violence. "Many public entities are putting everything on the Web without thinking through the ramifications of those actions." 
Of course, a lot of personal information that can be found on the Internet is already in the open, having been printed in newspapers, school newsletters, yearbooks and the like. In addition, the government records that are moving online -- tax assessments, court documents, voter registration -- are already public.
But much of that kind of information used to be protected by "practical obscurity": barriers arising from the time and inconvenience involved in collecting the information. Now those barriers are falling as old online-discussion postings, wedding registries and photos from school performances are becoming centralized in a searchable form on the Internet. 
"Google and its siblings are creating a whole that is much greater than the sum of the parts," said Jonathan Zittrain, director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School. "Many people assume they are a needle in a haystack, simply a face in the crowd. But the minute someone takes an interest in you, the search tool is what allows the rest of the crowd to dissolve." 
As a result, people are considering how to live their lives knowing that the details might be captured by a big magnifying glass in the sky.
"Anonymity used to give us a cushion against small mistakes," Mr. Brin said. "Now we'll have to live our lives as if any one thing might appear on page 27 in two years' time."
Waqaas Fahmawi, 25, used to sign petitions freely when he was in college. "In the past you would physically sign a petition and could confidently know that it would disappear into oblivion," said Mr. Fahmawi, a Palestinian-American who works as an economist for the Commerce Department. 
But after he discovered that his signatures from his college years had been archived on the Internet, he became reluctant to sign petitions for fear that potential employers would hold his political views again him.
He feels stifled in his political expression. "The fact I have to think about this," he said, "really does show we live in a system of thought control."
David Holtzman, editor in chief of GlobalPOV, a privacy Web site, said that the notion of privacy was "undergoing a generational shift." Those in their late 20's and 30's are going to feel the brunt of the transition, he said, because they grew up with more traditional concepts of privacy even as the details of their lives were being captured electronically.
"It almost gives you a good reason to name your kid something bland," Mr. Holtzman said. "You are doing them a good favor by doing that."
Indeed, a generic name is what Beth Roberts, 29, was seeking when she changed back from her married name, Werbick, after a divorce. A Google search on "Beth Werbick" returns results only about her. But a search for "Beth Roberts" returns thousands upon thousands of Web pages. "I would have plausible deniability if someone wanted to attribute something to me," said Ms. Roberts, who lives in Austin, Tex. 
Mr. Fahmawi, the economist, said he envied the ability to be a name in the crowd. "If I had a more generic name, I'd sign petitions with impunity," he said.
But those who have become more conscious of their Internet presence can find that it is almost impossible to assert control over the medium -- something that copyright holders discovered long ago. 
The debate over privacy is particularly fervent in the field of online genealogy, where databases and family trees are copied freely, with or without the consent of the living individuals. 
Jerome Smith, who runs a genealogical Web site, recently removed some names at the request of a man who did not want his children's information on the Web. But Mr. Smith noted the information itself had been copied from a larger public database. "Once you put it out there, it's out there," said Mr. Smith, who lives in Lake Junaluska, N.C.
Google says its search engine reflects whatever is on the Internet. To remove information about themselves, people have to contact Web site administrators.
A disadvantage of instant Internet profiling is that there is no quality control -- and little protection against misinterpretation. The fragments of people's lives that emerge on the Internet are somewhat haphazard. They can be incomplete, out of context, misleading or simply wrong.
John Doffing, the chief executive of an Internet talent agency called StartUpAgent, is surprised by how many job applicants ask him what it is like to be a gay chief executive in Silicon Valley. He says that even though he is heterosexual, some people assume he is gay because his name turns up on the Internet in association with his philanthropic work relating to AIDS and an online gallery devoted to gay and lesbian art. 
While this has been more amusing than troubling, he says, such information could be misused. "What happens if I were a job seeker and someone decides not to give me a job because of the same assumption?" he asked.
There are also cases of mistaken Google-identity. Sam Waltz Jr., a business consultant in Wilmington, Del., met a woman through an online dating service. Before they met in person, she sent him an e-mail message saying that she did not think they were compatible. She had found his name on a Web site called SincereLust.com, which appeared to her to be run by a Delaware-based transvestite group. 
"I'm sitting here, reading her e-mail and thinking, 'What is this?' " Mr. Waltz said.
He discovered that the site was a drama group dedicated to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." His son, Sam Waltz III, had been a member while he was at the University of Delaware. 
Mr. Waltz quickly explained the situation to the woman, and they have been dating for 18 months. "Now I periodically do a self-Google to make sure there is nothing else that needs to be challenged or checked," Mr. Waltz said.
Some say that the phenomenon of instant unchecked background searches could be manipulated to sabotage others' reputations.
Jeanne Achille, the chief executive of a public relations firm called the Devon Group, was horrified that someone had used her name and e-mail address to post racist slurs in a French online discussion group. She has repeatedly had to explain the situation to potential clients who have asked her about the posting.
"Whoever did this had to put some thought into it," Ms. Achille said. "Is it perhaps one of our competitors? Is it someone who felt we did something to them and wanted to get back at us? Is it a personal thing? Is it a disgruntled former employee?"
The posting has been impossible to remove. "There is no cyberpatrol that you can go to and make all of this go away," Ms. Achille said. "You just have to live with it." 

Defensive Strategies
How to Limit Search Exposure
A lot of online information about you and your family may be out of your immediate control, but there are ways to limit what others can find. 
* Periodically do Internet searches on your name to see what turns up. If there is information that you prefer not to have publicly available, contact the site's owner or Webmaster. Google says its database will typically reflect the changes within six to eight weeks.
* When making postings to the Internet, Usenet discussion groups or e-mail lists that archive messages, consider using a nickname or an "online handle" rather than your full formal name. 
* Take steps to prevent a personal Web site or Weblog from being noted by the robotic programs that "crawl" and index the Web (for example, a family Web page that you want only friends and family members to see). Information on how to do that is available at www.robotstxt.org.
* If you sign a petition or make a donation to a political group, understand that the information could become public and searchable on the Internet.
* If you want to put personal photos on the Internet, consider using an online photo service that can "share" photos with families and friends using a password but are not indexed for search engines. 
* If you do online genealogy, consider whether or not you have -- or need -- permission to put information about living people online, including their mothers' maiden names, which can be used in identity theft.
* Remember that e-mail sent in confidence can be forwarded, intentionally or inadvertently, and even wind up on the Web.

HEADLINE: American Capitalism's Other Side 

BYLINE:  By Fred P. Hochberg; Fred P. Hochberg was deputy administrator and acting administrator of the Small Business Administration from 1998 to 2001.

 BODY:
Andy Grove, a founder of Intel, summed up the mood of recent weeks when he said he is "embarrassed and ashamed" to be a corporate executive in America today.
 Like so many other great successes, Intel was, in its early years, nurtured by an economic system that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship -- and helped by institutions like the Small Business Administration. In return, the company grew into an example of American ingenuity. 
 Historically, America's small- business owners have always focused on fundamentals: they concentrate on creating something of value, generating jobs and profits in the process. At the heart of the current corporate quagmire is a departure from these principles.
Driven by the perceived imperatives of the stock market, many corporations have skewed their priorities. Meeting quarterly earnings projections has become more important for them than building long-term shareholder value. The result can be seen in the implosion of giant corporations, thousands of layoffs and evaporating retirement savings. This spectacle has cast a pall not just over corporate America but over the American brand of free-market capitalism.
Despite the pessimism here and abroad, most American corporations are aboveboard in running their businesses and recording their bottom lines.
But more important, it's just not true that as big corporations go, so goes the American economy.
During the 1990's, more than 80 percent of the net gain in new jobs was not from corporate giants, but from small companies involved in a range of businesses (far broader than the dot-coms). By the end of the decade, nearly half the work force was employed in small businesses. Their efforts powered the record economic growth of the 1990's.
Government and business leaders from around the world come to our country to learn how we nurture and sustain small entrepreneurs. But we are not doing nearly enough to show the world this side of American capitalism. The Bush administration removed the Small Business Administration from the cabinet and proposed cutting the agency's funding by over 20 percent. Worse, it aims to reduce the agency's lending capacity by 50 percent. This year, there is $9.4 billion available for small-business loans guaranteed by the agency. For next year, the administration is proposing less than $5 billion. At a minimum, the administration should restore or even increase the agency's lending capacity, especially since access to capital may now be sharply curtailed.
At a time of shaken confidence in American business, the administration should also work to put the small-business model at the heart of our global economic message. It should invest more resources to encourage the growth of small businesses in the developing world through microlending institutions. Microloans give people the opportunity to improve their lives and become stakeholders in their societies. Microlending nurtures the fundamental values of democracy and helps them take root.
Businesses based on jobs and profit, not the gambles of the stock market, are the real foundation of American capitalism. I have never heard small-business owners say they were embarrassed by what they do; they are rightfully proud of the enterprises they have built.

HEADLINE: In a Surprise, ABB Reports Quarterly Loss 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 24 

 BODY:
ABB surprised investors and analysts today by posting a loss for the second quarter, which it attributed to operational troubles and the costs of asbestos-related litigation. Coming on a day full of sour corporate news in Switzerland, ABB's loss prompted a 23 percent fall in its stock price.
 The Zurich-based company, a Swiss-Swedish builder of power plants and other heavy machinery, narrowly averted a financial crisis earlier this year and has suffered a series of embarrassments surrounding current and former top executives and their pay. It said today that it lost $13 million in the latest quarter, in part because of cost overruns at two projects in its oil, gas and petrochemicals division that it did not identify. 
 Revenue for the second quarter was $5.78 billion, little changed from the comparable period last year. The company's debt rose sharply, to $5.2 billion on June 30, from $4.1 billion at the beginning of the year.
Much of the problem in the second quarter was traceable to asbestos-related litigation in the United States, stemming from industrial boilers made in the 1970's by Combustion Engineering, a business ABB later bought and then sold again, retaining responsibility for the liabilities. Asbestos claims against the company rose 10 percent in the quarter, raising concerns that ABB will have to add to its reserves.
"We had a loss in the second quarter as a result of some charges to put us on a better footing," said Jorgen Centerman, ABB's chief executive, who has been struggling to restore confidence in the company. Referring to the stock price, he said in a telephone interview: "I don't understand what happened today. If you look at the underlying performance of the company, nearly every single parameter started to move in the right direction."
The positive signs he cited included a 10 percent rise in new orders, many from its biggest and most important customers, and an 8 percent rebound in sales from the depressed levels of the first quarter. Mr. Centerman said the second half of the year was looking stronger; earlier this week, it landed a $1 billion Russian order for oil field equipment.
Asset sales will help ABB meet its target for reducing debt, he said, adding that he expects the company's structured-finance unit to find a buyer after September.
Over the last year, ABB has responded to rapidly weakening demand by eliminating 10,900 jobs, partly through attrition, at a cost of $106 million.
Other Swiss stocks taking a beating today over profit weakness included Serono International, the biggest biotechnology company in Europe, and Adecco, a major worldwide temporary-employment agency. Word that Adecco's first-half profits were lower than expected chopped 14 percent off its share price; Serono shares fell 19 percent after the company lowered its forecast of earnings growth to 10 percent from the mid- to high teens.

PERSON: Arnold Weinstock 

HEADLINE: Arnold Weinstock, Top British Industrialist, Is Dead at 77 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Arnold Weinstock, who for 30 years dominated Britain's electrical and electronics industries with his giant General Electric Company, only to be ousted by critics who then virtually bankrupted the company, died on Tuesday at his home in Wiltshire. He was 77.
 The cause was cancer, The Times of London reported. 
As managing director of General Electric from 1963 to 1996, the famously penny-pinching and autocratic Lord Weinstock led the company as it grew into Britain's largest industrial conglomerate, with products ranging from household appliances to weapons systems, sales of $16 billion a year, profits of $1.5 billion and nearly $5 billion in cash reserves.
But despite the support of British governments on the left and the right, all eager to see General Electric become a technological leader, the cautious Lord Weinstock failed to give Britain much of a stake in emerging industries like semiconductors, computers and cellphones. (The company was not related to the company of the same name based in the United States.)
In 1996, Lord Weinstock, then 72, was persuaded to step down after the death of his son, Simon, who he had hoped would succeed him. He was succeeded by George Simpson, later Lord Simpson, who promised fast growth. But five years later, in September 2001, Lord Simpson was ousted after the company, now renamed Marconi, forecast a substantial loss and acknowledged $6 billion in debt and after the company's stock price had tumbled to 30 cents a share from $18 the previous year.
Lord Weinstock's wealth, once estimated at $750 million and largely invested in the company, shrank to a fraction of its former size.
The decline of the company was attributed to Lord Simpson's reversal of Lord Weinstock's business methods. Instead of building on its traditional strengths, he sought to transform Marconi into a glamorous, fast-growing communications giant, as reflected in the change of name.
Core assets were sold, and the proceeds, together with the cash reserves put away by Lord Weinstock, were augmented by additional borrowing and used to buy into telecommunication equipment plants. When the telecommunications bubble burst, Marconi found itself in trouble. 
Arnold Weinstock was born on July 29, 1924, in the London suburb of Stoke Newington, the last of six children of Polish immigrants.
Orphaned at the age of 10, he was brought up by an elder brother who was a hairdresser. He received a degree from the London School of Economics and began his business career in real estate. 
In 1949 he married Netta Sobell, whose father took him into his radio and television manufacturing company, Radio and Allied. He quickly came to dominate the company, taking it public in 1958 and making him and his father-in-law millionaires.
In 1961 he acquired the much bigger but poorly managed General Electric Company and moved to improve profitability. In 1967, he bought Associated Electrical Industries. The next year, Lord Weinstock took control of English Electric, another electrical engineering company. At 44, he was running Britain's biggest industrial company, with nearly a quarter of a million employees.
Lord Weinstock gave his managers considerable autonomy while monitoring their performance closely. A ferocious cost-cutter, he worked from a modest office. He also kept to the businesses he knew and was cautious about diversifying; a result was a strong company rich in cash but never a world leader in any field.
He is survived by his wife and a daughter, Susan.

HEADLINE: In Budget Crises, State Leaders Call for U.S. Aid 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: DENVER, July 24 

 BODY:
States have used up two-thirds of their available cash and their rainy-day funds trying to cope with budget crises, legislative leaders from across the country said today as they called for federal aid.
 By June 30, the end of the fiscal year for 46 states, the gap between revenues and spending was at $36 billion, leaders said at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures. The difference is expected to be $58 billion in the next fiscal year, leaving many states scrambling to pay for continuing programs and federally mandated ones. 
 "The rainy-day funds are there for a rainy day," said the president of the conference, State Senator Stephen M. Saland of New York. "This is somewhere between a rain storm and a hurricane." 
Senator Saland, a Republican, said many states were forced to cut reserve balances and programs this past year, while others raised taxes.
At least 26 states collected less revenue in the last fiscal year than they did the year before, and 19 tapped cash reserves, a June survey by the association found. States also raised taxes by $6.7 billion, breaking a trend of tax cuts that began in 1994. Only one state, Hawaii, cut taxes by more than 1 percent while 16 raised taxes by more than 1 percent.
Four states -- California, Kentucky, Massachusetts and North Carolina -- had not passed budgets when the survey was compiled.
The executive director of the conference, William Pound, said the next fiscal year, which began on July 1 for many states, would be a bigger challenge now that reserves were dwindling.
Legislators attributed the lower revenues to a declining economy, the Sept. 11 attacks and recent business scandals.
Senator Saland also said the federal government had contributed to the problem by increasing state obligations in programs like Medicaid and asking states to assume a bigger role in protecting the nation from terrorism.
Officials here said the federal government needed to meet its commitment to disabled children under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, increase the federal share for Medicaid, help states pay for bioterrorism defense and training, and reauthorize welfare block grants.
State Representative Rich Stanek, Republican of Minnesota, said many voters were turning to government for solutions after the Sept. 11 attacks.

HEADLINE: Levy Says Higher Pay Is Helping to Lure Teachers to New York 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
More than 2,000 certified teachers from all over the country flocked to a job fair in Brooklyn yesterday, leading Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy to suggest that the sharp salary increase in the new teachers' contract has made New York City schools a more attractive place to work.
 Mr. Levy said that the school system had hired 4,300 of the 8,000 new teachers it needs for the fall, and that 90 percent of those were fully certified and the rest were within "a stone's throw" of being certified. 
 He said the number of certified teachers applying in all license areas was up sharply over last year, though he provided no exact statistics, and he said the Board of Education should have no trouble filling the rest of the positions. 
In a change of policy, Mr. Levy has ordered that teachers hired this year be certified or within a year of being certified, as a way of meeting a State Board of Regents requirement that by September 2003 all teachers in the system be certified. At present, 17 percent of the city's 80,000 teachers lack certification.
"We are on track to get there," Mr. Levy said, adding that he spoke yesterday to teachers who had come to the hiring fair from Minneapolis and San Francisco.
Mr. Levy has also suspended a policy that required certified teachers to accept jobs at the city's most troubled schools last year before any other schools were allowed to hire. That policy was said to have inhibited many qualified teachers from even applying for fear of being assigned to neighborhoods they considered dangerous or classes where students would be hard to teach.
It was unclear yesterday whether that change affected the gain in certified teaching candidates. In any case, the increase in applicants comes as unemployment in the region has been rising.
In fact, both Mr. Levy and Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, credited the new contract's raises of 16 to 22 percent over 30 months for the increase in applicants. The contract raises starting pay to $39,000 from $31,900, and top pay to $81,231 from $70,000.
"We're seeing a whole different kind of buzz about coming to New York City and teaching in New York City than we've seen before," Ms. Weingarten said. 
Many of the teachers who attended yesterday's job fair at the Brooklyn Marriott Hotel came from outside New York City. Another provision of the new contract increases the maximum salary the city can pay teachers hired from other school districts to $61,000 from $43,370.
Ms. Weingarten said she believed the higher pay had done more to attract new teachers than the $8 million advertising campaign the Board of Education began last year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Fails in Effort to Block Vote On U.N. Convention on Torture 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 24 

 BODY:
 The United States lost a bid today to rewrite a United Nations plan intended to reinforce the 1989 convention against torture. The Bush administration, continuing to review international agreements binding on the United States, feared that the new plan would lead to demands by monitors to gain access to American prisoners and detainees. 
 The United States delegate to the United Nations' Economic and Social Council had called today for a vote to set aside the council's plan to establish a system of regular inspections of prisons and detention centers worldwide to check for abuses. 
The United States wanted to create a committee in the General Assembly to write a new plan more acceptable to Washington. 
The American proposal was defeated this evening, and the council's plan was approved.
The plan will next be considered by the General Assembly, where it requires the approval of a majority of the 190 member nations. Twenty nations must then ratify it for it to go into force.
The plan the United States opposed is contained in a protocol, or side-agreement, to the international convention against torture, which also bars "other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment." 
Diplomats say, and American officials do not dispute, that the United States is sensitive about this issue because of potential demands for access to the detention camp at the United States naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where more than 500 detainees suspected of being Al Qaeda members and others seized in Afghanistan are being held, as well as to others held in the United States as "enemy combatants." 
But an American official here said that the concern in Washington was that the plan, couched in what is called an "optional protocol," would be unconstitutional in the United States because it does not recognize states' rights. Adherence to the protocol would be voluntary. He predicted many other countries would also refuse to cooperate because of its intrusiveness.
The official also said there was no question of withdrawing support for the convention on torture itself, which he called "an important human rights instrument." The United States, which signed the convention during the Clinton administration, is the largest contributor to a United Nations fund to aid torture victims. 
Past efforts by United Nations monitors to visit American prisons have met with mixed results, with some states refusing entry to foreign inspectors. American officials have told United Nations human rights committees and monitors that the federal government cannot force states to open their prisons.
Human rights organizations say that the target of the new plan for prison visits is not the United States.
Amnesty International reports that more than 100 countries employ torture or other unacceptable methods on prisoners or detainees.

HEADLINE: Web Labors Of Jobless Man Were of Love, A Judge Rules 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Todd M. Rosenberg, the Internet cartoonist who under the name of Odd Todd chronicles the life of the unemployed, has emerged victorious from his battle with the New York State Department of Labor.
 The Labor Department administers the unemployment insurance program, which in June 2001 began paying Mr. 
Rosenberg $405 a week after he lost his dot-com job. Unable to find a new position, he decided to keep busy by creating an Internet site, oddtodd.com, that features his cartoons, fun facts, photos of kittens and his musings on topics like "Being the Weird Uncle." 
 The site also suggested that fans donate a dollar to Mr. Rosenberg, who to his surprise has received thousands of dollars (as well as donations of software, a leopard-printed chair and ostrich jerky). He also received a notice from the Labor Department, which contended that his Web site was a revenue-producing business.
Because a person cannot collect unemployment benefits while running a business, the Labor Department demanded that he repay more than $2,000 of unemployment benefits. Mr. Rosenberg's brother Daniel, a lawyer, helped him challenge that decision.
And in a decision Mr. Rosenberg said he received yesterday, an administrative law judge ruled that Mr. Rosenberg, who stopped receiving benefits late last year, was entitled to the unemployment benefits he received. The Web site, the judge wrote, "was simply a lark which turned into something lucrative."
It seems to be getting more lucrative; he is now selling enough "Laid Off" coffee cups and T-shirts to cover his rent, Mr. Rosenberg said yesterday. He has done some freelance work, and hopes his cartooning will turn into a real job. In the meantime, he has created a new cartoon, he said, "celebrating my one-year anniversary of being unemployed."

HEADLINE: Cuomo and McCall Look Ahead, Taking Aim at Pataki 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo and H. Carl McCall looked beyond September yesterday, spending the day campaigning against the man that only one of them is likely to face in November, Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Mr. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary, used a swing through Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse to promote his proposals to improve corporate responsibility and the upstate economy, saying those were areas that Mr. Pataki had failed to address adequately. 
 At about the same time, Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, stood on a sidewalk outside Public School 40 on the East Side of Manhattan, accusing the governor of shortchanging the city school system by allowing "the most inequitable state aid system in America" to stay in place. 
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. McCall are seeking the Democratic nomination for governor and will face each other in the Sept. 10 primary. But, as they have frequently done in their campaigns, both were turning their calendars ahead to the Nov. 5 general election, and saving their strongest barbs for Mr. Pataki.
The governor, with $23 million in the bank and a lead in the polls as thick as a featherbed, was out of the political fray, on a tour of the Finger Lakes region that took him from Camp Good Days and Special Times in Branchport, N.Y., to the Ontario County Fair.
"New Yorkers know that Governor Pataki has made record investments in education," said Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for the governor. She said the governor had proposed comprehensive campaign finance reform and that the state ethics laws were among the toughest in the country.
In his campaign events, Mr. Cuomo hardly mentioned Mr. McCall, unless prodded by reporters, choosing instead to direct most of his ire at Mr. Pataki and "state government." He lashed into the governor for failing to call for corporate reform, saying that the wave of corporate scandals was not a matter of statistics and arcane accounting, but was a matter that had painful consequences for average working New Yorkers.
A report by his staff said scandals at six companies -- WorldCom, Tyco, Global Crossing, Adelphia, Arthur Andersen and Enron -- had put 1,795 people in the state out of work and cost investors $30.1 billion.
As he has for days, Mr. Cuomo criticized Mr. McCall and Mr. Pataki for taking contributions from companies with state contracts, saying that was "ethically unacceptable."
Meanwhile, Mr. McCall criticized Mr. Pataki for the state's successful appeal of a court decision that had called for a $1 billion increase for the city's schools. 
In saying that the state did not have to give more money to the city's Board of Education, the appeals court said that a junior high school education was an adequate minimum standard, a conclusion Mr. McCall took issue with. He presented a bar graph that showed how median income level increased with education. Where the lowest bar should have been, for people who completed eighth grade or less, there was a photograph of a grinning Mr. Pataki holding up both thumbs.
But Mr. McCall also used the opportunity to campaign against Mr. Cuomo. He dismissed Mr. Cuomo's proposals for tightening corporate oversight, saying, "There are very significant limits in terms of what a governor can do."
He said that as comptroller he had taken steps of his own, requiring accounting firms doing business with the state pension fund to adhere to stricter standards.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Accounting for badapples: Investors in the stock market render their verdicts.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
A STRING of scandals and investigations involving aggressive accounting practices has shaken confidence in corporate America and helped cause the stock market to sink to new lows despite a recovering economy.
 If just a few bad apples are behind these scandals, as President Bush has suggested, his administration has surely implied that Arthur Andersen, the beleaguered accounting firm, is one of them. With unusual speed, the Justice Department sought an indictment of Andersen in March. In addition, the General Services Administration suspended Andersen from conducting new business with the federal government. In June, Andersen became the first major accounting firm to be convicted of a criminal charge -- obstructing justice for shredding documents related to the Enron investigation. 
 Andersen had certified the books for Enron as well as for WorldCom, Global Crossing, Sunbeam and Waste Management, companies involved in some of the largest recent financial scandals. Andersen was also the auditor for Halliburton and Harken Energy.
To much of the public, the once-venerable Arthur Andersen has become synonymous with distrust in accounting. The comedian Jay Leno joked of a new cooking show, "Cooking the Books With Arthur Andersen." 
But investors in this bear market have eventually come to devalue companies that did not use Andersen as their auditor as much as they devalued Andersen's clients.
To gauge how far investors' lack of trust extends beyond Andersen, one can compare the stock market performance of companies audited by Andersen with those audited by the other major accounting firms. 
After initially faring worse following disclosures concerning Enron's collapse and Andersen's indictment, the market value of companies that had been audited by Andersen fared about the same as those that were audited by rival accounting firms by the second quarter of 2002.
Specifically, the auditor of each company listed in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was identified as of November 2001. Two stock portfolios were then constructed: one consisting of the 80 companies (excluding Enron and WorldCom) that were audited by Arthur Andersen and another consisting of the balance of companies in the S.& P. 500, which were audited by other accounting firms.
The average cumulative stock market return for each group of companies -- adjusted to balance differences in the industry mix -- was tracked from Oct. 1, 2001, until last week. A report on these results that Kenneth Fortson and Alexandre Mas, two Princeton graduate students, and I prepared is online at www.irs.princeton.edu.
Companies in the S.& P. 500 audited by Andersen fared about as well as those audited by another accounting firm during October 2001, before news of the shredding of Enron documents became public. 
From the end of October to early January, stocks of Andersen's clients performed about 5 percentage points worse than those of rival firms, on average. The gap narrowed briefly in late February but opened up again in early March, just before Andersen was indicted. 
Significantly, the gap in stock returns between Andersen's clients and those of rival accounting firms began to evaporate in April of this year and disappeared entirely by the end of June.
The lower performance of shares in companies audited by Andersen from November through April may reflect, in part, a greater loss of confidence in those companies by investors. 
Another factor, however, is that Andersen's clients tended to have lower "betas," a common measure of how closely the returns from one stock move with the overall market. Historically, it turns out that Andersen's clients had less volatile returns than those of other companies, even after adjusting for major differences in industry composition. So, perhaps it is to be expected that the market value of Andersen's clients rose less quickly when stocks rose in the post-Sept. 11 rally and fell less sharply when the market declined over the last few months. 
Regardless, by June the stocks of companies that were not audited by Andersen had lost just as much value as those of companies audited by Andersen, suggesting that investors have not lost comparatively more faith in companies audited by Andersen.
Frank Vannerson, chairman of the Mount Lucas Management Corporation, stressed that the role of the stock market bubble must be remembered in interpreting these results. "We had a period of out-and-out mania, and 'corner-cutting' (as distinct from fraud) was widespread," he said. "Accounting firms were deeply involved -- all of them. In a bubble it could not be otherwise."
He continued: "Andersen fell (or was pushed) on its sword, but there is little chance that they were any more aggressive than the others in condoning corner-cutting schemes. Probably every non-Andersen firm in the S.& P. has been quietly purging their income statements of 'tainted' earnings." This might be responsible for their relatively weaker returns, compared with Andersen's clients, since April. 
Rather than attributing the lack of trust to "bad apples," Mr. Vannerson prefers an analogy to a "flu epidemic -- sort of a general decline in community ethical health." 
If this is the case, then restoring the patient to full ethical health will not be easy or quick. And it will probably require changes in incentives to align the interests of corporate management, accountants and boards with those of the public and investors. This is most likely to require preventing potential conflicts of interests between accounting firms and their clients, giving boards more independence, mandating greater disclosure of financial data and reducing managers' incentives to maximize short-run paper profits at the expense of longer-run profits and viability.

HEADLINE: Stock Exchange May Move Some Operations to New Site 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange may move some of its operations to a new trading floor in Westchester County, N.Y. -- or elsewhere in the metropolitan region -- to prevent the market from shutting down in the event of another terrorist attack or disaster in Manhattan, exchange officials said yesterday.
 The officials said they were considering opening a second trading location besides the main floor at 11 Wall Street, but they declined to discuss the details or to identify any specific sites. 
 The possible move to Westchester was first reported on Wednesday by Bloomberg News.
Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for the exchange, said that exchange officials had been seriously considering the move since last September, when the main floor was closed for four days because of widespread disruptions in telecommunications lines after the attack on the World Trade Center. The issue was discussed with exchange members during a July 10 meeting, though no decisions have been made yet. 
"All I can tell you at this point is that our exploration of the possibility is ongoing," Mr. Pellecchia said.
In the past year, a number of financial services companies in or near the trade center site have looked for office space in Midtown Manhattan, or outside the city altogether, to decentralize their operations in case of another attack. Morgan Stanley, the largest securities company in Manhattan, spent $42 million to buy a former Texaco headquarters in Harrison, in Westchester, in March. 
While the stock exchange's move would provide a secure backup site for trading, it would also help alleviate the chronic space shortage at the exchange's historic home on Wall Street. Exchange officials have long sought to move their operations to a larger building, and in recent years have even considered crossing the Hudson River to Jersey City.
In 1998, exchange officials negotiated with state and city officials to build a trading complex and office tower just east of the exchange. The agreement included more than $1 billion in land, cash, tax breaks and other subsidies, and would have been one of the largest in city history intended to prevent a corporation from leaving town. 
But the deal began unraveling this spring after the Bloomberg administration signaled that it was too costly for a city hurt by a sluggish economy and mired by a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. Though both sides have privately expressed concerns about the agreement, they have refused to discuss it publicly.
Several state officials and others said that Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the exchange, told the state last month that he was considering a backup site for the exchange in Westchester, Brooklyn, Queens or on Long Island. They speculated that the exchange could be following Morgan Stanley's move to Westchester.
It was unclear yesterday whether exchange officials still intended to pursue a new building on Wall Street, or if it would be necessary if part of the trading operations were relocated. Mr. Pellecchia said he did not know where the agreement with the city stood.
Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg, said only that "the negotiations are ongoing" between the exchange and the city. He said exchange officials had not informed the city that they were interested in moving to Westchester.
Westchester officials also said they were surprised to hear that part of the stock exchange could be moving to the county. "They've never come to us," said Susan Tolchin, chief adviser to the Westchester county executive, Andrew J. Spano. "We don't know anything about it."
Chris O'Callaghan, a partner in the McCarthy O'Callaghan Company, a commercial real estate firm in White Plains, said that although he had not received any calls from the exchange, he had found properties for a half-dozen companies that relocated to Westchester from Manhattan after Sept. 11.
"It would be a terrific thing for the county," he said of the stock exchange. "I think it's a credit to the county as a place to do business."
Mr. O'Callaghan said that Westchester was a logical choice for the exchange because of the availability of high-end office space at affordable prices. For instance, he said, a "well-located, class-A building" typically cost $26 to $35 a square foot to rent in Westchester, compared with $50 to $70 in Midtown Manhattan.
Jacques Baron, vice president of the County Chamber of Commerce in Westchester, said that he was also pleased by the news of the exchange's possible move. "Anytime we have a new employer, it is great for the county," he said.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Fall as Stocks Pull in Cash 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, pushing up yields as a rebound in stocks lured money away from government securities. 
 Even with yesterday's stock rally, the return on Treasuries is beating stocks for a third year. 
The 10-year note has returned 7.7 percent including reinvested interest while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost 27 percent. 
 "If we start to see more appetite to take on risk, Treasuries are going to be sold," said Jim Evans, who helps manage about $15 billion of bonds at Brown Brothers Harriman. 
Clark Wagner, who manages $1.5 billion at the First Investors Corporation in New York, said an increase in Treasury yields from record lows was inevitable because the economy is recovering, which makes it unlikely the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates as some investors have been betting.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32 , to 1032/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.47 percent from 4.42 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1, to 10013/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.35 percent from 5.28 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-week bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price: 99.961
High Yield: 2.270%
Low Yield: 2.100%
Median Yield: 2.200%

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: IMMIGRATION SECURITY; 
Border Customs Agents Are Pushed to the Limit

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: ROMA, Tex. 

 BODY:
It is high noon, 102 in the shade, and Andres Guerra is a blue blur in his wool-blend United States Customs uniform, dashing from car to car at this border crossing from Mexico.
 Interrogating drivers, flashing his mirror under tailpipes, peering into gas tanks with a fiber-optic probe, tuning in his radiation detector, he is guarding the border as best he can. His recent catches include more than $1 million in illegal cash, a ton of marijuana, 600 pounds of cocaine and three writhing baby alligators hidden under a smuggler's blouse. 
 But since Sept. 11, Mr. Guerra has been looking hard for a more deadly cargo. He and his fellow customs officers are now on the front line of the United States' defense against terrorists and their weapons. 
"You've got a vast number of vehicles coming across," said Rudy Santos, a customs chief in Laredo, roughly 80 miles northwest of Roma. "Try to find the bad guy among them. Try to find the canister of cyanide."
At every crossing along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, and in the trackless desert in between, the Customs Service is on a round-the-clock high alert. Its inspectors, working double shifts, have been pushed to their limits by their new task.
"They are absolutely getting weary," said Mr. Santos, who oversees 36 inspectors. "The body can take only so much physically. The guys are working 16-hour shifts in heat that'll knock you down."
Before Sept. 11, the Customs Service was mostly concerned with speeding trade and impeding contraband. Now the 213-year-old agency has shifted its priorities to guarding against killers with a cause.
One of the nation's oldest agencies, the Customs Service works alongside the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Border Patrol to control the flow of goods and people in and out of the United States. It may be swallowed or split up by the Homeland Security Department that Congress is starting to create.
Dismembering or dissolving the service "would be a serious mistake of the first order," said the customs commissioner, Robert C. Bonner, who wants it incorporated intact into the new security structure.
Mr. Guerra and his colleagues, interviewed at nine border posts in Texas and California, wonder whether their jobs will get even more difficult if their service disappears in the biggest government reorganization since the end of World War II.
"Everybody's asking questions," Mr. Guerra said, "and we're not getting too many answers." 
The United States' frontiers to the north and south are the longest undisputed, undefended borders on earth. Customs inspectors have long known that anyone can sneak into the United States from Mexico -- anyone, that is, who dares cross the Rio Grande or the desert in secret.
"People cross the river like we cross the road," said Ventura Cerda, a customs agent who patrols a 100-mile stretch of South Texas up the Rio Grande from Roma. "This border is open. Policing it cannot be done. People down here specialize in smuggling everything and everyone. I don't care if it's humans or weapons. All you got to do is get across that river and you're good."
Short of building a wall from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, the task of actually securing the border, most agree, is impossible. "It would take a million people, I suppose -- maybe more," said Paul H. O'Neill, the secretary of the Treasury, which oversees the service.
A quarter of the service's more than 20,000 agents are deployed at border posts. Every day they see roughly 1.3 million people going in and out of the United States. They peer into 350,000 cars, trucks and buses a day. With the help of their sniffer dogs, they seize more drugs than any other arm of the government. They collect more revenue -- about $22 billion a year in duties and fees -- than anyone but the tax man.
At the Mexican border, inspectors also have to speed a quarter-trillion dollars in annual cross-border commerce. They try to interrogate every potentially suspicious person coming into the country, watching for white knuckles or a jumping pulse.
"The guy on the line has to make a determination within seconds whether to intensely examine someone," said Mr. Santos, the chief in Laredo.
Given the pressure to keep cross-border commerce flowing freely, Mr. Santos said, balancing free trade with national security can become an unmanageable high-wire act: "There's no way you can do both."
Francis Brown is the assistant customs director for trade operations in Laredo, where some 4,000 tractor-trailers enter the United States daily. It is the border's busiest truck port, with its truck traffic up about sixfold since the advent of free trade with Mexico in 1994.
"You have to treat each one as a threat now," Mr. Brown said. "The inspector has to look at the particulars of every shipment. He has 30 seconds to two minutes to make a decision. Does he know what's coming across?"
At San Ysidro, Calif., which also handles some of the heaviest tourist traffic, some 50,000 Mexicans cross legally every day, commuting from the area around Tijuana to work in San Diego and elsewhere. Without them, hundreds of restaurants, hotels and small businesses would crumble. Francisco Luna, chief inspector at San Ysidro, said the agency "cannot spend minutes inspecting vehicles, because the economy would be ruined."
When the border first re-opened after the attacks, intensified inspections made the wait at the busiest crossings as long as 15 hours. Now, at most crossings, the wait is nearly back to what it was before September -- a consequence, customs agents say, of them working even harder and thinking faster. 
Complicating the task further, inspectors along the border are under constant surveillance from smugglers.
"They're watching us," Mr. Santos said. "They see what we are doing. We've gotten a lot of bomb threats. That disrupts our operations."
Mr. Cerda, on patrol along the Rio Grande, said that hundreds of unseen eyes and ears "are on both side of the border, listening to us, watching us."
Mr. Bonner, the commissioner, said those spotters worked for Mexico's most powerful drug cartels. The United States fights them in a continuous contest of cat and mouse.
"There's a gamesmanship that's going on that probably rivals anything during the cold war," said Mr. Bonner, a former chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
As in the cold war, the C.I.A. and its fellow services have worked more closely with the Customs Service and other domestic law enforcement and internal-security branches of the government since Sept. 11. But many border guardians say little useful intelligence reaches them.
Mr. Guerra, the inspector here, said he learned a lot from lessons in interrogation that a C.I.A. officer taught customs personnel. 
Mr. Santos, on the other hand, said he "would like to see real intelligence instead of generic intelligence" that was sanitized to protect sources.
Customs officers can look through travelers' vehicles and possessions without search warrants, probable cause or reasonable suspicion. But some said they needed access to private information, like tax data, to fight potential terrorists.
"There are certain inefficiencies built into the system, because this is a democracy," said David P. Higgerson, the customs director in Pharr, Tex. "If Osama bin Lopez shows up here and he has a tourist visa, but he also has a Social Security number, could we stop him?"
"We don't know how to do that," Mr. Higgerson said, because of walls erected by federal privacy laws. "Do you want a young dog handler here knowing whether or not you filed a tax return last year?" 
The answer from a new homeland security department, he said, would probably be yes. "I think we will have access to this stuff as homeland security starts to integrate."
X-ray and gamma ray machines already scrutinized many trucks entering from Mexico. Now the Customs Service tries to inspect billions of tons of cargo before they enter the country.
Its inspectors gather information and conduct background checks on Mexican trucking and shipping companies, as well as on the truckers who ferry cargo across the border.
"You're trying to pinpoint which of hundreds and hundreds of boxes in a trailer or a truck might be carrying contraband, and that's hard enough," said Crescensio Cantu Jr., the customs director in Roma. "Better to pinpoint the smuggler."
Customs inspectors at the Mexican border hear one question repeatedly from travelers, truckers and tourists. Anacleto Botello, a veteran at the port in Hidalgo, Tex., said he had heard it a thousand times: "Do I look like a criminal?"
Since Sept. 11, he said, "The question is, Who's not a criminal?"

HEADLINE: As the World Tracks Wall St., U.S. Leadership Is Two-Edged 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 24 

 BODY:
As stock markets from Singapore to Sao Paulo join Wall Street in stomach-churning gyrations, investors overseas are asking an old question with new urgency: Can the world learn to live without American economic and market leadership?
 So far, the answer seems to be no. 
 Even though Europe, Asia and Latin America are not suffering the corporate scandals or record-breaking bankruptcies that have rattled the United States, markets on all three continents have been moving in lock step with Wall Street.
Today's trading was a stark illustration. Shares in Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Paris, Amsterdam and London all fell sharply in the wake of a bleak Tuesday in New York. In Europe, several exchanges closed at levels not seen since 1997, before an afternoon rally in New York gave United States markets their best day in weeks. 
The fear -- shared by public officials, executives and ordinary investors -- is that further big losses could choke off fledgling economic recoveries in these countries. The United States, which has been the main engine of growth for the last decade, now looms as its biggest brake. "A slump in the U.S. would shatter global confidence," said Anais Faraj, European strategist at Nomura International in London. "Unfortunately, the odds of that happening are rising."
Already, there are signs that the erosion in investor confidence in the United States is hurting companies abroad. On Monday, Hugo Boss, the German fashion house, cut its profit forecast for the year by 16 percent, citing a weak American market, particularly for men's suits, which it said was sensitive to the markets and the economy. "Our business in the United States has declined noticeably in the last few weeks," the company's chairman, Bruno Salzer, said. "Men have to be in a positive mood to buy high-end men's wear."
Shares of Hugo Boss have tumbled 21 percent since Monday, and the company faces a shareholder lawsuit in the United States accusing it of misleading investors.
This has been one of the bleakest weeks in memory on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Despite staging a late-afternoon reversal today after the rebound in New York, Germany's main index is trading near its lowest level in five years, dragged down by insurers nursing battered stock portfolios and banks, which are disclosing loans to WorldCom, the big long-distance carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday.
Every day, it seems, brings more grim tidings from European companies. Siemens, the German engineering giant, said today that its fourth-quarter profit would be lower than the third. The company said orders for telecommunications and other equipment had fallen 20 percent.
"Investor confidence is completely damaged," said Hartmut Jende, a small investor in northern Germany who has seen much of his stock portfolio evaporate in the last few months. "The situation here is no different than in the U.S. market. There are no alternatives."
Executives say that as a proxy for the world's largest economy, Wall Street cannot help but cast a shadow over other markets. That pre-eminence, they said, has not been eroded by the accounting scandals.
"The die is cast in America," said Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP Group, the advertising firm. "The recession started there, and that is where the recovery will come from as well."
Though WPP is based in London, Sir Martin said it would follow American companies like Coca-Cola, reporting stock options as an expense in its next financial report.
By some yardsticks, economists say, Europe and Asia ought to be a refuge from the turmoil in the United States. Most European economies are in a slow recovery, which many think could accelerate later this year. In one sign of Europe's changing fortunes, the euro's value has risen in relation to the dollar, surpassing it for a few days last week.
Although companies like Deutsche Telekom and Vivendi Universal have suffered big declines in share prices -- prompting the dismissal of their chief executives, Ron Sommer and Jean-Marie Messier -- there have been relatively few disclosures of corporate impropriety.
Indeed, some experts said that the ousters of Mr. Sommer and Mr. Messier presage a new era of responsiveness to shareholders. "You can't prevent the rise of an equity culture in Europe," Mr. Faraj said. "These governments are committed to privatizing their state companies."
Asia has different concerns. Because its economies depend heavily on exports to the United States, investors there are sensitive to any erosion in confidence in America. At the same time, countries like Thailand and South Korea have been able to rekindle demand for their goods among their own consumers. Having survived the financial crisis of 1997-98, many Asian countries are enjoying a rebound.
"Our fundamentals are much better," said Ajay Kapur, an East Asian strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. "The U.S. is going through an asset deflation that Asia went through five or six years ago."
South Korea expects its economy to grow 6 percent this year, on the strength of exports and domestic demand. Five years after it ran out of foreign exchange reserves, Seoul has $115 billion in reserves.
Until the latest turbulence, its market was a star performer, more than doubling from September to April. Today, it fell nearly 3 percent, standing 23 percent below its spring peak. "People saw the fundamentals in Korea as stronger than in the United States," said Ha Sa Jun, an executive at Woori Financial Holdings in Seoul. "Korea is stronger now than during the economic crisis."
Asia is showing other signs of financial independence. This week, China offered shares in the Hong Kong unit of one of its largest banks, the Bank of China, raising $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. Unlike previous stock offerings of Chinese state companies, which were sold aggressively to American investors, these shares were largely bought by investors from Japan and Hong Kong.
Few countries have had more experience with a burst bubble economy than Japan. And yet, Japanese investors have poured money into the United States since the beginning of the year, in part because the strengthening of the yen makes American stocks relatively cheap.
Despite the recent scandals, analysts say Japanese investors regard American stocks, and assets denominated in dollars, as the safest in the world. Some note that the problems at Enron and WorldCom seem less pervasive than the cronyism that helped drag down Asian economies.
"In the U.S., the problems have been generated by individual companies," said Atsushi Ishii, deputy general manager of the global investment department at Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance, who expects Wall Street to recover later this year. "The financial condition of the market over all is still strong," he said.
Investors in Latin America are also hoping for a United States recovery. The benchmark stock index in Sao Paulo has fallen in recent weeks to its lowest levels since 1999, largely in response to Wall Street.
Dany Rappaport, an analyst at Tendencias, a consulting firm in Sao Paulo, said Latin American countries were particularly vulnerable to market turmoil in the United States because they run big current-account deficits. "They need a steady influx of foreign capital to keep their accounts balanced," he said.
At times like these, economists and analysts agree, breaking the psychological link between global markets would be desirable. The word on the lips of brokers in Europe and Asia is "decoupling."
But doing that is difficult, even for prosperous economies like those of Western Europe. For the Europeans to buck the jittery mood emanating from the United States, economists say they would have to generate strong consumer demand in their own countries.
"The U.S. has been carrying the global economy for far too long," Mr. Faraj said. "Even Atlas needs to take a break."
The trouble is that Europe's economy, while growing, remains sluggish. Retail sales in Germany have dropped, while consumer confidence in Italy and France is tenuous. Critics say that European governments have shied away from steps, like liberalizing labor markets and lowering taxes, that would bolster corporate investment and consumer spending.
Given the connectedness of the global economy, some think that even if Europeans took these difficult steps, they would still not be able to deflect the ill winds from Wall Street.
"How can you decouple the European markets from the United States?" said Max Dietszch-Doertenbach, an investment banker in Frankfurt. "So many of these companies are commingled. So many of these companies are active in the same markets."

HEADLINE: State Dept. Raises Concerns About Israel's Use of U.S.-Made Arms 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
A senior State Department official said today that Israel could face "consequences," including possible sanctions on arms sales, if it improperly used American-made weapons during attacks on Palestinian targets.
 Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the United States was closely monitoring Israeli actions to ensure they did not violate the Arms Export Control Act, which requires that military items sold by the United States be used solely for "internal security and legitimate self defense." 
 "We've made quite clear that we're seriously concerned about some of the Israeli tactics, some of the Israeli actions, including targeted killings and actions like this that endanger civilians," Mr. Boucher told reporters today. 
"So we continue to watch and monitor Israeli actions very carefully, and we urge Israel to consider consequences of actions such as these."
His remarks were prompted by reports that the Israeli military used an American-made F-16 fighter jet to drop a laser-guided bomb into a densely packed neighborhood in Gaza City on Tuesday, killing a Hamas leader and 14 civilians. 
The Bush administration condemned the attack as "heavy handed" and asserted that Israel was aware that noncombatants were in the building at the time. 
The arms control act requires the State Department to report to Congress when there is a "substantial violation" of the law, Mr. Boucher said. He said no such report had been issued "since the current violence began."
On Tuesday, Mr. Boucher was asked repeatedly by reporters to describe the kinds of specific Israeli actions that might lead to a report. But he declined to explain what those actions might be, saying, "It's an object of ongoing review."
The law authorizes the government to suspend military aid to countries that violate the Arms Export Control Act. In 1982, for instance, the Reagan administration suspended deliveries of cluster bombs to Israel after concluding that the military had used them improperly.
Asked today what sorts of consequences Israel might face if it were found to have violated the arms control act, Mr. Boucher replied: "I suppose there are all sorts of potential consequences. The chief issue that we've tried to address here is whether an action that harms civilians like this is right, whether it's wise, whether it actually brings anybody closer to peace."

HEADLINE: New Trade Center Idea: Move Bulk to West St. 

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
The lease made me do it. Or words to that effect. If the six plans presented last week by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation share a common lack of urban and architectural ambition, that is because the planners were constrained by prior leasing arrangements between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site, and the property's leaseholders. So suggests one rationale that has been going the rounds.
 Don't buy it. If the lease is a box, the planners are already thinking outside it. The thinking just hasn't gone far enough to date. All of the plans specify elements beyond the terms of a lease that did not anticipate the complete destruction of the twin towers: parks, a promenade, a memorial, a museum, an opera house, to name a few. But the result is six plans of such extreme density that they threaten to become black holes in urban space. What is needed now is a strategy for emptying out the box, so that actual planning can begin. 
 Such a strategy does exist. It was developed by Frederic Schwartz, the New York architect who designed the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, now in construction at the foot of Manhattan. For want of a better term, we can call it a plan, though in reality it is only a first step toward developing one. Perhaps it is best seen as an intellectual tactic for clearing the mind, so that thinking about ground zero can proceed on a higher level of historical imagination.
Mr. Schwartz's plan, which builds on precedents going back to Westway in the 1970's and the Plan for Lower Manhattan before that, sets forth two integrated goals. The first is to reduce market pressure on the World Trade Center site. The second is to mend the cityscape now shattered by the stretch of West Street south of Chambers Street. With remarkable elegance, both objectives are accomplished with a single move: transferring the bulk of the required commercial space from the World Trade Center site and distributing it along West Street.
The aim of this concept, I hasten to add, is not to create a huge void in the middle of Lower Manhattan. Nothing in the plan precludes building on the 16-acre site. The goal is simply to reduce the economic and political pressures that have compelled the development corporation's planners to pack the 16-acre site with more bulk than it can handle.
West Street, and the air rights above it, are the property of New York State. In other words, this eight-lane stroke of urban violence is governed by the same political players who control both the Port Authority and the development corporation. The transfer of air rights is a well-established principle in city planning. Mr. Schwartz's concept derives from this principle.
The plan begins by suppressing West Street beneath Chambers Street and Battery Park. Above the tunnel, platforming would create a linear development strip at street level. The strip is configured to create a rhythm of buildings, open spaces and streets that would connect Battery Park City to the rest of downtown. The total square footage would meet or exceed the amount lost when the twin towers collapsed.
The strip could be developed incrementally, as demand for office space dictated. The plan also creates room for housing. Office buildings could be clustered close to existing and planned transportation hubs and retail centers, with residential buildings stretching between the clusters.
The World Trade Center site, meanwhile, becomes a giant question mark, or a series of questions, an open field for discussion. What values, what ideologies, does New York want to inscribe on this particular place and time? How do we introduce standards of quality in a discussion that so far has revolved chiefly around issues of quantity?
Mr. Schwartz knows this part of downtown as well as anyone else in the field. In the 1970's, he worked on the aborted Westway project. His concept draws on that and other precedents, including the city's Plan for Lower Manhattan from the 1960's. He's already presented the plan to a number of groups of agencies, including the development corporation. From the feedback, he knows that the plan needs work.
Even in its present form, however, the plan offers a conceptual beauty unmatched by the six official proposals. Besides taking economic and urbanistic factors into account, it has set the stage for focused discussion on historical meaning and cultural values.
It is tragic that the development corporation has not recognized the need for such an undertaking. Somehow, the idea gained hold that the historical issues aroused last September could be resolved by architecture, planning and design. They can't, not even by the most gifted professionals in the field.
It is probable that this initial misstep will be repeated. The six plans, clearly, have gained little public support. Newer, better plans are not going to solve the problem, because the problem is not one of public relations. Nor is it yet a problem of design. It is an educational problem. It involves creating a climate of ideas sufficiently robust to foster the emergence of architectural solutions further down the road. Development corporation officials will be powerless to educate the public until they take on the far more daunting task of educating themselves.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Battered for Weeks, Dow Enjoys Its Biggest Daily Gain Since '87

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks broke their losing streak yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 488.95 points, or 6.4 percent, in its biggest one-day rally since the rebound after the 1987 market crash.
 After several punishing weeks that had eroded market confidence, investors appeared to take comfort in an agreement reached by Congress on accounting and corporate governance legislation and in the display of confidence by companies that are pledging to buy back their own stocks. Even the arrest of former top executives of Adelphia Communications, who were charged with fraud, was a boost. 
 Markets fell sharply in Asia and Europe before Wall Street opened yesterday. But when stock prices began to rise here, the European markets rebounded. 
By the end of the day, the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had turned in their second-best performances since World War II. The S.& P. 500 gained 5.7 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5 percent. But it was only the second time in 13 days that the Dow had posted a gain and only the third gain for the S.& P. in 13 sessions. And in this bear market, the major indexes remain down 18 percent or more for the year.
One force behind the rally, said some analysts, was buying by investors who had been betting on further declines. These investors, called short sellers, sell stocks and then aim to buy back the shares at lower prices. When prices start to rise, they often decide to lock in their gains before they disappear by completing the purchase of those shares.
Support also came from companies announcing that they were planning to buy back their own stocks, suggesting they considered the prices low. Stocks of several companies that have announced buybacks recently rallied yesterday. They included Merck & Company, which rose 9.1 percent, and Pepsico, up 10 percent.
Norman Miller, 66, a Phoenix attorney involved in estate planning, bought stocks yesterday and Tuesday, when the market was still declining. "There was so much exuberance in the market today that you wanted to be part of it," he said. "And you didn't want to say six months from now that you missed the bottom." While the rally generated much relief, one day's gain was not enough to convince some market watchers that the worst has passed. 
"I think the best you get here is a rebound," said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist of Rhodes Analytics in Boston. "I don't think the market is finished going down."
William Forster, 55, a New Yorker who is the managing partner of an oil field services group, said he had been taking his money out of stocks for two years. Despite yesterday's rebound, he is cautious. "I believe in the strength of the American economy," he said. "But while stocks are becoming cheaper, the market can still go lower."
Chris Wolfe, an equity market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients, said the surge was mostly a bounce in downtrodden stocks, led by the utility, materials and energy sectors. Duke Power rose 16.2 percent; DuPont, 8.7 percent; and Exxon Mobil, 9.7 percent.
Mr. Wolfe said the rally would have been more convincing if it had been led by technology and telecommunciations stocks, which have led the market lower for the last two and a half years. Their leadership would indicate that investors are more confident about the outlook for corporate profits. Though many of these stocks, including Microsoft, rose yesterday, they were not the best performers.
Financial stocks erased their losses of a day earlier. Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase fell 15.7 percent and 18.1 percent, respectively, on Tuesday after Senators questioned the banks about helping Enron hide some debt, which bank officials denied. J. P. Morgan officials responded yesterday to concerns about the legal fallout from Enron by announcing in a conference call and on television that senior management would be buying the stock for their own portfolios. Citigroup gained 9.6 percent; J. P. Morgan rose 16 percent.
Before Wall Street opened yesterday morning, the picture was grim. Asian markets closed lower overnight, with Japan down 2.6 percent and Hong Kong off 3.3 percent. In Europe, markets were plunging, with stocks in Frankfurt off 7 percent and in London down 6 percent. Futures contracts on Wall Street's three big indexes were also down sharply, indicating that many professional investors expected another sharp decline.
But after a brief plunge at the opening, with the Dow down 2.2 percent, buyers started pushing prices higher. "Once the market began to move today, many investors who had been waiting saw it as a good time to get back in," said Abby Joseph Cohen, chief market strategist at Goldman, Sachs.
The rally in the stock market came as Congressional negotiators reached agreement yesterday morning on corporate fraud, securities and accounting laws aimed at the abuses that have shaken Wall Street. President Bush has said he will sign the bill.
In another move to show how serious the government takes corporate misdeeds, John J. Rigas, 78, the founder and former chief executive of Adelphia Communications, one of the nation's largest cable companies, and two of his sons were arrested and arraigned on charges that they looted the company of more than $1 billion.
"It makes investors feel good that those who do not act in an ethical manner will be prosecuted," said Ms. Cohen.
The Dow closed at 8,191.29, while the broader S.& P. 500 climbed 45.73 points, to 843.43. 
The rallies were the biggest since the Dow surged 10.2 percent and the S.& P. 5.9 percent on Oct. 21, 1987, right after the market crashed. The Nasdaq rose 61.18 points yesterday, to 1,290.23.
As stock declines have continued in recent days, rumors have swirled. Some analysts said that a rumor that Federal Reserve officials were planning an emergency meeting, to consider an interest rate cut, had an influence yesterday. The Fed does not comment on such rumors, and there was no announcement. Stocks rallied in the afternoon even without any Fed action. But investors sold off bonds, pushing interest rates higher.
Some economists are worried that the plunge in stock market wealth could slow economic growth by discouraging consumer spending. That could, in turn, make a rebound in corporate earnings more difficult. Some investors appear to have concluded that there is a greater chance of the central bank cutting interest rates if the stock market continues to fall.
In recent days, the futures contracts on the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate target, the federal funds rate, have fallen below 1.75 percent, the current fed funds target. This suggests that more investors are betting the Fed will have to lower rates from their already very low level to encourage borrowing and spending.
What could become clearer today is whether yesterday's rally will last. Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs said that the economic backdrop for the stock market, while weaker than had been expected, was still positive. She also argues that stock prices are now very attractive.
But among the many uncertainties is whether there are many other companies still to reveal accounting problems and other problems.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Japan: Trade Surplus Rises 

BYLINE:  By Ken Belson (NYT)

 BODY:
 Japan's merchandise trade surplus grew for the fourth consecutive month on the back of strong exports to Asia and shrinking imports. 
The surplus hit 1.3 trillion yen ($11.1 billion) in June, 71.4 percent above June 2001 and almost twice the growth that economists expected. Exports were up 8.9 percent in June, the third consecutive rise, while imports slipped 5.1 percent. Japan's trade surplus with the United States, however, grew just 5.6 percent as the yen's rise during the period made Japanese goods more expensive in dollar terms. Ken Belson (NYT)

MCDONALD'S REPORTS 13% INCREASE IN EARNINGS

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The McDonald's Corporation reported a 13 percent increase in earnings yesterday on strong European sales, reversing a trend in which it posted earnings declines in the previous six quarters. McDonald's said second-quarter net earnings rose to $497.5 million, or 39 cents a share, from $440.9 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. 
McDonald's earnings dropped over the last several quarters because of the sluggish global economy and a scare over mad cow disease that hurt sales in Japan and Europe. Sales in Europe increased 7 percent and operating income rose 8 percent in constant currencies for the quarter. In the United States, sales increased 1 percent and operating income was up 7 percent for the quarter. Total revenue grew to $3.86 billion from $3.71 billion.

HEADLINE: Is Fighting Iraq Worth the Risks? 

BYLINE:  By Michael E. O'Hanlon and Philip H. Gordon; Michael O'Hanlon and Philip H. Gordon are senior fellows at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For months, President Bush has been asserting his intention to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. That goal appears to have broad support from the American people and Congress. Through careful diplomacy, he can probably also gain at least the acquiescence -- if not the active support -- of a number of European and Arab allies.
 A military operation to remove Mr. Hussein, however, would be the most momentous use of force by the United States since the Vietnam War. If President Bush undertakes such a mission, it will dominate the remainder of his term, radically reshape the politics of the Persian Gulf and Middle East, and have major repercussions for the global economy. Yet there has been little debate about the pros and cons of such a war. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings planned for next week will be a start, but only a start. 
 The track record suggests that the United States can continue to contain Saddam Hussein without war, just as we deterred the Soviets during the Cold War and just as we have contained North Korea for half a century. Mr. Hussein values his hold on power and his life more than anything and has refrained from actions likely to lead to his downfall. Yet there is a serious case for overthrowing him if he continues to hide his weapons of mass destruction and deny access to United Nations inspectors. Although he appears not to have been implicated in the Sept. 11 attacks, he could decide to give biological arms to Al Qaeda in the future. He may also be gradually progressing toward a nuclear weapons capability. But the case for overthrow needs to be compared with the costs and risks of an invasion of Iraq.
Unfortunately, most advocates of overthrowing the Iraqi regime have tended to minimize the attendant costs. For them, the rapid fall of the Taliban seemed to mark the arrival of a new form of warfare requiring only small numbers of American ground forces and promising decisive results at little cost. But there are ample grounds for thinking that war against Iraq would be much tougher.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban fought from fixed trench lines outside of cities. Similarly, during Operation Desert Storm, in 1991, Iraqi forces fought us in the open desert and could not counter American airpower. In a future war, however, Iraqi forces would probably take a lesson from their defeat in 1991 and fight from the cities, where civilian casualties would greatly raise the cost of air strikes and buildings would provide disguise for weaponry and military personnel. While many of Iraq's 425,000 active-duty troops are poorly trained and their loyalty to Mr. Hussein is questionable, his top 100,000 troops -- especially the Republican Guard and the Special Republican Guard -- are unlikely to crack quickly. They fear retribution from Mr. Hussein or from a new regime in Iraq made up of their internal enemies more than they fear the weak Iraqi opposition and American airpower. If there is any real hope of their deserting Mr. Hussein and handing us a victory without a fight, it will probably require the deployment of a large American invasion force on Iraq's border.
If we had to fight the Republican Guard in Baghdad, the urban combat could resemble that in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993 -- not to mention Israel's reoccupation of parts of the West Bank this year. Small arms fired from close range would put American aircraft and troops at much greater risk than they were in Desert Storm or the Kosovo and Afghanistan wars. Iraq might use chemical or biological agents against our invading forces. American military casualties could number into the thousands. Mr. Hussein may well fire Scud missiles carrying chemical or biological warheads against Israel, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia -- or may gas Iraqis who rise against him, as he did in 1988. 
Even with these factors, American forces would still win such a war and be able to install a new government. But the price would be substantial in Iraqi and American lives. According to a leaked Pentagon war plan, the operation could require 250,000 American troops invading Iraq from multiple directions. Deploying smaller forces would be to hope for victory rather than to ensure it. After the war, stability and democracy in Iraq would be far from guaranteed, and we might need to occupy Iraq for a decade or more. 
There is a case to be made that these costs are worth sustaining. But if so, we need Mr. Bush to make it. He has not yet done so.

HEADLINE: Maker of Educational Toys to Test the Public Offering Market 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
LeapFrog Enterprises, a manufacturer of educational toys, is scheduled to brave the volatile equities market today and offer nine million of its shares in an initial public offering.
 The company is making a debut at what clearly seems a perilous time for a new-stock sale. The once red-hot public offering market, where more than 400 companies went public just two years ago, has all but shriveled. 
 While much of the buzz surrounding LeapFrog has been about its timing, the company's owners have also drawn considerable attention. LeapFrog, which is based in Emeryville, Calif., is a unit of Knowledge Universe, an educational materials and services company owned by Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of the Oracle Corporation; Lowell J. Milken, who runs the Milken Family Foundation; and his brother, Michael R. Milken, the former financier who was convicted of securities fraud in 1990. 
This is Knowledge Universe's second public offering. In 1999, it took public Nextera Enterprises, a management consulting firm, at $10 a share. The company's stock has not traded at or above $10 since February 2000. The shares closed yesterday at 60 cents.
On Wednesday night, LeapFrog's stock was priced at $13, the low end of the expected range of $13 to $16 a share. The deal is being underwritten by the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup and by Merrill Lynch.
Since the beginning of the year, there have been only 49 initial public offerings, according to the Renaissance Capital Corporation, a research firm. This week, four of the five companies scheduled to hold sales pulled back because of unstable market conditions. On Monday, Dunlop Standard, which makes brakes for Boeing 757 jets, canceled its $370.5 million initial public offering. Republic Airways, the Safety Insurance Group, Graham Packaging and Cinemark have postponed their deals. 
Despite a grueling market, some analysts argue that LeapFrog may be making a good decision by offering its stock now. 
"There's no guarantee that market conditions will improve in the foreseeable future," said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida who studies public offerings. "By waiting, six months from now they might be kicking themselves and saying 'Why didn't I do it in July before the market fell even further?' " 
Under the company's current structure, the Milkens and Mr. Ellison will control 82.8 percent of the voting rights and will elect the entire board. 
"I don't think their presence alone is a problem," said Randall Roth, a research analyst at Renaissance Capital. "What could be a problem is if people start nitpicking and making an issue of certain past insider deals. It's a convenient connection that could pop up if people really tried to dig in and find skeletons in the closet. Much more likely is people will look at the fundamentals." 
LeapFrog, which entered the educational toy market in 1995, makes electronic educational toys for children in preschool through the eighth grade. Its most popular brand is LeapPad, a series of interactive books intended to help children learn subjects including reading, math, spelling and science. In 2001, LeapFrog produced 5 of the 10 best-selling toys in the preschool category, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm.
From 1999 to 2001, net sales increased to $313.7 million from $71.9 million, and net income rose to $9.7 million from $1.5 million, according to the company's prospectus. Analysts estimate that LeapFrog is worth about $795 million.
Analysts expect the offering to be well received by the market, since the company has seemingly solid financial records and is not in a particularly economically sensitive business. But LeapFrog investors should be prepared for at least two rocky quarters a year. Like most consumer electronic companies, LeapFrog's business is highly seasonal with approximately 85 percent of its total net sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters, when parents buy educational toys for children going back to school and for the holidays.
This sales pattern has contributed to wildly fluctuating quarterly results at LeapFrog. In 2001, the company lost $8.5 million in the first quarter and $7.4 million in the second. But it posted gains of $14.1 million in the third quarter and $11.5 million in the fourth quarter, the company said in its prospectus. 
The company's retail distribution system could also prove to be troublesome. LeapFrog depends on four stores, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, Kmart and Target, for 78 percent of its net sales. It does not hold long-term contracts with any of those retailers, leaving its sales vulnerable if any of those stores experience financial difficulties. For instance, as of December, Kmart, which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, owed LeapFrog $11 million. Through a combination of write-offs, payments and allowances, that debt has been whittled to $2.1 million, an amount the company said it could not exceed without harming profits.
Despite a downright gloomy public offering market, many analysts say the company will fare well. One LeapFrog strategy, analysts said, is to present itself as more of a technology concern than as an old-model toy company.
"They're sort of consciously sort of trying to spin it as something other than a toy company," said Bret D. Jordan, an analyst at Advest. "You get much better valuation in theory."

HEADLINE: Afghan Officials Say Aid Has Been Too Slow 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
A group of senior officials from Afghanistan said today that international donors, including the United States, had been slow to deliver reconstruction aid to their country, and they warned of social unrest if assistance is not increased by winter.
 The officials, including seven members of President Hamid Karzai's cabinet who are visiting Washington, also said that factional fighting and banditry in rural areas and in some cities remained major obstacles to rebuilding the nation. 
 But they asserted that their nation had taken major strides toward establishing peace and that regional instability should not be used as an excuse for withholding aid. They argued that further delays in assistance would undermine Mr. Karzai's fledgling government, which has struggled to extend its influence beyond Kabul, the capital. 
"The people of Afghanistan are asking the government every day: 'What have you done for us?' " Muhammad Farhang, the minister of reconstruction, told the audience at a conference at Georgetown University. "The popular sentiment around the country is, one more time we will be forgotten by the international community. "
At a conference in Tokyo in January, international donors including the United States, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Iran, pledged to contribute more than $4.5 billion over five years to rebuild Afghanistan. 
But Afghan officials said today that they have received only about half of the $1.8 billion in aid that they expected to receive by the fall. Three-quarters of that money was for relief -- mainly food and medicine -- leaving less than $150 million for reconstructing the nation's war-ravaged water systems, power grids, schools and roads. "The reconstruction of Afghanistan has not begun," said Adib Farhadi, the director of economic affairs in the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "The commitments from the Tokyo conference have not become a reality."
Publicly, the Afghan officials refrained from criticizing the United States. After a morning meeting with President Bush, Abdullah, the foreign minister, called him "a sincere and serious friend."
The president "assured all of us of the continued support for the cause of Afghanistan," Dr. Abdullah told reporters following the meeting at the White House.
But privately, several Afghan officials said that the United States had been slow to provide reconstruction aid, and that other countries were following its example. Large-scale reconstruction programs would give jobs to soldiers who might otherwise take up arms for money, they said. "If we don't get money in the next three or four months, we will have to brace for the worst," one senior Afghan official said.
Bush administration officials rejected such complaints, saying the United States had actually contributed more to Afghanistan than the $297 million it had pledged in Tokyo for the current year. "The United States during the last year has expended approximately $450 million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for Afghanistan," said David T. Johnson, the Afghan coordinator for the State Department. 
But administration officials acknowledged that some international donors have been slow to deliver aid out of concerns that the Karzai government was not capable of spending large amounts of money efficiently or with accurate accounting. "We've been trying to push people," said one administration official. 
During today's conference, Afghan officials provided a detailed accounting of the country's needs. Of Afghanistan's approximately 13,000 miles of roads, for example, only about 2,000 are paved, and only 20 percent of those paved roads are in good shape, said Shad Sargand, a professor of civil engineering at Ohio State University who has been advising the Karzai government on road building. 
The Karzai government, United Nations officials, aid groups and a growing number of lawmakers from both parties in Congress have urged the United States to help expand international peacekeeping operations, which are currently limited to Kabul, to the entire country.
But a senior Bush administration official said there was little chance of that happening because the United States military needs to focus on tracking down fighters from Al Qaeda around the globe.

HEADLINE: Big Budget Gap Next Year Behind Call for Cuts Now 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Just over a month ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and members of the City Council, all smiles, crowded into the rotunda of City Hall to announce an amicable agreement on a $42.3 billion city budget that avoided layoffs, raised few taxes and restored $175 million in services at the Council's request. Now the city's budget makers are going back to their drawing boards.
 The mayor wants to cut a billion dollars more in spending from the new budget and has raised the possibility of layoffs. The Council and the city's labor unions are renewing their calls for tax increases. And organizations that get city money, and thought that they dodged a bullet last month, are nervously crafting backup plans. "I don't think any of us expected to be back here so soon," David I. Weprin, the chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, said yesterday. 
 So what happened? Although the plunging stock market has certainly alarmed officials, who worry that it could drive down tax collections while forcing the city to make larger contributions to the city's pension funds to offset investment losses, the mayor says that he is confident that his economic projections will more or less hold.
Mr. Bloomberg, a businessman-turned-mayor who never seems more comfortable than when giving a PowerPoint presentation, explained this week that he was concerned because the city had two hurdles to clear regardless of what the stock market did. First, the city must keep its new budget balanced. Fiscal monitors warn that it contains more than a billion dollars in risks by counting on things like federal aid, union concessions and increased rent for the city's airports that may not materialize.
Second, even if everything falls into place and the budget stays in the black, the city will have to turn around and quickly close a gap of $3.7 billion to $6 billion next year.
So Mayor Bloomberg has ordered city agencies to come up with proposals to cut 7.5 percent of their spending this year, and has made it clear that he is willing to consider layoffs if necessary. If the money that is saved is not needed for this year's budget, he reasons, the city can always put it toward closing next year's large deficit. 
"Any savings that we make in '03, remember, are going to help us in '04 and '05," the mayor said this week.
The mayor's call to make such sweeping cuts to a budget so soon after its adoption is unusual. But right after the new budget was passed, fiscal analysts warned that it relied too heavily on one-time actions, like more than $1.5 billion in borrowing, that would not be available to close next year's gap. The Financial Control Board, which monitors the budget, asked the city to "develop actions with recurring value." When the mayor addressed the annual meeting of the control board last week, he announced that he would do just that, calling for 7.5 percent cuts to every agency.
Those service cuts, which Mr. Bloomberg said would yield a further billion dollars in savings, would almost double the amount of cuts included in this year's budget. They would be even deeper than a contingency plan that he had proposed during the budget negotiations, which called for further shrinking the size of the Police Department, making fewer garbage pickups and closing clinics and centers for the elderly.
Aides to Mr. Bloomberg, who plans to visit Puerto Rico today and the Dominican Republic tomorrow, say that the mayor is being guided by a simple, pragmatic idea: the earlier a cut is made, the more money it will save over time, and the less severe future cuts will have to be. 
But the talk of cuts and layoffs has rallied Council members, union leaders and social service providers to call on the mayor to consider raising taxes before cutting more services. The mayor resisted most tax increases this year, arguing that Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature would be unlikely to approve them in an election year.
Chanting "I'll pay my share, Mike, keep the budget fair," a few dozen people, including council members, demonstrated on the steps of City Hall yesterday, a spectacle that would normally be as unseasonable in July as fresh local peaches would be on city farm stands in January.
It is still far from clear just how likely layoffs are. Mayors, most recently Rudolph W. Giuliani, have used the threat of layoffs to win concessions from labor unions. The city is still hoping to win roughly $250 million in labor concessions to balance this year's budget. 
Then there are the upcoming contract negotiations. Between now and next June, most city labor contracts are to expire. The control board cautioned in a report last week that this had "enormous implications" for the city budget. The city may use the threat of layoffs to try to get the unions to accept smaller raises.
But city officials note that with more than half of the city's budget going for personnel costs, it is difficult to make major spending cuts without cutting jobs. 
Mr. Giuliani cut the work force at the start of his tenure, but by the time he left office it had surged back. There are now roughly 250,000 full-time city employees. If part-time workers are counted, along with workers at hospitals, libraries and the housing authority who are paid with city subsidies, the number jumps to 365,000.
So the mayor has taken in recent days to speaking of the need to downsize the city's work force, and his administration sent a letter to every city agency head last week telling them that while early retirement programs and severance packages should be their first choices for cutting the size of their staffs, they could also consider layoffs.
Asked this week whether he was open to laying off workers if his commissioners backed it, Mr. Bloomberg said: "We don't have the money, O.K.? You can write the story starting there." City agencies have until Sept. 4 to come up with their proposals. "We're going to do the best we can to mitigate any pain and suffering," the mayor said this week. "We're a compassionate city, a city that needs a lot of services. And we are trying our best."

HEADLINE: Up, Down and All Around 

 BODY:
The Bush administration was angry about cable TV news networks' displaying stock market movements at the bottom of the screen while President Bush was giving a speech. There were no complaints yesterday, however, that the arrows were being shown as Mr. Bush commented on the arrest of a C.E.O. charged with treating his company's treasury as a personal piggy bank. The Dow industrial average rose nearly 500 points, and although any politician would have given an arm to take credit for finally giving Wall Street a day of good news, most were wise enough to realize that the market's current wild ride is too scary for anyone to try to claim he's in control. 
 It's unlikely, for instance, that the White House will really try to press the idea that the markets rallied on the news that the peripatetic Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, had decided to postpone his trip to South America. The House majority whip, Tom DeLay, was at minimum unfortunate in his timing when he called a news conference yesterday to blame the Democrats for the fall of the Dow. 
 Other members of Congress were nodding in the direction of their pending corporate-governance legislation, which was the subject of a House-Senate deal yesterday. If nothing else, the timing of the market rise suggested that no matter what the most absolutist of free-marketeers claim, investors are not scared by stiffer penalties for rogue C.E.O.'s and tougher accounting rules. Indeed, most still fear the government won't do enough to protect them, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
The sight of John Rigas, the founder and former chief executive of Adelphia Communications, being led away in handcuffs after being charged with securities fraud was soothing for individual investors eager to see executives held accountable for their misdeeds. Yet late news that AOL Time Warner's accounting practices are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission was a sobering reminder that the market may be in for far more volatility, as the widespread excesses of the recent bubble get flushed out and addressed.
Americans have come a long way from the simple days of the Beardstown Ladies -- although the ladies turned out to be ahead of their time in achieving their big market gains through errors in bookkeeping. The time when truck drivers wondered if they shouldn't chuck it all for a career in day-trading are long gone. Now we pride ourselves on our nerves of steel -- or at least on an extraordinary ability to block out bad news. We have gotten used to triple-digit moves in the Dow and have perfected the art of filing away financial statements without really looking at them.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: WASHINGTON MEMO; 
White House Moves to Limit Corporate Scandals' Fallout

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
Responding to criticism from Republicans in Congress and nationwide that President Bush has not acted aggressively enough against corporate corruption, White House officials moved on several fronts today to demonstrate the administration's efforts.
 First, they took credit for today's arrest of executives charged with looting one of the nation's largest cable television companies. They told Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to cancel another trip out of the country and focus on the domestic economy. And while they insisted that Mr. Bush was not changing any of his plans to visit 12 American cities in August from his Texas ranch, White House officials said they expected him to stress economic security as frequently as national security and said they were still examining what themes he would strike. 
 Taken together, the White House moves are part of a strategy, albeit a defensive one, to contain fallout from the accounting scandals and the volatile stock market they have helped produce. The maneuvering appears to reflect a deepening anxiety within the White House and the Republican Party that candidates seeking election in November could be in peril in the wake of accusations that the party is too close to big business. 
Some Republican incumbents are accusing the White House of reacting too slowly and too tepidly. And they complain that Mr. O'Neill has been missing in action as a public voice to reassure investors.
"There is a strain, no question about it, between House Republicans and the White House," said a Republican campaign consultant. "The strain is caused by a sneaking suspicion that he's worried about '04 and they're worried about '02."
Not surprisingly, White House officials argued vigorously today that they have been intently focused on economic issues. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, cited polls showing that voters do not blame Mr. Bush or other politicians for the market sell-off. 
"People are in the mood right now to cover only one side of the story," Mr. Fleischer said, blaming the media for suggesting that Mr. Bush was in political peril.
But it was telling that White House officials said that they, not the Treasury, strongly suggested to Mr. O'Neill on Tuesday night that he delay his trip to Latin America, which was to begin on Friday. 
The ostensible explanation was that Mr. Bush wanted Mr. O'Neill, who traveled to Africa in late May and to former Soviet republics last week, to work on assuring Congressional passage of the president's economic initiatives, including expanded authority for the president to negotiate trade agreements. But several Republican officials with ties to the White House said today that Mr. O'Neill's absence from the economic podium was becoming a political embarrassment -- and by the end of the day, Mr. O'Neill was on television, talking up the administration's strategy.
Mr. Bush rarely comments on arrests except when the charges relate to terrorism, but he used a meeting with Democrats to tell reporters this afternoon that "this government will investigate, will arrest and will prosecute corporate executives who break the law, and the Justice Department took action today." Lawyers close to the Adelphia Communications case, in which the founder and two of his sons were arrested and charged with fraud, said the White House has been extensively briefed on the details of white-collar criminal cases now under investigation.
Mr. Bush also praised an agreement in Congress on legislation that would stiffen penalties for corporate fraud. The White House noted that it incorporated some ideas Mr. Bush put forward in a speech on Wall Street early this month, but made no mention of the inclusion of other ideas the White House had argued against. 
In Arkansas, Mr. Bush's predecessor, Bill Clinton, broke a long public silence on Washington's response to the corporate scandals, arguing that his Securities and Exchange Commission attempted a crackdown on loose accounting rules and "Republicans stopped it."
Several Republicans running for Congress said in interviews that they were especially worried about polls showing that the public believed that the party was more concerned about giant corporations than ordinary voters.
Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a Republican in his 13th term who is in a tough race for re-election, said the issue could cost his party control of the House. 
"The Republican Party must be against white-collar crime as well as street crime," Mr. Leach said. "If it is seen as the party of law and order only at the level of street crime, it will misserve the public."
A trade association executive here who is influential in Republican circles said the "administration tends to do the right thing, but sometimes they do it two months late."
In this case, the executive said, the president and his advisers made a serious mistake by treating the Enron debacle as "a few bad apples" and not as a damaging blow to American capitalism.
The strongest suit the Republican Party has, the executive said, is the belief that it is the party that made capitalism available to ordinary Americans in the form of retirement accounts like 401(k) plans. "The slice of the pie is worthless if the little guy loses trust in the system," the executive said.
But many other Republicans defended the president and said Republican candidates were in a strong position. 
"I'm not in a panic mode," said Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. "If by Labor Day the market's not on the way up, we can start worrying. But not now."
Mr. Davis said the new regulation imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring corporate chief executives to certify that their companies' books are accurate would "shake things out and stop the drip, drip, drip" of new disclosures of wrongdoing.
To calm the troops, the White House circulated on Capitol Hill this week a memo, containing reassuring numbers, written by a prominent Republican pollster -- making the point that the party is in better shape than it was before Sept. 11. 
"The American people are rightly directing their anger at corporate America," one senior White House strategist said today. "But it's an election year, and its not surprising there is general nervousness."
Such nervousness has also seeped into the White House, however, where many officials recall how Mr. Bush's father seemed ill attuned to economic conditions as he ran for re-election in 1992.
So today both the Justice Department and Mr. Fleischer argued that the arrests of the former Adelphia executives were the first fruits of Mr. Bush's new corporate fraud task force. While they conceded that the investigation that led to the arrests was under way well before Mr. Bush created the group earlier this month, they insisted the task force had sped communication among various agencies involved in the investigation, making a quicker arrest possible.
Despite the change in climate since the stock market began to plunge, the White House has made few changes in its economic agenda, emphasizing trade, privatization of Social Security and oil and gas drilling in Alaska.
But today, there were signs that White House policy makers were thinking about further economic proposals if the bear market worsens -- or the general economy deteriorates. "This president will always want to be in motion to make sure the economy is growing," Mitchell Daniels, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters after delivering a speech on the White House's budget agenda.
Other officials said that Lawrence Lindsey, the president's economic adviser, had briefly raised the possibility of encouraging investors to buy stocks by enacting a lower capital gains tax for stocks purchased in coming months or years. But the idea was quickly rejected because it favored one kind of investment over others -- and a kind most attractive to the wealthy.
"I heard it around here, but it never amounted to much," one official said.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE EX-PRESIDENT; 
Clinton Says Republicans Blocked His Audit Reforms

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 24 

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton today hailed his own efforts to increase the oversight of corporate governance and criticized Republicans and Harvey L. Pitt, currently the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying they had frustrated Mr. Clinton's efforts at reform.
 He said Republicans thus deserved some of the blame for the current flight of foreign capital from United States markets. 
 Asked about President Bush's handling of the economy and his attempts to rally investor confidence, Mr. Clinton, who was touring the construction site of his presidential library here, avoided criticizing his successor directly. Instead, he chided Republicans, who he said had blocked his administration's efforts to, among other things, bar accounting firms from working as auditors and consultants for the same companies.
"I'm sure that some of the people in Congress that stopped a lot of the reforms I tried to put through are probably rethinking that now," Mr. Clinton told reporters.
"Arthur Levitt, my Securities and Exchange commissioner, tried to stop the Enron accounting issues -- using the same accounting company being consultant and accountant -- and the Republicans stopped it." Later, Mr. Clinton added that Republicans had fought Mr. Levitt's effort, "and Harvey Pitt was the leader trying to stop us from ending those kind of abuses. That is a matter of record." Mr. Pitt, who was a securities lawyer before being appointed by President Bush to head the S.E.C., counted accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen, among his clients.
When asked if he agreed with senators and representatives who have called for Mr. Pitt's resignation, Mr. Clinton demurred. "I don't have to make those decisions anymore," he said.
Mr. Clinton also said he had been overridden by Republicans when he vetoed a securities-industry bill he said would have "basically cut off investors from being able to sue if they were getting the shaft." And he recalled that his Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, had tried to crack down on the use of offshore accounts to conceal corporate financial information, but that Senator Phil Gramm of Texas "and other Republicans stopped that."
"And that is one of the things that has caused all the European money to leave the markets, because they see that the government is in the hands of the party that stopped all of this stuff," Mr. Clinton said. "And so I think they've got a burden on their hands, and they seem to be trying to turn it around. We'll see."
Mr. Clinton again criticized Republicans in the White House and Congress when he was asked about investor confidence, suggesting that they ask the opinions of market-moving investors like George Soros and Warren E. Buffett. Those investors, Mr. Clinton said, disapproved of last year's tax cut and "knew it was a mistake to start running deficits again, that it would run long-term interest rates up and again undermine confidence."
But Mr. Clinton said the underlying American economy would "reassert itself sooner or later."

THE PERFECT STORE
Inside eBay
By Adam Cohen
332 pages. Little, Brown. $25.95.
 "Jerry Marcus, a tall, soft-spoken accountant from Queens, New York, already had 1,500 clothing irons, but he was hunched over his computer at home, bidding on one more." 
 This suspenseful moment comes in Paragraph 1, Chapter 10 of "The Perfect Store: Inside eBay," Adam Cohen's new book about the most successful company in Internet history, the world's leading sponsor of electronic auctions. Will the tall, soft-spoken accountant from Queens succeed in acquiring clothing iron 1501? I won't spoil it for you by telling. Suffice it to say that eBay has made it big by letting the Jerry Marcuses of the world peddle antique clothing irons to other Jerry Marcuses.
EBay's story is amazing, and Mr. Cohen's enthusiasm carries you along even if (like me) you are unsure, to start out, why exactly you should care. His prose is brisk and cheerful as the blue-red-gold-etc. of the famous eBay logo, and considerably less grating. And although his pro-eBay sympathies are plain, Mr. Cohen, an editorial writer for The New York Times, always supplies enough information to let an uncooperative reader draw a contrary conclusion.
EBay was conceived by Pierre Omidyar, who was born in 1967 to French-Iranian parents in Paris and studied computing in the United States. Mr. Omidyar has no grand vision of what technology should be; he is no Alan Kay, no Bill Joy. He has no drive to remold the technology industry; he is no Bill Gates, no Larry Ellison. He didn't invent the Internet or the World Wide Web or the Internet-mediated auction. "There had been auctions on the Internet for years," Mr. Cohen writes, "long before Omidyar even thought of starting an auction Web site."
But he did build a well-conceived Web site, did make a string of brilliant business moves that seem common-sensical only in retrospect, did become one of the richest people in the world, and does seem like a humane and decent man. Mr. Cohen struggles diligently to make him interesting, too, but here the results are mixed.
Mr. Omidyar is a little short of lovable quirks. Evidently Ebola is one of his hobbies. It was tough to persuade him to remove his "offbeat tribute to the Ebola virus" from the Web page on which he'd also put his brand new "AuctionWeb" service -- eventually to be renamed eBay. Before long it came time to tour the country, hyping eBay and the approaching public offering of its stock.
When it emerged that the eBay team was expected to do the tour in the gross luxury that is customary on such occasions, Mr. Omidyar put his foot down. Not that he turned down the private jets and fancy hotels, but "he refused to capitulate completely." His "rebellion" against "extravagance" took the form of insisting that Goldman, Sachs -- the firm that sponsored the road show -- pick up the tab. With rebels like him, who needs reactionaries?
So who is Pierre Omidyar -- an idealist who wants to change the world, or just an ordinary Ebola enthusiast who hit it big? Mr. Cohen presents evidence on both sides.
In the book's closing scene, eBay executives trek to Guatemala; via eBay, poor Guatemalans will sell their handicrafts directly to collectors everywhere. Bringing eBay to Guatemala "was Omidyar's dream," Mr. Cohen writes. "EBay could help transform San Pedro La Laguna -- and the lives of the people who live there."
Here, Mr. Cohen sounds uncannily like Humphrey Bogart in "Sabrina," explaining to Audrey Hepburn why poor people need billionaires.
But earlier he tells another revealing story. In the early days of his online auction business, Mr. Omidyar decided to sell a broken laser pointer. He started the bidding at a dollar; two weeks later, the high bid had reached $14. Then and there "it occurred to him," Mr. Cohen notes, "that AuctionWeb had a bright future ahead of it."
Mr. Omidyar had grasped what millions more would see eventually, to their profit: that a global electronic auction is perfect for flushing out the one person in the world who will pay the absolute most for any random piece of junk.
Mr. Cohen believes that "the implications of the eBay model -- of Mr. Omidyar's original conception of a perfect, global marketplace that everyone comes to on an equal basis -- are revolutionary." Maybe, but eBay is a strange business where Beanie Babies and recycled Barbie dolls were major milestones on the road to commercial greatness and "a lucky Elvis fan beat out 46 other bidders to pay $811 for the pest control agreement from Elvis's home on Hillcrest Road." The eBay story isn't so much about markets or economics as shopping.
EBay has no inventory, doesn't actually sell anything itself, but collects a commission on every sale. Obviously, this company is important. Some 75,000 Americans now run businesses entirely on eBay's sites. EBay strides through the world economy like a movie star, surrounded by its horde of dependent businesses, its buyers, sellers, critics and rapturous fans.
But the story leaves you pondering. The Web supposedly began a new information age, but eBay brings nothing of its own to the table; it simply connects people. It uses cyberspace not as a library but as a giant switchboard. And this era of the Great Switchboard in the Sky has barely begun. When I said in a 1991 book that global electronic auctions were inevitable (one prophetic claim plus 75 cents will get you today's newspaper), I meant four related activities: buyers bidding to get goods or services from a seller; sellers bidding to supply goods or services to a buyer. So far, eBay concentrates only on buyers bidding for goods, but the rest will follow. And it won't stop there. People will consult the great cyberswitchboard to get a job or a mate or a life. (It's already happening.)
EBay makes money by brokering deals. But what happens when buyers and sellers cut out the middleman and deal direct? At eBay you search for the item you want. But you can also search the Web as a whole. In the long run, we won't need two separate levels of search. Eventually we will use the fabric of cyberspace itself, not eBay, as our switchboard.
But chances are eBay will somehow still be making money off the deal.

 BODY:
A Portrait With a Pedigree
 The cover of the May 10 issue of The Gazette de Drouot, a weekly publication about art and antiques sales in France, had an unusual image from a small country auction in the Loire Valley: a portrait of Washington as commander in chief of the American Revolutionary forces, painted in 1782 by Charles Willson Peale. Also strange was the low estimate, just under $300,000. 
 "The minute I saw it I assumed it would go for a high price," said Thomas Coville, a private American art dealer in New Haven and New York. "Its provenance and history make it extremely important." 
Mr. Coville teamed up with Stewart Feld of Hirschl & Adler and Vance Jordan, both of Manhattan, to buy the portrait. Bidding was fierce, and the three ended up paying $5.3 million, a record for a traditional American painting sold in Europe.
Peale painted many versions of this picture. One is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, another in the Princeton University Art Museum, a third at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and a fourth at Versailles, where it once belonged to Louis XVI. Mr. Coville said his recent purchase was "the only one we know of that was still in private hands."
In 1781 after the Battle of Yorktown, the Executive Supreme Council in Philadelphia decided to commission a portrait of Washington and engaged Peale, the leading portraitist of the time, who was living in Philadelphia. He had known Washington for 10 years, having joined the Revolutionary Army and having fought in the Battle of Princeton. So Peale's were the first official portraits of Washington by someone who had fought in the Revolution.
This painting, a three-quarter-length image, shows a youthful, charismatic Washington, a very different image from the elderly Washington in the portrait by Gilbert Stuart. It is thought to have been executed after the Battle of Yorktown, in which Washington's army along with the French forces under the command of Jean B. Donatien de Vimeur, Marechal de Rochambeau, defeated the British in the final major battle of the war. This work, in which the battle is seen in the background, was taken to France in 1783 by the marechal to his chateau, near Vendome. It remained there until the sale in June.
The fact that it came from a descendant of the commander of the French forces at Yorktown and had only one owner makes it particularly important. It had been exhibited only once, in 1975, at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. Adding to its rarity is that it hangs in its original Louis XVI frame.
Mr. Coville said he, Mr. Feld and Mr. Jordan have not decided on a price for the painting. It arrived in New York just last week, and they were not sure who would show it first.
Is the rocky economy a concern to the dealers? 
"This is probably one of the few pictures one should buy in this economy because its value has nothing to do with the state of the stock market," Mr. Jordan said, adding that the dealers hope it will end up in a museum. 

A Cutback at Phillips
Last week Thierry Millerand resigned as director of French and Continental furniture for Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg. This week the auction house announced that it was closing the department. It does, however, plan to go ahead with an auction of the London dealer John Hobbs's furniture and decorative objects on Oct. 22.
"Our strategy is to focus like a boutique on just a few categories in areas we know best," said Louise T. Blouin MacBain, Phillips's chief executive. She added that Simon de Pury and Daniella Luxembourg had no intention of holding French furniture sales when they joined the company in January 2001. But since Mr. Millerand, considered one of world's leading experts in French and Continental furniture, was already working there, it made sense to keep a schedule of furniture sales.
While Phillips is shutting down one department, Mrs. MacBain stressed that it would be expanding others, bringing in more experts in areas like watches, 20th- and 21st-century design, and photography.
Meanwhile, she dispelled rumors that the auction house would move out of its West 57th Street headquarters. "We have a five-year lease," she said. "Nothing is going to change. But we might rent out one or two floors if there is a demand for them."

Educating the Public
The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art wants to make education more than simply comprehensive labels, gallery talks and regularly scheduled programs. On Oct. 12 it will open the Koret Visitor Education Center, a public drop-in center. The new 7,000-square-foot center, on the museum's second floor, more than triple the size of its current education center, will feature seating areas so the public can peruse exhibition catalogs and art books. It will also have activity bins for children, multimedia kiosks, video and DVD viewing stations and online information. A trained staff member will be on hand to answer questions.
"The traditional education programs reach only a small percentage of visitors," said John S. Weber, curator of education and public programs. "We've invested in our collection. Now we need to invest in ways people can better understand it." Mr. Weber also stressed that the museum intended to continue its scheduled educational programs.

Comings and Goings
David Gordon, secretary of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, has been named director of the Milwaukee Art Museum. He replaces Russell Bowman, who is starting an art-consulting business in Chicago. Mr. Gordon will start his new job in October.
"I've lived in London for 60 years," Mr. Gordon said. "I thought it was time for a change." He said he was "entranced by the museum's incredible building and collection."
An American investment banker is filling Mr. Gordon's place at the Royal Academy. Lawton Fitt, a managing director at Goldman, Sachs, will be the firstwoman to occupy the post in the 234-year history of the academy.

HEADLINE: People Who Can Rebuild A City 

BYLINE:  By Richard Florida; Richard Florida is a professor of economic development at Carnegie Mellon University and author of "The Rise of the Creative Class."

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
As planning for the former World Trade Center site enters a pivotal stage, it's clear that more is at stake than designing a memorial. The future of a region is being shaped. While the recently released plans and the reaction to them have sparked much discussion of architectural vision, the real issue is economic. We can't assess whether the plans are sufficiently visionary, or say whether the vision is the right one, until we have a clear sense of how Lower Manhattan is to function in the greater New York economy.
 That economy is fundamentally a creative economy. Growth derives from the endless creation of new firms, new industries and new ways of doing things. The directions these may take in a free-market system are unpredictable. Thus the most sensible overall planning approach is to help Lower Manhattan become what it is becoming anyway -- a multifaceted creative hub -- rather than to indulge in economic overplanning or try to micromanage the future. 
 Planners must avoid the temptation of using public land and subsidies to set industrial policy, either by trying to prop up existing industries or to pick winners from among the new ones. The fear that Lower Manhattan is losing its status as a center of the financial industry, for example, is not new and should not be allowed to drive planning. Well before Sept. 11, financial-sector activity was diffusing away from Wall Street, as when Goldman Sachs & Company decided to move many operations to a new building across the Hudson River. But the Street isn't dead. If it were, firms would be moving to Austin or Taipei, not New Jersey. What we're seeing is a natural cycle: all industries cluster and then diffuse over time.
To replace the tax revenue lost by this diffusion, some favor promoting biotechnology in Lower Manhattan. But biotech startups are complex and iffy, burning tons of cash through long development cycles, and even a substantial biotech sector would hardly be able to replace financial services. It's never wise for communities to bet a big chunk of the farm on one industry -- be it biotech or baseball. Even a hot growth industry may cool off or evolve in unexpected ways.
No one knows what the next big thing will be, and it often emerges where two or more fields intersect. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg built his business ventures by mixing finance and information technology; others have built theirs by mixing information technology with retail savvy, graphic arts or music.
It's not surprising that the most successful metropolitan areas are places that attract a range of creative workers -- not just technical and business types but the artists, writers, performers, designers and others who make up the creative class.
San Francisco, Seattle and Boston are prime examples; so is greater New York. Every such region has at its core an urban hub. Typically these hubs have teeming cultural districts like the blend of galleries, music clubs and other small venues long found in Greenwich Village; mixed-use, live-work-play areas like those in the former warehouse districts of SoHo and Tribeca; ethnic neighborhoods like Chinatown; and artists' havens like Williamsburg, Chelsea, Dumbo and Red Hook near Lower Manhattan.
These hubs, in turn, play multiple roles in the economic life of a metropolitan area. They attract talent, are good venues for any business that is creativity-intensive and serve as places for people from many different fields to exchange ideas.
From Seattle to Cambridge, Mass., the coffee house, the bistro and the bikepath serve the functions that the businessmen's club and the golf links always have: they're where the next generation of movers and shakers meet and mingle.
Lower Manhattan is ideal for this role. It lies at the crossroads of the region and adjacent neighborhoods have the diversity and creative culture required today for competitive advantage. Combine this with the financial expertise and capital long available here and you have what could be a natural setting for the growth of new ventures building on existing strengths. 
In practical terms, how can planners best help Lower Manhattan keep evolving in this direction? First, don't muck up what's organic and unique, either by force-feeding certain industries or by building the generic malls that turn off many creative workers.
Instead, integrate with what's already blooming. Think about seeding institutions that draw a diversity of jobs and talents: perhaps multidisciplinary think tanks or university branches. Make room for more housing, and when adding cultural amenities, think beyond tourist attractions and big-ticket high-art venues. Add or encourage participatory features that residents can enjoy regularly: more green space, bikepaths and walkways, and waterfront access.
Above all, work on connectivity. Not just a transit system to shuttle workers from bedroom communities to office towers but vastly upgraded rapid transit by rail, water, you name it -- in and out of the hub and all around the tri-state region. That's expensive and a tall order. But it is vital for an age in which high-growth regions must have a variety of urban subcenters around a creative hub, rather than a few monolithic business or industrial districts.
The real opportunity here is to help Lower Manhattan become the prototypical hub of the 21st century -- by accelerating its natural evolution from a center of global financial innovation to a place that feeds creative growth across the region.

HEADLINE: China Vexed by Glare of U.S. Investigations 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, July 26 

 BODY:
Senior Chinese officials are expressing irritation over a series of American actions in the last two weeks but are keeping their public comments fairly low-key as they seek to put a rosy glow on China's position in the world in preparation for the Communist Party congress this autumn.
 The timing of recent critical reports by the United States appears to have been coincidental, involving investigations that were many months in the making. But the quick succession of criticisms of China has clearly annoyed officials here. 
 The Pentagon released a report on July 12 concluding that China was rapidly modernizing its military with an eye to countering American power in the Pacific and pressing Taiwan over unification. 
A commission created by the Congress nearly two years ago released a separate report on July 15 in which it concluded that China posed a security and economic threat to the United States. 
Finally, the State Department said last Friday that the United States would impose sanctions on eight Chinese companies and a Chinese citizen accused of selling equipment with potential military applications to Iran. The companies were identified on Wednesday and at least two have denied they transferred arms technology or related goods to the Middle East. 
Yan Xuetong, the director of the Institute of International Studies at Qinghua University here, said the drumbeat of criticism had sent a message that the relationship between the United States and China had cooled somewhat in recent months. 
"The timing gives China a clear signal that the improvement after Sept. 11 is a temporary improvement and not a permanent change," he said.
China has supported the American effort to curb terrorism, partly because of concerns about China's own Muslim minority in the western region of Xinjiang.
But in contrast with previous periods when China has taken public offense at statements from Washington, the complaints this time have been relatively muted. With preparations under way for the party congress, held once every five years, Chinese leaders are saying little on many subjects, not just policy toward the United States.
Many decisions are being deferred. For instance, China's central bank announced on Tuesday that it would leave interest rates unchanged instead of cutting them as had been widely expected.
People's Daily and other major newspapers carried a front-page commentary on Tuesday titled "Stress the General Situation, Stress Unity, Stress Stability." 
No date has been set yet for the party congress, and there have been reports of infighting over the extent to which a younger generation of leaders will replace Jiang Zemin, China's president and the party's general secretary, and his closest advisers.
The low-key tone of Chinese objections has been especially true of the response to the sanctions. The Foreign Ministry ended up faxing a cautiously worded three-sentence protest to news agencies on Monday afternoon but did not follow its usual procedure of issuing a statement through the official New China News Agency. 
The news media here have ignored the sanctions so far, which will bar the nine companies from doing business with the American government and limit their ability to trade with the United States. 
The reports from the Pentagon and from the United States-China Security Review Commission, appointed by Congress, have belatedly drawn a somewhat stronger response. 
Zeng Jianhui, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the National People's Congress, told the official China Daily on July 17 that the reports' discussion of a Chinese threat to the United States was "out of tune with the trend of Sino-U.S. relations."
The Chinese Embassy in Washington criticized the Pentagon report on Monday, especially its assertion that China spends more than three times as much on its military as it publicly acknowledges. But the criticism was issued by a spokesman, Xie Feng, rather than the ambassador.
China Daily published two front-page articles on the reports today, with Mr. Zeng saying that he would like to invite the reports' authors to China and adding, "I'd like to see no confrontation or bickering but, instead, efforts to find more common interests and truth in a matter-of-fact way."
Michael Wessel, a member of the Security Review Commission, said that the commission had been aware that the Pentagon was preparing its own report but that the release of the two reports just three days apart was coincidental. 
"There was no coordination or Machiavellian intrigue here," he said in a phone interview from Washington, adding that he had not been aware of the plan for sanctions either.
The commission's most controversial recommendation was that American businesses should report to Washington on their investments in China and technology transfers to China, along with the effects of their China operations on the number of people they employed in the United States.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Rise On Economic Data 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bonds rose for a fifth trading session in six yesterday as stocks fell and the government said that durable goods orders tumbled, adding to evidence the economy's recovery from recession is slowing.
 The report "puts doubt in people's minds about how strong the recovery will be," said Edgar Peters, who helps manage $15 billion at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston. 
"That's what is moderating any euphoria in the stock market and helping to keep bond yields low." 
 Demand for bonds picked up after the Commerce Department said orders fell 3.8 percent, the first drop since March and the largest since November.
The price of the 10-year note rose 25/32 , to 103 27/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.38 percent from 4.47 percent. The 30-year bond rose 23/32 , to 101 4/32 , while its yield fell to 5.30 percent from 5.35 percent.

HEADLINE: Hedging Learned at the Family Farm 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
John Henry is a complicated man.
 He owns a controlling interest in the Boston Red Sox and a small piece of the New York Yankees. 
 For most people, this would be something of an existential crisis. Since the Sox sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920, Boston stopped winning championships and the Yankees started winning them and have not stopped. 
The rules of baseball prohibit this sort of dual ownership, though there are much bigger issues for Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, to ponder, like the possibility of a strike. But it seems appropriate for an investor who is often betting in multiple directions. 
Mr. Henry himself, a lifelong baseball fan, learned how to hedge against the weather and price fluctuations when he took over his family's Arkansas farm at age 25. He previously owned the Florida Marlins, which he sold last year to buy the Red Sox. His Yankee stake preceded both those relationships. One of Mr. Henry's minority partners in the purchase of the Red Sox was The New York Times Company.
He said in an interview this week that he had had a deal in place to sell his share of the Yankees to an unnamed party, but then accepted a competing bid from the Yankees' management. 
"We have a deal, we have a price, they just haven't sent me the money," he said. "Maybe they're afraid I might spend some of it." As in, on free agents for the Sox. 
Maybe they should be worried, because Mr. Henry is one of the few major investment managers making money right now. His John W. Henry & Company, an investment fund group, based in Boca Raton, Fla., struggled during the bull market, but is prospering again, with his funds appreciating sharply. 
Mr. Henry, 52, a cerebral man with a head for mathematics, uses complex formulas to trade futures contracts, which promise the delivery of assets like commodities or stock indexes on a future date at a set price. Money managers like Mr. Henry, also known as managed futures investors, follow trends in the global market, looking for price discrepancies to exploit, be it changes in currencies, grain prices or interest rates.
Mr. Henry talks about trading the way Yoda talks about the Force. 
"The nature of markets is to trend," he once said, referring to his style of investing, which he calls trend following. "The nature of life is to trend." 
George Soros, once the world's largest hedge fund manager, exploits some of the same trends Mr. Henry does, but with a more gut-driven approach. Managed futures investing tends to be driven by computer formulas and quantitative analysis. Mr. Henry's fund is also structured differently from a hedge fund and is available to retail investors with as little as $5,000 to allocate, though skeptics contend such funds are overly risky.
Part of Mr. Henry's philosophy is that trends course through the markets and their wake can render what seems like a sure-fire stock pick useless, because nothing operates in a vacuum. 
"I've seen year after year, brilliant men buying low and selling high -- for a while successfully -- and then going broke because they thought they understood why a certain investment instrument had to perform in accordance with their personal logic," he said in a speech in 2000. 
By October of 2000, the fund group's assets had fallen from $2.4 billion to $1 billion in about 12 months, so Mr. Henry cut his fees and consolidated his operations.
But in the last year, his style has returned to favor. His assets are back to $1.4 billion. His largest fund, Strategic Allocation, is up 22 percent in the last year and has gained 13.1 percent annually over the last five years, compared with 3.7 percent for the S.& P. 500. 
His most profitable trend this year has been the change in the direction of the dollar against the euro. Since the euro's inception, American tourists have enjoyed its weakness. But a variety of factors, from the terrorist attacks to the limp United States economy to the bear market, have strengthened the euro against the dollar. Last week, its value surpassed the dollar's for the first time in more than two years. 
"I began believing in March that we were going to have a major move in the dollar, so we had some fairly big positions," Mr. Henry said. "We've been long not just the euro but the British pound and the yen.
"When you're in this kind of situation, this decline in the stock market, you have to hope this fund is working," he added. "That's what you're in it for. This is a way to be diversified."

HEADLINE: China Bank Shares Fall in Initial Offering 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 25 

 BODY:
In one of the biggest stock market debuts anywhere in the world this year, shares of the Hong Kong unit of the Bank of China began trading publicly today. They promptly fell 4.7 percent on heavy selling by Hong Kong residents.
 The initial price for the offering was set last Saturday. Since then, markets around the world have weakened, and the Hang Seng index, the main barometer of Hong Kong stocks, has fallen by 4.3 percent, so today's movement in the bank stock caught up with the broader market. 
 Still, the offering, which raised 19.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.5 billion), was a milestone for China, the first international stock listing by a mainland bank. In it, the state-owned Bank of China sold 22 percent of the shares in its Hong Kong unit, which is the territory's largest lender and its second-largest taker of deposits.
The Chinese government has been actively selling stakes in state-owned enterprises even when stock markets have been weak, in the hope that partial private ownership will improve the business practices at the companies. China Telecom, the near-monopoly provider of fixed-line phone service in southern China, is preparing an even larger initial public offering for later this year.
About a third of the shares in the Bank of China offering were set aside for retail investors living in Hong Kong to buy at a 5 percent discount; the rest were sold to institutions and foreigners at full price. The discount allocation, a common feature in large privatizations around the world, prompted a frenzy of activity over the last three weeks.
Residents filed 385,000 applications for shares, a huge number in a territory of 6.8 million people.
Trading opened today near the full offering price, 8.5 Hong Kong dollars ($1.09) a share, but the price eroded during the day, to close at 8.10 Hong Kong dollars, barely above the discount price retail investors paid.
Analysts said the Bank of China and its underwriters had been lucky that financial markets in New York rebounded so strongly on Wednesday. The Hang Seng, which lost heavily before the American rebound on Wednesday, inched down only 0.9 percent today.
"The timing was quite fortunate given what happened in the U.S. markets overnight -- otherwise the results could have been quite a bit worse," said Patrick Vizzone, a director of Commercial Economics Asia, a Hong Kong consulting firm.
Local corporate and institutional investors were not so lucky. More than a dozen companies that are trying to expand in mainland China and want to impress Beijing, led by the Standard Chartered Bank, agreed in advance to buy large blocks of stock in the initial public offering instead of waiting to buy it from retail investors during the early trading. 
Large institutional investors around the world were also buyers -- some through a private placement of the stock today in the United States -- on the expectation that the stock would soon be included in the Hang Seng Index and in a widely followed index published by Morgan Stanley Capital International.
Traders said the stock fell despite heavy buying by the underwriters to support it. The lead underwriters were Goldman, Sachs; UBS Warburg; and Bank of China International Holdings, another arm of the parent bank in Beijing.
Because of strong demand in the days before trading began, the underwriters actually sold 15 percent more shares than the Bank of China initially sold, with all of the extra shares going to institutional investors. They must cover the difference within 30 days, either by buying shares in the open market or by having the Bank of China issue more stock to them at the institutional price.
Despite the first-day drop, investors still valued the Hong Kong unit of the Bank of China higher than American institutions like J. P. Morgan and Citigroup, as measured by the ratio of stock price to book value. Yet 9.5 percent of the unit's loan assets are classified as nonperforming, even after the government took some bad loans off its books. That is nearly twice the average for Hong Kong banks and six times that of American banks.
None of the proceeds of the offer will remain in the Hong Kong unit as fresh capital; it will instead go to the parent bank, whose nonperforming-loan burden is higher still.
Henry Lee, managing director of the Hendale Group, a Hong Kong money management company, said the crucial question now was whether the stock would fall below 8 Hong Kong dollars a share. "If they break that, it may not come back up above that level soon," he said.
If it does fall that far, the Bank of China risks antagonizing Hong Kong residents despite the retail discount. Although trading was fairly heavy today, equal to one-sixth of all the newly issued shares, many people at one Hong Kong brokerage office were holding on to their stakes.
"Wait and see is my approach, and I'll only sell it when it goes up to 8.60," said Chan Yee-ting, 52, who described herself as a housewife. "It's a long-term investment for me."

HEADLINE: Build Plants, Top Energy Regulator Urges 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
New York's top energy regulator called yesterday for the construction of new power plants and greater participation in conservation programs, saying that the near-record electrical use earlier this month illustrates the need for action.
 The push comes during a month in which the downstate region experienced one major power failure and several smaller ones. The regulator, Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the New York Public Service Commission, told government officials this week that while she was confident the state would be able to make it through the summer without any more major failures, more long-term solutions were needed, including the building of new plants. 
 State regulators have approved several new generation projects, although many have been stalled by the inability of power companies to attract investments because of the Enron scandal and the weakening economy. 
This month's power problems came as a surprise to many energy experts, who thought that the softening economy, the loss of the World Trade Center and other factors would reduce demand for power this summer. But utilities still found themselves struggling to meet demand in many areas.
"Our experience early this month reinforces the fact that the demand for electricity is growing and that we must continue our efforts," Ms. Helmer said in a statement released late Wednesday.
On Saturday, an explosion at a Consolidated Edison substation on the East River knocked out electrical power for roughly 63,000 people in Manhattan. It is still unclear exactly what caused the short circuit that led to the explosion, officials said yesterday.
Two years ago, state officials, including Ms. Helmer, warned that a power crisis was rapidly developing. As a result, the New York Power Authority installed 10 minigenerators in the city. The timing proved crucial, because in August 2001 the Con Ed network reached record levels of use.
At a City Council hearing on Tuesday, Ms. Helmer said the minigenerators were not enough. She said the state was prepared to activate several programs that encourage customers to reduce electric consumption to cope with shortages. In emergencies, Con Ed has the authority to demand that some businesses reduce their power usage.
On July 18, the New York Power Authority was able to reduce demand in the city by asking more than 15 businesses and government agencies to cut back as part of a program that provides organizations with $40 for each kilowatt of electrical power that they save, said Michael Saltzman, a power authority spokesman. Gov. George E. Pataki has heavily promoted a program under which people receive $75 for turning in inefficient air-conditioners.
The New York Independent System Operator, which runs the power grid, has said the city will need 2,000 to 3,000 additional megawatts of power generation by 2005. Con Ed has a capacity of about 13,000 megawatts in the city and Westchester County. To address long-term concerns, Ms. Helmer called for the construction of new plants and for importing electricity under the Hudson River and through the New York Harbor from New Jersey and other states.
Ms. Helmer said that she did not anticipate any other serious problems this summer, but stopped short of making any guarantees.

HEADLINE: U.S. Proposes to Cut Global Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, criticized overseas for supporting a huge increase in American farm subsidies this year, said today it was prepared to seek reductions worldwide as part of a global trade agreement.
 The proposal was included in a negotiating package the administration unveiled in advance of World Trade Organization farm negotiations to resume next week in Geneva. 
 "This plan is a win for America's farmers, ranchers and consumers and also a win for the global economy," the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, said at a news conference.
The administration will seek a ban on export subsidies, payments provided to increase foreign sales, and sharp cuts in domestic support provided to farmers to raise production.
The United States proposal would cap this support at 5 percent of a country's total farm output, a figure that the administration said would trim $100 billion from the current level of subsidies provided by the United States, the European Union and other wealthy countries.
Beyond the curbs on trade distorting subsidies, the administration also called for global tariffs on farm products to be cut from a worldwide average of 62 percent to an average of 15 percent in five years.
The administration's proposal has won praise from major American farm groups.

HEADLINE: Data Suggest Weak Spots In Economy 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
Factory orders for big-ticket goods, including cars and computers, unexpectedly fell 3.8 percent in June from May, the largest amount in seven months, the Commerce Department reported today.
 The June decline in orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- was the first since March and came after a 0.6 percent increase in May. Analysts had expected a 0.6 percent increase. 
 Adding to concerns was a National Association of Realtors report today that sales of existing homes -- the largest part of the housing market -- dropped 11.7 percent in June from May. That left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.1 million, the lowest in nine months. Existing-home sales, however, have been running at brisk levels for much of the year and the association is forecasting record sales for 2002.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, reported today that new-home sales rose to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 million in June, a 0.5 percent increase over May. Analysts had expected a 4.7 percent decline.
Many analysts think low mortgage rates will continue to support the housing market, which in turn would help a recovery.
The decline in durable-goods orders along with a 1.4 percent drop in shipments -- a barometer of current demand -- was considered an ominous sign that businesses might be growing even more uncertain about a recovery.
"The report suggests that there is an endemic concern about the state of their own businesses, whether consumers will step up and buy their products, and the prospects for the economy in general," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com.
The decline in orders was broad based. Orders for cars, computers, communications equipment, machinery, metals, metal products and electrical equipment all dropped.
"The glass remains half-empty for many manufacturers and the recovery -- while well under way -- has not yet accelerated to a satisfactory pace," David Huether, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said.
Two Labor Department reports released today offered workers some encouraging news. Wages and benefits increased 1 percent in the quarter from April to June from the previous quarter, the fastest pace in six months. That came after a 0.8 percent advance in the first three months of this year.
In addition, new claims for state unemployment insurance dropped to a 17-month low, suggesting that the pace of layoffs is stabilizing. Claims fell last week by a seasonally adjusted 21,000, to 362,000.

HEADLINE: Kodak's Profit Increases, but Sales FallAgain 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, July 25 

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company reported today that its second-quarter profit increased sharply because of a tax benefit and cost reductions. Sales, however, fell for a seventh consecutive quarter. 
 Net income rose to $284 million, or 97 cents a share, from $36 million, or 12 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 7 percent, to $3.34 billion, from $3.59 billion, the company said. Quarterly sales last rose in the third quarter of 2000. 
 Excluding a tax gain related to the closing of a subsidiary and a write-down of assets, profit would have fallen to $248 million, or 85 cents a share, from $325 million, or $1.12, Kodak said. The average profit estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call was 83 cents.
Film sales in the United States fell 20 percent in the quarter as consumers cut back travel plans and took fewer photos. Layoffs and other cost-cutting measures helped earnings this quarter and hurt results a year ago. The chief executive, Daniel A. Carp, said Kodak was not seeing signs of an economic improvement.
Operating cash flow in the quarter fell 18 percent, to $410 million from $503 million a year earlier. 
"What we have to do at Kodak is manage for cash, stay tough on costs, manage market share and position for the upturn," Mr. Carp said. "We're just going to have to keep our heads down and grind through this."
Shares of Kodak fell 29 cents, to $28.10. They have fallen 36 percent in the last year amid declining sales and competition from Fuji Photo Film of Japan.

HEADLINE: McCall Faults Nursing Home Investigations 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
Thousands of complaints about poor care at nursing homes in New York were ignored or not properly investigated by the State Health Department last year, according to an audit released yesterday by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
 Mr. McCall said the failures occurred even after the state centralized its system of tracking complaints. In the new system, instituted in May 2001, complaints are entered into a centralized database managed by department officials in Albany and sent to regional offices for investigation. The system includes a toll-free number so people can check the status of their complaints. 
 But the audit, which compared the database records with records kept in regional offices, found serious discrepancies between the records, indicating that many complaints were not properly investigated, Mr. McCall said. 
The audit found that of a random sample of complaints, 43 percent were not investigated promptly or not investigated at all. Nearly 1,000 cases, including 695 in the New York City region, were assigned to investigators who no longer worked for the Health Department, the audit found, and more than 1,200 complaints were assigned to investigators who lacked proper certification.
In some cases, serious complaints of physical abuse or safety concerns were not investigated within two days, even though investigators are required by law to do so within that period, the audit found.
At a news conference in Manhattan yesterday, Mr. McCall, who is running for governor, accused Gov. George E. Pataki's administration of failing to "adequately investigate allegations of abuse, neglect and mistreatment" of nursing home residents across the state. 
A statement released yesterday by the Health Department said that it has more investigators than ever before, 246 to supervise 685 nursing homes, and that it levied record fines in 2001. According to the statement, 95 homes were inspected in 2001, up from 43 the previous year.
John Signor, a spokesman for the Health Department, said Mr. McCall had twisted the audit results to suit his political purposes. "Once again, Carl McCall is unnecessarily scaring seniors and their families in a shameless attempt to further his political ambitions," he said. "Every complaint received by the department is reviewed and investigated."
Health care watchdog groups said the audit confirmed accounts of problems that they had heard about for years. Cynthia Rudder, director of the Nursing Home Community Coalition, said investigations into complaints often ended without family members being informed of the outcome of the inquiries, or were investigated improperly or too slowly. 
"One resident complained about a lack of blankets in the winter, but by the time the investigator showed up it was summer and he found there was no problem with blankets," Ms. Rudder said.
Patricia Sheehan put her father, Oswaldo Esteves, 73, in a nursing home in Jackson Heights, Queens, almost two years ago, when his symptoms of Alzheimer's disease became too much for her mother to handle at home. When her father contracted pneumonia in spring of 2001 and had to be hospitalized, doctors discovered that his body was covered with tiny red insect bites.
Mrs. Sheehan said she got no response when she called the Health Department to complain. She put her father in a different home but tried to follow up to make sure other patients in the first home did not suffer the same problems.
Six months later, an investigator called her to check on her father's status. "They said there was no need to pursue it anymore since he had been moved," Mrs. Sheehan said. "I was totally shocked."

HEADLINE: Protecting Capitalism From Itself 

 BODY:
Back when financial markets were soaring, analysts marveled at the phenomenon of "panic buying" on Wall Street -- the desperate snatching up of any stocks within reach by investors who felt they could not afford to stay on the sidelines. Yesterday's nearly unanimous passage by both houses of Congress of sweeping corporate governance reform legislation was the political equivalent of panic buying. We are in a bull market for reform, and even the most adamant foes of regulation realized they could not afford to stay on the sidelines.
 However, the bill itself, unlike some of the stocks snatched up by investors in the late 1990's bubble, has real underlying value. It is essentially the legislation introduced in the Senate by Paul Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat. Until a few weeks ago it seemed to have little chance of being approved by the Senate Banking Committee, let alone by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which initially passed a far weaker reform bill. Now, within days, President Bush is expected to sign into law a reform he could not quite bring himself to endorse explicitly as recently as July 9, when he came to Wall Street. 
 The legislation creates an independent oversight board with strong disciplinary powers for the accounting industry. It was in the 1930's that private accounting firms were formally entrusted with certifying corporations' financial statements on behalf of the public, but the profession has proved incapable of policing and disciplining those of its members who betray that trust. 
The new measure rightly forbids auditors to provide many kinds of lucrative consulting services to companies whose numbers they are checking on the public's behalf. It also requires firms to rotate their lead partners involved with a client, and directs the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will oversee the new accounting board, to review a greater number of financial statements.
Top corporate executives will become more liable for any misleading information provided by their companies, although an opportunity was missed to make them liable not only for misstatements they know to be such, but also for those they should reasonably be expected to know are untrue. This leaves open the door for continued plausible deniability in the boardroom, and may be an issue for Congress to revisit soon. 
The self-congratulatory rhetoric in Washington cannot hide the fact that much of what this legislation ostensibly does accomplish -- both in terms of policing accountants and cracking down on companies' own malfeasance -- will be undone in the absence of vigorous and effective enforcement by the S.E.C. The current commission chairman, Harvey Pitt, has proved to be the wrong man at the wrong time for the job. News of his absurd quest to obtain cabinet status and a salary increase has further undermined confidence in the judgment of Mr. Pitt, a former lawyer for the accounting industry who took office last year ominously pledging to preside over a gentler, friendlier S.E.C. The bill proposes a needed boost in funding for a commission long hobbled by insufficient resources as well as by delays on the part of the White House and the Senate in seating the four other commissioners. 
The American economy is still trying to get past the damage done by greedy executives -- and their facilitators in the accounting and other professions -- who believed that making a company's performance look good was more important than actually performing. If President Bush and Congress produce a law empowering the S.E.C. to crack down on false accounting and corporate malfeasance without ensuring that the commission has the will and resources to do so, this seemingly ambitious bill will turn out to be just another illusion, a short-lived reform bubble on Capitol Hill.

PERSON: Alain E. Kaloyeros 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Behind a Research Center, a Geek With Great Cars

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
AT the technology-obsessed State University of New York here, the big man on campus this season does not play football. To be blunt, at 5-foot-7 -- on his tiptoes or in his dreams -- he's nowhere near big enough, and at age 46, this grizzled physics professor is past prime time for rough-housing on athletic fields. Instead, he plays around with atoms, invents chip technology, and was point man in the project that is to bring a $400 million computer chip research center, and potentially thousands of new jobs, to Albany later this year.
 "I don't believe in computer intelligence, only human intelligence," says Alain E. Kaloyeros, a dapper dervish of a scientist. "After all, we're the ones who make them. Though I think in some ways, by swamping us with information, they're training us to be smarter and faster." 
 But being on science's cutting edge does not make Mr. Kaloyeros a one-dimensional man. Perish the thought. His nostrils flare, as does his Continental accent (part Greek, part French, part Lebanese). Check out that trophy key hanging from his belt loop: it ignites a 390-horsepower Maserati. He has a sports car fetish, a sushi habit, and an addiction to Starbucks; his favorite movie is "Ocean's Eleven," the George Clooney version. He loves its sarcasm, especially when insomnia strikes. His favorite invention, even though it's not one of his, is the radar detector. 
In these parts, Mr. Kaloyeros, dean of the School of Nanosciences and Nanoengineering, the future-is-now branch of physics that traffics in individual atom management, is most definitely the player of the moment. Something of a computer chip wizard -- he holds 10 patents for thin film technology and last year received SUNY's Outstanding Inventor Award -- Mr. Kaloyeros is also a veritable Chamber of Commerce in disguise. 
It turns out he's the guy who, along with Gov. George E. Pataki, can take credit for bringing an infusion of Silicon Valley to the Hudson Valley. When the industry-epitomizing consortium, International Sematech, which Mr. Kaloyeros and the university has done business with since 1994, let slip last year that it needed a state-of-the-art research center that could open by October 2002, Mr. Kaloyeros didn't think twice: "I said, 'Why not New York?' and we took it from there." 
He wooed the Sematech executives like a suitor: first the trip to Lake George for a scenic powwow with the Semiconductor Industry Association, then the campus tour (nice coincidence that a construction project -- tenants wanted -- was under way adjacent to his Nanosciences building), then lots of quality time with the governor. That last thing, he says, was a pivotal psychological component because "it implies that the state is interested in a long-term relationship." In short, he did everything but send flowers; not that he didn't think of it. A single pink rose was how he roped in his wife, Paula, in the late 80's.
THE secret negotiations lasted from September until last week, when Sematech announced its plans to move onto campus, right next door to the Center for Environmental Science and Technology Management, the futuristic ship-shaped building where Mr. Kaloyeros has an office, appropriately, in the glassy prow. Earnest old Albany not only bested a bid by Belgium, but according to him, it fended off a pair of after-the-fact counteroffers from other states. He isn't sure if he should name them, but what the heck: sorry, Oregon and Florida. 
"They're the darling of the industry," he says of Sematech, whose 12-member constituency includes I.B.M., Intel, Motorola and Royal Philips Electronics. "Everybody would like to get Sematech in their backyard; this whole new high-tech field is driven by university research, and building critical mass at the state university level is something that's going to end up helping to drive the state's economy. You know, we're at the point now where 90 percent of your life is run by computer chips," he adds. Clearly, he thinks this is a swell thing. Money in his pocket, too: he or she who invents the littlest, fastest, multi-tasking chip will never hurt for work. 
Not for nothing does the vanity plate on his metallic black Porsche Boxster -- his alternate ride is that brand-new Maserati Spyder crouched in the parking lot -- shout out his tongue-in-cheek take on his sense of self: GEEK. As in, the strata of geekdom where Bill Gates, whom Mr. Kaloyeros describes as a transcendent nerd, is club president. Mr. Kaloyeros purchased his last two Porsches courtesy of royalties from his patents and is already lusting after the Ferrari 360 Spider. He's in line for a black model; all his convertibles are black, and all his cars are convertibles, the better to tan in while driving to work from suburban Slingerlands, where he lives with his wife and two sons. 
Mr. Kaloyeros earned a doctorate in physics from the University of Illinois in 1987. Raised to be career-minded in East Beirut, Lebanon, where his father was a banker and his mother worked in marketing for Sony and Sanyo, he recalls that the in crowd at his Lebanese high school was composed of the smart kids, not the jocks or beauty queens. "Better be nice to geeks," he jokes, "because the way the world is going, chances are you're going to end up working for one."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Day Is Freneti c As Investors Start Looking For Bargains

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
In another day of stock market sound and fury, the Nasdaq composite index took a pounding, but the broader market averages closed with only modest losses.
 Portfolio managers, encouraged by the action, said investors seemed to shift out of a sell-everything mode and were beginning once again to differentiate between stocks that are cheap and those that are not. 
 At the close of trading, the Nasdaq composite index had fallen 50.15 points, or 3.9 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day flat, at 8,186.31. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.75 points, or about a half of 1 percent. With about 2.5 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, trading was frenetic. 
"I was sort of encouraged by what happened in the market because it's giving us the first indication that we're beginning to see differentiation," said Charles I. Clough, of Clough Capital Partners in Boston. "Until now, it's been massive liquidation, week after week. The Nasdaq gave out, but that's where the economy is most weak and where there is still some washout to occur."
Stocks were in free fall by midafternoon, with the Dow industrials down 245 points and the Nasdaq hitting a new intraday low of 1,220.93, a loss of 70 points. Both indexes recovered, but the Nasdaq could not struggle back to its previous closing level. 
Investors in technology were alarmed by a report from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that it was cutting capital expenditures because of weak demand for chips. Since many technology stock bulls were counting on a pickup in chip orders ahead of the crucial back-to-school season, the company's announcement took the wind out of technology stocks.
Semiconductor stocks have been one of a few safe Nasdaq havens in recent weeks, hanging in while other sectors were battered. Yesterday, the Philadelphia semiconductor index of 17 chip stocks lost 10 percent of its value. Intel fell 6.5 percent, to $17.48.
The carnage in technology stocks is now beginning to approach the losses endured in the Dow industrials after the crash of 1929, said David Dreman, head of Dreman Value Management. From its high in September 1929, the Dow fell 89 percent by July 8, 1932, he said. "The high on the Nasdaq 100 was 4,825 in March 2000," he said, "and the low yesterday was 873, a drop of 82 percent." The Nasdaq 100 closed at 894.54.
Investors seem to be taking the view, with reason, that technology stocks are still overpriced, Mr. Dreman said. "Even though we're down this much, these companies were so enormously overvalued that there could be a lot more downside ahead. There was so much overexpansion in capacity in telecom and computers, it's going to take a long time for these companies to come back, if ever."
Genuity Inc., an Internet service provider, fell $2.30, to 29 cents as it defaulted on $3 billion in loans. Verizon Communications said it would not buy back a controlling stake in the company. Genuity shares were spun off to the public in June 2000 by the GTE Corporation at $11 each.
Eroding confidence in corporate practices continued to hammer some of the biggest companies yesterday. AOL Time Warner shares fell $1.75, or about 15 percent, to $9.64 on news that the company's accounting was under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission. J. P. Morgan Chase lost 95 cents, or about 4 percent, to close at $22.35, as securities regulators look into the bank's role in the Enron fiasco. The bank says it did nothing wrong.
Investors are continuing to flee mutual funds, according to Robert Adler at AMG Data Services. For the week that ended yesterday, a record $12.2 billion exited stock funds, bringing total outflows for July to $30.6 billion, the most since the company began compiling fund data 10 years ago. Corporate bond funds and money market funds both drew in money. 
"There is no indication of panic or full-scale flight from the market," Mr. Adler said. "But every buyer who disappears is not just disappearing, he is becoming a seller. That puts a different picture on the market." Outflows are also escalating at index funds. 
Anthony M. Maramarco, portfolio manager at Babson Value Fund in Cambridge, Mass., said that he had started to see the traditionally defensive stocks, like food companies, come back a bit. It may be a harbinger of more stability. "Even though we haven't had that blow-off that everybody was looking for, we may have gotten to the point where we will just bounce along at the bottom here," he said. "There's certainly a lot of bad blood that has been let."

HEADLINE: For Schenectady, A Guyanese Strategy; 
Mayor Goes All Out to Encourage A Wave of Hardworking Immigrants

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y. 

 BODY:
This small city in the Mohawk River valley, where industries built in the early 20th century on the hard labor of immigrants from Italy and Poland crumbled long ago, is in the market for a new ethnic group.
 The mayor has found one, and he is doing everything short of packing up their homes in New York City and driving the moving van to get them here. 
 They are Guyanese immigrants living in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, and since May, Mayor Albert P. Jurczynski has gone to rather unusual lengths to persuade them to move to his struggling city of 62,000 people.
He is their guide on a weekly bus tour that brings dozens of Guyanese immigrants here every Saturday for a three-hour tour of the city. He takes them to Schenectady's own Central Park for ice cream cones. He takes them to his in-laws' house for homemade wine. He promises to build them a cricket stadium one day, to personally review all their resumes, officiate at their weddings and learn to love their spicy soups. 
He has given out his cellphone number on a New York radio show that is popular among Guyanese immigrants. He makes regular trips to Richmond Hill, Queens, the city's largest Guyanese neighborhood, where he walks along Liberty Avenue practically demanding that everybody move to Schenectady on the double. He flatters the merchants, buys Guyanese products and dines on braised bass, curried goat and 15-year-old Guyanese rum.
"Let me ask you something," the barrel-chested mayor boomed through a microphone as a bus filled with 43 visiting Guyanese immigrants rolled away from Schenectady City Hall on a Saturday in July. "Bloomberg, down in New York City, would he be doing this? For that reason alone you should move to Schenectady."
His plan is working. From the time last year that Mayor Jurczynski (pronounced jur-ZIN-ski) heard there was a a small Guyanese population in his city, some 2,000 have moved here, according to Schenectady officials, with each weekly bus tour bringing more. They are buying dilapidated or condemned homes -- some for as little as $1 -- and fixing them up, making plans for restaurants and shops and taking jobs as construction workers and nurses' aides. Most important to the mayor, they are telling their friends and relatives about an obscure and hard-to-pronounce place called Schenectady.
Immigrants to this country move from place to place all the time, creating new and often large enclaves as they go. While many depressed or deserted cities have courted and encouraged immigrants to move in, what usually drives these migrations -- like the movement of Bangladeshis from Queens to Detroit and Bosnians to Utica, N.Y. -- is word of mouth.
In this case, the motor of change is Mayor Al, as he is known around the city.
Mr. Jurczynski, 45, a Republican who grew up here and is serving his seventh year as mayor, seems to have decided that his city's future lies in the hands of the Guyanese. And his obsession has left some in established ethnic communities feeling slighted. 
There are roughly 140,000 Guyanese in New York City, the largest population outside Guyana, a former British colony on the northeast coast of South America. Most are ethnic Indians, whose ancestors were brought to Guyana from India as indentured servants. They speak English, which has helped make their adjustment to life in Schenectady much less difficult than it was for the earlier immigrants from Italy and Poland. (The mayor is the grandson of immigrants from Poland.)
The mayor's effort began after he received a telephone call last year from Deryck Singh, a Guyanese immigrant who settled here 15 years earlier and was looking for a place to build a Hindu temple. There were only 200 Guyanese immigrants living here, but the mayor helped them find a vacant Catholic church to house the temple, and in the process he learned a few things about the Guyanese, he said.
Mr. Jurczynski recalled Mr. Singh, who moved here from the Bronx after stumbling on Schenectady one afternoon during a drive up the New York State Thruway, saying Guyanese people "don't believe in public assistance."
"When I heard that, I had a big smile on my face," the mayor said. "And I said, 'You're singing my tune.' "
After that, the mayor began to meet and greet more Guyanese immigrants, including two savvy real estate brokers from Queens, one of whom hosts a radio show in New York City.
Last May, the mayor called in to "Herman Singh Show Time," a radio program on WRTN 93.5 FM, and told the largely Guyanese audience that they should move to Schenectady and call him directly on his cell phone. It was a bold move, but it was subtle compared to what came next.
A month later, the bus trips began, leaving every other Saturday at 6 a.m. from Richmond Hill and returning 12 hours later. Starting in July, the trips, paid for by the two real estate and mortgage brokers from Queens who often get dozens of clients after each trip, are running weekly. Soon, for the first time, two buses will make the trip.
Unemployment here is about 3.6 percent, far below that of New York City, and houses sell at a fraction of prices in New York City.
"I have a better life here for half the cost," said Deryck Singh, the district manager for the Albany division of Stewart's Ice Cream. "I have a great deal of love for New York City, but I just can't do it every day."
The city has been selling homes on its demolition list, in some of its most downtrodden neighborhoods, to Guyanese immigrants, for as little as $1. And Schenectady gets a great deal: It costs $16,500 to demolish each condemned building, so they save the cost of demolition and watch their property values rise. Herman Singh, the radio host and broker, said that after seven bus tours so far, his business, Tropical Funding, had handled 72 mortgages for people who had taken the bus tour and had bought property in Schenectady.
Mr. Jurczynski has made no secret of his motivation in having the Guyanese move into a city that has lost tens of thousands of residents over the last few decades. But the mayor, who is quick to describe the Guyanese as hard-working, entrepreneurial and tidy, has been criticized by some of the city's black residents for rolling out a red carpet for the Guyanese and, in doing so, implying that Schenectady's other ethnic groups -- blacks, Hispanics and Asians make up roughly 20 percent of the population -- are neither as industrious nor as desirable.
At a recent Schenectady Council meeting, Councilman Joseph Allen said he found it "offensive" that the mayor would imply that "the people who have lived here for years don't have a strong work ethic."
George L. Robertson, president of the Schenectady Economic Development Corporation, said the city had tried offering numerous financial incentives to encourage home buying and entrepreneurship. But when residents of Schenectady earn enough to buy homes, they often leave for the suburbs, he said.
At the welcome reception at City Hall in July, a parade of employers, school officials and others made their pitches to the Guyanese visitors, leaving them with information packets and canvas tote bags. Mr. Robertson told them: "Quite frankly, you're an opportunity for us. We very much are looking for a new ethnic group."
Afterward, as everyone headed to the bus for the mayor's tour, Yasmin Baksh, 41, a Guyanese immigrant and unemployed banker who lives in Richmond Hill, said, "We feel so welcome. They want us to come develop the area. The way they were speaking, I've never heard this."

HEADLINE: Pension Funds In New Jersey Face Shortfall 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 25 

 BODY:
Just as New Jersey has patched up its worst fiscal mess ever, the state is staring at another: next year an enormous payment for its shrinking pension funds will come due. 
 The total will approach $1 billion, by the estimates of some state officials and consultants, most of it in new spending. John E. McCormac, the state treasurer, said the shortfall would be "much worse" than he expected just a few months ago, although he said he would not know what new contributions would be needed until the most recent investment returns were analyzed. 
 Soon, Mr. McCormac said, the state will be able to calculate the damage done so far by a bold plan in the 1990's that borrowed money to finance the funds with stock market profits. 
The dismay and blame surrounding the pension funds are directed mostly at former Gov. Christie Whitman, who now more than ever is accused of mortgaging the state's future to pay for the tax cuts that propelled her to national prominence. 
"You think what's going on in the business world is bad?" said Judith C. Cambria, a fiscal policy specialist who wrote a report on the state's fiscal trends over the last decade. "The last administration used every trick in the book." 
While criticisms of her administration have mounted with New Jersey's escalating budget problems, Mrs. Whitman has continued to defend her fiscal management.
"So much of it has gotten personal," she said in a recent interview with The New York Times.
More recently, as the stock market has stagnated, pension funds all over the nation have lost money. But in New Jersey, said Tom Vincz, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, "a perfect storm is coming up now."
The market plunge has cost New Jersey's funds $22 billion over the last two years. The state will have to resume regular contributions, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, after skipping payments for several years. And pension costs were bumped up after the State Legislature granted 9 percent increases to teachers and retired state workers before last year's elections. 
What's more, the state must pay $160 million in the current fiscal year, which began July 1, on the $2.75 billion in bonds that the state issued to replenish the funds in 1997. The payment schedule was set up to start with small amounts and balloon later.
The idea five years ago was to wipe out a pension-fund deficit by floating bonds, invest the assets in a galloping stock market and make more on the investments than it cost to pay off the bonds. The plan was purposely overfunded so that the state could skip payments for several years.
The returns, however, have not covered the 7.64 percent annual interest on the bonds -- although they might over the life of the bonds. 
"I believe it was in essence arbitrage, and I don't think the government should engage in arbitrage," said State Senator Leonard Lance, who as a member of the General Assembly was one of the few Republicans to oppose Governor Whitman's proposal. "Unfortunately, I believe I've been proved right on this." 
Even before Gov. James E. McGreevey took office in January, he blamed his Republican predecessors for the growing budget gap. But the pension funds were not even a factor for the 2003 fiscal year, because by law no contribution was scheduled until 2004. 
While the pension funds have lost value, there was no way to anticipate the market losses of the spring and summer. 
When Moody's Investors Service downgraded New Jersey's bonds in March, it predicted that in 2004 the state would have to start making pension payments of "several hundred million dollars per year." Tim Blake, the author of the report, said he had since heard estimates of $1 billion.
Over the last two years, the state's investment portfolio, most of which is pension funds, declined from $94 billion to $72 billion. About 60 percent of the portfolio is invested in stocks.
Ms. Cambria, the fiscal policy specialist, said that while the recent losses were alarming, "It's absolutely essential that we realize we are seeing the consequences of irresponsible action over a long period of years."
In the 1990's, the state's long-term debt rose to $15.7 billion from $4 billion. Of that, $2.75 billion came from the 1997 pension bond sale, the state's largest debt offering ever.
The bond issue allowed Mrs. Whitman to balance her election-year budget by drastically cutting the state's required contribution to the pension funds. The problem was "unfunded liabilities" -- that is, money that was supposed to be in the pension funds and was not -- dating to 1994, when the state started deferring its payments. 
When the governor proposed borrowing to raise the funds and investing the money, the idea was wildly unpopular. No state had ever issued bonds to cover pension costs, and even the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Robert E. Littell, pronounced it a "wacko idea." 
But Mrs. Whitman prevailed, and critics were shushed when the bonds sold in an eager market at an average interest rate of 7.64 percent, instead of the 7.78 percent that the state had expected.
Over the next two years, the pension system's returns averaged 19.3 percent. But by Jan. 1, 2002, the total return had dropped to 7 percent, and losses since then have depressed returns further. 
McGreevey administration officials acknowledge that the funds have performed worse than most public pension plans in recent months. Mr. McCormac, the state treasurer, said New Jersey was one of just two states that use in-house employees to manage all investments. But he dismissed reports that some administration officials were considering hiring private brokerage firms to manage the funds. 
"That's not even on our radar screen," Mr. McCormac said.

HEADLINE: Fire Prompts New Debate On Managing The Sequoias 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN 

DATELINE: KERNVILLE, Calif., July 25 

 BODY:
The fires that continued to roar today near hundreds of giant sequoias, the towering trademarks of the area around this central California town, have renewed an argument over how best to manage the Sequoia National Forest's resources while preventing the woodland's destruction.
 Mirrored in similar cases across the country but particularly acute in the vast forests of the West, the debate pits the competing interests of preservation and business against each other and leads to drawn swords every time a fire makes ash of the landscape. 
 "You know who's getting all the blame for this?" asked David Priest, who runs a bait-and-tackle shop in Lake Isabella, a town 10 miles south of here that has been afflicted by three wildfires in the two months. "Clinton," he replied to his own question, referring to the former president. Mr. Clinton established the Giant Sequoia National Monument during his last year in office, protecting a 328,000-acre piece of the forest from culling, logging and most clearing that involves heavy equipment. 
Many people here say that protection has added fuel to the fires.
"If you can't go in there and bulldoze, how do you clean things out so that they don't explode?" said Linda Meadors, a bank employee who has lived in Kernville for 27 years and said she used to enjoy hunting deer and game birds like quail and pheasant in the area of the monument, activities banned under the new designation. "It doesn't make sense that you can't fight fire because of laws and special interest groups. There's a lot of resentment here over that."
Regardless, the latest fire, which began on Sunday when a campfire ran out of control near a lodge on the Kern River named McNally's, was being fought today on all fronts. 
A Bakersfield woman, Peri Van Brunt, 45, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the fire, although officials said they did not believe she had set it deliberately.
Fire officials seemed hopeful that they could have some measure of control over the blaze in two or three days if favorable wind and weather conditions persisted. But if the winds shift and blow the 58,500-acre fire more intensely toward the sequoia groves to the west and north, firefighters would have a hard time stopping it from entering the Trail of 100 Giants, the most spectacular of the old sequoia groves, where trees 2,000 years old stand 200 feet tall. In all, 11 sequoia groves were threatened by the McNally fire today, with at least one less than a mile from the flames. Many of the trees in the area have survived countless fires in the past, but the brush around many of them is unusually thick and could flare up to unmanageable levels, fire officials said.
"In some of this country, it's been 100 years since we had fire in it," Jim Paxon, a Forest Service spokesman, said this morning. "But things are looking up. As long as we don't get a major burst of thunderstorms with downdrafts, we'll be in good shape."
Sean Cosgrove, a forest policy specialist with The Sierra Club, said that because the Forest Service generates revenue from timber sales, the economic incentive to promote logging might interfere with the agency's mandate to protect wildlife and old-growth trees.
"We don't sue or litigate to stop controlled burns," Mr. Cosgrove said. "We sue over fire reduction projects that are packaged as bad timber sale projects."
Loggers say that the battle by environmentalist groups to ban old-growth timber cuts have curtailed the tree-thinning needed to prevent large fires. "These fires are due to the reductions in logging," said Glen Duysen, founder of Sierra Forest Products, a 35-year-old timber company in Terra Bella, eight miles from here, that runs just one of the eight mills it once had. "There are just too many trees per acre."
But Art Gaffrey, a Forest Service supervisor here, said that each year 6,000 to 8,000 acres of the Sequoia Forest are thinned using prescribed burns and timber cuts.
"Proposed projects have been questioned and there have been delays and changes," Mr. Gaffrey said. "But in my seven years here I do not remember a project being stopped."
Forestry officials acknowledge that overly aggressive fire-suppression policies in place since early last century have left forests vulnerable to much larger fires because the natural order, which counts on fires to clear land and promote new growth, has been upset.
"Smokey Bear did too good a job," said Matt Mathes, a Forest Service spokesman. "It was a well-meaning policy with unintentional consequences."

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

"THE BOURNE IDENTITY," starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Directed by Doug Liman (PG-13, 113 minutes). Mr. Damon plays Jason Bourne, a C.I.A. superassassin with amnesia who is chased across Europe in the company of a charming German waif (Ms. Potente) by his employers. There are espionage writers who use the genre to explore the complexities of geopolitics, but Robert Ludlum, on whose novel this competent, enjoyable picture is based, was not one of them. At a time when thrillers are shadowed by real-world anxieties, the implausibility of this movie, which amusingly imagines the C.I.A. as a virtually omniscient operation, comes as something of a relief. Mr. Damon handles his character's existential crisis with fierce adroitness, and Mr. Liman's direction has an old-fashioned swiftness and efficiency (A. O. Scott).

"THE CROCODILE HUNTER: COLLISION COURSE," starring Steve Irwin. Directed by John Stainton (PG, 90 minutes). In addition to the crocodiles that are his specialty, the irrepressible Mr. Irwin, an Australian naturalist whose hyperactivity has made him a star of American cable television, wrangles poisonous snakes and fanged spiders. His shenanigans, during which he addresses the audience in his trademark Down Under idioms ("crikey!," "have a go at that!"), are bundled into a ludicrous, amusing story of international intrigue involving a spy satellite, an ornery Queensland rancher and a pair of C.I.A. operatives whom Mr. Irwin treats as another peculiar species of wildlife. Though Mr. Irwin's antic good spirits can be annoying (one occasionally envies the reptiles' inability to hear), they can also be very funny. Whether you're laughing at him or with him, you will find yourself laughing a lot (Scott).

"K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER," starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow (PG-13, 138 minutes). Mr. Neeson and Mr. Ford play Soviet naval officers wrestling for control of a nuclear submarine -- with each other, and with the vessel itself, a malevolent embodiment of totalitarian hubris and bureaucratic incompetence. Ms. Bigelow, one of the best pure action directors around, turns a sturdy, conventional script -- a hybrid of "Alien" and "Mutiny on the Bounty," with many nods to submarine movies of the past -- into a swift, tense drama of dueling egos and mechanical catastrophe. After a while, you barely notice Mr. Ford's Russian accent (Scott).

"LIKE MIKE," starring Bow Wow, Eugene Levy and Morris Chestnut. Directed by John Schultz (PG, 100 minutes). A 13-year-old orphan named Calvin (Bow Wow) turns around the fictional Los Angeles Knights pro basketball team, courtesy of a pair of magic sneakers that he finds. Calvin's new powers are observed when he wins a chance to shoot against a spoiled N.B.A. star during a halftime stunt. Naturally, he's asked to join the team. The successful kid rapper Bow Wow is a talented actor whose boyish eagerness here is a marked contrast to his taciturn rappadocio. The director's breezy steadiness keeps the movie from hitting us over the head -- well, not too hard, anyway, no small feat since the steroid-juiced sentimentality of the ending may force some to flee before the outtakes unspool under the credits (Elvis Mitchell).

* "LILO AND STITCH," with the voices of Chris Sanders and Daveigh Chase. Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois (PG, 89 minutes). In this charming exercise in intergalactic multiculturalism, Stitch, the snaggle-toothed, ill-behaved result of an alien genetic experiment, crashes to Earth, where he is adopted by a young Hawaiian girl named Lilo. The pair must contend with extraterrestrial law enforcement and a nosy earth-bound social worker, and their triumph over these adversities involves the usual Disney blend of comic anarchy, musical numbers and heart-tugging sentimentality. The movie's family relationships are addressed with low-key realism, and the animation has a lovely, gentle precision, with plenty of room for visual comedy but less of the noise and chaos that have become the hallmarks of 3-D animation. This movie suggests that the old-fashioned, flat, painted kind of animation still has much to offer (Scott).

* "LOVELY AND AMAZING," starring Catherine Keener, Brenda Blethyn, Dermot Mulroney and Emily Mortimer. Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener (R, 91 minutes). This smart, acidic comedy by the director of "Walking and Talking" could be described as a West Coast answer to "Sex and the City," minus that series' high-gloss glamour and erotic joie de vivre. Ms. Keener and Ms. Mortimer are sisters, both attractive and in their 30's, who have major self-esteem problems and poor taste in men. Ms. Blethyn is their vain mother who develops complications after liposuction. The movie zeroes in on contemporary narcissism with a relentless, needling accuracy that illustrates exactly the way some people allow their insecurities to poison their intimate relationships. But once it has limned its characters (Ms. Keener's is by far the most vivid), it doesn't go anywhere in particular (Stephen Holden).

"MEN IN BLACK II," starring Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Lara Flynn Boyle, Rip Torn, Rosario Dawson and Tony Shalhoub. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 82 minutes). If your memory of the first one is a little hazy, don't worry: that was the point all along. And, in any case, this sequel provides the same pleasant, pointless mixture of whimsy and kineticism. Of course, like the "Ghostbusters" and "Austin Powers" sequels (to give only two out of several thousand possible examples), the fun has diminished because the novelty has worn off. Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones coast along, joined by Mr. Torn and Mr. Shalhoub (and a talking bulldog) from "Men in Black," and a host of creepy, scaly, funny aliens, including Ms. Boyle, her icy charms enhanced by hundreds of slimy tentacles and an extendable green tongue (Scott).

* "METROPOLIS," starring Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Gustav Frohlich and Brigitte Helm. Directed by Fritz Lang (not rated, 120 minutes). Lang's silent modernist fever dream -- a nightmarish grand opera of romantic love, alienated labor and technological power -- is one of the most studied and imitated films of all time, and has been reissued many times. Except for a brief theatrical run in 1927, though, the movie as Lang made it has never been seen. This latest version, the result of a four-year restoration project using archival materials and new digital techniques, may not be the director's cut, but it is as definitive a "Metropolis" as we are likely to see. The new 35-millimeter print is beautiful, the score has been newly recorded, and Lang's swirling, visionary stew of Christian symbolism, Expressionist set design and political anxiety is more grand and troubling than ever (Scott).

"MINORITY REPORT," starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). This atmospheric new thriller is a muscular and dense exercise of skill and verve. (Ironically, this exercise may be the most adult film that Mr. Spielberg has made in some time; it's about the bloody blurring of passion and violence -- a compassionate noir.) In 2054, a law enforcement unit called Pre-Crime exists to stop murders before they begin; three Pre-Cogs -- beings who float in a nutrient-rich fluid -- can predict when a crime will be committed and know the identity of the perpetrator. When the unit's chief, John Anderton, is accused of a crime he hasn't yet committed, he's soon on the run. Mr. Cruise does as much sprinting in this picture as he has in his entire filmography. The fluid bursts of quick-cut images seen on the monitors also show that Mr. Spielberg isn't about to be shown up by those quick-fingered, compulsively exhibitionistic upstarts like David Fincher. With "Minority Report" he toys with the idea that there's more -- and less -- to Mr. Cruise than meets the eye and says we shouldn't trust our eyes anyway. But doesn't he always? (Mitchell).

"MR. DEEDS," starring Adam Sandler and Winona Ryder. Directed by Steven Brill (PG-13, 91 minutes). It could be said that the remake of Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," starring Mr. Sandler in the title role, is redundant, since the actor has been remaking Capraesque movies for most of his career. As in Capra's original 1936 classic, Longfellow Deeds still lives in Mandrake Falls, is an aspiring greeting-card poet and has no patience for pretension. And once again, he is left a fortune by a distant relative: adjusted for inflation, the amount is $40 billion instead of $20 million. He's taken to New York, where he'll presumably be enticed by the city. Mr. Sandler's films are always about the arrogant getting a deserved comeuppance at the hands of humbler types, but this is the first time he seems a little smug himself. "Mr. Deeds" has him rehashing a role he has performed so many times before he could be doing this picture in his sleep. The result is likely to be that he'll put audiences to sleep (Mitchell).

* "ROAD TO PERDITION," starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 119 minutes). This solemn, rain-washed period gangster film based on a graphic novel is a cool but stately work that achieves the grandeur of a classic Hollywood western. An exploration of father-son relationships viewed largely through the eyes of a 12-year-old boy, it follows the fugitive journey of Michael Sullivan (Mr. Hanks), a hit man for the mob outside Chicago, who flees the wrath of the middle-level boss (Mr. Newman) who is also his surrogate father. Filled with memorable tableaus, the movie is a serious picture show whose cinematography by Conrad L. Hall lends every frame an Edward Hopper-like mood. Mr. Newman (with an Irish brogue) steals the movie as Rooney, the mob boss faced with agonizing life-and-death choices. Mr. Hanks holds his own as the movie's enigmatic antihero on a vengeful mission: a killer-for-hire with a social conscience and a devotion to his young son (Holden).

"SCOOBY-DOO," starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG, 105 minutes). The old Hanna-Barbera cartoon was cheap, silly and occasionally charming in its blithe stupidity. This adaptation, combining live action with 3-D computer-generated animation, looks pretty expensive, and its stupidity is, for the most part, charmless. The human cast -- Mr. Prinze, especially -- does a good-humored job of sending up and paying homage to the old show, but its efforts are overwhelmed by a relentless pop music score, hideous special effects and a plot that violates all the rules of the old series for no good reason (Scott).

* "STUART LITTLE 2," with Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie and the voices of Michael J. Fox, Melanie Griffith and Nathan Lane. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 72 minutes). Determinedly un-hip and utterly engaging, the sequel to "Stuart Little" (based on E. B. White's classic children's book) is even better than the original. Once again, the blend of live action and animation is virtually seamless. The characters are more sharply drawn than before, the newest addition being a duplicitous jewel-thieving bird (voice of Ms. Griffith) under the thumb of an evil falcon (James Woods). The role of the spoiled family housecat Snowbell (Mr. Lane) has been beefed up, and Mr. Lane turns the character's every peevish complaint into an amusing comic barb. The zesty action sequences find Stuart tooling wildly around New York and doing battle with the falcon in a model airplane. This is one family film franchise that respects the innocence of childhood without becoming saccharine (Holden).

* "SUNSHINE STATE," starring Edie Falco, Angela Bassett, Mary Alice, Mary Steenburgen and Timothy Hutton. Written and directed by John Sayles (PG-13; 141 minutes). Mr. Sayles's panoramic exploration of life in Delrona Beach, a fictional Florida coastal town in the throes of development, is as rich and even-handed a mosaic of American life as any filmmaker has brought to the screen. The overlapping stories revolve around two families, one white, the other black, who are being pressured to sell their property to greedy developers. Among more than a dozen characters who cross paths in the course of the story, the most compelling are Marly Temple (Ms. Falco), a sardonic young woman who runs her family's motel, and Desiree Perry (Ms. Bassett), a former teenage rebel who returns after a 25-year absence to confront her straitlaced mother (Ms. Alice). More than a probing civics lesson, the movie takes the political and spiritual pulse of our restless national psyche (Holden).

* "TADPOLE," starring Sigourney Weaver, Aaron Stanford, John Ritter and Bebe Neuwirth. Directed by Gary Winick (PG-13, 77 minutes). At its most evocative, this fragile wisp of a movie with its moody, hothouse New York atmosphere suggests a contemporary descendant of "The Catcher in the Rye." Its protagonist (Mr. Stanford) is an intellectually precocious 15-year-old preppie who fancies himself in love with his 40-something stepmother (Ms. Weaver), who is unaware of his passion. A casual sexual encounter with her best friend (Ms. Neuwirth) over Thanksgiving break leads to an attempted cover-up that resembles a sophisticated French farce. Ms. Neuwirth practically steals the movie as the kindhearted but libidinous chiropractor with whom he enjoys a one-night stand. For all its delicate charms, the movie, shot in two weeks, is ragged around the edges and has a slack cynical ending (Holden).

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Star Digs: Living Like Mick

BYLINE:  By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
WANT to sleep in Mick Jagger's bed? No problem. Yes, the rich are different from you and me: they're cheaper. Rather than let their splendid houses in paradise sit empty when they aren't using them, some celebrities prefer to rent them out, offering dream vacations to total strangers (or at least those with five-figure vacation budgets).
 Ordinary mortals can now frolic in private redoubts once reserved exclusively for those anointed with fame and outrageous fortune. Among the mansions currently available are those belonging to Randy Travis, Jane Seymour, Merv Griffin and -- oh, yes -- Charo. 
 Charo, who bills herself as "the original cuchi-cuchi girl," may not have much of a career anymore, but she has a really, really oversize seven-bedroom spread on spectacular Tunnel's Beach, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, where "Jurassic Park" and "South Pacific" were filmed. Prices begin at $7,700 a week. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Jagger's Mustique retreat -- a Japanese-style six-bedroom oceanfront villa with a rambling koi pond and a series of pavilions connected by a raised walkway -- goes for $13,000 to $16,000 a week. 
The "rent a celebrity villa" trend, which began in the roaring 90's and seems to be weathering the current economic slump, is a logical (and for celebrities, lucrative) outgrowth of the American obsession with the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Even Robin Leach himself latched onto the trend for a while: his Villa Golden Dreams, an opulent three-acre, 8,500-square-foot compound on Jumby Bay Island, just north of Antigua, fetched $5,000 to $6,400 a day. He recently sold it, but the house is supposed to be back on the rental market in November. 
Voyeurism is undoubtedly part of the allure. Fans are willing to pay a premium for the chance to feel as if they are mixing with celebrities, even if the celebrities themselves are nowhere to be seen.
"There's no greater feeling than vacationing in their idol's home," said Alfredo Merat, the president of Overseas Connection Inc., which rents eight celebrity houses. "It makes for a very exciting time."
Celebrity vacation villas are listed on Web sites like unusualvillarentals.com,islandoutpost.com and villasoftheworld.com, which is run by Overseas Connection. 
Why should you think about shelling out for a celebrity villa? To begin with, they almost always offer three things that famous people crave: luxury, security and, most of all, privacy. Mick Jagger's villa is completely secluded -- bamboo screens and lush vegetation fend off sightseers and paparazzi. And it comes with his private Jeep and a staff of six. 
To put the prices in some perspective, for large groups, the per-person cost of a celebrity rental can work out to the equivalent of staying at a Four Seasons or a Ritz-Carlton.
Naturally, for some, these properties offer tremendous cachet and intrigue, enmeshed, as they are, in the personal histories of their owners. "I've stayed in houses all over the world, and it impressed me that Mick's looked just like it does when he's there," said a businessman who has rented the Mustique villa twice. He asked that his name not be used, because, he explained, "I want to go back there, and I don't want to make him mad."
Mr. Jagger, it turns out, is very particular about who stays at his villa. "He's a little picky," said Mr. Merat of Overseas Connection, which lists the villa. "Clients must apply for the right to rent his property with a detailed description of the party, number of people, names and occupations." 
Mr. Jagger personally reviews each application, Mr. Merat said, "and then a fax comes back saying either yes or no without explanation."
Mr. Jagger is obviously no fool: fellow rock stars almost never make the grade, Mr. Merat said, for fear that they will destroy the house. "He's a bright business guy," he added. 
Mr. Jagger has good reason for caution. His villa, like most other celebrity homes for rent, is filled with his family's personal belongings. "They don't change anything," the businessman said. "It's not new or sanitized, with all personal items removed, like other rentals. It looks like they were there the day before, with family pictures and mementos from Mick's career, and even a Christmas tree in the closet."
Luxury reigns chez Jagger. After all, the owner has gone from his bad-boy rock 'n' roll days to being knighted by the queen. On request, the staff is happy to prepare a luxurious picnic, served on adjacent Macaroni Beach, complete with flatware, crystal, cut flowers, Champagne and lobster. "It's like you're at a London dinner party," the businessman said. 
In some homes, cachet comes in the form of history. Jane Seymour's 11-bedroom English manor house, St. Catherine's Court, near Bath, dates from A.D. 950 and once housed Henry VIII's mistress, Ms. Seymour said, and their daughter. Surrounded by 14 acres, with gardens, tennis court, orangery, croquet lawn, Victorian plunge pool and medieval church, the house is available for $23,000 a week. 
Ms. Seymour said that she and her family stay at St. Catherine's Court twice a year, and her photographs, paintings and other personal touches are found everywhere.
"It's a very personal home," Ms. Seymour said. "It's not a hotel and will never be a hotel."
History of a different sort comes with Merv Griffin's 45-acre estate in County Galway, Ireland: it used to belong to John Huston. Now a 12-room hotel, it can also be rented out in its entirety for $20,000 to $30,000 a week, depending on the season. 
IAN FLEMING'S Jamaica estate, Goldeneye, was also a place where Hollywood royalty dropped in, along with a famous neighbor, Sir Noel Coward. The rambling compound, where Fleming wrote his James Bond thrillers, has a three-bedroom house and four smaller villas on a private beach in Oracabessa. The design is Indonesian, the furnishings include the author's desk, and there's a seawater swimming canal. The cost ranges from $42,000 to $80,500 a week. Individual villas are sometimes available, starting at $1,000 a night. 
Goldeneye is now part of the Island Outpost hotel and villa chain owned by Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, and his partners. "Fleming built a gazebo, away from the house, where he could write," said Mr. Blackwell, who grew up on the island, knew the author and bought the estate in 1976. "During the Suez crisis, Sir Anthony Eden, the prime minister, was visiting, and that gazebo became the headquarters of the British government for one day." 
Later, scenes for "Dr. No" were shot near James Bond Beach, which adjoins the property. Later still, Bob Marley, who recorded for Island Records, stayed at Goldeneye. So did Harrison Ford and Sting, who wrote "Every Breath You Take" while there, Mr. Blackwell said. 
"It's very private, like having a whole section of Jamaica to yourself," said Kevin Haasarud, the executive director of HBO Films Comedy Institute, who stayed at Goldeneye while scouting locations for a writers' retreat. "It has an ethos. It conjures up all kinds of things that are very romantic and enticing. It's an A-list destination for those interested in Hollywood lore."
(A celebrity gloss also covers Mr. Blackwell's other property, Cuckoo's Nest, a spectacular five-bedroom, three-level house with mountain views in Sundance, Utah. It rents for $1,500 to $3,500 a night.) 
For the ultimate in luxury, isolation and price, few places beat the big house on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. This private 74-acre island is owned by Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group of companies.
There are 12 bedrooms, 2 freshwater pools, 2 whirlpools, beaches with beach huts and barbecue grills, a lighted tennis court, windsurfers, sailing dinghies, motor launches and a helicopter landing pad. The price, a whopping $120,000 to $141,000 a week, includes all meals and drinks and a staff of 22. 
A bit more modest are the rentals offered by Randy Travis, the country singer, and his wife, Elizabeth. They rent out two houses on Maui. The larger, a Polynesian-style seven-bedroom villa in Lahaina, has some of the star's platinum records on the walls and goes for $9,000 to $12,000 a week. 
The Travises live in the historic district of Santa Fe, N.M., in one of three houses they own in the area. The smallest house is for rent now, and the house they live in will be -- just as soon as they move out. 
"We're leaving lots of the stuff we now use, and lots of personal touches," said Ms. Travis, her husband's manager. "It's special, because we're trying to make a really homey, comfy feeling."
Mr. Travis said he felt so inspired in his Santa Fe digs that he once wrote seven songs in two days, working with a partner in his custom-made gym-and-office lair.
"When we rent this property," he said, "I'm putting police tape around that area, and nobody but me and whoever wants to write can get in."

Of Course, Fame Carries a Price Tag
CELEBRITY villas are available during many periods throughout the year, though Christmas and midsummer can be difficult times to find a place. Book well in advance.
For most houses, a nonrefundable 50 percent deposit is due at the time of reservation. The balance, plus a refundable security deposit, are due about eight weeks before you go. Because reservations are noncancelable, "we urge clients to take out cancellation insurance," said Alfredo Merat, the president of Overseas Connection Inc. He said his company would work with clients who must change their dates "by trying to rerent the property, in which case we refund all but 25 percent, but we can never guarantee it."
 Most properties include maid, pool and ground service, while other staff and food costs are usually extra, Mr. Merat said. DAVID KIRBY

HEADLINE: Wall Street In Suburbia? A Bad Idea, Mayor Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that talk of moving some of the New York Stock Exchange's operations from Wall Street to Westchester made little business sense and would play into the hands of the terrorists who attacked Lower Manhattan. 
 "I think that you don't want to let the terrorists win," Mr. Bloomberg said during a trip to Puerto Rico. "The terrorists are trying to force people out of Lower Manhattan" and to hurt businesses and the economy, he said. "We just are not going to let the terrorists win. They've done enough damage." 
 The mayor was reacting to reports that the New York Stock Exchange, which was shut for several days after the attack on Sept. 11, was considering moving some of its operations to a new trading floor away from its historic home on Wall Street to another location, possibly Westchester County, in the metropolitan area. 
Mr. Bloomberg said that if the exchange wanted to open a second trading floor, sites in Brooklyn or Queens "make an awful lot more sense from a business point of view." The mayor said that "the best and the brightest" want to live in the city, and that transportation between two trading sites would be much easier if both were in the city.
Officials at the stock exchange declined to respond to the mayor's remarks.
Word that the stock exchange was considering a move of some of its operations came as a deal with the city to build a new trading complex and office tower downtown was unraveling.
In 1998, city and state officials agreed to provide more than $1 billion in land, cash, tax breaks and other subsidies for the new complex for the exchange. But after Mr. Bloomberg took office, his administration signaled that the city could no longer afford the package. 
Some city officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggested that by floating the idea of moving elsewhere, the exchange was trying to pressure the city for more concessions. Exchange officials denied the accusation. 
"That's ludicrous," said Robert Zito, an executive vice president for communications at the stock exchange.

HEADLINE: Bush Urges a Cap on Medical Liability 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C., July 25 

 BODY:
With doctors complaining about rising malpractice insurance premiums, President Bush called today for a major overhaul of the nation's medical liability system, including legislation to cap compensation for pain and suffering at $250,000 in successful malpractice suits.
 "Health care costs are up because docs are worried about getting sued," the president told an audience of 1,700 health care professionals in a sweltering gymnasium at High Point University here. 
 Mr. Bush declared the liability system "broken and riddled with bad, bad law." 
One reason Mr. Bush traveled to North Carolina was to attend an evening fund-raiser in Greensboro for Elizabeth Dole, the Republican candidate for the Senate. Mrs. Dole is "constantly breaking what they call the glass ceiling," he said. 
White House aides said the president expected to help raise $750,000 for Mrs. Dole and the state and national Republican Parties.
The trip put Mr. Bush squarely on the home turf of a potential political rival in 2004, Senator John Edwards, a Democrat who became wealthy as a medical malpractice lawyer.
In a telephone conference call with reporters, Mr. Edwards said today: "I spent most of my life before I came to the Senate fighting for kids and families against insurance companies, and I think that's the right side to be on. If the president wants to be on the side of the insurance companies, we'll let him do that."
Medical malpractice awards have been a perennial issue in the health care debate, with many Republicans and the health insurance industry arguing that until doctors receive protection from lawsuits, they will continue ordering expensive tests and unnecessary procedures that drive up costs. Mr. Bush echoed that argument today, saying too many doctors are practicing "defensive medicine."
Democrats and trial lawyers have traditionally resisted changing the law, saying patients need legal recourse when they are injured. Today, Mary E. Alexander, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, accused Mr. Bush of favoring the insurance industry, which has contributed to his political campaigns.
"Instead of giving speeches to reward insurers," Ms. Alexander said, "he should change his economic policies, which are devastating the working families of America."
Typically, states set their own malpractice guidelines, and Mr. Bush is ordinarily a strong defender of states' rights. But he said in his speech today that the federal government needed to set standards, and he cited estimates that malpractice awards drive up the cost of government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, by more than $25 billion a year.
"It's a national problem that requires a national solution," Mr. Bush said, calling on Congress to enact legislation by late fall.
Anticipating the president's speech, the Department of Health and Human Services released a report on Wednesday that said the cost of malpractice insurance for specialists had risen more than 10 percent in recent years.
Besides caps on awards, the White House wants the legislation to include provisions for payments over time, rather than in lump sums, and for juries to be informed if patients have other sources of compensation for an injury. The president also wants to prohibit cases from being brought years after an injury.
The White House malpractice initiative comes at a time when health economists and ordinary Americans are growing increasingly concerned about the rising cost of health care. The White House is also backing a Republican plan to offer a prescription drug benefit to the elderly, and it has called for tax credits of $1,000 for individuals and as much as $3,000 for families to help the uninsured buy private medical coverage.
But the prescription drug plan is in trouble in the Senate, and the tax credit plan has received a lukewarm reception from Democrats in Congress, as well as from consumer groups.
One group, Families USA, was also critical of the malpractice plan today. Ron Pollack, its president, called the initiative an "unfortunate diversion from the most important health issues facing our country -- expanded health coverage for the uninsured and recently unemployed, prescription drug coverage for seniors and patients' rights legislation."
The president spoke this afternoon after visiting nearby High Point Hospital, where he met privately with a number of doctors and patients, including some from other states, notably Nevada, which has been particularly hard hit by rising malpractice insurance premiums.
Dr. Shelby Wilbourn, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Las Vegas, told the president that he was leaving his practice because his premiums jumped to $108,000 this year, from $33,000.
In an interview with reporters after the president's speech, Dr. Wilbourn, 41, said he was moving to a rural area in Maine, where he might not earn as much but would pay just $9,800 a year for insurance in his first year in practice.
"I would strongly advise women in Las Vegas now not to get pregnant," he said, "because trying to find an obstetrician is very difficult."
To underscore the point, the White House also invited Jill Barnes of Henderson, Nev., who is eight weeks pregnant and has been unable to find an obstetrician in Nevada. Ms. Barnes says she drives an hour and a half to Arizona for her medical care.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Microsoft to Step Up Spending and Hiring

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., July 25 

 BODY:
Shrugging off a deep recession in the technology industry that has beset its competitors, Microsoft said today that it planned to accelerate its investment in research and development and increase its work force.
 At a daylong meeting for financial analysts, Bill Gates, the chairman and chief software architect, said that Microsoft would increase its investment in new software and hardware technologies almost 20 percent in the fiscal year 2003, raising its spending to $5.2 billion, from $4.3 billion. At the same time, the company plans to add 5,000 workers to its force of 50,000. In its last fiscal year, it added almost 3,000. 
 "We have a lot of belief in the things we're doing, both in terms of growing the markets we're in and growing share in the markets we're in," Mr. Gates said.
The company is as strong as or stronger than all competitors in its key markets, he added. But he said he was concerned about the Global Services division at I.B.M. and the Linux operating system, both of which have significant momentum.
"I.B.M. in Global Services has a strong asset, and they've managed to get Websphere out," he said, referring to the company's foray in the Web-based services market. Microsoft is trying to become a player in the corporate computing market with its .Net (pronounced dot-net) initiative, though analysts say it is trailing I.B.M., which has giant reach in the corporate marketplace and has adopted the Linux system.
Mr. Gates, who outlined the company's strategic direction yesterday at a similar meeting for industry analysts, repeated Microsoft's mantra today about the importance of a software data format protocol known as XML, or extensible markup language. Microsoft is redesigning all its products to embed the format.
Moreover, in a significant departure from reliance on its programming languages to tie software developers to its Windows operating system, Mr. Gates said the company had come to realize, along with the computer industry, that programming languages were no longer as important as the XML format.
Shares of Microsoft fell $3.40, to $42.83, today. The stock had touched a 12-month low earlier in the week.
Microsoft's chief financial officer, John G. Connors, sketched out the new financial reporting breakdown that the company plans to give its investors beginning next fall. For the first time, it will break financial results into seven businesses: desktop operating systems; knowledge workers; MSN; home and entertainment; mobility software; servers and programming tools; and business applications. "What the company is really going through is a significant diversification and a significant transformation," he said.
Mr. Connors said he expected all major businesses at Microsoft to grow in the next year, ranging from a rise of 7 to 8 percent in its desktop operating system business to a leap of 76 to 92 percent in its smaller business applications segment. Over all, he said that revenue in 2003 would climb 11 to 13 percent and that operating income would rise 6 to 8 percent.
In his talk, Mr. Gates commented briefly on Microsoft's agreement with the Justice Department in its antitrust case and its continuing legal entanglement with nine states dissenting from the agreement.
"We were very pleased to have our settlement with U.S. Justice," he said, adding that with respect to the continuing appeal of the nine states, "We're awaiting the decision, and we're hoping it will come out the same way we settled with the D.O.J."
Mr. Gates briefly acknowledged the company's failed investment in the market for interactive television but insisted that its business model was fundamentally sound. Commenting on the increasingly contentious issue of how to account for stock options in technology companies, he noted that neither he nor Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive -- two of the world's richest men -- had ever taken stock options.
"Our interests overwhelmingly are the same interests that are the interests of the shareholders," he said.
The company also said today that it expected to do better in the market for mobile wireless devices than in the cable business, where its software efforts have been largely ignored.
Although its cellular data phones are just now becoming available commercially, Microsoft has 31 companies manufacturing portable hardware based on Microsoft's software, and the company has announced alliances with 12 service operators in the cellular phone business.
Industry analysts have criticized Microsoft's mobile-phone products for their relatively high cost and short battery life.

HEADLINE: In Palestinian Children, Signs of Increasing Malnutrition 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Friday, July 26 

 BODY:
A study under way for the United States Agency for International Development is finding that malnutrition among Palestinian children in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has increased substantially during the conflict with Israel, according to diplomats and government officials knowledgeable about the survey.
 Preliminary results of the study, which is due to be finished and released in 10 days, are causing alarm within the Israeli government and the Bush administration, which has been pressuring Israel to alleviate Palestinian suffering. 
 One senior Israeli official said that Israel had learned through diplomatic channels of two forthcoming American studies detailing a rise in malnutrition.
"This is going to be disastrous for Israel," the official said. The Israeli government, already anticipating international criticism over conditions among Palestinians, has recently stepped up talks with Palestinian representatives to address the needs of those in the West Bank. 
At the urging of the Bush administration, the Israelis have shelved a demand that the Americans supervise any transfer to Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority of Palestinian tax revenue that Israel has withheld during the conflict, Israeli officials said on Thursday. Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said that Israel would begin transferring part of the money to the Palestinian Authority next week.
The shift came as Israeli officials engaged in a third day of damage control over the decision to drop a one-ton bomb into a densely populated neighborhood in Gaza City on Tuesday morning. The bomb killed its intended target, a leader of the militant group Hamas, but it also killed at least 14 other people, including 9 children.
As Israel braced for threatened Palestinian retaliation, Mr. Peres warned on Thursday that civilians might pay for the strike.
"I know that this is a serious escalation, and I am really afraid that innocent people on both sides will pay a high price," Mr. Peres told Israel's Army Radio.
Israeli ground forces have seized control of seven of eight major Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank and have imposed 24-hour curfews that they lift only intermittently. Israel started the military operation after back-to-back suicide bombings a month ago in Jerusalem, and political and military officials have said they have no choice but to retain this grip on the West Bank until the threat of Palestinian violence ends.
Few Palestinians can leave their homes to work, and the costs and difficulties of transporting goods have become prohibitive, aid workers say.
The Israeli government is concerned that international criticism will grow as the crisis in the West Bank and Gaza deepens. It has recently made it somewhat easier for international aid groups to distribute food, diplomats here said.
The preliminary results of the Agency for International Development malnutrition survey have been widely discussed in diplomatic and aid donor circles here. Palestinian officials have also learned of the results, and some of the early findings have been posted on a Palestinian Web site, www.miftah.org.
American, Israeli and Palestinian officials, as well as European diplomats who were briefed about the survey, said they expected the final study to show a substantial increase in malnutrition.
The survey, conducted by Johns Hopkins University on contract with the agency, is of 1,000 households in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The preliminary results were based on about a third of that sample, one diplomat here said. 
The preliminary results overstate the current findings of the survey, according to Western diplomats who have seen more recent conclusions. The preliminary findings indicated that 30 percent of children were suffering from chronic malnutrition, and another 21 percent from acute malnutrition, said diplomats who were briefed on the results.
As the researchers broadened their study to the bigger sample, those numbers declined. But the figures continue to show a substantial rise in malnutrition, according to people familiar with the survey. 
Two years ago, a survey done for the same agency that was described by diplomats as somewhat less rigorous found that 7 percent of Palestinian children were chronically malnourished and 2.5 percent were acutely malnourished. 
Officials of the Agency for International Development declined to discuss the findings. "We can't substantiate any numbers until August 5," said Gina Benevento, the press officer for the agency in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, referring to the study's scheduled release date.
The Israeli military operation has presented the government with a dilemma, Israeli officials said. While it wants to remain at least for now in the West Bank, the government does not want to shoulder the costly burden of supplying services to the Palestinians, as it did before the Oslo agreement created limited Palestinian self-rule. For Israel to supply food, one Israeli official said, would be to start down that road.
"We've been there," the official said. "So the dilemma here is between the security and need."
In all, Israel has withheld about $600 million in Palestinian tax revenue during the 22-month conflict, arguing that the money might be used to finance terrorism. Under the terms of the Oslo peace accords, Israel is supposed to transfer the money, amassed from customs duties, value-added taxes, and other fees, to the Palestinian Authority. 
Israeli officials said they intend to hand over tax revenues worth about $42.3 million. A first payment of about $14.8 million is likely to be made next week, they said.
In addition, Israeli officials said that they would use about $29.6 million of the Palestinian tax revenue to cover Palestinian debts to Israel for electricity, water, medical care and other services. 
Israeli officials said that while the Bush administration is pressing them to ease the plight of average Palestinians, it is making no demands for a return to political negotiations. In a speech a month ago, President Bush endorsed the condition of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel that Mr. Arafat be replaced as Palestinian leader before substantive negotiations resume.
Early today Israeli troops and armored vehicles moved into Gaza, according to residents, who said the soldiers were firing machine guns. The Israeli Army had no comment.
On Thursday morning, an Israeli settler was shot and killed while driving through the West Bank, in an attack claimed by two militant groups. A rescue worker said that the gunmen continued firing at rescue crews as they arrived at the scene. The victim was identified as Rabbi Elimelech Shapira, a 43-year-old father of eight. Another person was seriously injured in the attack.
Separately, an Israeli policeman, also a West Bank settler, was arrested on suspicion of selling ammunition to Palestinians, bringing to seven the number of Israelis detained in the case. 
The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, accused Mr. Sharon on Thursday of trying to sabotage peace efforts by approving the airstrike Tuesday.
"It shows the Israeli prime minister was probably not happy with these initiatives and efforts and said, 'I will go ahead with this strike to sabotage these efforts,' " Mr. Mubarak told reporters in Paris.
Palestinian officials and European diplomats say that a Palestinian cease-fire was in the works when Israel sent an American-made F-16 fighter over Gaza City to kill the militant leader. Israeli officials said that they knew of negotiations among Palestinians toward a cease-fire, but had dismissed them as the hopeless work of well-meaning people with no influence over terrorist groups.
There were clashing accounts in the Israeli news media over who was at fault for what the government has described as faulty intelligence that buildings around the blast site were not inhabited. Eleven of the 15 people killed in the bombing were in neighboring buildings. More than 140 people were injured, Palestinian officials said.
Israeli officials continued to add details to the threat to Israelis they said was posed by Sheik Salah Shehada, the air raid's target and a founder of the paramilitary wing of Hamas.
"Shehada was busy planning a mega-attack involving a truck with hundreds of kilograms of explosives, something that would have jolted the Israeli people, causing hundreds of deaths," said Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the Israeli defense minister. On Tuesday, after the bombing, a senior military official said that Mr. Shehada was preparing to blow up a bridge used by settlers in Gaza, to dispatch a boat filled with explosives to a bathing beach, to send a bomber to a mall, and to order shooting attacks at Israeli settlements.

The Hershey Foods Corporation said yesterday that it would put itself up for sale, stunning the quiet, insular town it almost single-handedly created and startling a financial community anticipating that this American icon could end up in European hands. 
 With tears in his eyes, Richard H. Lenny, the company's cost-cutting chief executive whose clashes with workers erupted into a six-week strike this year, gathered employees at 9 a.m. to break the news and assure them that it was not his doing. 
 Rather, the decision came from the Hershey Trust Company, the philanthropic entity that controls the chocolate maker and was set up almost 100 years ago by Milton S. Hershey to look after the community's poorest children long after he had gone. 
"We were shocked," said Dennis Bomberger, a business agent for the Chocolate Workers Local 464, the workers' union. "We always thought the trust would keep Hershey Foods forever. It's always been a Hershey town." 
Even to the cheerleaders of consolidation on Wall Street, putting Hershey on the auction block seemed out of character for a company so tied to the Pennsylvania community that bears its name. 
Beyond its kiss-shaped lampposts and streets named Chocolate and Cocoa Avenues, the town's schools, houses, gardens and theater all carry the imprint of Mr. Hershey's charitable legacy, having been paid for with his profits. 
Many presumed that the trust existed solely to perpetuate Mr. Hershey's grand social experiment, lending an air of disbelief that the trust could ultimately be the one to unravel one of the nation's last surviving company towns. 
"Milton Hershey must be rolling over in his grave," said John M. McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. "He believed very strongly in the community of Hershey, in protecting it. I'm all for food industry consolidation, but this one surprised me."
But the trust says its sole charge is the preservation of the Milton Hershey School, an institution that opened in 1909 for orphaned white boys and currently serves 1,200 students of every race and both sexes from kindergarten through high school. Its endowment is $5.4 billion, before the sale, eclipsing most major universities. 
"Wow, that's a lot of money," said Michael L. Ross, the chief investment officer for Stanford's $8 billion endowment, noting that some of the largest endowments are no more than $2 billion. "That is mind boggling for a K-12." 
With the stock market reeling, the trust described a sale, as reported in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, as the surest way of safeguarding its assets in case the company's fortunes ever turn.
Shares of Hershey soared on the news, jumping more than 25 percent, or $15.80, to close at $78.30.
"Frankly, we don't know what Milton Hershey might have done," said Robert C. Vowler, the chief executive of the trust, which owns 76 percent of the company's voting stock. "All we can do is look at what he did in his lifetime. He built companies and sold them. Our responsibility is to perpetuate the school, not the company. That is the fundamental reason we are doing what we are doing." 
The announcement comes during a second wave of acquisitions in the food business, even though the industry has already been whittled down to a smattering of global players in the last two years.
Taking off at a feverish pace in the closing half of 2000, only to slow precipitously within a year, the consolidation frenzy led to Unilever's buying Bestfoods, Philip Morris's snatching Nabisco, General Mills' swallowing Pillsbury, Kellogg's taking over Keebler and PepsiCo's seizing of Quaker Oats, leaving Hershey as one of the few bystanders in what seemed like an inevitable trend.
Despite the many pairings that have already occurred, few expect a name as recognizable as Hershey to have difficulty enticing buyers. An auction could bring in $10 billion or more, analysts estimated, making it one of the largest sales in the industry. 
"Hershey is clearly one of the jewels left in the food industry," said Romitha Mally, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
Suitors would probably include at least one American company, Kraft Foods Inc., and no less than two European contenders, Cadbury Schweppes and Nestle, both of which have large stakes in the candy business overseas and a small enough presence in the United States to win approval from the Federal Trade Commission. 
Rather than simply accepting the highest offer, the trust said that it was looking for a buyer willing to keep the company's headquarters in Hershey, instead of just scooping up brands like Payday and Reese's before closing up shop there. 
In so doing, the trust said it hoped to keep the town's relationship with the company much as it has been for the last 100 years, more or less. 
"The economics of the region could be impacted severely if things do not go the way the trust would like to see them go," said August Memmi Jr., chairman of the Board of Supervisors in the Township of Derry, the official name of the city where Hershey is situated. The company employs at least 13,000 people in the town of no more than 22,000, Mr. Memmi said, making for obvious repercussions if a buyer ultimately decides to look elsewhere for its corporate headquarters. "That could affect everyone's pocket book."
Bristling at the suggestion that it has overlooked its social obligations, the trust said it was simply acting while it still could. Since the mid-1980's, when Hershey stock represented more than 80 percent of its assets, the trust has been weaning itself off its dependence, trying to become more like other foundations whose financial health does not rise and fall with the fortunes of a single company. 
Over the last 16 years, the trust has sold 41 million shares of stock, often to the company itself. While the strategy has lessened its vulnerability to sudden swings in the market, it has also left it in a somewhat precarious position.
The trust had every intention of continuing to decrease its ownership in Hershey, now at about 31 percent. 
But according to a 1984 agreement reached with the company, once the trust's stake drops below 15 percent, the coveted Class B shares it owns, which account for its overwhelming influence, revert to Class A shares, which have one-tenth the voting power. At that point, the trust would no longer dictate the company's destiny. 
"This has been a long road for us," Mr. Vowler said. "Had we kept on the same course as we had been, we would have lost control of the company."
Mr. Lenny, the former Nabisco executive who joined in March 2001 and was the first outsider to run Hershey in its 108-year history, tried to persuade the trust to sell its shares to the company, but the proposal was rebuffed. 
For all the hard feelings that still linger from the strike and the stigma of being an outsider that he could never shake off, it was Mr. Lenny, not the ironclad trust set up by Mr. Hershey himself, who fought to keep the company from falling into a competitor's hands. 
But to many of the workers, spilling out of Hershey's factory in their navy jumpsuits, heavy work boots and baseball caps, the internal power-struggles mattered less than their prospects for the future. 
"We talked about it, joked about it, but you just never thought it could actually happen," Boyd Martin, a 42-year Hershey veteran who cooks up batches of chocolate syrup, said as he put his empty lunchbox and jacket into his red pickup truck.
"I'm looking to retire in 2004 and it's real possible that this kind of switchover is going to impact that. I just don't know. I just don't know."

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Managers Are Back, Profitingin Others' Bad Times 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
How fitting that the Dow Jones industrial average is back to its 1998 levels.
 John W. Meriwether, whose hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, flamed out in spectacular fashion that year, is gaining ground once again. Mr. Meriwether has amassed $1 billion in assets in his new fund, known as JWM Partners, and has recorded a profit of more than 6 percent for investors this year, according to people with access to its results. 
 Mr. Meriwether's second act -- after disrupting the global markets and being bailed out by a dozen banks in 1998 -- serves as a reminder that someone is always getting rich, no matter how steeply the stock market indexes are falling. 
In fact, some Wall Street titans who struggled during the bull market have lived to see another day in this bear market. Complex strategies long practiced by George Soros and Mr. Meriwether are resurgent, as are funds that invest in emerging markets and distressed securities and those that bet against the stock market by short selling. Betting against the dollar has worked for many, and some have bet against stocks using futures contracts and buying bonds.
Their success is attracting billions of dollars to hedge funds -- secretive and lightly regulated investment groups that cater to the rich and increasingly the upper middle class, as well as to college endowments, pension funds and foundations. Hedge fund assets rose to $563 billion last year from $408 billion, mostly from new sales, and the pace is said to be similar this year, according to a hedge fund advisory firm, the Hennessee Group.
"One of the great challenges of the 'hedge fund' business that we are in is that it has become mainstream," wrote Lewis Moore Bacon, the chief executive of Moore Capital Management, one of the biggest funds, in a May letter to his investors.
"The welter of hedge funds being created of late gives everyone, even the newcomers, pause," he said, adding that investors were driven to hedge funds by "the same unease and distrust of conventional institutions and practices that led me into the arena of speculative trading as a hedge against the uncertainties of pre-Reagan America."
Some analysts suggest that the proliferation of hedge funds has contributed to the market's recent volatility, because such funds are expected to find ways to make money in all environments. But those in the industry counter that mutual funds, a much larger business, have been under more pressure to sell because investors can withdraw money from them daily, instead of once a quarter or once a year as permitted by most hedge funds.
In theory, hedge funds are intended to reduce risk, because the classic approach is to buy some stocks and sell others short, or bet against them, thereby hedging against a market decline. But in practice, hedge funds cover a vast array of entities, some that practice the classic approach and others that greatly increase risk by borrowing heavily or by swinging for the fences and striking out.
Many of the top funds of the bull market, which piled into technology stocks but did little hedging, have since collapsed.
Mr. Soros and Mr. Meriwether make big bets on macroeconomic trends in the global currency, commodity, stock or bond markets and often use considerable leverage, or borrowed money, though the two of them use very different tactics. They were Wall Street titans of the early and mid-1990's but by the end of the decade seemed obsolete to some.
After all, who wanted to bet the dollar against the Thai baht or the Malaysian ringgit in 1999, when people could make more money buying shares of Cisco Systems? Besides, investing through E*Trade or another discount broker was a lot cheaper than what hedge funds charge, a minimum of a 1 percent annual fee and 20 percent of profits. 
But this year, some of these managers have profited by making big bets against the dollar in comparison with the euro or the yen. One of them is John Henry, now the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox, who runs a $1.4 billion managed futures fund group, which is structured differently from a hedge fund but has some similarity in strategy. 
Mr. Henry's largest fund was up 20 percent in the first half of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 13.2 percent.
"Having such devastation, such a dizzying spiral downward in the stock market, is an environment where we tend to do well," Mr. Henry said in an interview, adding that the disarray in the market was troubling on a personal level.
"You worry, as one has to, when you see what's happening to the stock market," he said. "I'm an American, we're not short stocks, so we don't have any reason to want these things to go down. It's disconcerting to see this unrelenting decline."
Officials of few fund groups would speak publicly for this article, but information on their financial returns was gathered from interviews with hedge fund managers, investors and consultants as well as quarterly letters and internal e-mail messages.
Bruce Kovner, another hedge fund manager who makes investment calculations on big economic trends, is also said to be thriving. His Caxton Associates is one of the world's biggest hedge fund groups; the group's Gamut Investment Fund was up 14.3 percent after fees through May, though its returns also held up during the bull market.
Mr. Meriwether practices a style called relative value investing, in which he makes bets on the price differences between similar currencies, often using bonds. His new fund is said to use roughly $10 of borrowed money for every $1 of capital. The leverage is considerable, though Long-Term Capital had more than twice that level at its demise. Mr. Meriwether's returns were said to be 6 percent to 7 percent for the first half of the year, after fees.
Mr. Soros, who has taken a less active role in his fund group, is not posting stellar returns. After fees, his $7.4 billion Quantum Endowment which was up 13.8 percent last year, is down 3 percent in the first half of this year, but he is trouncing the Nasdaq composite index. Moore Capital, which practices a style similar to that of Mr. Soros known as macro-investing, had returns on its funds ranging from a 3.8 percent loss to a 6.8 percent gain in the first half.
Not all of those profiting now were dormant during the bull market. Andor Capital Management, a Manhattan group that is among the largest hedge funds, had returns ranging from 3.3 percent to 14.4 percent in the first six months of the year at its mostly technology funds, while the Nasdaq composite lost one-quarter of its value.
How is this possible? By being net short, meaning that the funds are selling more stocks short than they are buying. "We had minimal exposure on the long side and made money in every sector on the short side," wrote Daniel C. Benton, Andor's chief executive, in a letter to his investors last week.
In another letter to investors, two of Mr. Benton's top managers, David Felman and Christopher M. James, wrote, "If the economy picks up, the market will rally, but if it does not, we face a crisis." They added that "the fundamental data points that we monitor support concern rather than optimism."
"A weakening dollar, possible Latin American debt failures and potential global conflicts may exacerbate the predicament." 
"As we look out to the remainder of the year," they added, "our view remains cautious. We are facing a do-or-die test for the financial system."

HEADLINE: Health Care, in the Right Doses 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "More May Not Mean Better in Health Care, Studies Find" (front page, July 21) couldn't have come at a better time. Health expenditures are accelerating again after nearly 20 years. 
 With irrefutable evidence that the best predictor of health care use is supply, the challenge is how to curb America's appetite for care. The logical solution has been the traditional health maintenance organization, where salaried doctors receive per capita payments to discourage overuse of services. But because of resistance by patients and clinicians, many insurers are moving toward consumer-driven models with broader networks and fewer restrictions. 
Our weakened economy may again raise our tolerance for a top-down approach. Employers must now decide whether employees are to become the next gatekeeper of care.

HEADLINE: In Puerto Rico, a Milestone; in New York City, Not Much Celebrating 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO and MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
In Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan, thousands gathered yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the island's status as a commonwealth of the United States at a three-hour ceremony with speeches, flag-waving and even a visit from the mayor of the other capital of Puerto Rican life -- New York.
 It was necessary for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a delegation of Puerto Rican city officials to fly south in the mayor's private plane to commemorate the occasion. There were no commemorations in New York for them to attend. 
 Considering that there are 830,000 people of Puerto Rican descent in New York, the absence of fanfare surrounding the anniversary may have seemed surprising. But it was an indication of how Puerto Ricans here are more concerned about issues that affect their daily lives and, like those in Puerto Rico, are divided on what the island's political status should be. 
Angel Ivel, 51, an air-conditioner repairman from East Harlem, reflected both pride in his native Puerto Rico and the reality of life here as he hoisted a Puerto Rican flag in a community garden in solitary acknowledgment of the day.
"The people in New York don't pay much attention to what happens in Puerto Rico," he said. "It's a shame. They should have organized some kind of get-together."
On the island, there is a strong pro-statehood movement struggling to make it the 51st state. There is also a small but vocal minority who want Puerto Rico to become independent. 
Even the Popular Democratic Party, the architect of the commonwealth and the party currently holding both the governor's office and a legislative majority, wants change. In recent years the party has lobbied Washington for more powers -- for example, the ability for the commonwealth government to strike its own trade agreements -- to tackle the island's considerable economic problems, including an unemployment rate of 13 percent.
"The bottom line is, what's there to commemorate?" said Angelo Falcon, a senior policy executive with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. "There's a consensus that the current status is not adequate for Puerto Rico anymore." 
The commonwealth has given the United States a military outpost in the Caribbean and one of its biggest consumer markets, while giving Puerto Ricans the benefits of American citizenship and one of the highest standards of living of any Latin people. But while subject to federal law like Americans in the states, Puerto Ricans have unequal rights and obligations. Puerto Ricans do not pay most federal taxes, and do not vote for president or receive full representation in Congress. Puerto Rico has its own laws, taxes and government but is subject to United States law, including that regarding military service.
Repeated referendums on the status question have left Puerto Rico with its status quo intact. Up to now, Congress has refused to give a clear signal of what alternatives would be acceptable, with the issue of self-determination bogged down on questions about the political and economic cost of incorporating a Spanish-speaking state if Puerto Ricans chose statehood. 
Even with its ambiguous status, however, Puerto Rico remains essentially Hispanic, and Puerto Ricans find consensus in defending both their culture and their American citizenship. In New York, the island's status takes a back seat to bread and butter issues of education and jobs. But opinions about the island's political fate abound, and polls of stateside Puerto Ricans have shown a preference for a commonwealth.
"We are citizens; we don't need green cards," said George Olivio, 49, a clerk at a hardware store in Hell's Kitchen. "We get a lot from the United States and people are comfortable. They don't want to hear about independence or statehood."
But Felix V. Matos-Rodriguez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, noted that commonwealth status eased the migration of Puerto Ricans to New York in the years after World War II, many of them agricultural workers displaced by industrialization.
"For economic development to work in Puerto Rico, there was a need to export workers because of overpopulation," he said. "There's a sense that people were shipped out. That, and the volatility of the status issue, helps explain why there's no official celebration here."
Those who represent New York say people of Puerto Rican descent here are often increasingly ambivalent about politics on the island.
Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a United States representative from New York, said status was not as divisive an issue as it used to be in the city because Puerto Rican voters have increasingly turned their attention to mainland politics. 
"More and more Puerto Ricans understand electoral politics in New York and they see themselves at a political crossroads," she said. "Our vote could be the decisive factor in determining elections."
The anniversary has not been entirely bypassed in the states. Juan Figueroa, president and general counsel of the legal defense fund, said his organization had joined a committee of mostly civic groups nationwide that is holding seminars about Puerto Rico and cultural events through the year to commemorate the date.
Mayor Bloomberg attended the official celebration in Puerto Rico with a delegation of Puerto Rican city officials who flew south in his private plane, including four council members and Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president. The mayor read a statement from President Bush.
Thousands gathered in San Juan by the Capitol building, waving Puerto Rican and American flags in a festive celebration headed by Gov. Sila M. Calderon. But thousands of others, mostly independence supporters, rallied along the waterfront in Guanica, in the island's southwest, to protest the other historic event that took place on July 25: the United States invasion of the island in 1898 to seize it from Spain. 
Regardless of political leanings, evident among Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people and an additional 3.4 million Hispanics of Puerto Rican descent in the states is a sense of nationhood and a persistent clinging to language.
Ricardo E. Alegria, founder of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, director of the Museum of the Americas in Old San Juan and a Harvard-trained anthropologist, said that Puerto Rico's cultural nationalism was manifested in myriad ways, from the thousands of Puerto Ricans making a living selling arts and crafts to the civil disobedience protests against the Navy in Vieques.
Despite the political and economic fusion with the world's sole superpower and concerted assimilation efforts in the pre-commonwealth era, such as English-only instruction in public schools, he said, "we think, make love and pray to God in Spanish."
But commonwealth is basically a compromise: Children are taught in English and Spanish, just as they get presents both from Santa Claus on Dec. 25 and from the Magi on Jan. 6. Both the American and Puerto Rican flags snap from public buildings and at official events, where the two national anthems are also played. 
Under the tug of American control, Puerto Ricans have come to identify themselves as much, it seems, by what they are as by what they are not. "The United States is always the reference under which we say, 'Yes, but . . .' " said Arlene Davila, an assistant professor of American studies at New York University who was born and raised in Puerto Rico and has written about Puerto Rican identity. 
Puerto Rico, of course, has not been immune to Americanization. Many in the island bemoan infiltrators such as Spanglish, consumerism and individualism. On the plus side, Puerto Ricans uphold American democratic values to the tune of a voter turnout in national elections that surpasses 80 percent.
But the hybrid that is the commonwealth, noted Ms. Davila, "has heightened awareness of what's Puerto Rican."

HEADLINE: House and Senate Reach Initial Deal on Trade Powers for Bush 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators agreed late tonight on the details of legislation that would give President Bush authority to make international trade deals that could be approved or rejected -- but not amended -- by Congress.
 The issue has been one of the White House's top legislative priorities this year, and should the package agreed to by the House and Senate negotiators tonight win final approval from both chambers it would be a big victory for Mr. Bush. 
 Barring any last-minute problems, the bill is expected to go the House floor on Friday. It is likely to be taken up by the Senate next week before Congress recesses for the rest of the summer. 
Both the House and the Senate had passed versions of the legislation earlier this year. But they differed in a number of key areas, especially in how they would seek to help workers who lose their jobs because of increased competition from imports or because their employers move to other countries.
Agreement has also been complicated by concern in both parties that any further moves toward new trade deals, which supporters say would benefit the economy in the long run, could hurt workers in some regions at a time when the economy is still struggling to regain its footing after last year's recession.
Mr. Bush has cast the legislation as an important part of his economic recovery package, even though any direct benefits it might bring are years away.
The administration has been pressing Congress to act before it leaves for the rest of the summer, saying that postponing the vote until fall would put it too close to Election Day pressures to protect domestic workers and businesses from increased foreign competition.
Mr. Bush has said he wants to use the increased trade negotiating authority to pursue deals to open markets in Latin America and perhaps in other parts of the world.
Congress balked at giving so-called fast-track negotiating authority to President Bill Clinton. Fast-track authority provides the president with a broad mandate to negotiate trade deals. Any agreements must be submitted to Congress, which can approve or reject them but cannot amend them. Without such authority, the president's ability to negotiate with trading partners would be limited since any agreement could be reopened piece by piece in Congress.
Most of the opposition to trade negotiating authority for the president has come from Democrats, who have been concerned about trade's effect on American workers and on the environment.
Details of the agreement reached tonight were sketchy. But aides to the main negotiators, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, said the two mean had agreed to provide workers who lose their jobs for trade-related reasons a new package of financial assistance to allow them to maintain their health-insurance coverage.
Under the deal, workers would receive a tax credit for 65 percent of the health-insurance premium, which would be purchased through an existing government program for laid-off workers. The coverage would apply both to employees of companies directly affected by increased foreign competition and to some workers who lose jobs indirectly -- that is, because they work for a supplier or subcontractor of a company that is forced to scale back its business.
Congressional aides said the negotiators reached a compromise on whether to require the president not to change any existing trade laws in his negotiations, but they could not immediately provide details. Such a provision was included in the original Senate version of the bill as a way of insuring that the United States does not bargain away its anti-dumping laws, which seek to prevent foreign competitors from selling their goods here below cost. 
The first House version of the trade bill passed 215-214 in December, and only after heavy lobbying by the administration and the Republican leadership in the House. The Senate version passed 66-30 in May.
Republican aides said they expected the sweetened health-insurance program would attract enough Democrats to ensure passage of the final bill in the House on Friday.

HEADLINE: NEGOTIATORS AGREE ON BILL TO REWRITE BANKRUPTCY LAWS 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators announced today that they had reached agreement on a bill that would rewrite the bankruptcy laws, making it much harder for people to escape their debts when they declare bankruptcy.
 The agreement, a victory for credit card companies and other lenders, came late today after members of a conference committee reached a compromise on the language of an abortion-rights provision that had threatened to scuttle the overall bill. The compromise will restrict the ability of anti-abortion protesters to use the bankruptcy laws to shield themselves from paying court fines resulting from protests at abortion clinics. 
 The overall bankruptcy bill, which passed both houses of Congress by overwhelming margins more than a year ago, appears destined for final approval in the House and Senate, and the White House has suggested that President Bush will sign it. The House could vote on the measure as early as Friday, the day it is scheduled to begin a monthlong summer recess. Conference committee members were under pressure to reach an agreement before the break. 
"We have worked hard for a year to make this a better and more balanced bill, and we have succeeded," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and who led the conference committee. "I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to get it passed."
The bill approved by the conference committee would end the ability of millions of Americans to use the bankruptcy system to wipe out credit card bills and other loans that are not secured by homes or other assets. Many of those debts would instead have to be paid back over time. 
Credit card companies and other lenders have contended that they are being unfairly penalized as a result of the growing rate of bankruptcy filings. There were 1.45 million filings last year, a record, up 19 percent from 2000.
The timing of a final agreement was intriguing, given that it is a clear victory for the interests of corporate America over consumers at a moment when large corporations are otherwise under siege on Capitol Hill because of recent scandals, many of them involving accounting abuses.
The bill, which has been vigorously opposed by consumer-rights groups, had long been the top legislative priority of credit card companies and some banks, which insist that many debtors abuse the bankruptcy laws to escape debts they should be able to pay. The companies sharply stepped up campaign contributions to members of Congress in recent years as they promoted the legislation.
Among the biggest beneficiaries would be the MBNA Corporation of Delaware, which describes itself as the world's biggest independent credit card company. Ranked by employee donations, MBNA was the largest corporate contributor to President Bush's 2000 campaign.
The company has also recently acknowledged that it gave a $447,000 debt-consolidation loan on what critics viewed as highly favorable terms to a crucial House supporter of the bill only four days before he signed on as a lead sponsor of the legislation in 1998. Both MBNA and the lawmaker, Representative James P. Moran Jr., Democrat of Virginia, have denied that there was anything improper about the loan.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who began work on the legislation in 1998, said that today's agreement would "close loopholes exploited by big spenders who have the ability to repay their debts and better protect consumers who have been left to pay higher prices for goods and services as a result."
A leading opponent of the bill, Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said through a spokeswoman that the bill was "dastardly for consumers, especially in these economic times," and that he would fight it. "It should be embarrassing for people to vote for this."
The Senate and the House passed versions of the bankruptcy bill in March 2001, but the the conference committee was stalled for months over the abortion provision. 
The provision had been sought by abortion-rights supporters, led by Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat. They had cited cases in recent years in which anti-abortion advocates had filed for bankruptcy to avoid paying court fines and judgments owed as a result of illegal clinic protests.
But anti-abortion advocates in Congress, led by Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican, had argued that the provision could restrict the free-speech rights of anti-abortion protesters.
The final wording of the compromise provision was not immediately made public tonight, but Senator Schumer said in an interview that it "contains language that says that those who use violence or blockades to close or harass clinics are not protected by bankruptcy for their liabilities." He described the result as "a victory for women."

HEADLINE: To Keep The Peace, Study Peace 

BYLINE:  By MAHVISH KHAN

 BODY:
WHEN Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, decided to study ethnic violence, he ended up looking at something that most experts in the field don't: peaceful cities. 
 Mr. Varshney, who is from New Delhi, wanted to find out why some cities in India managed to avoid bloody Hindu-Muslim clashes while others erupted in horrifying violence. 
 "For far too long scholars and policy makers have focused on the state for conflict prevention. My main research finding is that we should instead focus on civil society," Mr. Varshney said. "An integrated society is the best bet for ethnic peace." 
With the increase in ethnic conflicts in recent years, the results of his nine-year project have generated enormous excitement. Scholars have hailed his book, "Ethnic Conflict & Civic Life: Hindus & Muslims in India" (Yale University Press), as a major breakthrough, while the United Nations has already adopted his method to study Muslim-Christian violence in Indonesia. The Open Society Institute, part of the Soros Foundations Network, which promotes democratic principles and human rights issues, has distributed 170 copies of the book to staff members around the world. And it has been talking, along with other foundations, with Mr. Varshney about extending his research to other ethnic and religious flashpoints, from Eastern Europe to Nigeria.
"By carefully studying riot-prone and peaceful cities, this new model has a persuasive analysis and explanation of why violence occurs," said Samuel P. Huntington, chairman of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies. Most researchers tend to avoid studying regions where no violence exists, Mr. Huntington said, so they have no place to compare their findings to, and their conclusions are based on incomplete evidence. Mr. Varshney avoided this research flaw by leading a team of researchers from Harvard, where he taught for nine years, to explore why some Indian cities were violence-prone, while others with the exact same Hindu-Muslim ratios lived in peace.
What Mr. Varshney found was that ethnically integrated organizations -- including business associations, trade unions, professional groups, political parties, sports clubs -- stand out as the most effective ways of controlling conflict.
These mixed associations proved far more effective than routine but uncoordinated social interactions, like simply allowing children to play together in the neighborhood. While both kinds of activities were important for ethnic harmony, formal organizations become much more important in times of strife, Mr. Varshney said.
Mr. Varshney's team collected information on Hindu-Muslim rioting from 1950 to 1995 and identified eight riot-prone cities, where there had been repeated clashes. The team then picked three riot-prone cities -- Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Aligarh -- and compared them with peaceful cities with equal Hindu-Muslim population ratios: Surat, Lucknow and Calicut.
After analyzing the data, Mr. Varshney found a clear pattern: cities with developed social, political and economic integration were far less vulnerable to conflict.
Calicut's network of associations and peace committees, for example, helped defuse tension during the widespread rioting that broke out after Hindu militants destroyed the Babri mosque in Ayodhya in December 1992. While unfounded rumors that Hindus were desecrating mosques by throwing pigs into them were spurring violence in other cities, Calicut's organizations helped city officials quash the specious reports. 
The riots that whipped across the western Gujarat State in March and April of this year and claimed more than 1,000 lives seemed to provide further evidence for Mr. Varshney's conclusions. The three riot-prone cities he identified were the sources of some of the worst violence, while Surat, which is also in Gujarat, remained peaceful.
"It was with considerable scholarly satisfaction, but also with great emotional and political dismay that I observed the patterns of violence and peace during the recent Gujarat riots," Mr. Varshney said. "As copies of my book were coming into circulation, its predictions and analysis were coming true."
Whether it is India, Indonesia or Palestine, "this is an important breakthrough in understanding the problem of ethnic conflict globally," said Robert Putnam, a Harvard professor whose work on civic participation in American life, detailed in his book "Bowling Alone," has been cited by both President Bill Clinton and President Bush. "Varshney's findings show the crucial mechanism by which societies can manage diversity," he said. "This is not a handbook to pass out in Bosnia, and his book does not tell governments what to do, yet it frames the problem." 
United Nations officials began to talk to Mr. Varshney about his ideas last summer, before his book was published. "We thought his method could also apply to the dynamics of Indonesia," where strained Muslim-Christian relations often break out into violence, said Satish Mishra, head of the United Nations Support Facility for Indonesian Recovery. "Varshney's findings raise the possibilities of future peace."
In April the United Nations office in Jakarta hired Mr. Varshney to oversee the creation of a database that would track incidents of ethnic violence. Mr. Mishra said this would give Indonesian policymakers a map of violent locations, a sense of their duration, intensity and reported causes. This should lead to better ideas of how to combat these conflicts, he said. 
"If policymakers formulate their responses only on the basis of guesses and intuitions, they can go horribly wrong," Mr. Varshney said from his home in Ann Arbor. "A reliable database on violence is critical for policymaking."
Not everyone is sold on Mr. Varshney's theory, however. Some critics argue the problem is perhaps more complex then simply creating integrated associations. David Laitin, a professor of political science at Stanford University, said Mr. Varshney lacked the evidence to show that association members are doing what his theory says they do. Mr. Laitin argued that Mr. Varshney placed too much emphasis on trust among organization members. It may just be that in the cities where there is economic interdependence, both sides have an interest in refraining from riots. Levels of trust would then be unnecessary, Mr. Laitin said.
Mr. Varshney counters that trust is not central to his work. Pitting trust against self-interest is too narrow, he said. There is evidence, he says, of many motivations, which cannot be reduced to mere trust or self-interest.
Aryeh Neier, the president of the Open Society Institute who distributed Mr. Varshney's book to his overseas staff, said: "I am not certain that the same pattern will prevail. However, his model intuitively makes enough sense that it is worth thinking of implementing elsewhere."
That is precisely what Mr. Varshney would like to do and says he plans to seek $750,000 in funds from the Soros Foundations, the Ford Foundation and others in order to test his model in Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia and possibly Eastern Europe within the next three years.
Mr. Varshney is already working with Rajmohan Gandhi, a leading activist of Indian civic engagement and the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, to reduce violence in his birthplace. Their project, primarily financed at this time by the Foundation for Human and Economic Development, a nonprofit organization based in Orlando, Fla., will try to create Hindu-Muslim ties in the eight riot-prone cities that Mr. Varshney identified, by forming a range of nongovernmental organizations and business partnerships.
"Intuitively, his model makes sense -- it is fresh, it is different and it is promising," Mr. Gandhi said in a telephone interview from his home in New Delhi. "Varshney's research shows that work of integration and partnership does help to safeguard against violence. Once people read his book and comprehend the model, it will trigger a lot of constructive thought and action."

HEADLINE: Polls of Consumers 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A July 20 letter by Warren Mitofsky, a founder of the CBS/New York Times Poll, was critical of your publication of preliminary results from the Surveys of Consumers conducted by the University of Michigan. He wrote, "Consumer confidence may have increased." 
In fact, the sample size was sufficient to indicate that consumer confidence fell from the prior month at conventional levels of significance. 
 Over the past 10 years, the preliminary results have correctly anticipated the full survey findings, with the difference averaging less than one-tenth of a point. Perhaps this is why The Times as well as other media organizations publish the preliminary results despite the fact that the data are not publicly released.

Portugal Faces Sanctions Over Deficit

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 26 

 BODY:
Europe's monetary union is facing one of its first major tests, as Portugal disclosed late Thursday that its budget deficit had soared above the limit set by the European Union.
 The European Commission immediately began a sanctions procedure against the Portuguese government. Under the union's rules, Portugal could be assessed heavy fines if it fails to get its deficit below 3 percent of its gross domestic product. 
 The figure for 2001 was 4.1 percent, Portugal's finance minister, Manuela Ferreira Leite, said late Thursday. She promised "a profound reduction, a violent one," to bring it down to 2.8 percent for 2002. 
That Portugal would breach the deficit limit had been expected, but the scale of the breach surprised and angered European Union officials, who chided the government in Lisbon for what they called incomplete and flawed economic data.
Portugal discovered "serious omissions in the production of government deficit and debt data," Pedro Solbes, the union's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said in a statement.
Reaction from other European capitals was muted, however, perhaps because Portugal is not the only country at risk of violating the limit. Budget gaps are widening in France and in Germany, which is perilously close to the 3 percent limit this year.
Portugal and Germany narrowly avoided receiving formal warning letters from the European Commission in February, an escape that experts attribute to Germany's influential role in the monetary union.
When the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets the rules for the monetary union, was adopted in 1997, the German government was a main proponent of strict limits on members' budget deficits, arguing that profligate borrowing by governments would undermine Europe's new currency, the euro. The 12 nations that signed the pact pledged to balance their budgets by 2004.
There is little evidence that Portugal's woes have had much of an effect on the euro, at least so far. The currency has risen 14 percent in value in the last three months, regaining parity with the dollar; it traded at 98.87 cents today in New York.
But experts said that if Brussels did not deal firmly with Portugal -- by withholding development funds and imposing fines -- the credibility of Europe's unified monetary policy would suffer.
"They should be tough," said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research institute in Brussels. "You have to impose sanctions, otherwise everybody will do the same thing."
Mr. Gros said Portugal's previous government, which was defeated in elections in March, tried to cover up the size of the deficit by shifting some public expenses to state-owned corporations. "This was a combination of really bad information and a government that knew an election was coming," he said.
Under European Union rules, Portugal could be fined an amount equal to 0.5 percent of its gross domestic product, or more than $670 million. But such a penalty can only be imposed by a vote of the finance ministers of fellow union members.
European Union officials said Portugal would be given about a year to get its financial house in order before penalties were considered. The new Social Democratic government in Lisbon has said it will lay off government workers, close public agencies and raise its top value-added tax rate to 19 percent from 17 percent.
"It would be difficult to imagine sanctions if the country acts," said Gerassimos Thomas, a commission spokesman.
Skeptical economists say Portugal's ballooning deficit is proof of the futility of trying to control government policies with numerical rules. They predict that more governments will soon soar past the 3 percent limit, and that few will balance their budgets by 2004 as promised.
These pledges, the economists noted, were based on achieving certain rates of economic growth. While Europe is in the midst of a fragile recovery, analysts fear it could be hobbled by the recent market turmoil in the United States, which has spread to European markets.
"What is this fetish for balanced budgets?" said Peter Dixon, chief economist at Commerzbank Securities in London. "It doesn't allow for the fact that when growth slows, governments have to be able to spend money to stimulate the economy. It imposes a straitjacket on growth."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
RallyLets Dow and S.&P. 500 Finish Up for the Week

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied in the last hour and a half yesterday and the push was enough to assure that both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose for the day and finished higher for the week.
 It was the first positive week in three for the Dow and the first in four for the S.& P. 500. The Nasdaq composite index also rallied yesterday, but it still finished the week down, its fourth consecutive weekly decline. 
 After the punishment investors have taken in the last few months, any pause has to be a plus, as was the fact that the Dow and the S.& P. 500 managed to keep all the gains made on Wednesday, when the two indexes had their biggest one-day rallies since the 1987 crash. That rally came the day after the market fell to five-year lows. 
"That's a very good sign that the market held on to Wednesday's gains,' said Joseph Liro, the equity strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
But Mr. Liro said he still needed "to see more" before he would feel that the market had reached a bottom. 
Richard Bernstein, the United States strategist at Merrill Lynch, is also not ready to say the decline is over. "We still have valuations that are expensive, although they are not stretched," he said. He also said that investors, based on Merrill's Lynch's sentiment index, were still too interested in the market. "People are still speculating, and they are worried that they will miss the turn," he said. "I would rather see people completely lose interest."
The Dow rose 78.08 points, or 1 percent, to close at 8,264.39, while the S.& P. 500 was up 14.16 points, or 1.7 percent, to 852.84. The Nasdaq composite index was up 22.04 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,262.12. For the week, the Dow was up 3.1 percent and the S.& P. 500 up 0.6 percent. The Nasdaq was off 4.3 percent.
The Dow is still down in 14 of the last 19 weeks and could be heading to one of the worst January-to-July performances since the end of World War II.
With three trading days left in July, the Dow is down 17.5 percent so far this year. The worst first seven months of the year since 1945 came in 1962, after President John F. Kennedy forced the steel companies to roll back price increases. The Dow was down 18.2 percent by the end of July 1962 but managed a 9.1 percent rebound in the last five months of the year. Currently, the second-worst January-to-July performance is a 13.6 percent decline in 1969.
Among the sectors that led the rally yesterday were drug, utility, energy, chemical and basic material companies, most of which had been beaten down in the previous weeks. Among the leaders were Johnson & Johnson, Duke Power, DuPont and Exxon Mobil.
But the technology and telecommunications sectors were not able to end their losing streaks. The Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was down for the fourth consecutive week, falling 5.5 percent. Despite a 7.5 percent surge Wednesday, Microsoft finished the week down 8.5 percent. AT&T Wireless was down 18.1 percent.
Two badly beaten down stocks helped lead the S.& P. 500 index higher. Tyco International surged $3.78, or 45.8 percent, to $12.03, after naming Edward D. Breen, the president of Motorola, as chairman and chief executive.
AOL Time Warner, which had plunged 15.4 percent Thursday after the company disclosed a preliminary inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting, was up $1.26, or 13.1 percent, to $10.90.
The stock surge on Wednesday and the relative stability on Thursday and yesterday could indicate that the market is getting back on its feet. But the threat that new companies may be disclosing accounting or other problems will assure that many investors still have their fingers on the sell button.
Based on weekly data from AMG Data Services, investors are continuing to flee mutual funds. For the week ended Wednesday, there was a net outflow of $12.2 billion from stock mutual funds, bringing total outflows for July to $30.6 billion, the most since the company began compiling fund data 10 years ago. In addition, more than half of last week's outflows was shifted into money market funds, a sign that many investors are worried.
The University of Michigan reported yesterday that its consumer confidence index for July had fallen less than initially reported. The index was at 88.1 for the month, compared with an initial reading of 86.5. Although higher than thought, July confidence is still down from 92.4 in June.
In the bond market, prices and yields were little changed. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 1/32, to 103 26/32, while the yield remained at 4.38 percent. For the week, however, bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, were down. The yield on the 10-year note a week ago was 4.52 percent.

PERSON: Rudiger Dornbusch 

HEADLINE: Rudiger Dornbusch, 60, an Economist of Outspoken Views 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose explanation of why currency exchange rates sometimes fluctuate sharply became a tenet of international economics, died on Thursday at his home in Washington. He was 60 and also had a home in Boston.
 The cause was cancer, M.I.T. said in a statement. 
 Dr. Dornbusch, who spent 27 years as an M.I.T. professor, found himself frequently in the headlines for his outspoken views on various crises in developing countries. He was almost alone in predicting the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, just weeks before the peso collapsed. And he urged the Argentines to keep their peso pegged one to one to the dollar, reiterating that view on the eve of the devaluation last December and Argentina's plunge into debt default and crisis. 
"Rudi believed strongly that Argentina needed a strong currency peg to maintain the confidence" of the markets, said Stanley Fischer, a Citigroup executive and a former M.I.T. colleague who as the deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in the 1990's often worked with Dr. Dornbusch.
Only in that way would the Argentines defeat inflation and draw the foreign investment needed for economic growth. "Rudi would say that if the Argentines only had the discipline to maintain the peg," Mr. Fischer explained, "then we would all be better off."
Dr. Dornbusch encouraged developing countries to embrace policies that maintained the confidence of capital markets. That often meant inflation-fighting austerity policies that required budget cutting and higher interest rates. He gave his advice on frequent trips abroad as a consultant, many to Latin America. Very often, the finance ministers and Central Bank presidents with whom he met had been his students at M.I.T.
"On my first trip to Chile," recounted Paul Joskow, an M.I.T. economist, "I went to the ministry of finance to meet with the minister and the deputy minister, and behind the deputy's desk were two photos -- one of Chile's president and the other of Rudi."
A seminal paper that Dr. Dornbusch published in 1976, a year after he joined the M.I.T. faculty, solved a puzzle. Floating currencies should adjust gradually to one another, economists thought. The volatility that was often a feature of foreign exchange trading seemed irrational. How else to explain why currencies overshot their value on the high and low side?
But Dr. Dornbusch argued that the overshooting was a rational response to economic shocks and news. Currencies can respond instantly in daily exchange trading, while a country's employment levels, inflation rate and economic growth adjust only slowly. But once these others do adjust, the pressure comes off the currency, which then returns to normal value. That insight into the dynamics of exchange rates became widely accepted.
Dr. Dornbusch was also the co-author, with Mr. Fischer, of "Macroeconomics" (McGraw-Hill, 1981), the first textbook for undergraduates in advanced economics courses to include chapters on the shifts in economic theory that had gained prominence over the previous decade or so.
He was born in Krefeld, Germany, on June 8, 1942, and studied economics at the University of Geneva, getting his undergraduate degree in 1966. Heeding the advice of a mentor that he should move to the United States to advance his career, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he earned his Ph.D. in economics in 1971.
After teaching stints at Chicago and the University of Rochester, he went to M.I.T., recruited by the university to fill a slot as an international economist. Despite his illness, he had taught in the spring semester and had traveled to Geneva in early June to receive an award and take part in a panel discussion.
Dr. Dornbusch is survived by his wife, Sandra Masur, and a brother, Paul Josef Dornbusch of Krefeld.

HEADLINE: July Confidence Number Revised Upward 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell less in July than previously estimated, according to a University of Michigan survey that shows that Americans may not let tumbling stock prices completely dim their view of the economy.
 The final consumer sentiment index for July was 88.1, compared with a preliminary 86.5 and a June reading of 92.4. 
 "It's another indication that American consumers have not thrown in the towel despite the stock market plunge and anemic employment growth," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen 13 percent this month, more than in September, the month of the terrorist attacks, and the final confidence reading for this month is the lowest since November. Still, incomes keep rising and cars are selling at a pace that may make July the best sales month of the year, according to industry forecasts.
Economists had expected a reading of 86.5 in the final consumer sentiment index, the same as reported preliminarily. Confidence influences consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy.
The current-conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situation and their willingness to spend on household items like furniture and stoves, was 99.3, better than a previously reported 99. It was 99.5 in June.
The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, was 81. Though that was down from 87.9 in June, it was up from the previously reported 78.5 for July.
"I wouldn't want to bet that stocks are going to be significantly better in a year, and my stock portfolio is worse," said Russell Higgins, a 43-year-old architect in New York. "But I'm taking a vacation this fall, so it hasn't let me stop doing that. I wouldn't do something like go out and redecorate the whole apartment."

HEADLINE: Wary About the Economy, Consumers Spend With Extreme Caution 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: DAVENPORT, Iowa, July 26 

 BODY:
Kim Haack, 45, a federal government worker playing golf at Davenport's Duck Creek municipal course, has been stung enough by the stock market's plunge to hunker down. 
 Each year, Ms. Haack and her husband take two- or three-week vacations far away, and two brief vacations of four days to Chicago or St. Louis. "The mini-vacations are out," she said. 
 Every 10 days or so, the Haacks and two other couples used to go out to dinner. "It would be $300, and we wouldn't think about it," she said. "Now it has to be a special occasion." 
Marcia Jacobs, 47, a special-education teacher in Moline, Ill., stopped for coffee while riding a bike along the Mississippi River. She has two teenage boys in high school. With their college tuition funds in eclipse, Ms. Jacobs said, "I'm stressing state schools." 
When the economy threatened to falter after Sept. 11, consumers, a group responsible for nearly two-thirds of the nation's spending, went shopping and helped to avert a downturn. That sort of behavior is unlikely to repeat itself. With the recent flurry of corporate scandals and the stock market's worst pummeling since the Great Depression, many people around this mid-America city on the Mississippi plan to hold onto their money. 
Skittish about jobs or angry with big companies they trusted, burned or not by the market decline, Republican or Democrat, people here say they are hunkering down. They are paying off debts and putting off vacations; they are spending less for meals and postponing big purchases. 
Richard Aicher, 70, is a maintenance worker at the University of Iowa in Iowa City who was visiting Davenport. He can retire any time and get a state pension. But he is edgy, Mr. Aicher said, about "the Enron thing and the WorldCom thing." A year ago, he said, "we'd go to a place where you could have a sandwich and a bottle of beer. Not now. We watch more TV and drink beer at home because it's cheaper." Big purchases are out. "We could use some new furniture," he said. 
In the neatly groomed town of West Branch, Iowa, home of Herbert Hoover, president at the start of the Depression, Sharon Lynch, 46, was putting an envelope into the mailbox on Main Street. Since January, Ms. Lynch said, her retirement fund has dropped to $53,000 from $78,000. A "strong Republican" and self-employed office manager and computer systems manager, she said she felt "raped and pillaged." 
Unsure now that any investments are safe, Ms. Lynch said she was wary of buying anything but necessities. She bought a new red Chevrolet Monte Carlo two months ago, but only after her last car had run down. "I looked long and carefully," she said. "Last year, when Chevrolet introduced zero-percent financing, I looked for another six months." 
West Branch Ford's customers are behaving the same way. "This next round of zero-percent financing is going to be more lackluster than it was last year," said Mark Huisenga, a salesman. "I think the used-car market is going to grow."
At Lujack's Northpark Auto Plaza, a big, 16-brand dealership in Davenport, Cary Cox Sr., the manager, said business was strong, thanks in part to used cars. Used-car sales, Mr. Cox said, broke records in five of the last six months.
Storekeepers are feeling the sting. Barbara Schneff, who works at her family's 86-year-old jewelry store in Davenport, said, "People aren't spending as much on higher ticket items. People who were going to buy something for $20,000 buy something for $10,000. People are hesitant. We have had quite a few people wanting to sell jewelry."
At Northpark Mall here, Becky Nolte, manager of J. S. Kim Jewelers, said, "We hear a lot of women saying, 'I'll have to ask my husband' before buying. Before they would just buy it." Sales are strong, Ms. Nolte said, but only because the store is about to close and is selling everything for 60 percent to 70 percent off. 
Many of the mall's young shoppers, who live on their wages, and the elderly, who have pensions as well as Social Security, do not seem inclined to change their spending.
Joe Parker, 72, a retired railroad worker in Savannah, Ill., gets a $2,300 pension check each month and $1,100 from his late wife's pension. "I get my check, spend it, and the next month they send me some more," Mr. Parker said. 
At the other end of the age spectrum, Kristina Bernhardt, 24, a saleswoman in a tuxedo store, said: "I'm just going to enjoy myself. We kind of live for the moment." 
But then there are shoppers like Pam Mally, 43, a divorced mother of three, who lost money in the stock market. Traveling has been reduced to visits with relatives, Ms. Mally said, adding: "I'm cautious with everything. If I saw something I liked, I purchased it. I don't now."
The market's long, steep decline is taking a toll on the City of Davenport's finances. Taxpayers have become focused on necessities, like sewers and streets, said Charles W. Brooke, 60, a lawyer who is the part-time mayor. Mr. Brooke wants to open new branch libraries and rebuild a ball field, but older taxpayers are balking.
"When you are going through a depression, you reduce things to the basics and get into a fortress mentality," Mr. Brooke said. "People are waiting to see what happens next, if more shoes drop and if Congress does what it should have done two years ago."
Some of the reluctance to spend grows out of anger at politicians and corporate leaders. Janan Weber, 52, a teller and customer service representative at a bank in Dunkerton, Iowa, near Waterloo, and her husband, Leonard Weber, 57, an assembly line worker at a John Deere plant in Waterloo, were having the $4.23 breakfast at the Rhythm City Casino's restaurant here. 
The Webers' retirement savings have plunged. Mr. Weber has postponed the retirement he hoped to begin this year. The corrupt corporate executives "should go to jail," he said. "They should take that money and give it back to investors."
The Webers are careful with money. They live outside Dunkerton on a 120-acre farm they own outright. They grow much of their food and pay off credit-card charges in full each month. They do not go to malls. 
They stopped at the casino because it offered a cheap visit to Davenport. Through a promotion they found a free room at the casino's Blackhawk Hotel. They limit their losses to $20 each a day, so the room cost them $40, half the price of an equivalent motel room here. 
It is said that frugality and spending on riverboat gambling do not mix. To stay in business, the boats stack the odds in their favor. But to many people here, those odds now beat the stock market. 
Raymond Denys, 49, and his wife, Susan, 50, of East Moline, Ill., do not own any stock. Mr. Denys earns $18 an hour as an electrician at a Deere plant in Moline and is assured a pension when he retires. He has resisted putting money into a 401(k) to supplement the pension. Mrs. Denys earns $10 an hour at an optician's office. She saves 10 percent of her wages but leaves the money in a savings account.
"I'm afraid that my son and my husband won't have a job one of these days," Mrs. Denys said. "I will never buy a new car again."
Mr. Denys said, "I'm trying to cut off all my credit cards."
But twice a week, the Denyses visit the casinos here. They limit themselves to losses of $100 a week, and over five years they say they have lost a little more than they have won. But they have been beating the house recently. 
Two years ago, Mr. Denys won a $4,500 jackpot. "He wins all the time now," Mrs. Denys said. "Last year I won my first jackpot -- $1,500."
That spurred her consumer spending much as stock market gains in the 1990's might have. "It paid for all my Christmas presents," she said.

HEADLINE: The Sunny Side of the Street 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
What I'm about to propose reminds me slightly of the final scene in "The Life of Brian," in which the faux messiah and his followers, hanging crucified on a row of crosses, burst into happy song: "Always look on the bri-ight side of life!" But you don't really have to be in a Monty Python mood to think that the cascade of grim tidings from Wall Street is, in many ways, good for us.
 I know the accounting scandals, bankruptcies and vaporized stock values have caused real pain. With deep sympathy for the victims, though, it seems to me this is one of those inevitable, chastening moments from which the country may benefit in important ways -- is, in fact, already starting to benefit.
 To begin with, the crisis has deflated an artificially inflated market, and forced us to face up to the fact that we were living an economic lie. All those grinches who warned against stock values built on vague promises of future profits were right, and -- c'mon, be honest -- even as we sucked the nitrous oxide we kind of knew it. Any recovery begins with an honest reckoning. 
The truth may empty your pockets, but it will also set you free. Over the past decade we have been absurdly captivated by the stock market. The Dow became our national mood ring. Investing went from being a form of savings to being a kind of lottery. We became a nation lined up on its elliptical trainers, pedaling to nowhere while staring blankly at the market ticker on CNBC. We didn't want to be like Mike. We wanted to be like Phil Jackson, clicking trades on his laptop. The fact that Americans are losing faith now is no bad thing; we've been worshiping in a casino.
It was not just individual Americans who were swept up in the euphoria. Market worship infested businesses everywhere. It is true, as President Bush keeps saying, that the great majority of corporate leaders are decent, honest men and women, and the larcenous, book-cooking greedheads are a tiny minority. But executives today operate in a culture perverted by the spirit of the instant payoff. That gambler instinct may make sense for Internet start-ups and other companies based on notions rather than assets. But stimulated by the proselytizing of management consultants and the siren song of Wall Street, even solid, steady companies began to behave like teenagers in heat.
My father was a C.E.O., who retired in 1989 with both his company and his reputation in robust health. He and his business friends watch the scandals now with amazement and horror, not so much at the venality as at the madness of corporate life. How did share price become the sole measure of success? How did corporate executives start feeling they had to spend half their time doing lap dances for market analysts? How did even industries whose accomplishments take years -- bringing an oilfield on line, developing a new automobile -- start jerking to the tempo of quarterly reports?
One answer is that during the 90's, executive rewards were so closely pegged to the stock price that the temptation to jack up the company's short-term value was irresistible. Stock options, the right to buy shares at a set price even after the value goes up, have been rightly celebrated as a way of giving workers and executives a stake in the company. But for top executives they grew wildly out of proportion, encouraged by the absurd fact that companies didn't have to count them as expenses against their bottom lines. Often there was little restriction on how soon they could be cashed in. If a sudden bump in the stock price means you can claim your options and reap a princely windfall, what's your incentive to think about the long term? So instead of settling for honest balance sheets that will not thrill Wall Street, you look for artful (mostly legal) ways to goose the bottom line. Instead of making investments that will sustain the company, you make trendy investments that will seduce stock buyers now -- hey, let's string a zillion miles of fiber-optic cable! 
In any case, your board was probably hammering you to keep up with the hot market. One symptom of the mania for quick results is that companies that used to train up generations of executives, breeding skills and loyalty, now hire and fire the talent like free-agent relief pitchers. A recent study by the management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton reports that although C.E.O.'s with longer tenure generate substantially better profits, the rate of turnover increased by more than 50 percent in the last half of the 90's.
When everyone was feasting together, moreover, it was easy to overlook that the system had grown some blatant conflicts of interest. The consultant who taught you how to evade your taxes was partners with the auditor who testified that your accounts were on the up and up. The investment banker who underwrote your expansion was joined at the hip to the stock analyst who rated your stock. The directors of the company were too often well-stroked pets of the chief executive they were supposed to oversee.
These corrupting arrangements are now being challenged, a little by legislation, a little by regulation, and in large part by angry shareholders, corporate executives and boards trying to save their companies' skins. The excesses of stock options are likely to be reined in. The conflicts of interest are being sundered. There will be fuller disclosure and tighter accountability, at least until the inventive minds of American capitalism open new loopholes. Integrity has regained some standing as a marketable corporate value. Witness the move by companies to occupy the moral high ground -- Coke by leading a move toward treating options as an expense, Charles Schwab by aggressively advertising the fact that its advisers do not get commissions for pitching you bad investments. 
"American capitalism goes through this all the time," said Irwin M. Stelzer, director of regulatory studies at the Hudson Institute. "The question this time was, does it still have its self-corrective powers? I think the evidence is that it does. It's amazing the speed with which the corrective antitoxins were injected into the system."
Here's another cheering prospect. This shift in the zeitgeist may stimulate a healthy resistance to the overweening influence of corporate lobbies. I'm betting we won't be privatizing Social Security anytime soon, despite the president's continued devotion to the scheme. Legislation to stop companies from dodging taxes by setting up phony headquarters in Bermuda is at least up for discussion. The Bush tax cut -- mother of all deficits -- still seems nearly invulnerable, but who knows? And it's possible that the scandals may even have created enough of a backlash that industry lobbies will not quite so easily have their way on issues like health care and the protection of the environment.
Democracy, like capitalism, also has antitoxins. They are called elections, and the next ones promise to be a lot more interesting. It was hard to stir much resentment of politicians who served the fat cats when we were all hoping to be fat cats. Now that our aspirations have been downsized, one can hope we will get, along with a lot of cheap populism, some serious discussion about our national priorities. 
There is no reason voters' wrath should be reserved for Republicans. Democrats like Tom Daschle and Joseph Lieberman and Chris Dodd and Charles Schumer, for example, have helped smother important corporate reforms, and there are plenty of Congressional Democrats who act like wholly owned subsidiaries of special interests.
But the Democrats enjoy the distinct advantage of running against a party and a president that put the lazy in laissez-faire, the party of the post-Enron shrug, the party of Harken and Halliburton, the party of the Enron-tainted Army Secretary Thomas White. The Democrats get to run against Harvey Pitt, who, whatever his skills as S.E.C. chairman, must be the most politically tone-deaf man to serve in Washington since Earl Butz, who memorably justified junk-food school lunch programs by declaring that ketchup is a vegetable. Mr. Pitt is the man who took office promising a "kinder, gentler" S.E.C., who spent his first year recusing himself because every other case involved former clients, and who then told Congress he was willing to do his job from now on if he got a 20 percent pay raise and cabinet status. The Democratic National Committee could not have invented Harvey Pitt. 
And what of Mr. Bush's future? A lot can happen in two years, of course, and he seems to lead a charmed life. (For a while this summer it even looked as if Martha Stewart was going to take a bullet for him. The TV and tabloid fascination with her stock dealings briefly obscured the president's complacency.) But at the rate he's going, Mr. Bush will be lucky to steal a second term.

Finally, Let's Train a Generation of Women Electricians

BYLINE:  By DOROTHY SAMUELS 

 BODY:
One of my least favorite high school memories -- right up there with nearly flunking 10th-grade geometry -- involves my two semesters taking home economics. This was the required course in sewing, cooking, social etiquette and smart supermarket shopping to which girls of my era were routinely subjected while the boys in our grade took an introductory shop class.
 Under the guidance of Mrs. Saxon, the school's well-meaning home ec instructor, we girls learned to make brownies from scratch and practiced walking slowly with a book on our heads in preparation for the humiliating term-end fashion show in which we had to model the misshapen garments we had created using paper patterns purchased at the local Woolworth's. Meanwhile, the boys were being taught things I found a lot more compelling -- cool stuff like how to use a jigsaw and the secret of repairing a broken socket without getting electrocuted. 
 It was the late 1960's, and a lot of old societal assumptions were being rethought, but not as yet the ones that decreed that the girls at my Long Island high school all needed to learn how to make cakes, not repair lamps.
These memories were stirred by a troubling new report by the National Women's Law Center. Based on data from 12 states, including New York and California, the report documents the startling degree to which the same sort of gender-based assumptions that excluded me from shop class some 30-odd years ago still flourish, with the result that in much of the country, high school vocational and technical courses remain nearly as segregated by sex as they were in my day. 
According to the report, for example, girls make up 96 percent of the students enrolled in cosmetology courses, 86 percent of students taking courses to become health aides and 87 percent of those taking child care courses. Meanwhile, more than 90 percent of the students enrolled in carpentry, automotive and plumbing courses are boys. In one of the states examined, Florida, fully 99 percent of those studying for the beauty trades are female, and every single plumbing student was male. 
The vocational and training courses surveyed in the report provide job preparation for youngsters who, for one reason or another, are not following the regular academic track. By keeping female students clustered in traditionally female programs, schools are relegating them to lower-wage careers, compromising their future earning power with potentially devastating consequences for their ability to support themselves, much less a family. 
Adding insult, the education offered by the traditionally female programs is often inferior. A review of New York City's highly sex-segregated vocational programs last year by the same group, for example, found that predominantly female schools offered almost no advanced math or science courses, in contrast to the predominantly male schools, some of which even boasted special programs providing entry into high-paying computer technology jobs -- training not available in the predominantly female schools.
Thanks largely to Title IX, the 30-year-old law that bars sex discrimination in any federally funded education program, the past few decades have seen big advances in young women's participation in competitive sports. But as the report sadly suggests, the nation still lags in living up to the law's promise when it comes to ensuring male and female students equal access to vocational programs critical for seizing higher-paying job opportunities. 
Defenders of the status quo tend to explain away the stark pattern of sex segregation in high school vocational programs as simply a matter of "personal preference." Doubtless individual taste is a factor. But as the report notes, so are recruitment drives that convey the message -- with varying degrees of subtlety -- that female students are not welcome. So, too, is steering by teachers and guidance counselors, who fail to help young women fully understand their range of options, or to encourage their entry into higher-paid fields where women remain woefully underrepresented. "Personal preference," I recall, is the same excuse that was trotted out not long ago to explain why there were so few women lawyers, physicians and veterinarians. That, of course, was before access and attitudes changed, and women responded by pursuing those professions in droves.
All these years later, I would still choose to take shop rather than home economics. Recently, though, I found myself telling my 13-year-old son, who was in the process of burning the scrambled eggs he was making, that it was important for him to learn some basic cooking skills. Mrs. Saxon would be proud, I thought.

HEADLINE: A Sudden Rush To Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
With Congress close to final approval of a bill supported by the White House to overhaul the bankruptcy system, lawyers and consumers groups today predicted a rush of bankruptcy filings by people seeking to erase their credit card bills and other debts before the tougher rules take effect.
 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday by Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the House and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for Americans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy. 
 After the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun to receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to file bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.
"I've had plenty of calls this morning," said Gary F. Weltmann, a consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. "And I'm telling people that they need to take action now." 
Marty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was "getting ready for the onslaught."
"I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules," he said.
The White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill, which was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in the Senate next week. 
"The president looks forward to signing that," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. "That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support for good reasons." 
The bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate conference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more than a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday after agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final obstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a result of clinic protests.
The bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card and banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the bankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to pay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up 19 percent from 2000.
"This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our bankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one while cracking down on those who don't," said Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
Critics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a gift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign contributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do harm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost jobs, poor health or divorce.
The bill's opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage, which comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive accounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of the same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for the bankruptcy bill.
"The timing couldn't be worse," said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. "It takes a lot of gall for Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are concerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky." 
Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of the bill, said today that "it boggles the mind that at a time when Americans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need of protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major financial safety net in our society for the middle class."
Bankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and middle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take them years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free "fresh start" that many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.
Recent studies have shown that the average American filing for bankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average of about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last year showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that was six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had medical debts exceeding $1,000.
"I won't deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system," said Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the Bankruptcy Center. "But there are honest, hard-working folks who are really going to be affected by these changes."
The bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes in their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the federal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their unsecured debts, like credit card bills.
Debtors with an income above the state median would be barred from filing under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead under Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be repaid over time under the court-administered plan.
Mr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would "hurt a lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7."
"My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and they've just got heavy debt," he said. "You can always find some circumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and got themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old poor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that the credit card companies make to Congress."

HEADLINE: Russian Tea Room to Close After Tomorrow's Dinner 

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The Russian Tea Room, that storied preserve of infused vodka, glinting caviar and buttery blini that was for decades a clubby watering hole for the city's bolderati, announced its closing yesterday, less than three years after its spectacular but ill-fated $30 million renovation.
 The flamboyant restaurateur Warner LeRoy, who hoped to reinvent the Tea Room as a variant on his hugely successful Tavern on the Green, died a little more than a year after reopening the restaurant at 150 West 57th Street, a six-story Italianate brownstone squeezed between two large buildings. It will close after dinner tomorrow. 
 LeRoy's daughter Jennifer, whom he had handpicked to become the restaurant's chief executive, was in the end unable to summon the requisite dazzle and ballyhoo to keep the high-maintenance property afloat as a theme restaurant and tourist draw.
"Only Warner could make it something old and something new," said Clark Wolf, a New York-based restaurant consultant. "I guess he was the only one who had that kind of life force." 
Some may suggest that the closing marks the passing of a restaurant age that was rich in history and character, but the Tea Room era actually passed with the shuttering of the original restaurant in 1996 for a nearly four-year, Perils-of-Pauline, down-to-the-studs reconstruction, according to Tim Zagat, chairman of Zagat Survey.
"A large part of its greatness came before Warner took it over," Mr. Zagat said. "In those days, it was a place of wonderful spirit and ambiance. It was a home away from home for many people in the theater, show business and the arts."
He added, "I hope that someone, somehow will find a way to revive it soon and operate it in a matter of months."
But although there had been rumors of potential buyers in the Tea Room's waning weeks, yesterday's announcement "was very serious and very sad," said Shelley Clark, a Tea Room spokeswoman. After giving the news to the 17 managers after lunch, Ms. LeRoy, 23 and the chief executive of the restaurant's parent company, LeRoy Adventures, gathered much of the staff of 170 late in the afternoon and told them.
"My family and I inherited our father's ambitious dream for the Russian Tea Room, and we did everything in our power to realize his vision," she said in a statement afterward. "Unfortunately, like so many other restaurants, the Russian Tea Room suffered from the slowing national economy and the tragic events of 9/11."
Ms. Clark said that the company's other dazzle palace, Tavern on the Green, the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States according to Nation's Restaurant News, "will not be affected in any way by the closing, and will look forward to seeing Tea Room patrons there."
The Tea Room lost its principal financing in the third quarter of last year, when Vornado Realty Trust, which had been a 50-50 investor, wrote off its nonmanagerial investment of $7.374 million as a loss, according to Howard J. Rubenstein, Vornado's spokesman. 
"Vornado invested in the Russian Tea Room and it turned out to be a failed investment as a result of Warner LeRoy's untimely death last year," Mr. Rubenstein said.
Neither LeRoy nor the managers who succeeded him were able to summon the ghost of the Tea Room past. "For many years it functioned as a semiprivate club," said Malcolm M. Knapp, a restaurant analyst in Manhattan. "But it took so long for Warner to reopen it that it broke the rhythm of the whole club idea, and Warner couldn't capture the original spirit."
"It became a tourist and event place for corporations," he said, then became a victim of economic cutbacks in private parties, and the decline in overseas tourism. It had high overhead costs, and they weren't making their sales numbers."
The restaurant began as, literally, a tea room in the 1920's. In reputation, RTR, as addicts called the place, was on a par with the Stork Club and the Algonquin Round Table. Flaunting a stage-Russian flair that appealed to its fiercely loyal patrons, the original Tea Room was dominated by red-red banquettes, shimmery samovars and year-round Christmas ornaments whose wacky ubiquity announced an ambiance of festive eccentricity.
Many of the legendary goings-on there may actually have happened: Leonard Bernstein writing the opening refrain of "Fancy Free"; Madonna in the coat-check room (she was fired); the timely escape from a back door of the Shah of Iran's sister to duck an irate crowd; and Zero Mostel swathing himself in an apron to take orders from diners for, as he put it, "peasant under glass." 
It was, of course, the place where Elizabeth Taylor had to show off her new bauble from Richard Burton: a diamond as big as the Ritz. Then there was the time that a weeping Sol Hurok entered the Tea Room, announcing that he had just emerged from the most touching film he'd ever seen: "The Sol Hurok Story. 
From its initial clientele of musicians and dancers warped from the vortex of Carnegie Hall next door, it became the place for agents, writers, actors, stars and celebrity-gazers to, well, be. Sitting within listening range of agent Sam Cohn's booth -- Table 1 -- was to attain nirvana.
"Now where is Tootsie going to have lunch?" asked Mr. Clark, referring the character played by Dustin Hoffman in the 1982 movie about an obnoxious actor who dresses as a woman for lunch at the Tea Room and fools his agent.
Warner LeRoy bought the restaurant in 1995 from its longtime owner, Faith Stewart-Gordon, who chronicled its zenith years in a 1999 memoir, "The Russian Tea Room: A Love Story."
LeRoy, the son of Hollywood pioneers, was the kind of showman who, leaving a $48 million estate at his death in February 2001, also left orders to spend some of it on "a great fun memorial party." If anyone could make the Tea Room a competitor for Tavern on the Green, foodies said, it was Warner LeRoy.
But he may have miscalculated from the beginning. "Tavern is unique in its look, location and the size of the large-scale parties it can handle," said Mr. Knapp, adding: "Tea Room just wasn't the same."
Nevertheless, LeRoy embarked on a War-and-Peace of a renovation that was fraught with delay, rumor and controversy, not the least of which was a failed development partnership with the four-star chef David Bouley.
After the new Tea Room opened, for a time there was stretch-limo-lock on West 57th Street, and there were some generous restaurant reviews. But many critics found the upgrade long on visual spectacle and short on menu appeal. "From Russia, with kitsch," was the pronouncement of Gourmet magazine. And William Grimes in The New York Times termed the redo "appalling," noting the giant acrylic bear that dominated the upstairs dining hall and terming much of the menu "a dreary slog."
But if there are many who will forever regret the demise of the old Tea Room, there are some who will miss aspects of the new Tea Room as well. "After he died," Mr. Zagat said, "I could still feel Warner's spirit whenever I was there."

HEADLINE: The State of Puerto Rico 

 BODY:
More than three million Americans -- some 800,000 of them New Yorkers -- have roots in Puerto Rico, but to many other Americans the island is an enigma, a place where they are likely to take their passports, which are not needed, but not a knowledge of Spanish, which often is. So it comes as little surprise that as Puerto Rico marked a milestone this week with official fanfare attended by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a New York City contingent, there was little notice of the event on the mainland.
 It was the 50th anniversary of the commonwealth, a status conferred on Puerto Rico to allow self-government and end its days as a colonial prize won by the United States in the Spanish-American War. And while cannons boomed and music and dance made for a festive party, the relationship being marked is showing signs of strain. 
 With its mix of limited benefits and obligations of United States citizenship, the commonwealth status has endured by default. Several nonbinding plebiscites the island has held over the years have failed to produce an acceptable alternative.
The ambivalence is significant in Puerto Rico, where political and civic involvement permeate the lives of its 3.8 million people. A thundering drum roll of rallies, car-mounted loudspeakers and personal canvassing regularly result in voter turnouts of about 80 percent. On an island of strong opinions, the status debate generates much shaking, sometimes even violence, but not much movement.
Puerto Ricans born on the island -- like those born on the mainland -- are United States citizens. Island residents pay Social Security taxes, but no federal income tax. They cannot vote in presidential elections and they have no vote on the floor of Congress. While the island has a Constitution and self-government, Washington controls matters involving defense, transportation, communication, immigration and foreign trade.
As a commonwealth, Puerto Rico retains its Spanish language and culture, even as it blends in American life. But the limits of the status quo -- in which Puerto Rico does not get the full benefits of statehood nor the advantages of fuller sovereignty -- have been blamed for creating a situation where the per capita income is lower than that of any state in the Union. Tax breaks given to American companies that set up shop overseas are being phased out for Puerto Rico, many companies have left and unemployment is in double digits. Anger at the United States found a flashpoint in recent years on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, used for target practice by the Navy. Tempers barely cooled when President Bush announced last year that the Navy would withdraw in May 2003.
Now Puerto Rico is looking for a new deal. Its governor, Sila Calderon, wants more sovereignty and economic opportunity, including control over foreign trade, but statehood advocates refuse to join her efforts to reach consensus on a proposal for change. So she is showing Puerto Rican political muscle elsewhere, heading a drive to register all eligible voters among Puerto Ricans living on the mainland, many of them in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida. All that will help to get the attention of members of Congress, who must approve any change for the commonwealth. But the first step, a re-examination of what is best for Puerto Rico, must begin there. And so far, that kind of introspection has been limited, tortured and inconclusive.

HEADLINE: Jobs for New York, Performed in Ghana 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "In New York Tickets, Ghana Sees Orderly City" (front page, July 22) implies that outsourcing suppliers who have offshore service centers are hurting New York City and America. I say, "Au contraire." 
 Outsourcing allows companies to get non-core jobs done a lot more cheaply and as well as or better than if they did it themselves. The outsourcing supplier can charge less because the women in Ghana are doing the data input. 
Today, most outsourcing suppliers rely on this labor arbitrage; they can employ well-trained workers who are thrilled to work at the top of their country's pay scale, which happens to be far lower than ours. 
Judging from the article, this work is having a wonderful impact on Ghana's economy. If patriotism is important, native Americans have formed outsourcing companies to provide the same labor arbitrage on our shores.

 It is outrageous that, in these times, New York City is outsourcing jobs to Ghana, more than 5,000 miles away (front page, July 22). 
 In the aftermath of Sept. 11, New York City has a 7 percent unemployment rate. Thousands of New Yorkers are looking for jobs, and the city is giving away jobs to other states and countries.
Furthermore, there is no accountability in contracting out. In this age of cyber-terrorism, personal and potentially sensitive information is being transmitted across continents. Who is assuming responsibility for the security of this information?

HEADLINE: Pressure on Companies Using Tax Dodge 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Pressure on companies that acquire a Bermuda mailbox as part of a strategy to earn tax-free profits in the United States increased yesterday with the California state treasurer and the president of the top labor organization attacking the moves.
 In a surprise move last night, the House approved an amendment to the bill that would create a Department of Homeland Security. The change would forbid the department to contract with companies that establish an offshore headquarters to evade American taxes. Page A8. 
 Union leaders plan a rally Tuesday outside the New York Stock Exchange to denounce the Bermuda deals as unpatriotic, damaging to employees and shareholders and a central issue in corporate corruption. State treasurers will gather in New York on Aug. 12, where H. Carl McCall, the New York comptroller, will ask them to consider actions against companies that use or plan to use an offshore mailbox to escape taxes on their American profits.
The first state treasurer to do so, Philip Angelides of California, issued an order Thursday banning 19 companies that use the tax dodge, including Ingersoll-Rand, from state contracts that are under his control and from selling their commercial paper to the state's $45 billion pooled fund for state and local governments.
Mr. Angelides said he would also ask trustees at the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, and the California State Teachers Retirement System, or Calstrs, the largest and third-largest pension funds in the country, respectively, to sell all $752 million of stock in the 19 companies.
"A company that would deliberately do a sham relocation offshore to escape taxes," Mr. Angelides said, "would also look to bend environmental rules, shortchange workers or even stick it to their shareholders.
Mr. Angelides, a former real estate developer, added: "The danger in their thinking is that if everyone does it, then it undermines the economy as a whole. The issue is how do you change the culture of thinking that you do not have to play fair? You have to start with the most odious of practices, those that on their face strike most Americans as wrong, and the Bermuda business certainly does that."
Ingersoll-Rand will seek a meeting with Mr. Angelides in hopes of persuading him to change his policy, said Paul Dickard, a spokesman.
Last night, John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., wrote Stanley Works directors asking them to stop trying to acquire a Bermuda mail drop "before you inflict serious harm on Stanley Works, its shareholders and employees."
Escaping taxes through a Bermuda deal is "particularly inflammatory at a time when American workers and domestic companies are being asked to finance the war on terrorism with their tax dollars," Mr. Sweeney wrote.
On Monday, Mr. Sweeney and Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the International Association of Machinists, and union members plan to gather outside a Stanley Works factory in New Britain, Conn., to protest the Bermuda plan.
The two also plan to deliver a letter to John M. Trani, the chief executive. Mr. Trani will not be in town, but Peter Duda, a spokesman, said that Mr. Trani would be delighted to meet with the union leaders. Mr. Sweeney will speak outside the stock exchange on Tuesday.
Following are the 19 companies and their working headquarters on Mr. Angelides's list, as well as 3 companies that plan to use a Bermuda offshore address:
Accenture (Chicago); APW (Waukesha, Wis.); Cooper Industries (Houston); the Everest Reinsurance Group (Liberty Corner, N.J.); Foster Wheeler (Clinton, N.J); Global SantaFe (Dallas); Gold Reserve (Spokane, Wash.); Helen of Troy Cosmetics (El Paso); Ingersoll-Rand (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.); Leucadia National (New York, pending); McDermott International (New Orleans); Monday Ltd. (New York); Nabors Industries (Houston); Noble Drilling (Sugar Land, Tex.); PXRE Group (Edison, N.J.); Stanley Works (New Britain, Conn., pending); Treansocean Offshore (Houston); Tyco International (Exeter, N.H.); Veritas DGC (Houston, pending); Weatherford International (Houston); White Mountains Insurance (White River Junction, Vt.); and Xoma (Berkeley, Calif.). 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 30, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about pressure on companies that have acquired offshore addresses to reduce taxes misspelled the name of an oil drilling contractor that is among 19 companies barred by the California state treasurer from receiving contracts that he controls. It is Transocean, not Treansocean. Because of an editing error, a list of companies that use offshore addresses or plan to do so misstated the locations for five. Transocean, Global SantaFe and Noble Drilling use the Cayman Islands; Gold Reserve uses Canada; and McDermott International uses Panama. None use Bermuda.

HEADLINE: Russia to Go On Building Nuclear Reactors in Iran 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 26 

 BODY:
The Russian government, brushing aside the Bush administration's concerns, indicated today that it planned to continue building new nuclear reactors in Iran like one that American officials have repeatedly warned could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
 Russia's assistance in building a nuclear plant in the Iranian city of Bushehr, near the Persian Gulf, has been a nagging irritant in relations with the United States for years. It produced the sourest note in otherwise friendly meetings between President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin here in May. 
 While administration officials have pressed Russia to break its contract to complete a 1,000-megawatt reactor at Bushehr, a document approved this week by Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov and announced today outlined plans to build three more reactors at the site.
The document also indicated that Russia would offer to build two more reactors at a new nuclear power station at Ahwaz, a city about 60 miles from Iran's border with Iraq. 
That appeared to contradict remarks earlier this month by Russia's atomic energy minister, Aleksandr Y. Rumyantsev, who said the cooperation with Iran in developing its nuclear-power industry would end with the project at Bushehr.
Russia, like Iran, has repeatedly dismissed the American concerns about the project, insisting that it was a purely civilian effort to develop new energy sources. But the Bush administration, which has labeled Iran part of an "axis of evil" along with Iraq and North Korea, fears that the Iranians will use Russian equipment and expertise to pursue a secret program to produce nuclear weapons that could threaten Europe and the United States.
Russia's plans were released on the government's official Web site today, without public comment, as part of a draft outlining potential areas of economic, industrial and scientific cooperation with Iran over the next 10 years.
The prospect of more Russian assistance is certain to provoke new warnings from the United States and may undercut the close relationship that has developed between Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush, especially since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.
In recent months Russian officials have sought to defuse the Bush administration's complaints, saying Russia would insist that Iran return the plutonium produced as a byproduct of nuclear power generation to prevent it from being used in weapons. After their meetings in May, Mr. Bush said Mr. Putin had assured him that Russia would press Iran to allow extensive international inspections of the plant.
Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has previously said it will cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which oversees the world's civilian nuclear power programs.
In Washington, administration officials said Russian cooperation with Iran's nuclear energy program would be on the agenda next week when Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham leads an American delegation to Russia to discuss energy and nuclear proliferation issues.
"Our concerns with regards to Russian cooperation with Iran on the issue of Bushehr are well known," said Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the National Security Council. "We have expressed them in public as well as in private directly to Russian President Putin. And we will continue to work with Russia on proliferation issues of concern."
After today's announcement, the chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, Dmitri O. Rogozin, said Russia's plans should not hurt relations with the United States since Moscow shared Washington's worries. "Neither Russia nor the United States is interested in other countries' use of peaceful nuclear technologies for military purposes," he told the Interfax news agency.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT PUSHES TRADE LEGISLATION IN VISIT TO CAPITOL 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
Hours after House and Senate negotiators reached a surprise breakthrough on a broad trade bill, President Bush made a rare visit to the Capitol today to rally House Republicans behind the measure, which he said was essential for economic growth.
 Mr. Bush huddled with fellow party members in a closed-door caucus, trying to ensure the success of a package that had been deadlocked for years and still faces resistance in the House. House and Senate negotiators agreed late Thursday night to give the president the right to make trade deals that Congress could not change but only ratify or reject, which would amount to a major victory for the president. 
 "We're going to get a free trade agreement," Mr. Bush told reporters as he left the Capitol late this afternoon trailed by an entourage of his senior staff. "We're going to get a free trade agreement, which is very important for jobs and workers, very important for our farmers and ranchers, and it's very important for our economy."
But it was a sign of how contentious trade issues are in the politically polarized House that by late tonight, even the president's direct plea had not sealed the deal. With the House pushing to go into an August recess, Republican leaders were still trying to quell several rebellions and turf wars and had not yet brought the measure up for debate. 
The negotiating power Mr. Bush seeks was held by five earlier presidents but expired in 1994. President Clinton never succeeded in convincing Congress that the negotiation authority should be renewed, in part because of concern among Democrats that trade deals cost American jobs and lower environmental standards.
Mr. Bush has always put expanding international trade near the top of his economic agenda. In recent weeks, he has stepped up pressure on Congress to pass the trade bill on the grounds that it would help the economy recover from last year's recession and restore confidence at a time when the stock market is sinking -- even though the fruits of any trade deals are years away.
Besides granting broader trade negotiating authority to the president, the agreement, reached just before midnight Thursday, breaks significant new ground for American workers. It creates a program of subsidized health insurance, in addition to other benefits for Americans who are displaced by foreign competition. The measure calls for the government to pay 65 percent of the health insurance costs for such workers in the form of refundable tax credits.
Passage of the trade package is considered assured in the Senate, which plans to take it up it next week. But trade is always a difficult issue in the House, which passed its own version of the bill by just one vote last year. While House and Senate negotiators were able to reconcile their different versions on Thursday night, Republican leaders in the House were wary that the compromise could lose support during the August recess; they spent the day furiously trying to round up votes and pass the measure tonight. 
Senior administration officials -- including Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Robert B. Zoelleck, Mr. Bush's chief trade negotiator --worked by the side of Republican officials in the Capitol twisting arms of wavering Republican and trying to solve problems. Representative William M. Thomas, a California Republican who as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee was instrumental in negotiating the accord, said Mr. Bush himself had made a brief but direct pitch to party members. "He basically said, I want it because the American people need it," Mr. Thomas said.
But despite the president's direct intervention, internecine Republican battles went on well into the evening as Republican members of the Appropriations Committee threatened to vote against the bill because it usurped some of their powers to control spending.
The pact also caused a sharp split among Democrats, which could have repercussions in the party's presidential primary in 2004. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, called the legislation "a very strong bill for workers adversely affected by trade."
But Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, was critical of it and said House Democrats would work to defeat it. The two Democratic leaders rarely disagree on major issues. 
Organized labor, already running ads against such trade legislation in eight major states, promptly began lobbying against it. John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "Working people have watched unfair trade deals and growing trade deficits send millions of family-supporting jobs overseas to nations where corporations can abuse workers' rights, child labor and the environment."
Democrats who were disappointed by the agreement argued that the health care tax credits would not ensure that displaced workers would be able to afford coverage in the private health market.
Democratic aides were working hard to keep most of their party voting against the bill as a tactic to force Republicans from vulnerable textile and steel areas to cast a vote for the bill that could be used against them in the election.
For years Congress has been unable to pass trade negotiating authority because of discontent among many lawmakers with the North American Free Trade Agreement and deepening concern, particularly among House Democrats, about the costs of free trade.
Lawmakers attributed the surprise agreement, in part, to the concerns about the stock market and the economy -- and the desire of Republicans to support the president on economic matters. In past years, Republicans had resisted tying a trade bill to a worker assistance package, but they moved toward the position of the Democrats in the last two years. The final agreement split the difference between the 70 percent tax credit for health insurance offered by the Senate, and a 60 percent tax credit offered by the House. 
In fact, both parties were already putting forward new economic measures with an eye toward the fall elections at back-to-back news conferences. Democratic leaders promoted their ideas for retirement security, including tough penalties on senior executives who mismanage corporate pension funds.
Republicans countered with their proposals, including the forfeiture of assets of corrupt executives.

 A THING (OR TWO) ABOUT CURTIS AND CAMILLA
By Nick Fowler.
398 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $24.95.
 NICK FOWLER'S rueful, funny first novel is the latest in a long American line of Wounded (White) Man fiction. Curtis Birnbaum, a balding Manhattan rock musician, recovering from drug addiction and fantasizing about a record contract, woos the beautiful Camilla Fell, then loses and pines for her. As in any decent Wounded Man story, Birnbaum must come to terms with a weak and withholding father (actually, two weak fathers, his own and Camilla's) and a punishing mother (a minor, extravagant, satisfying character).
"A Thing (or Two) About Curtis and Camilla" is pretty current in its social observations, and holds the promise of news from the world of Contemporary Wounded Men. So what has changed since Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Cheever recorded the pressures and repression weighing down a sensitive middle-class man trying to make it in a capitalist world? As Fowler tells it, the pressures haven't changed much -- a man's still simultaneously worried about performing, dodging gold diggers and scraping together enough money to start a family -- but as for repression, there isn't any anymore. By now we're all used to anything going, sexually speaking; even children know the score. In beautifully economical flashbacks, we learn that Birnbaum, who wasn't shielded from the sexual bitterness his parents flung at each other, was already a Wounded Boy. Now, in this age of It's O.K. for a man to cry, anything goes emotionally too, so Curtis spews and spills. His insecurities make him a good comic character -- one mark of the New Wounded Man is how he revels in his own humiliations -- but sometimes his gooey excesses (especially in the early lovey-dovey pages with Camilla) can be downright embarrassing. A reader gets through the pap, though, since the story in general is informed by a pretty irresistible delight in its own telling.
Fowler's playfulness encompasses a (by now familiar) range of visual and narrative tricks: mini-chapters, footnotes (any veteran of fiction workshops will attest that footnotes are certainly popular nowadays), song lyrics, photos (including a tiny one of -- no kidding -- Don DeLillo). The book designer, Justin Salvas, has a deft, light touch, but Fowler's not in it just for the graphic pleasures. His invocation of his literary heroes is a joy: he calls on William Blake (who flashes the twin themes of innocence and experience), T. S. Eliot (who signals the bleak moments), and that mini-poster boy DeLillo (for whom Curtis and Camilla share a passion that's something of an aesthetic mystery, given Birnbaum's own narrative predilections). 
J. D. Salinger is another of his heroes, which makes sense, given Curtis's tender and protective impulses. Those impulses tend to arise most often around a 9-year-old girl named Little Green ("after that Joni Mitchell song"), Curtis's Salingeresque neighbor. Sophisticated, charming, smart, dangerously close to too cute, Little is also a vulnerable child, one Curtis would certainly be happy to catch in the rye. Her trust enables him to extend the story of his own wounding into a meditation on childhood in "these graceless days." Little also allows Curtis more opportunity to report the news from New York's funny pages, his satiric chronicle of life in Lower Manhattan sharpening as it takes on an increasingly absurd tone. My favorite scenes involve the locker room at Crunch, the Lafayette Street gym; an overheard cellphone conversation Curtis follows through the streets; and sidewalk table-gazing at Time Cafe (Time with a capital T is a central motif ).
Camilla is a classic tragic love object: gorgeous, mysterious, tortured by some elusive secret. As she is a blue-eyed black woman, her first appearance signals, perhaps, some concern with race. (Curtis asks, "What's it like going through life so beautiful?" She replies, "It's like if I asked you what it's like to be white.") But the subject does not come up between them again. On a questionnaire Curtis sends, Camilla lists favorite movies by white male directors, books by white male writers (O.K., I admit there's one on the list by a woman -- Annie Proulx -- and obviously plenty of black women admire music and art by white men. But the mirror-imaging of Curtis's white-guy tastes and the absence of any competing sensibility is just a little suspicious). When Curtis asks if she's taken a class in feminist studies, Camilla says she "found the 'subject' boring and despotic." A lot of young women are scared off by the word "feminist" these days, but given Camilla's horrific sexual history, that quick exchange seems (if I may use an unfeminist term) too easy.
Birnbaum's fictional world, however, appears to have miraculously got past the point where feminism or ethnicity or race matters. (Curtis doesn't make a huge thing of his Jewishness, and he describes a woman as "half Asian or something, so hard to tell in these mongrel days.") Then, near story's end, he notices a poster of Mike Tyson, "our modern Grendel." The reader is about to meet Camilla's father, another black man who's something of a monster. Equal opportunity for bad guys? Or is this novel finally about to rush headlong into tricky old questions of race and sexual power? It's just the moment when you want a novelist to face what he's created head-on, but Fowler ducks even as he's pushing into dangerous territory.
Camilla's father is an outrageous, pathetic, bizarre character who brings the novel to a gonzo finish but doesn't make all that much sense as father of the woman we've seen throughout the book, or even as the ending to Curtis's story. Fowler is switching tracks from Wounded White Man to Wounded Black Woman, which leaves a lot of serious ground to cover -- but at this point, structurally speaking, the novel's about to arrive at its final destination. So the big serious psychosexual issues have to be compressed into a couple of (pretty weird) dramatic scenes. This funny novel, most successful in Curtis's absurd and playful moments, ends on a disturbing, off-key note. Yet Fowler attacks the conclusion of his story with a kind of crazy courage, and you can see in his straining how he might be exploring what he'll take on next time out.
Nick Fowler is an expansive, lyrical, inventive writer. Given the ambitions of this novel, I imagine he'll end up thrashing around again with tricky and troubling characters -- not to mention ideas about the ways men and women wound each other and their children. At the risk of sounding like Curtis's demanding mom (or a despotic feminist), I hope he takes them on.

HEADLINE: And Bear In Mind

 BODY:
 (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)

YOU ARE NOT A STRANGER HERE, by Adam Haslett. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.95.) These nine short stories (Haslett's first collection) exhale a desiccated bleakness, a despair mitigated by the characters' continuing desire to be good, to do the right thing despite hopelessness, loss, disease and frequent mental illness.

FRAGRANT HARBOR, by John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $25.95.) A novel of large scope, placed chiefly in Hong Kong in 1935 and after, undertaking big propositions: race, class, love, war and, perhaps most successfully, the transformation of a refugee community into one of the world's richest societies.

THE MONK DOWNSTAIRS, by Tim Farrington. (HarperSanFrancisco, $22.95.) A tender, witty novel in which a former monk, after 20 years in his order, rents an apartment from a 38-year-old single mother; the ensuing relationship grows cautiously, taking account of the prudence required of struggling people who aren't going to get that many more chances.

MUSSOLINI, by R. J. B. Bosworth. (Oxford University, $35.) A historian's judicious examination of the dictator who helped create Fascism from a mix of socialism and nationalism; he ruled Italy for 21 years, losing touch with reality when he became dependent on Hitler and too well acquainted with war.

THE WHORE'S CHILD: And Other Stories, by Richard Russo. (Knopf, $24.) In these short stories the author of "Empire Falls," this year's Pulitzer Prize novel, abandons working-class settings and protagonists in favor of intellectuals caught in late middle age, worried about illness and ambivalent about marriage.

THE WINTER ZOO, by John Beckman. (Holt, $25.) The hero of this first novel, a young man newly arrived in Poland from Iowa, trades his naivete for lessons in youthfulness; Beckman captures the rush of freshly liberated desires in post-Communist Europe, making his climactic scene a pansexual orgy in a Cracow hotel.

PRAGUE, by Arthur Phillips. (Random House, $24.95.) A first novel set in 1990, far beyond the recently fallen Berlin Wall, where young Americans reveal themselves not as travelers but mere tourists, detached from their surroundings, weightless and immaterial among time-battered buildings and people who have survived wars and uprisings.

HALF IN LOVE: Stories, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $23.) Fourteen stories, set mostly in the author's native Montana, among small-time racetracks and failed oil wells, where brides choose wedding dresses to hide branding-iron scars; no one expects an easy life here, and even the young feel their choices constrained by economics and losing habits.

IRIS ORIGO: Marchesa of Val d'Orcia, by Caroline Moorehead. (Godine, $35.) A fascinating biography of a remarkable woman, an Anglo-American heiress who became the lady of a big estate in Tuscany, where she knew everybody, worked hard, taught peasants to read, helped people escape Fascism and wrote beautifully on many subjects.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Airline Food Still in Flux

BYLINE:  By SUSAN CATTO; SUSAN CATTO contributes to The Times from Toronto.

 BODY:
WHEN airlines began cutting back on food service last fall, some analysts predicted it would be only a matter of time before competitive pressures forced a return of the foil-wrapped entree, or some approximation of it. The analysts were right -- sort of.
 In recent weeks, several airlines have changed their policies again, restoring or upgrading their food service. Continental has introduced larger portions and better cuts of chicken on its trans-Atlantic flights. United has restored its breakfast service, even on short flights. American Trans Air has introduced hot snacks. First-class and business-class meals are nearly as ubiquitous as they were this time last year. Is this a return to the days of fully catered flying? 
 Not exactly. According to Robert Mann, president of R. W. Mann & Company, an airline analysis and consultation business in Port Washington, N.Y., "We're far more likely to see meals as they have been known and pilloried go away" as airlines continue to cut costs. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that American Airlines was considering taking away meals entirely on domestic flights.
Commenting on the report, Todd Burke, a spokesman for the airline, said: "To say that we're evaluating food service is certainly a true statement, but we're absolutely not planning to pull food from our flights." 
What is likely to continue, at American and elsewhere, is a balancing act between the airlines' quest for efficiency and the passengers' need for food.
When the major airlines removed meals from most short domestic flights, airport restaurants and fast-food outlets sprang up to feed passengers. Hotels and services such as Los Angeles-based SkyMeals started offering airplane-ready meals to go, for a price. (A sample SkyMeals entree: flash-seared ahi tuna with wasabi aioli, sesame ginger dressing, jicama, orange and cilantro salad, cucumber, zucchini and avocado. Cost: $32.50, including delivery to your home or office.)
Yet even experienced fliers had problems adjusting. Paul Williams, a travel consultant at Linden Travel in New York, started advising his clients to pack meals after a foodless day of travel last November. He left his house at 4 a.m. to catch a flight to Tucson, Ariz. The flight was late and he had to rush to make his connection in Dallas.
"I didn't pack anything and I was absolutely starving at the end of the trip," Mr. Williams said. Now he tells his clients to bring their own food, even if they have a lengthy layover.

X-Raying the Cheeseburgers
Passengers planning to take their own food, however, have sometimes been stymied by airport security, according to Mr. Mann. "The presumed alternative to having airlines serve you a meal is to buy something to bring along and eat that," he said. "Unfortunately with this unfolding security environment, which is highly random and highly irrational, you don't know whether you're going to be able to bring anything on board."
Packed food and drinks are usually permitted if they can go through X-ray machines without spilling, but Mr. Mann said he had heard of passengers being told to consume or discard beverages before proceeding. More commonly, guards have asked passengers to sip drinks, unwrap sandwiches and open cartons to prove their contents are harmless. Besides that, early-morning departures and closely timed connections can make it impossible for passengers to eat before or between flights.
Nevertheless, more meals per flight are being served now than six months ago, and sympathy for passenger hunger isn't the only reason airlines are re-evaluating the importance of food. They've discovered that a hungry passenger is an irritable one, more likely to complain, drink too much or be dissatisfied with the airline. That's a reason Continental decided not to cut back meals, according to Julie King, a spokeswoman. Instead, she said, the airline has sought savings in areas, like refinancing loans, that have no direct impact on the customer.
That strategy is one thing that has kept Paul Tauger, a lawyer in Costa Mesa, Calif., loyal to Continental. "I refuse to fly American Airlines now because they will not give you a meal domestically on most flights," he says. "I get bored on flights and I can't sleep. The meal breaks it up, so I like to get the meal," he says.
Meals serve the same function as the on-board movie, Mr. Mann, the consultant, said. "They occupy people and keep them in their seats." The meals-as-entertainment theory is borne out at AirlineMeals.net, where flying foodies with digital cameras post photos, analyze entrees with the zealotry of restaurant critics, and vote on the Meal of the Month. (June's favorite: a juicy-looking steak with potatoes and spinach from Austria-based Lauda Air.)

Rundown on Policies
So how can you tell if you'll be fed on your next flight?
For one thing, you'll need to fly during mealtime. You're unlikely to get lunch on a three-hour flight departing at 2 p.m. or dinner on a flight after 9 p.m., but even the definition of mealtime depends on the individual airline. "Mealtime varies from market to market depending on competitive factors and how long the flight is," said Kurt Ebenhoch of Northwest Airlines. The rules are constantly in flux, but here is a general guide to economy-class policies at individual airlines as of early this month.
American: No meal service on main-cabin domestic flights under four hours, with the following exceptions. Meals are served on flights between Chicago or Dallas and the West Coast. Meals are also served on selected routes to and from Northeastern cities, including flights between Dallas and these cities: Hartford, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington.
American Trans Air: Hot snacks (breakfast pastry or pizza pocket, for example) on most flights three hours or longer and on all flights between Chicago and the West Coast.
America West: Main-cabin meals on flights over five hours out of its Phoenix hub.
Continental: A cold breakfast or snacks on flights over an hour and a half; breakfast, lunch or dinner on flights over two hours. Improvements to the trans-Atlantic meal service (better cuts of chicken and bigger portions of vegetables and pasta) have not yet been duplicated on domestic flights.
Delta: No meals on most flights under four hours. Exceptions include some Northeast routes.
Northwest: Meals only on flights from one of the airline's three hubs (Memphis, Detroit and Minneapolis-St. Paul) and the West Coast.
Southwest: Snacks only.
United: Cold breakfast on flights over one hour; hot breakfast on flights over two hours. Lunch or dinner on flights over three and a half hours.
USAirways: Snacks on most mealtime domestic flights over two and a half hours; meals on flights from its three hubs (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C.) to the West Coast.

 BODY:
The Warlords
The bulky American in combat camouflage, sleeveless pocket vest, wraparound sunglasses and floppy fishing hat is not going to talk to me. He may be C.I.A. or Special Forces, but either way, I'm not going to find out. These people don't talk to reporters. But in Mazar-i-Sharif, second city of Afghanistan, in this warlord's compound, with a Lexus and an Audi purring in the driveway, armed mujahedeen milling by the gate and musclemen standing guard in tight black T-shirts and flak jackets and sporting the latest semiautomatic weapons, the heavyset American is the one who matters. He comes with a team that includes a forward air controller, who can call in airstrikes from the big planes doing Daytona 500 loops high in the sky. No one knows how many C.I.A. agents and Special Forces troops there are in country. The number is small -- perhaps as few as 350 -- but with up-links to air power and precision weapons, who needs regiments of ground troops? When you ask the carpet sellers in Mazar why there has been peace in the city, they point up into the air. Only America, the carpet sellers say, puts its peacekeepers in the sky.
 The biggest warlords in northern Afghanistan, Big D (Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum) and Teacher Atta (Gen. Ostad Atta Muhammad), are inside this compound, with a United Nations mediator who wants them to pull their tanks back from the city. In Mazar's main square, eyeing one another from the backs of their dusty Pajero pickups, equipped with roll bars, fog lights and plastic flowers on the dashboards, are about 50 fighters from each side, fingers on the triggers of rocket-propelled grenade launchers, Kalashnikovs and machine guns. In the past weeks, the militias have been dueling. The fighting has been so bad that the Red Cross hasn't been able to leave Mazar for the central highlands, where as many as 1.2 million people may be starving. 
 The presence of the American in the warlord's compound is something of a puzzle. Bush ran for the presidency saying he was opposed to using American soldiers for nation-building. The Pentagon doesn't want its warriors turned into cops. Congress is uneasy about American soldiers in open-ended peacekeeping commitments that expose them as terrorist targets. And deep in the background, there still lurks the memory of Vietnam, America's last full-scale attempt at imperial nation-building. But here in Mazar, Americans are once again doing what looks like nation-building: bringing peace to a city most Americans couldn't have found on a map a year ago.
Yet the Special Forces aren't social workers. They are an imperial detachment, advancing American power and interests in Central Asia. Call it peacekeeping or nation-building, call it what you like -- imperial policing is what is going on in Mazar. In fact, America's entire war on terror is an exercise in imperialism. This may come as a shock to Americans, who don't like to think of their country as an empire. But what else can you call America's legions of soldiers, spooks and Special Forces straddling the globe?
These garrisons are by no means temporary. Terror can't be controlled unless order is built in the anarchic zones where terrorists find shelter. In Afghanistan, this means nation-building, creating a state strong enough to keep Al Qaeda from returning. But the Bush administration wants to do this on the cheap, at the lowest level of investment and risk. In Washington they call this nation-building lite. But empires don't come lite. They come heavy, or they do not last. And neither does the peace they are meant to preserve.
Peace in Mazar, it should be understood, is a strictly relative term. The dusty streets are full of turbaned adolescents with Kalashnikovs slung on their shoulders, and firefights are not uncommon. But the American in the floppy hat is not about to call in airstrikes to stop a militia shootout. He's there to deter the bigger kind of trouble -- tank battles or artillery duels. The question is whether the American presence is sufficient to keep Afghanistan from sliding back into civil war. Senators Richard Lugar and Joe Biden have warned that nation-building will fail here unless the force of 4,500 foreign peacekeepers, currently patrolling in Kabul, is expanded and extended to cities like Mazar. They are undoubtedly right, but the Europeans aren't likely to back fine talk with actual soldiers, the Pentagon doesn't want to put peacekeepers on the ground and the Bush administration needs all the legions at its disposal for a potential operation against Iraq. For the time being, it's American peacekeeping in the air or nothing. 
In the vacuum where an Afghan state ought to be, there are warlords like Dostum and Atta. They are the chief obstacle to nation-building, but not because they are feudal throwbacks or old-style bandits in uniform. The warlords in the Mazar negotiations are late-modern creations of the American and Soviet duel for influence in Central Asia. Now that the Americans are ascendant, each warlord has a press officer who speaks good English and lines up interviews with the foreign press. 
They are also building a political constituency at home. Dostum has his own local TV station, and its cameras are in the courtyard waiting to put him on the evening news. While their power comes out of the barrel of a gun, they also see themselves as businessmen, tax collectors, tribal authorities and clan leaders. Big D actually began life working in the local gas plant. Both he and Teacher Atta prefer to be known as commanders. A warlord, they explain, preys on his people. A commander protects them. Warlords build schools, repair a road or two and make the occasional grand public gesture. 
Big D, for example, has placed a plaque near the entrance to the exquisite blue-green 16th-century mosque in the center of Mazar, letting foreign visitors know -- in English -- that he paid to have the place rewired and the gardens replanted with box hedges and roses. Big D does not attend to the city's more banal needs, like sewers, garbage collection or hospitals. These have languished for 25 years. Children with legs ripped apart by mines push themselves along in the dust on homemade carts. But such distress is beneath a warlord's notice. Holding power in Afghanistan is not an exercise in public service. 
Nor is Big D's newfound attention to the foreign press a sign of a change of heart. About 50 miles away in Sheberghan -- inside a palace decorated with baby pink and blue tiles and surrounded by a rose garden and peacocks -- he runs a foul and dilapidated prison where he kept about 800 Pakistani Taliban fighters captured in the battle for Kunduz last November. When representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross visited the prison, they discovered that Dostum was letting the inmates starve to death. 
When the local I.C.R.C. delegate reminded the general of his responsibilities, he denied that he had any. Go talk to Karzai in Kabul, he growled. The Red Cross had to step in and put the prisoners on an emergency feeding program like one used in a famine. No sooner had the I.C.R.C. restored the prisoners to health than the good general traded them back to the Pakistanis in a gesture of reconciliation. This is how an upper-level warlord plays the new political game in Afghanistan: by forcing international aid agencies to shoulder responsibilities that are actually his own and then making sure he gets the political credit.
During a break in the negotiations, Big D saunters out into the courtyard. He is a burly figure with short, spiky salt-and-pepper hair that comes down low above his brow, giving him the appearance of an irritable bear. While his bodyguards take up protective positions around him, he makes calls on the latest in satellite phones, a Thuraya. He's trying to turn himself into a politician, so he dresses like a civilian in a white shirt and slacks. Teacher Atta, when he appears, is wearing a shiny gray suit and carrying a businessman's diary. 
Dostum represents Jumbesh, a military and political faction based in the Uzbek ethnic minority, while Atta represents Jamiat, a more religiously flavored group based among the Tajiks. They are fighting over who will rule Mazar, its blue-green mosque, a population of several million people and a hinterland of well-irrigated fields and some useful natural-gas deposits. But they are also waging a personal vendetta. When I talk to Atta, a tall, gaunt man with deep-set eyes and the intensity of a genuine religious warrior, he says scornfully that while he fought for his country against the Soviet invaders, that low intriguer Dostum was sidling up to the Soviets and keeping out of the fight. As Atta says this, he flicks his white worry beads to and fro like a lion flicking its tail.
Afghanistan has existed as one country since 1919. Although there is a rich heritage of interethnic hatred, most Afghans feel they are Afghans first and Uzbeks, Hazaras, Tajiks or Pashtuns second. This isn't Bosnia, where the country didn't exist until 1992, and Croats and Serbs fought a war to annex their parts of Bosnia to Croatia and Serbia. While the Afghan warlords do get their cash and guns from neighboring countries like Iran, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, none of them actually want to dismember the country. The warlords don't threaten the cohesion of Afghanistan as a nation. They threaten its existence as a state. 
According to the great German sociologist Max Weber, states are institutions that exert a monopoly over the legitimate means of violence in a given territory. By that rule of thumb there hasn't been a state in Afghanistan since the Soviet Union invaded in 1979 and the war of resistance began. Because the warlords have the guns, they also hold the reins of power. The essence of nation-building is getting the guns out of the warlords' hands and opening up space for political competition free of violence. But this isn't easy in a country where there is no actual difference between a political party and a militia. 
It will take years before the national government in Kabul accumulates enough revenue, international prestige and armed force to draw power away from the warlords. But Bosnia shows it can be done. Six years after the war, the Muslim, Croat and Serb armies are rusting away, the old warlords have gone into politics or business and a small national army of Bosnia is slowly coming into existence. The problem in Bosnia is corruption, and that is a better problem to have than war. 
In Afghanistan, the Americans are currently beginning training for what they hope will be an 80,000-man army, air force and border police force for the Karzai government. But most of its manpower will come from one ethnic group, the Tajiks from the Panjshir Valley. Unless more Pashtuns, Uzbeks and Hazaras can be recruited quickly, the national army is going to become just another ethnic militia, albeit one financed by the American taxpayer. 
While Karzai waits to take charge of his army, his only option with the warlords is to co-opt them, as he has tried to do with Dostum by appointing him to the grand but empty title of deputy minister of national defense. This means that Dostum's militia is nominally a part of the national army. However, on the road between Mazar and Sheberghan, the barracks, tank parks and checkpoints are decorated not with Karzai's picture but with Dostum's. In the north, at least, Karzai looks like nothing more than mayor of Kabul and vice president for public relations. 
It would be as foolish to be discouraged about this as it would be to suppose that American power can change it quickly. History suggests that nation-building is a slow process. America's own nation-building experience -- reconstructing the South after the Civil War -- lasted a full century, until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Overseas, it was the blood and fire of an imposed unconditional surrender in 1945 that enabled America to help rebuild Germany and Japan as liberal democracies. The shattered European states were fully formed to begin with, so the Marshall Plan built on firm foundations. In Bosnia, by contrast, nation-building has been slow because the political institutions left behind by Tito's Yugoslavia were weak. None of the ethnic groups had any experience in making democracy work. 
The American capacity to shape outcomes in Afghanistan, still less to create a state, is constrained by the way it won the war against the Taliban. Its military success last November was victory lite. The winning strategy paired Special Forces teams and air power with local commanders and their militias. When victory came, America thought it had won the war, but the warlords in the Northern Alliance thought they had. Now they dominate the Kabul government and insist that they, rather than the Americans, should shape the peace.
But even they don't control the Pashtun-dominated south. There, in the valleys and passes bordering Pakistan, nation-building is taking place in the middle of a continuing campaign against Al Qaeda. The only people who know where to find Qaeda fighters are the local warlords, and they won't go looking unless the United States pays them handsomely and provides them with weapons. Some Washington policy makers profess to be untroubled about this: paying the warlords to hunt Al Qaeda keeps them busy, and keeps them under the control of the Special Forces. Yet the essential contradiction in American efforts to stabilize Afghanistan is that in the south, at least, winning the war on terrorism means consolidating the power of the very warlords who are the chief obstacle to state-building. 
Moreover, the question of who is using whom is not easy to answer. Ever since the days of the British North-West Frontier, Afghan tribal leaders have been experts at exploiting imperial troops for their own purposes. It's no different now. In December, a southern warlord informed a Special Forces unit that a Qaeda detachment was on the road nearby. The detachment was duly hit from the air, only for the Americans to discover that the dead were just some of their warlord's rivals heading off to Kabul. Instead of controlling its warlord proxies, Washington is discovering that it can be manipulated by them. 
The parlay in the compound at Mazar goes on until 7 in the evening. Oncoming darkness concentrates minds -- it is not safe, even for warlords, to be on the roads at night, and both Dostum and Atta live outside the city in their own walled enclaves. So at dusk, with the Mazar swallows wheeling in the sky, Big D and Teacher Atta emerge -- a deal has obviously been struck -- and jump into their black Audi and black Lexus. With their bodyguards clambering aboard backup cars, and the warriors in the Pajero flatbeds falling in behind, the two columns of fighters roar out of the city in a plume of exhaust and dust. 
The United Nations negotiators -- Mervyn Patterson, a frenetic Northern Irelander, and Jean Arnault, a suave Frenchman -- later explain the terms of the deal they have negotiated. "In the name of Allah, the compassionate and merciful," the document commits the warlords to withdraw their tanks 100 kilometers from Mazar, to ban heavy weapons and machine guns from the city and to contribute 600 fighters to form a city police force. The negotiators acknowledge that they have no troops to enforce the deal. But they can call on a powerful friend. Throughout the talks, the American with the floppy hat has stood silently in the room.
Imperial presence is the glue that holds Afghan deals together, but there is precious little of it to go around. By comparison, Bosnia, which would fit easily into a couple of Afghanistan's 30 provinces, has 18,000 peacekeepers. But there are none outside Kabul in a country the size of France. The United States wants a presence here, but not an occupation. Afghanistan has been an imperial plaything since the 19th century, and nothing makes an Afghan reach for his rifle faster than the presence of an occupying foreign power. So in Mazar, indeed anywhere outside Kabul, the imperial presence is a nebulous thing -- a Special Forces detachment here, a plane overhead there. 
The day after the deal is done, in the Mazar stadium, a dust-blown space usually used for the chaotic Afghan polo known as buzkashi, 600 mujahedeen, stripped of their Afghan dress and now wearing ill-fitting, hot gray uniforms, straggle out onto the parade ground. As their old militia commanders watch from a shaded reviewing stand, sipping cups of tea, the new police force squares off for its first parade. Peace in Afghanistan depends on whether the warlord militias can be lured into policing or other civilian lines of work, and the only people determined to make this transition happen are a silent quartet from Special Forces, watching from the reviewing stand, just behind the warlords' adjutants. 
Nation-building lite looks too lite in Mazar to be credible for long. Authority relies on awe as much as on force, and where awe is missing, as it was in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993, Americans die. The British imperialists understood the power of awe. They governed huge tracts of Africa, and populations numbering in the millions, with no more than a couple of administrators for every thousand square miles. In Afghanistan, awe is maintained not by the size of the American presence but by the timeliness and destructiveness of American air power. What the Afghan warlords saw being inflicted on their Taliban opponents, they know can be visited upon them. For the moment, this keeps the peace. 
However, awe can be sustained only if force is just -- that is, accurate. When American planes pulverize an innocent wedding party, as they did earlier this month, just because some of the more exuberant partygoers were firing into the air, Afghan style, the planners back in Tampa, Fla., will tell you it was just a mistake. But it is more than a mistake: it is a major political error, and the more errors there are, the less awe and the more resistance American power will awaken. 
Effective imperial power also requires controlling the subject people's sense of time, convincing them that they will be ruled forever. The illusion of permanence was one secret of the British Empire's long survival. Empires cannot be maintained and national interests cannot be secured over the long term by a people always looking for the exit.
American power has a reputation for fickleness. C.I.A. agents mysteriously appeared in Afghanistan in the mid-1980's and supplied the mujahedeen with Stinger missiles. Once the Soviets were in flight, the Americans went home, leaving Afghanistan to the mercy of the warlords. Years of devastation and war ensued. Afghans have no problem with the idea of a limited American imperial presence, provided that it brings peace and chases away the foreign terrorists from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Chechnya. But Afghans look at these American imperialists and wonder, How long will they stay? If, as the rumors go, war against Iraq's Saddam Hussein is next, will the man in the floppy hat with his communications team still be here in the fall?
Back in Kabul, past the Marine security cordon at the fortress-style American Embassy, Elisabeth Kvitashvili, the head of programs in Afghanistan for the United States Agency for International Development, will remind you bluntly: "We're not here because of the drought and the famine and the condition of women. We're here because of 9/11. We're here because of Osama bin Laden." U.S.A.I.D. was spending $174 million in Afghanistan before 9/11, feeding a people abandoned by the Taliban government. But that figure doubled after 9/11, as languishing humanitarian motive found itself reinforced by the national interest of making Afghanistan safe from terrorism. 
In reality, rebuilding failed states will never guarantee American security against the risk of terror. Even well-run states, like Britain and Spain, can find themselves unwilling harbors for terrorist groups. Rebuilding Afghanistan's institutions won't necessarily keep Al Qaeda from creeping back into the country's mountain passes and caves. Nor will fixing Afghanistan banish terror from the region. It is just driving Al Qaeda south into the frontier provinces of Pakistan. 
Given how difficult it is to police the North-West Frontier, America will be tempted to declare victory early and go home. Already, uncertainty about American intentions is causing insecurity. The recent assassination of Hajji Abdul Qadir, a vice president and one of the few ethnic Pashtuns to join the Karzai government, is not just the normal turbulence of Afghan politics. It is an attempt to bring down the government, and if it did collapse and civil wars were to start again, as in 1992, the United States could not walk away as easily as it did last time. This time the disgrace would stick. Al Qaeda would conclude that if it can topple Karzai, why not topple President Musharraf in Pakistan? Actual defeat, in other words, is a possibility. To avoid it, Washington will have to help Karzai, and the only help that counts in Afghanistan is troops. 
Even with American help, the best Karzai and his Kabul government can hope for is to appoint the least-bad warlords as civilian governors to keep a rough-and-ready peace and collect some taxes. This sort of ordered anarchy, among loosely controlled regional fiefs, would provide ordinary Afghans with basic security. This may be all that is possible, and it may be all that American interests require. Keeping expectations realistic is the key to staying the course there. Understanding what's at stake is just as important. America could still lose here. If it did, Al Qaeda would secure a victory as large as it achieved on 9/11. 

The Internationals
Since the end of the cold war, nation-building has become a multibillion-dollar business. This is not because rich nations have been seized by a new tenderness of heart toward poor and failing ones. The percentage of Western budgets devoted to foreign aid fell steadily in the post-cold-war period. At a recent conference in Mexico, rich countries promised to do better. But still, with the exception of tiny Denmark, which just scraped by, there isn't a country in the world that devotes even 1 percent of its gross domestic product to helping poor countries. The United States is nearly at the bottom of the pile, spending a derisory 0.1 percent of G.D.P.
Still, small sums eventually add up, and when you figure in all the checks and credit-card donations from ordinary people flowing into nongovernmental development charities, the money for nation-building aid rises into scores of billions of dollars every year. The new mantra of this industry is governance. Economic development is impossible, and humanitarian aid is a waste of time, so the theory goes, unless the country in question has effective governance: rule of law, fire walls against corruption, democracy and a free press. Since most of the countries that need help have none of these things, nation-building programs to create them have become the chief beneficiaries of government aid budgets.
Nation-building has become the cure of choice for the epidemic of ethnic civil war and state failure that has convulsed the developing world since the end of the long imperial peace of the cold war. The nation-building caravan has moved from Cambodia in 1993, where the United Nations supervised an election; to Angola, where it failed to secure a peace in 1994; to Sarajevo, where it was supposed to create multiethnic democracy; to Pristina, where it was supposed to stop the victorious Kosovars from killing all the remaining Serbs; to Dili, in East Timor, where it tried to create a government for a country left devastated by the departing Indonesian militias. Wherever the traveling caravan of nation-builders settles, it creates an instant boomtown, living on foreign money and hope. But boomtowns inevitably go bust. In Sarajevo, for example, the internationals arrived in 1996 after Dayton with $6 billion to spend. Now, six years later, the money is all but gone, and the caravan is moving on to Kabul.
Kabul is the Klondike of the new century, a place where a young person can make, if not a fortune, then a stellar career riding the tide of international money that is flooding in with every United Nations flight from Islamabad. It's one of the few places where a bright spark just out of college can end up in a job that comes with a servant and a driver. So Kabul has the social attractions of a colonial outpost joined to the feverish excitement of a boomtown. But unlike the Klondike, this gold rush is being paid for not by speculators and panhandlers but by rich Western governments. 
Empire means big government. One paradox of the new American empire is that it is being constructed by a Republican administration that hates big government. Its way around this contradiction is to get its allies to shoulder the burdens it won't take on itself. In the new imperial division of labor on display in Afghanistan, the Americans do most of the fighting while the Europeans, who have no ideological problems with big government but don't like fighting, are only too happy to take on the soft sides of nation-building: roads, schools, sanitation and water. 
Rebuilding Afghanistan altogether is projected to cost between $14 and $18 billion over the next decade. In Tokyo in January, promises were made of $1.8 billion for reconstruction this year. The Afghans heard the promises. Now they're waiting for the money. In anticipation, Kabul landlords have jacked their rents sky-high -- a decent four-bedroom villa that rented for $1,000 a month only a year ago now commands as much as $10,000. 
In the Kabul bazaars, the booksellers are doing a brisk business in English dictionaries and phrase books. All young Afghans want to learn English, the magic code that opens the door to salaries as drivers, translators, secretaries and cleaners. The car-repair shops, located in rusting freight containers, now hang out hopeful signs -- Ponctur Repair," "Fix Foraing Engin" -- in the hope of snagging one of the passing white Toyota Land Cruisers. Another sign proclaims "The Golden Lotos Hotel and Restaurant Is Ready Again to Serve You Each Kind of Internal and External Delicious Foods."
Nation-building isn't supposed to be an exercise in colonialism, but the relationship between the locals and the internationals is inherently colonial. The locals do the translating, cleaning and driving while the internationals do the grand imperial planning. The locals complain that the internationals don't understand anything, not even the local languages. Behind one prominent U.N. bureaucrat's desk in Kabul there is a furtive crib sheet in Dari, Pashto and English: Stop, Go, Left, Right, Please, Thank You. The internationals may be ignorant -- may even arrive believing that the Taliban invented the burka and that women's oppression began with the Taliban seizure of Kabul in 1996 -- but ignorance does not stop them from sighing about the corruption, complacency and confusion of the locals. 
In nation-building contexts, however, the international lament is complicated by guilt. Every international in Sarajevo knew that his government could have stopped the Bosnian war. In Kabul, everyone knows that the martyrdom of the city, between 1992 and 1996, when dueling warlords reduced large swaths of it to rubble, could have been stopped had the big powers not abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal. So any smart local will exploit international guilt, while any smart international will blame the locals.
These are the colonial continuities in nation-building, but Afghanistan is at least supposed to be different. Such is the gospel according to Lakhdar Brahimi, the wily Algerian diplomat who is the boss of the 500-plus U.N. staff members already in place. Brahimi's engagement with Afghanistan dates to 1997, when he first tried to broker cease-fires among the warlords. When I ask him what is different this time, he plays with his worry beads and says that all the warlords assure him that they have learned a lesson. They don't want to repeat the brutal factional fighting of 1992. But he freely admits that the fighting between Dostum and Atta in Mazar suggests that all the talk of a change of heart may be just talk.
Brahimi has no influence over the American presence in Afghanistan or over its war on terror in the southern provinces. But he worries at the way they are arming warlords in the south. "I tell the Americans: Why do your planes fly at night here? Because you are afraid of Stinger missiles. And who, may I remind you, brought these missiles to Afghanistan?" Whether Stingers are actually being turned against the Americans, the point remains: if you feed a snake, it may return to bite you.
Brahimi has fought the United Nations bureaucracy in New York to keep the Afghan operation from being flooded with out-of-work nation-builders from the downsizing operations in Kosovo, Bosnia and East Timor. He has also insisted on coordinating the warring U.N. agencies: "We want to be sure that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing." As United Nations boss, he has resisted playing the role of imperial proconsul, insisting that "the Afghan government is in the driving seat."
The theory is that Brahimi's people will force the "U.N. family" and what is laughingly called "the international community" to work in harmony. The reality, as in all nation-building cities, is ferocious competition among donors, United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations for a market share in money and misery.
The U.N. nation-builders all repeat the mantra that they are here to "build capacity" and to "empower local people." This is the authentic vocabulary of the new imperialism, only it isn't as new as it sounds. The British called it "indirect rule." Local agents ran the day-to-day administration; local potentates exercised some power, while real decisions were made back in imperial capitals. Indirect rule is the pattern in Afghanistan: the illusion of self-government joined to the reality of imperial tutelage.
The white Land Cruisers, the satellite dishes beaming e-mail messages skyward, the banks of computers inside all the U.N. compounds, offer a drastic contrast with Afghan government offices, where groups of men sit around drinking tea, without a computer in sight. At the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority, the Afghan and international officials trying to coordinate reconstruction believe that as much as $700 million of the money pledged at Tokyo has so far gone to U.N. agencies, while only $100 million or so has gone to the Afghan administration itself.
The easy talk about helping Afghanistan stand on its own two feet does not square with the hard interest that each Western government has in financing not the Afghans, but its own national relief organizations. These fly a nation's flags over some road or school that a politician back home can take credit for. American foreign assistance concentrates on food aid in part because it sops up U.S. farm surpluses. The unpleasant underside of nation-building is that the internationals' first priority is building their own capacity -- increasing their budgets and giving themselves good jobs. The last priority is financing the Afghan government. 
Admittedly, the capacity of this government is limited. After the new Afghan cabinet ministers came to work in January, there wasn't a fax machine, telephone, desk or chair in their offices until the United Nations shipped them a planeload of office supplies. Now most of the available chairs are occupied by redundant bureaucrats. The Afghan foreign minister, Abdullah Abdullah, confesses that the only way to get anything done in the ministries is to identify an "implementation cell" of 5 to 40 competent people and to pension off the rest.
But the administrative weakness of the Afghan government is also an excuse to keep it enfeebled. How else can a state be created, unless it is given the initial capacity to deliver services and raise its own taxes? It's a colonialist fallacy to suppose that Afghanistan need remain a basket case. Until the Soviet invasion and the civil war that followed, it exported dried fruit, vegetables, precious stones and natural gas. A "Made in Afghanistan" label could support a big export industry in carpets and luxury clothing. Yet all of these bright prospects will remain a gleam in a few Afghan economists' eyes unless Western governments can provide the Karzai administration with enough operating revenue to get through the first years. 
Ashraf Ghani, the worldly and exhausted former World Bank official who is now the government's minister of finance, sits in a wood-paneled office in the prime minister's compound and directs his ire at the condescension of the U.N. bureaucracy and Western governments. Not a single one of the more than 350 projects submitted by international organizations and N.G.O.'s, Ghani says, actually promised to consult the Afghan interim administration. "This government is asking for accountability," he says. 
Ghani is the most senior example of a trend: the return of the Afghan elite from exile. These returning exiles are not always popular. They are in a hurry, and exile makes them impatient with the old ways at home. Still, the Afghan diaspora, estimated at more than four million people worldwide, is going to be the country's chief source of expertise and investment in the years ahead. 
There is growing fury, just visible beneath Ghani's veneer of calm, at the contrast between the high-sounding language of capacity-building and the reality of capacity confiscation. How is Afghanistan to build up its own civil service if the government can pay senior officials only $150 a month and any international N.G.O. or newspaper can pay its drivers $1,000? How can the Afghan government coordinate reconstruction when every day N.G.O.'s arrive, fan out into the countryside and find a school to rebuild, an orphanage to establish or an orthopedic center to reconstruct, all without telling the Kabul government anything? 
Ghani and his staff have put together a national development framework, and in a country where almost everything is broken -- roads, schools, agriculture, electric power -- it establishes what has to be fixed first. But how do you get foreign agencies to follow the plan, and how do you build accountability between a penniless government and rich donors who don't trust the Afghans to spend it wisely? 
Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor led the internationals to believe that most of the aid that deluges these countries gets siphoned off into corrupt pockets. In Bosnia, the entire criminal and civil justice system was staffed with corrupt leftovers from the Communist era. The internationals ignored this and insisted on early elections, believing that democracy would throw out the crooks. Six years on, Bosnia has had four elections, it still has the same leadership and there hasn't been a single conviction for bribes in a Bosnian court. 
This failure to grasp that democracy works only when it goes hand in hand with the rule of law has been the costliest mistake in the Balkans. Instead of creating fire walls against the abuse of power, nation-building exercises usually take the form of funneling all resources into the hands of a few designated locals whom the internationals deign to trust. When these designated locals begin skimming, the internationals throw up their hands in disillusion. The right strategy, at least if the Balkans is anything to go by, is to build in checks and balances from the start, by helping the Afghans to rewrite the criminal and civil code and train a new generation of lawyers, prosecutors, judges and criminal investigators. Without these legal foundations, no country can make the transition from a war economy to a peace economy. 
Currently, the war economy in Afghanistan, the one run by the warlords, depends heavily on the poppy economy. War and drugs will strangle the honest economy if they can't be brought under control. All the money flowing in from international donors and N.G.O.'s will sustain the city of Kabul alone and will probably tail off within five years. That leaves the agricultural economy as the backbone of the country: the lovingly irrigated mulberry orchards of Gulbahar, the expanse of vines in the Shamali Plain, the rice and wheat fields on the plains between Mazar and Sheberghan. Afghanistan may be a poor country, but there is no reason, if the war and drug economies can be controlled, that it cannot feed itself. 
For 25 years, Afghan resources have been siphoned into buying weapons. Changing these priorities will take more than turning warlords into politicians. Local revenues will flow to desperately needed projects like rebuilding villages, putting sewers in towns and collecting the garbage only after ordinary people, especially women, get some way to make their voices heard. 
The problem is that most people, especially women, have no institutions of their own. The traditional Afghan jirgas are occasional assemblies convened only for emergencies; the village shura is the preserve of older men and is often dominated by local commanders. Since 1994, Samantha Reynolds, an intense British woman in her 30's who runs the U.N.'s urban regeneration program, has been convening community forums in urban areas to bring together neighborhood residents -- at first with men and then, as confidence builds, with women as well -- to demand basic services, like garbage collection, electricity, sewers and schools. When the municipal officials or local commanders fail to respond, these groups tax themselves to provide them. The Afghan government is currently considering the expansion of the community forums nationwide. They would work out what towns and villages need, apply directly to a World Bank fund and then set about implementing them. It's a grass-roots strategy for building up local leadership, as well as undercutting local commanders and busy-body internationals alike.
In the 50's and the 60's, thanks to Soviet and American engineers, Afghanistan had some of the best roads in Asia. Nancy Hatch Dupree's old guidebook, published in 1971, and now remaindered on the stalls of Kabul's book market, says that you can get from Kabul to Jalalabad in a couple of hours, and Kabul to Mazar in six. No more. Like those in all failed states, Afghanistan's roads give out when you leave the capital. So do electric power and telephones. It's hard not to think that the place needs fewer humanitarian bureaucrats and more civil and electrical engineers.
All the same, infrastructure can't create a nation. Bosnia now has the roads and schools it needs, yet its ethnic groups remain as divided as ever. But it's true that Afghanistan won't have a functioning economy until the farmers can get their fruit and vegetables to market and the big truckers from Pakistan and Iran can get goods up to the northern towns. Here the Afghans do need international investment. They can mobilize the construction crews -- everybody's idea for weakening the warlords is to create construction jobs for the militiamen -- but they need the big lenders to come through with money for the surveys, the engineers and the heavy equipment.
The Afghans are still waiting for delivery on almost all the promises the internationals have made. The overriding fact about reconstruction, at least in the first year, is that the pace set by Afghans has been faster than the internationals can cope with. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expected the refugee return to be rather like it was in Bosnia -- slow and cautious. Instead, it came in a flood that overwhelmed its resources. By the end of the year, an astonishing 1.6 million refugees are expected to return. 
At the beginning, the group was able to provide each family that arrived at its reception center in Pul-i-Charki, on the outskirts of Kabul, with 150 kilograms -- more than 300 pounds -- of wheat, together with a full medical examination and payment to Pakistani truckers to take them to their villages. Now the big government donors are telling U.N.H.C.R. that they can't fully finance the program, and the organization is cutting back the food ration and the medical assistance.
In March, Unicef, the U.N. children's fund, handed every school-age child a plastic bag containing a basic reader, purged of references to guns or warlords, together with a pencil and a writing book. The schools opened, and since then attendance has risen from 5 percent of the school-age population to 35 percent. Now, in the hot summer days, by the roadsides you see files of barefoot, scrofulous but cheerful children -- and girls, too -- walking to school, carrying their Unicef bags. But the numbers are not likely to climb above 35 percent, because donors have given Unicef only 60 percent of what it has asked for in its Afghan appeals. 
Unless these gaps in financing can be filled, there is going to be trouble. When the refugees get home, they discover that their fields are still full of mines and that the de-miners can't do the work fast enough. The irrigation systems that used to water their fields have been blown up, and the international experts are still walking around doing exploratory studies of how to reconnect them. The villages in the Shamali Plain, where the front lines were, are still flattened. So the families camp in the ruins, with their U.N.H.C.R. tarpaulins as tent material, and try to get a kitchen garden going. Each refugee who returns without a field to till or a home to live in is another potential recruit for the warlords' militias. Afghanistan doesn't need to be on life support forever, but if it doesn't get sustained assistance for the first three years it may not escape its demons.

The Brick Maker
Imperialism used to be the white man's burden. This gave it a bad reputation. But imperialism doesn't stop being necessary just because it becomes politically incorrect. Nations sometimes fail, and when they do, only outside help -- imperial power -- can get them back on their feet. Nation-building is the kind of imperialism you get in a human rights era, a time when great powers believe simultaneously in the right of small nations to govern themselves and in their own right to rule the world. Nation-building lite is supposed to reconcile these principles: to safeguard American interests in Central Asia at the lowest possible cost and to give Afghanistan back a stable government of its own choosing. These principles of imperial power and self-determination are not easy to reconcile. The empire wants quick results, and that means an early exit. The Afghans want us to protect them, and at the same time help them back on their feet. That means sticking around for a while.
Washington had better decide what it wants. If it won't sustain and increase its military presence here, the other internationals will start heading for the exit. If that occurs, there is little to stop Afghanistan from becoming, once again, the terror and heroin capital of the world. There is no reason that this needs to happen. Afghans themselves know they have only one more chance. They understand the difficult truth that their best hope of freedom lies in a temporary experience of imperial rule.
They are ready to seize the moment. It is easy to be cynical about the imperial outsiders, however necessary they may be, but it is hard not to be moved by the Afghans themselves. The nation-builders to bet on are those refugee families piled onto the brightly painted Pakistani trucks moving up the dusty roads, the children perched on the mattresses, like Mowgli astride the head of an elephant, gazing toward home. 
The nation-builders to invest in are the teachers, especially the women who taught girls in secret during the Taliban years. I met one in an open-air school right in the middle of Kabul's most destroyed neighborhood. She wrote her name in a firm, bold hand in my notebook, and she knew exactly what she needed: chalk, blackboards, desks, a roof and, God willing, a generation of peace. At her feet, on squares of U.N.H.C.R. sheeting, sat her class, 20 upturned faces, all female, having the first reading lesson of their lives.
Finally, you could believe in the brick maker, alone with his 5-year-old son, in the middle of an expanse of desolate ruins in downtown Kabul. After the militia fighting in 1992, nobody bothered to make bricks. What was the point? The shelling might start all over again. But now the brick maker had his wooden form in his hands, pressing it down into a mixture of straw and mud that has served to make bricks since the time of the Prophet. Behind him, a hundred neat brown bricks were drying in the last dusty light of the day. The brick maker had a beard, a dirty caftan and a cap on his head. All he had ever known was war. When I asked him why he thought it was time to make bricks again, he said: "We have a government now. People need houses." He didn't have time to talk more. He was too busy making bricks.
It would be too much to say that the brick maker wants us infidels here, exactly, but I would venture that he knows he needs us. With us here he is able to gamble. But without the Americans in floppy hats nobody is going to feel safe enough to start building a house with his bricks.

But now, with the hope of a future, brickworks like this one east of Kabul are answering a soaring demand. (Somon Norfolk/Growbag)

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 7-28-02: THE ETHICIST; 
Get a Divorce

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
My husband and I, in our 50's, were married nearly seven years ago. Last year, he was given a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. In our state, all but about $90,000 of our combined assets, excluding house and car, would have to be spent before he could qualify for assistance. I am considering a 'Medicaid divorce' (that is, in name only) so he can receive treatment without running through my modest savings. We both dread the divorce, and I don't want to cheat Medicaid, but I don't want to be driven to poverty. Is such a divorce ethical? B.V.C., Seattle
 People marry late in life for various reasons, but the pursuit of financial ruin is not one of them. So it is through divorce, paradoxical as it sounds, that you can best honor your marriage vow to cleave to your husband for better or worse. Preserving your small savings will be enormously beneficial to you both. I can understand his fear that divorce could be the prelude to your abandoning him, but you can help him most by offering tenderness and reassurance, not by joining him in penury. If you become loving but unmarried companions, your ethical obligations to one another will not be transformed. It is a grim irony that while the president touts marriage as the road to financial security, your staying married would mean a descent into poverty. 
 What you are contemplating is not the exploitation of a legal loophole but adherence to the regulations governing Medicaid. But you should seek legal and financial advice: besides divorce, there are other options to consider, including, for instance, transferring some assets to your children (if you have any) or protecting your assets through annuities or trusts. Done with respect for the law and compassion for your husband, such actions, divorce included, are prudent and ethical courses of action.
Ultimately, the question is who should pay for your husband's care: Medicaid or you, the late-in-life spouse? To me the answer is both. You should assist him but should not be utterly impoverished. And Medicaid should be reformed so as to spare you this painful dilemma. Medicaid rules envision a couple in a lifelong economic partnership. While this is true of many couples, it is not the case for those like you who marry late in life.
Yours is a situation in which an individual moral goal -- to behave honorably toward both your spouse and the law -- is best facilitated through political action. Both major parties must make changes, embracing measures to protect the assets of middle-class seniors and taxing the assets of the rich (including through the estate tax) to provide all Americans with catastrophic medical care.
My wife and I are computer programmers at different companies, and sometimes I assist her. Nobody at her company knows I do this, but everyone seems to benefit: her company gets free labor from an experienced programmer, I get marital credits and my wife gets excellent reviews (only marginally because of my work). Is it ethical for her to use my work and pass it off as her own? Anonymous, New Jersey
What you're doing seems well within the bounds of the sort of assistance we all sometimes give to or receive from friends, relatives or colleagues. By that measure, your wife isn't passing off this work as her own; it is her own.
While a bit of help from time to time is fine, a few cautions are in order. You must be wary of digging yourself too deep a hole, of doing more and more of your wife's work. And she must be careful not to take a job she's incapable of doing without your help, and not to give her employer a false impression of her abilities. And of course, she must not violate any company confidentiality rules.
Now if you'd like to stop by my place and help me sort out some computer problems, you'd be a truly virtuous person. Probably excessively so.
The exterior of our newly purchased home features a mosaic Madonna and Child. We appreciate religious art, but this barely seems like art: the Virgin Mother bears a marked resemblance to the celebrity psychic Jackie Stallone. Removal would entail a violent public act with a sledgehammer. And friends of all denominations worry we may be struck by lightning. Should religious tolerance trump our right to redecorate? L.G. and J.N., Toronto
You might consider safeguarding this mosaic on not theological but aesthetic grounds, as worthy folk art. Indeed, some jurisdictions have art-preservation laws, so you should check with a lawyer before bringing that hammer down.
You are not, however, ethically obligated to display other people's art in -- or should I say on -- your home out of concern for their religious sentiments. What you might do, in deference to your new neighbors, is give them a chance to remove this mosaic at their expense. Or you could look into ways of covering it up without destroying it. Simply alerting your neighbors might be worth doing, too, not as an ethical obligation but as a way to keep peace in the valley. As to God's wrath -- well, lightning rods are available at most hardware stores.

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
Job Turnover Mints New Entrepreneurs

BYLINE:  By THOM WEIDLICH 

 BODY:
FRED H. ABBOTT, 48, has led senior management teams in several information technology advisory firms, including Gartner in Stamford, Conn., and the Hurwitz Group in Framingham, Mass. He has also been laid off twice.
 The last time, in the summer of 2001, Mr. Abbott was senior vice president for sales at a Web-based survey company. But rather than going begging for another position, he pursued a course that has become increasingly popular among out-of-work executives in this wobbly economy: He started a business. 
 Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm in Chicago, says the proportion of its clients, mostly executives and managers, who have decided to go into business for themselves has nearly doubled, to 11.2 percent in the second quarter of this year from 6.45 percent in the third quarter of 2001.
The reason is no mystery. "In the late 1990's, many people were deferring their entrepreneurial dreams because the getting was so good out there," said John A. Challenger, the firm's chief executive.
Another outplacement firm, DBM in New York, has seen a similar move toward self-employment. "People are realizing that there's no security in corporate America and they'll probably switch jobs every two years, and usually not of their own choosing," said Beth Burdick, a DBM consultant.
The pool of potential entrepreneurs has grown, Ms. Burdick added. Historically, they fell largely into two categories: born entrepreneurs, who have always itched to run their own show, and refugees from the corporate world who cannot get back in. Now, there is a new type: Laid-off managers who have the skills to land a job similar to their old one, but who are fed up with the uncertainties of corporate life.
Jeff Goodsill of Concord, Mass., personifies the new type. For 12 years, he worked at Raytheon, the military contractor, rising in the management ranks.
"I would have been happy to stay at Raytheon, but it wasn't happening there anymore with all the mergers and layoffs," said Mr. Goodsill, 40, who left of his own volition to join the video game business.
But in April, he was laid off as a manager at a video racing-game company. With his business background and relative youth, he was confident that he could find another management position, but he didn't want to go down that road again.
"I said to myself: 'I could spend six months looking for a job. Why not spend three months trying to put together a business plan?' " he said.
So Mr. Goodsill decided to start his own business, G-Force Games, to develop a new racing game, and is now writing a business plan and looking for start-up financing. He estimates that he will need as much as $500,000 to assemble a team of six people and get the venture through the first year. His plan calls for the product to be delivered two years later and for profitability six months after that. He says he has begun looking for an outside job to meet his expenses while he seeks financing.
Following such a path, of course, takes spunk. The Small Business Administration estimates that nearly one-third of new ventures fail in their first two years and that half fail within four.
Experts say market research is the key to success. In studying the information technology business, Mr. Abbott found that independent technology consultants enjoyed their work but that they had little appetite for the task of drumming up business. So he decided to act as their agent, finding work for them for a percentage of their billings.
"When I looked at three things: the job opportunities available in this economy, where I was in my career and what the buyers of the services we provide were saying to me -- this seemed by far and away the most attractive option," Mr. Abbott said.
He now represents 35 information technology analysts as president of Valley View Ventures, working out of the basement of his Tudor-style home, also in Concord. He says he is ahead of his target to reach annualized bookings in the seven figures by the end of this year.
Gary S. Bedrosian also spotted opportunity in being a go-between in his profession. Mr. Bedrosian had spent the bulk of his career as a manager in several consulting companies that specialized in computer networking. But in April 2001 -- two weeks after he bought a $410,000 house, no less -- he was laid off from a computer-networking company.
It was a "here we go again" moment, he said; in 1999, he was laid off from his previous job, as a regional manager for a different company in the same field.
At first, Mr. Bedrosian, who is 48, took a cavalier attitude to his joblessness. But by Thanksgiving, he was "starting to get a little desperate," he said. Then, after talking to others in his industry, he got the idea for starting a venture to place temporary networking engineers with networking consulting companies.
He recently set up Networkers Net in his home in Hampton Falls, N.H., and he says he expects his business to expand as the economy picks up and as consulting firms realize they have laid off too many people. "The value proposition is, I know their business as well or better than they do," Mr. Bedrosian said.
To be sure, starting a business is not for everyone. Too often, would-be entrepreneurs believe that expertise in their specialty will carry the day, forgetting that understanding the marketplace is even more important.
"Probably the biggest cause of failure is people are good at what they do but haven't learned to run a business," said Gene Fairbrother, president of MBA Consulting Inc., a small-business consulting firm in Coppell, Tex. His advice, echoed by other business specialists, is this: Educate yourself on the essentials of starting and running a company, do market research and write a business plan.
IF you conclude that you don't have the skill to pull it off, team up with someone who does.
"I'd also say to people that their network is far bigger than they may have imagined," said Mr. Abbott, the manager turned entrepreneur. "Look to the people you've served in the past. Ask what isn't going right for them today that they need a service for that you can provide."
And, he said, "Listen to them about what their agony is these days."

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
So Tragic, You Have To Laugh

BYLINE:  By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
ARTHUR MILLER doesn't like to explain his plays. "I'm not particularly good at it," he says. "Before 'Death of a Salesman' was produced, someone asked me what it was about, and I said, 'It's about a salesman, and he dies.' "
 But Mr. Miller, who turned 86 last October, has written a new play, "Resurrection Blues," and the other day he agreed to talk about it, at least a little, by telephone from his home in Connecticut. It's a satirical comedy -- he calls it "a tragic farce" -- a genre different for him, but one in which religion, the news media and political and economic corruption, themes he has explored in the past, have crucial roles. 
 Performances begin next Saturday at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, where the play opens on Aug. 9, with a cast that includes Laila Robins, John Bedford Lloyd and Jeff Weiss. The director, David Esbjornson, directed Mr. Miller's "Ride Down Mount Morgan" on Broadway two years ago.
"Resurrection Blues" takes place in an unnamed Latin American country ruled by a military dictatorship that is backed by the United States. Drugs and violence are endemic and 2 percent of the population has 96 percent of the wealth. A savior arises among the peasants, a peaceful revolutionary who some say is the son of God. The revolutionary is arrested, and the top general (Mr. Lloyd) decides the prisoner must be crucified.
"Shooting doesn't work," the general says. "People are shot on television every 10 minutes; bang-bang, and they go down like dolls, it's meaningless." A New York advertising agency offers $25 million for worldwide television rights to what is conceived as an hours-long event with the potential for commercials about products that benefit every bodily orifice.
"The absurdity of so much around me is such," Mr. Miller said, "that the only way I could keep looking at it was to find something outrageously funny in it."
Mr. Miller's work has been much on view in New York this year. "The Crucible" was revived on Broadway, and his first Broadway play, "The Man Who Had All the Luck," from 1944, also reappeared there in a Roundabout Theater Company production. 
In a Guthrie newsletter, Mr. Miller is quoted as saying that he has to explain to people they are supposed to laugh at "Resurrection Blues," "because when it's one of my plays, they forbid themselves to laugh." Still, "if they can't laugh at this," he said from Connecticut, "there's something wrong with them."
The play restates Mr. Miller's longstanding concern with society's effect on the individual and the individual's responsibility in society. When one character says she is merely a bystander, another responds, "Well, if you are you're the only one left in the world."
Mr. Miller has previously satirized what one character in "Resurrection Blues" calls "this whole insane worship of money that is killing everyone." In a 1992 essay, he called for privatizing executions: putting an electric chair at second base in Shea Stadium and selling the best seats for as much as $300. In a 1995 essay, "Let's Privatize Congress," he suggested that each senator and representative's salary be paid by whatever business group wished to buy that official's vote. (Both essays appeared on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times.)
The deification of money is very much a concern of the new play, he said: "It's the commercialization of everything we look at, everything we do. We're buying and selling everything that exists. The value of everything is what it can be sold for."
But that's about as far as he is willing to go. "When I want to state clearly what I believe, I write an essay," he said. "If I'm exploring a human dilemma, I write a play. This play is about the dilemma of how to react to a world with no faith."
Will the play have a New York run? "I'm talking to one or two producers who want to come out and look at it," Mr. Miller said. "But I have no deal yet."
Mr. Esbjornson, who this year directed "The Goat," Edward Albee's Tony Award winner for best play, said he didn't think it would be difficult to get audiences to laugh. "The play," Mr. Esbjornson said, "is edgy and unusual, but as always with Arthur Miller there's a dramatic center. It has a dangerous and frightening political underbelly that's juxtaposed with the satirical humor. What makes this play different are the extremes. I think that's where the humor lies -- in the absurdity of the world Arthur is creating."
For Mr. Miller, his beliefs are implicit in "Resurrection Blues." "As I look around me," he said, "the feelings combine hope and disgust, high amusement and despair. It's all packed into that play."

Resurrection Blues
Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis.
Previews begin next Saturday; opens Aug. 9.

From the Play: Feeling Everything
The character, played by Jeff Weiss, is a cousin of the repressive general running the country in which "Resurrection Blues" takes place.

HENRI: I am convinced now, apart from getting fed, most human activity -- sports, opera, tv, movies, dressing up, dressing down -- or just going for a walk -- has no other purpose than to deliver us into the realm of the imagination. The imagination is a great hall where death, for example, turns into a painting, and a scream of pain becomes a song. The hall of the imagination is really where we usually live; and this is all right except for one thing -- to enter that hall one must leave one's real sorrow at the door and in its stead surround oneself with images and words and music that mimic anguish but is really drained of it -- no one has ever lost a leg from reading about a battle, or died of hearing the saddest song. . . . This is why this man must be hunted down and crucified; because -- he still really feels everything. Imagine . . . if that kind of reverence for life should spread! Governments would collapse, armies disband, marriages disintegrate! Wherever we turned, our dead unfeeling shallowness would stare us in the face until we shriveled up with shame! No! -- better to hunt him down and kill him and leave us in peace.

Marketing Homes Before Building Has Even Started

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
IN the rush to get in on low interest rates and a good market, Long Island's residential builders are employing creative ways to market their homes before the traditional model units have been completed -- and in some case before their projects have even been approved.
 "In the past you didn't do any marketing unless you had a full-fledged sales office and a decorated model," said the residential builder James L. Neisloss, a principal in Meadowood Properties in Islandia. 
 But, he said, in the past year, nontraditional means of marketing, such as off-site sales offices and high-tech visual aids, have increasingly been used to presell and advertise proposed new properties.
Home builders are trying to take advantage of the low interest rates and "do as much as they can in a positive environment" before rates start rising again, said Steve Davidson, senior financial economist for America's Community Bankers, a trade association based in Washington that represents 1,200 community savings and loans banks nationwide.
In the past 18 months, following a peak in 2000, conventional 30-year mortgage rates have "come down and plateaued," he said. 
In 2000, interest rates were above 8.6 percent in May and averaged 8.05 percent for the year. Last year, the average rate was 6.97 percent. In recent weeks, the rates have been hovering around 6.5 percent for 30-year mortgages and about 6 percent for 15-year loans. 
"The market is hot because of the interest rates and people investing in real estate rather than the stock market," said Robert Weiboldt, executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute in Islandia.
Unlike those constructing single-family houses, who can advertise and go to contract at any stage of a project's development, those building co-ops or condominiums must file an "offering," or disclosure plan, with the state attorney general's office, according to Richard Herzbach, a partner with Certilman, Balin, Adler & Hyman in East Meadow, the law firm that files up to 90 percent of Long Island's offering plans. 
In order to advertise their impending development as they wait for the offering plan to be accepted, a process that can take up to three months, some developers have begun using a 120-day procedure called market testing, which would allow them to advertise -- but not sell -- their product as they evaluate the community. 
"This gives them an idea of prospective purchasers and also allows them to get a jump on advertising and get their name into the community," Mr. Herzbach said. "No firm commitments can be made during that time, but it gives the developer a list of people he can go back to when the offering plan has been accepted."
ACCORDING to the attorney general's office, five market test applications were submitted in Nassau and Suffolk counties in both 2000 and 2001, an increase from one in 1995.
Meadowood Properties is building 45 condominium units, called the Greens at Meadowood, adjacent to the 18-hole Rock Hill Golf Course. It will be part of an existing 90-unit community in Manorville, built in stages over the past 20 years by other developers.
The new units, averaging 2,200 square feet, are in five-unit two-story buildings with attached one-car garages. End units are $320,000 and include a master suite, den and "flex" bedroom on the ground floor. An open loft overlooks the first floor, and there is another bedroom on the second floor. Other units, at $310,000, have three bedrooms on the second floor, with living space on the first. Common charges for security, maintenance and taxes are $220 a month. 
For the past three months, to expedite sales until the first model is completed, Meadowood has been leasing space for a sales office in the existing 16-by-30-foot clubhouse for $500 a month.
"Using the clubhouse was my way of seizing the moment," said Mr. Neisloss, who had also filed for a market test. "Once the model is completed, I can convert a garage into a sales office, but I will already have opened in a position of strength and with half a dozen sales" since the offering plan was accepted on June 1.
In the past three years, as the Holiday Organization in Westbury has been waiting to begin construction on its latest development -- a 177 single home condominium community in Mount Sinai called the Hamlet at Willow Creek -- it has employed several methods to make the product visible, said Elliot Monter, Holiday's president.
"We are trying to speed up the opening of the models for late August, and we did a market test in order to get to market since it took so long to get approvals," he said. "We will be running ads this month. Also, several hundred people had contacted us while we were going for approvals, and we showed them renderings and plans." 
The homes at Willow Creek, which will have three to six bedrooms and two- or three-car garages, will range in size from 2,600 to 4,500 square feet. The project's amenities will be an 18-hole golf course, a restaurant, outdoor swimming pools and tennis courts. The prices range from $480,000 to $700,000. Common charges will be about $350 a month.
The East Meadow-based Klar Organization sold more than half of its new 44-unit town house condominiums in East Setauket, called Willow Wood, within two months of the offering plan's approval, based on a virtual reality walkthrough on a computer screen, according to Steven A. Klar, a principal.
The units, have either two or three bedrooms, and the first models are to be open to the public next Friday. Prices are to be $325,000 to $377,000 and common charges will be $196 a month.
"Those using the virtual reality tour got the advantage of preopening prices, which were about $20,000 to $40,000 less," Mr. Klar said. "And, it was a lot quicker than building a model. We started construction in January and had a six-month jump in marketing."
Sandy Pines, director of marketing for the Beechwood Organization in Jericho, said, "In the past, 30 percent of our houses had been sold before a model was constructed; now we are seeing 50 to 60 percent."
In most cases, Beechwood begins sales for a proposed development at a trailer at another site that is already under construction, he said. Scale models of the proposed houses -- about 4 feet by 3 feet -- are located at all sites during premarketing.
Sales for Beechwood's new 110-unit condominium project -- Country Pointe at Miller Place -- began at a construction site farther east in Manorville, Mr. Pines said.
The three-bedroom units, ranging from 2,000 to 2,400 square feet are priced from $324,900 to $399,000. Common charges will be about $225 a month. 
While preselling is a benefit, it is not for everyone, according to Michael Dubb, a Beechwood principal.
"It enables us to sell a house for up to 15 percent less if we can sell from plans, because we don't have to pay insurance and interest as long on the land," he said. "Some people can buy like that, but others have to kick the tires."
Once a model is constructed, some builders have speeded up the decorating process by leasing furniture instead of having it custom made. "With leasing, there is no down time," Mr. Neisloss said. "The companies have the inventory, and there is quick delivery. In the old way, we would have had to find a decorator, order fabrics and wait for delivery. "
Leasing furniture and accessories has increasingly become a "flexible tool for builders in a market such as this, where time is of the essence and the need is shorter," said Mark Nash, a principal and president of Builder's Design and Leasing, a 26-year-old firm in Gaithersburg, Md., that designs and leases fully packaged units for residential models.
On Long Island, developers would pay, based on a 12-month to 18-month lease, from $1,500 to $1,800 a month for furnishing the model of a typical 2,000-square-foot, $300,000 town house, Mr. Nash said. The package would include furniture, accessories and installations.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Waterfront Offices Are Seen as Hoboken Harbinger

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
THE mayor of Hoboken is so enthusiastic about the move of the publisher John Wiley & Sons to his city's waterfront, he seems to have dipped into his dictionary to celebrate. "This will add great cachet, and a certain panache," David Roberts said, "having a premier publisher position itself in Hoboken."
 It will also mean, the mayor said, an end to what has sometimes been librarylike quiet along the streets during the day. 
 Once a rough-edged industrial port with blocks of seedy bars hunkering behind its docks, Hoboken has become a commuter town as luxury apartment towers were built one after another along the Hudson River in the past decade. "At night," the mayor said, "the place fills up with a young, exciting population -- but they are people who are away all day at jobs in New York City." 
Mr. Roberts took office only last year, but he said his family had owned and operated various restaurants in downtown Hoboken for many years. "We never had activity during the day," he said.
Now that Wiley is beginning to move into 400,000 square feet at the Waterfront Corporate Center put up by SJP Properties, the mayor said, "We are anticipating a real street life, a new vitality."
Wiley is moving in stages from Manhattan, where it has been headquartered for nearly two centuries. The book publisher will have 800 employees in its new headquarters by year's end. The Waterfront Corporate Center, with a second tower under construction, will eventually house about 2,000 office workers -- roughly doubling the current daily work force in Hoboken.
Right now, the major employers in Hoboken are St. Mary's Hospital, with 820 employees (160 of them part-time); Stevens Institute of Technology, with 550 employees; and the city itself with 550 full-time and 100 part-time employees. The new corporate center anchors a 50-acre downtown redevelopment area that will have mixed uses. The city of Hoboken collaborated with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on the redevelopment plan and on selection of SJP as the commercial office developer.
The Port Authority did infrastructure repair work at the riverside, beginning with road improvements in 1999, then construction of a waterfront walkway and conversion of the old five-acre Pier A into a park. The Port Authority has also allocated funds for another park on Hoboken's Pier C in anticipation of the greater crowds to come, especially at lunchtime.
SJP began work two years ago on the Waterfront Center, breaking ground for the first of two identical 14-story office buildings. "We were just convinced that Hoboken was underutilized as a commercial center," said Steven J. Pozycki, SJP's chairman and chief executive. "As it stands now, I'd say our instincts were proven completely 100 percent correct."
Wiley signed a lease to move its world headquarters to the first building three months before the groundbreaking in October 2000. Three of the remaining four floors of space in the 550,000-square-foot building have been leased. Sumitomo Trust and Banking USA signed a lease for its regional headquarters in December 2000. CPR (USA)/Liberty View Capital Management rented offices for its United States headquarters in March 2001. And Fuji Securities took space for its United States headquarters earlier this year.
Construction of the second building began last November. In March, at the foundation-and-girders stage, Marsh & McLennan signed a lease for 425,000 square feet. The company, a financial services concern based in Manhattan, is to begin moving in 1,200 of its employees this fall.
Mr. Pozycki said the Hoboken site easily met Marsh & McLennan's key requirements -- "primarily to keep employees close to the Manhattan headquarters, while providing them with a Class A state-of-the-art environment."
The Waterfront Center is on 400 feet of river frontage next to the renovated historic Hoboken Terminal building. It offers direct access to New Jersey Transit trains and buses, PATH, the New York Waterway ferry and a new section of the light rail rapid transit system that now runs from Bayonne to Jersey City. Light rail service is to start in Hoboken by the end of the year.
"Most of the people working at the Waterfront Center will be using mass transit," Mr. Pozycki said, "since that is the way most of them get to work now." All the companies are relocating people from New York City, except for CPR/Liberty View, which is moving from Jersey City. 
New Jersey Transit's executive director, George Warrington, said he considered the redevelopment around the terminal to be "smart growth" of the sort that is being promoted by Gov. James E. McGreevey. 
"It's exciting to see," he said, " that the development community in New Jersey and the municipal governments have increasingly come to capitalize on the value of mass transit, and to see the use of transit terminals and facilities as backups for both mixed-use and residential development."
Meanwhile, Mayor Roberts said he was excited that New Jersey Transit was indicating a readiness to capitalize on the commercial possibilities for its property in the redevelopment area. New Jersey Transit had plans to construct a 450-unit residential building on its property; however, it is now considering ideas for commercial development there, both the mayor and Mr. Warrington said.
"Development had been residential-only here for a long time," said Mr. Roberts, who noted that his family business had constructed a housing project some years ago. Too much residential development, he said, "has wound up putting a great strain on our community. It's true that market forces have driven the price of real estate higher. Home and condo prices remain strong. But the rental market is sluggish -- with supply beyond demand."
THE city, whose master plan is 16 years old, is beginning work on a new plan for development, the mayor said. "Rather than tinker with the old one, which dates back to when Hoboken was an industrial city wanting to be a residential city, we will move to a commercial plan."
It is really a matter of taking advantage of what has been there in Hoboken all along, Mr. Roberts said. "There is no other New Jersey city with its downtown two blocks off the Hudson," he said. 
Jersey City, south of Hoboken, is New Jersey's largest commercial office center on the Hudson's western bank. But its downtown is more compact, and not strung along the edge of the water as in Hoboken. One of Jersey City's key transit links to its downtown, the PATH tube to the World Trade Center, was lost in the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Hoboken has more ferry traffic -- up to 20 trips per day -- than any other community," the mayor said, but aside from the ferry, "we have never managed to realize our true mass transit capabilities"
The city offers extraordinary panoramic views of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty, he added. "But we never managed to have people enjoying them from their offices until now."
To those coming in to Hoboken by ferry, the view will also be fine, Mr. Pozycki said. The Waterfront Center buildings, designed to harmonize with Hoboken's historic character, have attractive brick, limestone and granite facades featuring geometric shapes, like triangles, pyramids and a circle.
The ferry currently operates from a temporary site, but the Port Authority has committed to renovating the historic building.
"We're embarking on a voyage," Mayor Roberts summed up, "to a new personality for our city."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 4, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about new office buildings in Hoboken, N.J., included an erroneous figure for ferry trips in a quoted comment on the city's concentration of mass transit. Ferries serving Hoboken number roughly 16 an hour at peak times, not 20 a day. The article also misspelled the name of one of the city's major employers. It is St. Mary Hospital, not St. Mary's.

HEADLINE: A New Authority On Indian Law 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
ON a gothic-style campus that sits about an hour's drive from the state's tribal casinos, the University of Connecticut School of Law is quietly putting together an American Indian law program, with the aim of becoming a leading authority on the subject in the Northeast.
 Nell Jessup Newton, the school's dean, is one of the top Indian law experts in the nation and is nudging the school into the field. She is overseeing the revision of the most important book on the subject, Felix S. Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law, an assignment that lured a professor who had worked with the Hopi and Navajo tribes to accept a job at the school to join the project. Richard D. Pomp, a longtime professor who specializes in tax law, is writing the first textbook ever on the taxation of American Indians, encouraged, he said, by Ms. Newton. And the university is expanding its curriculum to offer another Indian law class, its second, in the coming academic year. Only about two dozen other law schools in the nation offer as many, virtually all of them in the West. (Yale has one.) 
 "This was the only job that I applied to," said Bethany Berger, the professor who came to the school to work with Ms. Newton. "Dean Newton is probably one of the top five Indian law scholars in the country. And so the opportunity to work with her is great." According to state and tribal experts, the Indian law research at the school couldn't happen at a better time. With two of the nation's richest and most powerful tribes located in Connecticut and a handful of others seeking federal recognition, issues involving Indian law are surfacing across the state, making additional and objective expertise in the field a much welcome resource. 
"It's definitely needed here in the Northeast area," said Thomas Acevedo, chief of staff for the Mohegan Indians, who noted that several western universities have strong Indian law programs. "I think UConn is just now discovering that they need that discipline as well in the law school and I think with the hiring of Nell Newton that they will make sure that happens." 
Ms. Newton, who became dean just two years ago, would like to further expand the curriculum to add Indian law courses on topics like jurisdictional issues. The law school has offered an introductory Indian law class since 1998, but is expanding its course offerings in the field. Next year, for example, the law school will offer its first course on American Indian taxation.
The creation of an Indian law clinic that would give students experience working with tribal governments is another one of her goals. And she would like to create an Indian law center that focuses on the unique legal issues of tribes in the 13 original states.
Though Ms. Newton acknowledges that those are long-term plans, she and others said an expansion of Indian law offerings would be useful, especially at a time when Indian issues are consuming the state.
"I am absolutely delighted that more expertise and erudition will be devoted to a subject that is profoundly significant and increasingly so for Connecticut and the whole country," said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, whose office has some lawyers who spend as much as 90 percent of their time working on Indian law issues.
In fact, Indian law issues have been popping up in Connecticut courtrooms with increasing frequency in recent years as the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegan Indians achieved economic power and handfuls of other tribes sought federal recognition and filed land claims. But until now, many lawyers, or judges for that matter, had not delved into that area of law.
"What you are finding is in commercial transactions, for example, or in litigation, you do come across lawyers that just have never experienced it before, so it's a learning process for them," said Jackson T. King, general counsel for the Mashantucket Pequots and a UConn law school alumnus. "And then you also come across judges who have never confronted the issues before either as a judge or in their practice, so it becomes a learning process for them too."
And it's not an easy subject matter. Many lawyers said it is a complicated area of law that involves an interplay of statutes, constitutional law and history that dates backs as far as the 18th century.
As David J. Elliott, a Hartford lawyer representing Kent School in the Schaghticokes Indians' land claim and federal acknowledgment procedures, put it, Indian law involves jurisprudence that is "well off the beaten path of what lawyers usually do." 
The other problem is that many people don't understand the relationships that tribes have with state and federal governments, Mr. Acevedo said.
"People sort of lack the understanding of why do we have Indian tribes as separate governments within the United States and of course people are really never taught that in our school systems," Mr. Acevedo said. "So that understanding sort of exasperates people because they always just think of the federal and state system and they don't understand that there's a federal tribal system within the federal government make up of how the United States is governed."
For that reason, lawyers and judges alike have been very interested in learning more about the subject. Two symposiums that were held by the Mashantucket Pequots in recent years attracted lawyers from around the state as well as state and federal judges, Mr. King said. The General Assembly's judicial committee convened a symposium on sovereignty last year, and in the fall, an Indian law seminar will be held at the Mohegan Sun Casino, said Dale White, general counsel for the Mohegans. 
Likewise, Ms. Newton has given several "Indian Law 101" talks to organizations like the Connecticut Bar Association, covering topics like land claims, Indian gaming and other things. 
"The legal issues are extraordinarily complex and yet we are in a state where most people don't even understand that if you slip and fall on a reservation you have to bring your case in tribal court," Ms. Newton said.
At UConn, the growing amount of activity involving Indian law was not planned. Though Ms. Newton's academic expertise in Indian law made her an attractive candidate, it was not the primary reason why she was hired, said Philip E. Austin, the university's president. Her track record at the University of Denver, where she was dean of the law school, as well as her ability to be an effective fund-raiser also were major factors.
Likewise, Ms. Newton said the presence of two of the nation's richest tribes in the state was not necessarily her sole reason for coming here. 
"I came here because it's just an extraordinary school," she said. "And had there been no tribes in Connecticut, I think I still would have come here."
"I like to think of it as the icing on the cake for me," she added. "I think the same was true for the university."
But Ms. Newton's presence rekindled interest in the subject matter, said Mr. Pomp. A tax scholar who has worked with several third-world countries as well as the Navajo tribe, Mr. Pomp is working on a textbook on taxation of American Indians, which he expects will be published in 2003. 
In addition, Mr. Pomp will teach the taxation course next year with Ms. Berger.
A graduate of Yale University's law school, Ms. Berger said she only applied to UConn because, in addition to teaching Indian law, she wanted to work with Ms. Newton on the revision of the Handbook of Federal Indian Law. Originally written in the 1940's, the handbook has only been updated twice, most recently in 1982. In the current project, Ms. Newton is overseeing more than 30 Indian law experts who are revising the book, which many refer to as the "bible" in Indian law.
"The opportunity to work on that was really tremendous," Ms. Berger said. 
Such a project along with additional course offerings can only benefit law school students, said Mr. King. In addition, they are going to a school in a state where Indian law cases are often raised in courts, which makes it an exciting time to study the subject. 
"The Indian law issues that people think about, a lot of them start in Connecticut," Ms. Berger said. "The questions of tribal recognition, of Indian gaming, things like that, it's all happening here."
And that, Mr. Pomp said, is another reason why the Indian law activity at UConn makes sense.
"I think with the dean's arrival a couple of years ago and with of course our own tribes, this is a perfectly logical development in the history of the law school," he said.

HEADLINE: Strong Demand For Store Space In Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS and visitors to the city have kept shopping despite an weakened economy and the events of Sept. 11, and as a result demand for retail space in most locations has been strong even as the office market has sagged, according to real estate executives. 
 The surge in demand in the retailing market has been led by bank branches that stress convenience to customers who need to conduct transactions outside traditional banker's hours, drugstore chains that seem to want to be on every other street corner and a proliferation of wireless stores that sell cellular telephones and the bewildering variety of calling plans attached to them. 
 "It's the latest craze," said Faith H. Consolo, vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Associates, a brokerage company specializing in retail space. "We had yogurt stores, then we had coffee stores and now we have wireless stores." 
Although there has been an increase in vacancies in some once-hot locations like SoHo, there are multiple bidders for whatever space becomes available in traditional shopping areas -- and some that were not so traditional, like Times Square. Over all, Ms. Consolo estimated the retail vacancy rate in Manhattan is about 5 percent, with most of those vacancies concentrated below 14th Street, where the proximity to ground zero and transportation difficulties have reduced foot traffic. 
This is in contrast to the office market, where the vacancy rate crept above 10 percent in the second quarter, according to a report by Grubb & Ellis, the real estate brokerage and services company. Asking rents for office space have declined 5.7 percent since the beginning of the year to an average of $47.85 a square foot annually, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2000, the report notes.
Brokers disagree about the flexibility of landlords on retail rents, and the difference may be a matter of location. In prime areas, Ms. Consolo said, building managers are sticking to and getting their asking rents. 
In other areas, there appears to be some room for negotiation. "The asking rents are not being published at a lower number, but for the right tenant there is room to talk to the landlord," said Susan Kurland, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company.
Several real estate executives said the events of Sept. 11 have had an impact on the retail scene in ways obvious and not obvious. The obvious include the destruction of the retail space in the World Trade Center and nearby and the reduction of the number of tourists in places like SoHo.
The less obvious include an apparent increase in the number of stores selling home furnishings and other items for the home. "People have been traveling less since Sept. 11," said Joseph A. Aquino, a managing director at Garrick-Aug. "They are staying home more and, as a result, they are more interested in fixing up their homes."
He noted that a 40,000-square-foot Crate & Barrel store is being built at the northwest corner of Broadway and Houston Street and that Maurice Villency, which had planned to vacate a 30,000-square-foot store on Third Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets in favor of a location on Madison Avenue, will now stay and renovate.
The new Circuit City store at Broadway and 80th Street and the proliferating wireless stores are a part of the stay-at-home trend, he said. "That seems to be what people want now, a big television and a cellular telephone." 
If tourists are fewer in some areas of lower Manhattan, they are still very much in evidence in Times Square, which is attracting retailers as new office buildings in the once-seedy area fill with well-paid workers, as well.
Thomas M. Bow, the director of leasing for the Durst Organization, which owns the Conde Nast building on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd Streets, recently arranged for a Duane Reade store on the first floor and basement, even though there is another Duane Reade a block away at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue.
He noted that the shoe stores Foot Locker and Skechers are due to move into the area, Foot Locker next to the heavily visited Toys "R" Us store at Broadway and 44th Street, and Skechers to the Reuters building at Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street. The Skechers store will be in what is known as the "town house" section of the building to the west of the subway entrance on the north side of 42nd Street. J. P. Morgan Chase will have automated teller machines on the ground floor and a branch office on the second floor and 3,500 square feet of street level space remains to be leased. Skechers' 4,500-square-foot store will be the New York flagship for the California-based chain, which brokers say is looking for additional stores in the city.
A 7-Eleven convenience store is scheduled to move into 1 Times Square, the triangular building at 42nd Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway where the ball is dropped on New Year's Eve. The Hershey Food Corporation is planning to open its first major store away from its hometown of Hershey, Pa., at 48th Street and Broadway.
According to Mr. Bow, Times Square may eventually rival New York's traditional shopping mecca of Fifth Avenue for some types of stores because it is becoming a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week market. "Stores like the N.B.A. would be better off here than on Fifth Avenue, because Times Square does not shut down," he said.
Brokers said asking rents on 42nd Street near Times Square are $325 a square foot while space on Broadway in the area has an asking rent of $500 a square foot.
With Nasdaq at the 43rd Street corner of the Conde Nast building and ESPN Zone on 42nd Street, the remaining midblock space was 3,500 square feet of street level space with a 35,000-square-foot basement attached. Mr. Bow said Duane Reade took the street level and 12,000 square feet of the lower level. The remainder was taken by one of the building's major tenants, the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, for use as a library and conference space, he said.
Retail space in low-rise structures to the east of the Conde Nast building on 42nd Street is being leased only on a short-term basis, Mr. Bow said. The Durst Organization has long had plans to demolish the buildings to erect a 50-story, 1.6-million-square-foot office building to be called One Bryant Park.
Heavily visited areas like Times Square, Union Square and Columbus Circle tend to reward retailers better in slow economic times than such secondary locations as the avenues on the West Side where public transportation is less convenient, said Fred C. Posniak, director of leasing for W&M Properties, an investment and management company. 
He said that leasing had been brisk in the Fisk Building at 250 West 57th Street bacause of its proximity to Columbus Circle, near where the Hearst headquarters is located and where a headquarters is being built for AOL Time Warner. "The good location always holds up better than places like SoHo, which was dependent on tourism," he said.
Mr. Posniak said the retail and office markets are related and retailers located near buildings filled with office workers will naturally do better than those in neighborhoods with many vacancies. "Retailers on Eighth and Ninth Avenues are going to have trouble," he said.
But not all real estate executives agree. Some say population shifts are luring retailers to areas of the city once deemed too poor or unfashionable to attract anything but local mom-and-pop retailers. One developing area is the Lower East Side, where refurbished housing is attracting young adults with rents lower than in many other parts of Manhattan, said Alan Victor, executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, a brokerage and services company .
He said new restaurants and boutique stores were opening on Clinton, Orchard and Rivington Streets.
"The Lower East Side is attracting a hip, young crowd and restaurants, like 51 Clinton Fresh Food, have opened up," said Katherine Daisley, director of marketing at Lansco. And she said noted that Orchard Street, between Houston and Delancey Streets, had long been noted for stores offering goods at bargain prices.
"The Lower East Side has been developing for the last decade because there is an economic advantage for people to live there," said Gene P. Spiegelman, director of retail services at Cushman & Wakefield. "Services follow people. You can say the same thing about the West Village or TriBeCa."
"It has become a night-time destination for younger people," she said, ignoring the irony that some of the newcomers are moving to an area their forebears struggled mightily to escape.
Of course, some retailers want to be just about everywhere. In addition to the rapidly spreading Commerce, Washington Mutual and North Fork bank branches and the wireless stores -- AT&T, Verizon, Cingular -- a chain of sandwich shops, Pret A Manger, has been popping up mushroomlike around the city, with 12 stores open in Manhattan and has said it plans to open a score more.
The London-based chain, which is 33 percent owned by the McDonald's Corporation, emphasizes company ownership of its shops (as opposed to franchises), fresh foods prepared on the premises and an absence of preservatives -- what its bags describe as "the obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives common to so much of the 'prepared' and 'fast' food on the market today."
It also publicizes its policy of donating any unsold food to charity at the end of the day to assure customers the sandwiches sold the next day will not be holdovers.
ONE of the underlying strengths of the retail market in Manhattan is the eagerness of foreign companies to establish a presence here, if only to be noticed without much expectation of making a profit. "Some of these stores are here mostly as flagships as opposed to true retail," said David A. Green, an executive director with Insignia/ESG, the brokerage and services company. 
According to Robert Futterman of Robert K. Futterman & Associates, a retail oriented brokerage, there are eight or so foreign-based retailers, including organizations bearing the names of the designers Jil Sander, Joseph Abboud and Adrienne Vittadini, that are actively looking to open their first stores in Manhattan despite the uncertain economic times. 
Other high-end stores that already have a presence in the city, like Coach, Armani Exchange and Ann Taylor, are seeking to expand their already successful businesses, brokers say.
Some retailers try to get ahead of the curve, moving into neighborhoods that are converting from an industrial past to a residential and commercial district. One example, Mr. Green said, is Whole Foods Market, which opened a 40,000-square-foot store in Chelsea at Seventh Avenue and 24th Street. Many of the old warehouses in the area have been converted into art galleries and artist's studios, and other buildings have been converted to housing.
"We are seeing the emergence of a neighborhood as the old buildings are converted," Mr. Green said.
Other companies simply need a space big enough to make their retailing concept work, even if the location is not ideal. The Minnesota-based Best Buy, which sells a broad array of electronic devices and major appliances, was one of them. "Best Buy needed a space where they could lay out the store," said David LaPierre, a managing director with Insignia/ESG. "So they took 43,000 square feet at Sixth and 23rd and now they are open for business.
"The quality of the space dictates where some retailers will go," he added. "They will go to the West Side to find quality space even if they would rather be on the East Side."
Even areas like SoHo, which went from being one of the hottest retail areas of the city to one of the coldest, with annual rents dropping from $450 a square foot to under $300, can be seen as an opportunity rather then a disaster, according to some brokers. "Values in SoHo are getting back to reality," said Jeffrey D. Roseman, a broker with Newmark New Spectrum Retail.
Some real estate executives say SoHo's troubles may be temporary, because many of the tourists that once thronged its streets were from the metropolitan area and had been discouraged from coming to the area by the traffic and other restrictions that followed the events of Sept. 11. They said national chains might move into spaces vacated by local retailers, particularly at the lower rents.
"There is more supply there than there has been in eight or nine years," Mr. Green said. "We are starting to see creditable candidates looking there and the landlords are easing off rents," he said.
Madison and Fifth Avenues were unaffected by Sept. 11 and have barely felt the effect of the recession, said Ms. Consolo, who noted that Asprey, the British seller of luxury goods, is expanding from about 10,000 square feet to 25,000 square feet at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue.
"The retail market is doing much better than I would have expected in this economic environment," said Ms. Kurland of Cushman & Wakefield.

When Publish or Perish Is More Than Just Words

BYLINE:  By LEWIS BEALE 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
HOW'S this for a disaster in the making? A writer and artist, living and working out of a third-floor walkup, decide to start their own publishing house. They have limited funds and almost no experience in the book business. To make matters even worse, the first two volumes they plan to issue seem to have almost no commercial potential.
 "What makes us particularly lunatic is that we're starting off with a book of poetry and a book of literary criticism," said Dennis Loy Johnson, who, with his partner, Valerie Merians, is the driving force behind Melville House Publishing, which will release its first offerings in September. "Two big sellers. Absolute sure fire hits." 
 If nothing else. Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merians are realistic. They know what they're up against. 
More than 135,000 new books were published last year, which means the fight for shelf space at the local Barnes & Noble or independent bookstore is more vicious than a championship boxing match. In addition, New Jersey is not exactly a hotbed of the publishing industry; although the state boasts two fine university presses -- Princeton and Rutgers -- and several small, specialized publishing houses, the bulk of the industry is in New York City, where Knopf, Doubleday and Random House reside.
Then there is the issue of what Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merians have chosen to publish. Even though a third of all the new books in 2001 were adult fiction, children's works or in the field of sociology and economics, Melville House will issue "Poetry After 9/11," an anthology of New York poets, and "A Reader's Manifesto," in which the critic B. R. Meyers attacks pretentiousness in the work of such literary luminaries as Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy.
Despite all this, the limited nature of their potential readership may be an advantage for the initial Melville House offerings.
"Their market will be very clear to them, very specific," said John Whitman of Turtle Books, a small publisher of illustrated children's books. "The advantage for smaller publishers is when they're filling a small niche. When you do something specific, you find people who will follow you. They will find that they will connect more quickly to their market, and they won't waste advertising dollars, because they can go to outlets and venues that can reach that audience."
Not that the two fledgling publishers were thinking that hard about marketing when they decided to create Melville House. The impetus for the venture came from mobylives.com, a chatty publishing industry Web site run by Mr. Johnson, who also writes short stories and whose weekly book column appears in several newspapers around the country. After Sept. 11, Mr. Johnson's site began getting a lot of poetry, and he noticed that "poetry was everywhere."
"I thought this was a remarkable response," he said. "People who don't normally do poetry were doing it. So we also wondered how the real poets were responding, and would people be interested in that."
Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merians decided to solicit poems from writers they knew and to compile them into a book.
"We thought it would be very modest," said Ms. Merians, who is a photographer and sculptor. "We would hand sell it just to New York area bookstores. You know, an out-of-the-back-of-the-car kind of thing."
About that time, Mr. Johnson got a fan letter from B. R. Meyers, whose attack on literary pretension that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly last July had caused a sensation. Mr. Meyers told Mr. Johnson he was going to self-publish his essay to try to reach a wider audience, which Mr. Johnson saw as a recipe for disaster. So Mr. Johnson talked Mr. Meyers into letting him publish an expanded version of the work.
"Then we thought, 'We've got a serious business now. Meyers has got a following. That book will sell,' " Mr. John said.
Then the real work began. The printing itself was the easiest part, since it simply entailed calling around and finding out how much it would cost. But Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merians had to incorporate, hunt down poets and read manuscripts, plus negotiate royalty contracts with their writers. And there was the toughest nut to crack: persuading someone to distribute their books.
"The biggest problem a new press has is getting a distributor," said Mr. Whitman. "The reason more established distributors hesitate to take on new people is because they don't have a backlist, and they're often undercapitalized.
But Melville House was lucky. After several distributors hung up on them or laughed in their faces, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merians connected with a Chicago-based company called the Independent Publishers Group, whose president, a former college professor, took a personal interest in the Meyers book.
"It's a real long shot to take on these little guys," said Curt Mathews, the chief executive of IPG, a distributer for small publishing houses. "The way I do it is to think about what they're publishing, and get a reading on them. Are they clever? The people who make it tend to have a sense of what's interesting and what isn't. You have to be able to imagine the audience, what they want, and how they get to know the book exists. Dennis seemed to me to have some relevant background, so he wouldn't be making it up as he went along, and he seemed real sharp."
Melville House was fortunate in another sense. When word got out that a book of post-9/11 poetry was coming out, the media started to pay attention -- so much attention that it had to hire a publicist. CNN called. So did National Public Radio, "Good Morning, America" and any number of local television and radio stations.
Good feelings aside, there are still serious financial and distribution issues. For instance, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merians have to pay their own printing costs, and given the nature of most book distribution deals, will receive only about 25 percent of the total sale price, out of which they have to cover overhead and pay royalties. Because it usually takes three months from the initial publication date before sales money begins coming in, the neophyte publishers say they do not expect to see money until early next year. In the meantime, they will have spent more than $20,000 -- an enormous amount for them -- borrowed from their families and a bank.
Then there still is the problem of getting the books on the shelves. Although both works are currently listed on the Amazon and Barnes & Noble Web sites, there is no guarantee a reader will be able to find them in a major store.
"The majors like to support the independent publishers and new authors," said William Kohler, a publisher's representative based in Ocean City, "but it involves sifting through the multitude of titles to find what they want to give shelf space to. You're at the mercy of people who have the control, who read the book and say it has a chance."
So it comes down to reviews, personal contacts and marketing and what Mr. Kohler referred to as "sweat equity" -- the simple act of getting out there and flogging the book on their own.
"We will be hitting pavement everywhere we go this summer," said Mr. Johnson. "We will bring books and meet the local store owners."
It certainly will not be easy. Mr. Johnson estimates they will have to sell 25,000 copies of Mr. Meyers's book just to break even, a hefty number for a startup publisher.
But Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merians say they are committed. They already plan to issue two more works, a book of short stories and a volume of poetry, next year. Ultimately, they would like to establish Melville House as a boutique firm that issues no more than six books a year, specializing in highly literary novels and poetry.
"We don't want to be snapping off quickies to make money," Mr. Johnson said.

Living Tax-Free at the Top Rungs

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
ABOUT one in every thousand Americans who earned more than $200,000 in 1999 paid no income tax, despite a 1969 law intended to prevent tax-free living, new data from the Internal Revenue Service shows.
 In an annual report on high-income people who pay no taxes, the I.R.S. said that almost 2.5 million Americans reported an adjusted gross income of at least $200,000 in 1999, putting them in the top 2 percent of all taxpayers. (Adjusted gross income is the last line on the front page of a Form 1040 tax return.) 
 Within that group, 2,525 individuals and married couples paid no federal income tax. These taxpayers had an average adjusted gross income of $389,000 each, according to the spring 2002 issue of the Statistics of Income Bulletin, which the I.R.S. released this month and where the 1999 annual report appeared.
Of those nontaxpayers, 2,174 paid no tax anywhere in the world. 
Over all, the $200,000-plus income group had an average income of $580,000 each and paid, on average, 26.5 percent of their adjusted gross income in federal and foreign income taxes, the I.R.S. found. Foreign income taxes accounted for less than $1 of every $500 of total taxes paid. 
Congress had ordered the reports after a 1969 Treasury study found that 155 individuals and couples paid no income tax on incomes of $200,000 or more. (Adjusted for inflation, a $200,000 income in 1969 was the equivalent of about $908,000 in 1999.)
The number of high-income people paying no taxes has varied from around 1,800 to 2,800 in recent years. Many of them took deductions for interest, including interest paid on investments, and losses from S corporations, a form of closely held business. 
To prevent people with very high incomes from enjoying the benefits of government without sharing in the costs, Congress passed the individual alternative minimum tax in 1969. But over the years, Congress has not adjusted the law to fully account for inflation; as a result, the alternative minimum tax today applies to very few people who make more than $627,000, but can apply to a single parent making as little as $28,000. 
The Treasury Department estimates that the alternative minimum tax will affect about 80 percent of taxpayers who make $75,000 to $250,000 in 2010, when the tax cuts that President Bush championed in his election campaign are fully effective.
As a result of the alternative minimum tax, some taxpayers will get no relief under the Bush tax cuts and others will have their tax cuts reduced.

Parkway's Scenic Views May Soon Be Official

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
As the Henry Hudson Parkway meanders under old stone overpasses in Riverdale, past the green edges of Inwood Hill and Fort Tryon Parks and down the west side of Manhattan, it reveals surprisingly serene views of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge and the elegant architecture of Riverside Drive. 
 The vistas fade in and out as the road curves, which is exactly what Robert Moses had in mind when he built the road in the 1930's. This is exactly why Hilary Kitasei, a Riverdale resident, is leading a group that plans to nominate the road as the city's first official scenic byway. 
 Ms. Kitasei and the Riverdale Nature Preservancy Henry Hudson Parkway Task Force also hope to encourage a few improvements in the roadway. To name a few of their complaints: signs are intrusively large and there are too many of them; cement barriers are ugly; rusted chain-link fences spoil the rustic overpasses; the billboards in Harlem ruin the view of Riverside Church; and the State Department of Transportation is considering straightening some of the S-curves to speed up traffic. 
"Parkways are different from typical highways," said Ms. Kitasei, chairwoman of the task force. "And aesthetics are important. The goal of an expressway is to get from Point A to Point B with the maximum safe speed. A parkway is a driving experience."
The state Scenic Byways Program began in 1992, and today includes 14 roads covering more than 2,000 miles, none in the city. Because nominations must come from a community group, the task force has been meeting with community boards, parks groups and government agencies to rally support. Scenic Byway status would not bring any special protection, but it would make it easier to get money and political support for improvements.
Task force members have different particular interests. Nancy Bruning, president of the Friends of Fort Tryon Park, is worried about the proposal to straighten the S-curves, which would likely eliminate some parkland and worsen a local drag-racing problem.
Paul S. Mankiewicz, a task force member and a biologist who runs an ecological engineering firm on City Island, contends that adding soil and terracing and more plants along the roadways would both beautify the parkway and be an economical way to capture rainwater, reduce flooding and perhaps lower the summer temperature a few degrees.
"It's hard to find a reason to object to it," Ms. Kitasei said. "It's taking back the park in parkway." SETH KUGEL

Bridal Gowns That Draw Oohs A Second (or Fifth) Time Around

BYLINE:  By JAY MOLISHEVER 

 BODY:
IF material objects can carry emotional weight, try to calculate the load-bearing capacity of the gown your mother wore on her wedding day. 
 Laurel Trask of San Carlos, Calif., started looking for her late mother's 1946 rayon brocade gown after she and her fiance, Brian Connor, made plans to marry this fall. "Since my mother had Alzheimer's for many years before her death, she was kind of lost to me," Ms. Trask said. "This is a way of reconnecting with her when she was young and strong." 
 Brides and their mothers say that marrying in a family bridal gown adds emotional depth to the ceremony. It can also be a stylish option. In recent years there has been an upswing in interest in mining attics and closets for wedding dresses -- particularly those from the 1930's, 1950's and 1960's.
This resurgence, said Carolyn Niezgoda, who is a wedding gown restorer in Brooklyn (www.carolynniez.com), "coincides with the fact that their mothers had the beautiful romantic 1950's gowns with the portrait necklines and the full skirts and crinolines that flattered the waist, which were getting away from the those high necks and cover-up gowns that you found in the 40's. Now we're also seeing the beautiful empire-waist sheaths from the 1960s."
For her marriage in June 2001, Marcia Rocker Gardy of Alexandria, Va., decided on her mother's drop-waist gown, a satin and lace confection that had taken on a faded ivory color. When she took the dress to Imperial Gown Restoration in Fairfax, Va. (www.gown.com), Mrs. Gardy requested a light cleaning that wouldn't change its patina, which she said "represents almost 50 years of a wonderful marriage." 
"These dresses give their wearers a greater sense of family connection," said Jonathan Scheer (www.jscheer.com), a fabric restorer on New York's Upper East Side, who reports "a marked increase in brides wanting to wear their mother's, and sometimes, their grandmother's wedding dresses." 
Steven Saidman, Imperial Gown's third-generation owner, said, "There has been a visible, substantial increase in requests to restore antique gowns since 9/11." The revival, he added, began before then; he attributes it to "a culture that has again become more traditional." 
Ms. Niezgoda explained: "People need to create stories, they need the connectedness." For mothers and daughters, she said, the process of preparing an heirloom dress "is almost always an astounding bonding experience." 
Depending on its condition, a family gown can represent a substantial savings -- or a substantial outlay. The cost of restoring a vintage dress can be in line with the price tag on a new designer gown. Even the best-cared-for heirlooms may require careful refitting, not to mention specialized cleaning, repair, color and fabric restoration, even restyling. The process can take several months and can cost from $1,000 to $4,000.
Wedding dresses with a history present certain limitations. Susan Washburne McMichaels Sacher, 28, knew from childhood that she would someday wear the ivory silk brocade gown her great-great-grandmother wore in 1882. Her maternal grandmother and namesake, the late Susan Washburne Reyburn Winship, was married in it in 1941, and her mother, Susan Bishop Winship McMichaels, gave it a spin in 1967. "I'm the fifth Susan in the line to wear this dress." said Mrs. Sacher, who was married in May at Grace Episcopal Church in New York to Robert Sacher, an owner of the Luna Lounge in New York. 
The Susans' gown was a bit discolored in places. "I don't think it had ever been cleaned," Mrs. Sacher said. And she recalled that when she took it to Mr. Scheer, the restorer, "He said to me, 'I could clean it, but I'm worried that the detail and ornamentation could be damaged.' So in the end I opted not to do anything to it."
That meant not letting out the seams. "I'm the same height as my great-great grandmother, so the length was perfect," she said. "But Victorian bodies were quite different than American women's bodies are today. Women wore corsets and such, so while I'm very fit and work out all the time, my shape is not that of a woman from 120 years ago." So the sacrifice Mrs. Sacher faced was caloric, not economic. "I had to find a way to fit myself to the gown," she said.
Some experts recommend that brides avoid emulating every aspect of the look their mothers strived for on their wedding day. 
"This is not a re-enactment, it's a marriage" said Paula Stanton of Elegant Bridal Boutique (www.EverythingVintage.com) in Mount Horeb, Wis., who recommends mixing and matching accessories from other eras. "Having the cap, veil and shoes all from the same period as the dress gives the feeling of a costume, not a bridal gown." 
And reverence for a heirloom gown means different things to different brides. "For some, it's like renovating the old family home; for others, it's a Williamsburg museum restoration," Mr. Saidman said.
When Jennifer Bertsch Dolce and her husband, Jared, of Pelham, N.Y., became engaged two years ago, she decided that she wanted to march down the aisle in the same empire-waisted satin sheath that her mother, Beverly Bertsch, wore in 1965. "I had bought it in Filene's in Boston," Mrs. Bertsch said. "On sale."
Mrs. Dolce, who at 5-foot-8 is three inches taller than her mother, said: "The dress was wrinkled and yellowed. But when I first tried it on, I felt, this is it."
They took it to Ms. Niezgoda, who hand-cleaned and reblocked each panel and restyled it for the bride's taller figure, removing the boxy kimono sleeves and raising the shoulders with spaghetti straps. Then she relined and resewed the entire dress, at a cost of $1,500.
"The dress didn't mean as much to me when I bought it as when she wore it," Mrs. Bertsch said. 
Women who don't have an heirloom dress in the attic can readily find a gown that looks the part. "My mom and dad actually eloped, so there was no wedding dress to be handed down," said Polly Miller Tubbs of Blue Mounds, Wis., who chose a Chantilly lace ball gown from the 1950's from Ms. Stanton's shop when she married Dennis Tubbs in the British Virgin Islands last month. 
Mrs. Tubbs plans to preserve the gown. "Just in case I have a daughter," she said.

With Lofts Scarce, the Bronx Beckons and Artists Notice

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
A few years ago, the murmurs started. Artists were discovering the attractions of the South Bronx: cheap rent, good subway access and, especially, vacant industrial space.
 A few dozen artists arrived, but the expected explosion never occurred. But that may change. Carnegie Management Corporation, a Brooklyn developer, is putting the finishing touches on the conversion of the Estey Piano Company factory into 155 live-in artists' studios, renting for $950 to $1,700 a month. The first 18 units in the long-vacant factory should be available next month. 
 There is no lack of interest. Last month, when Carnegie ran an ad in The Village Voice, calls flooded in.
Mark Hohlstein, a 38 year-old sculptor and collage artist, is one person interested in the area. He tried out the neighborhood once before, but is now living upstate and trying to move back into the city. Most areas, however, are unaffordable to him.
"I'm an artist and to pay the rent in Williamsburg, you have to work," he said. "I have to not make art."
He scoured the map for alternatives. Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and Long Island City, Queens, were filled up, he decided.
"So I just went up, and there's the Bronx," he said.
Carnegie originally bought the piano factory for $4.75 million from Touro College, whose plans to convert it into student housing had fallen through. Renovations, which include installing high-speed Internet service and restoring the ancient clock tower, will cost another $4 million. 
"We decided this is the next frontier," said Berl Jacobs, who, with son Isaac, runs Carnegie. "This is going to be the new Williamsburg." 
Carnegie, which converted six industrial buildings in Williamsburg to lofts, has been working with the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, which has helped them obtain necessary zoning changes.
"From our perspective, this is a logical development for the area," said Neil Pariser, senior vice president of the development corporation. "It has come back from the ravages of the 1970's."
The factory building is a block from the spot where the crucial scene in "Bonfire of the Vanities" was filmed, but it is also near the South Bronx's increasingly popular antiques district.
Workers are preserving the uneven parquet floors, the crisscrossed wooden joists and the industrial window frames while installing modern kitchens and bathrooms.
"The artists have discovered the area for the last four or five years, and it's ripe," Mr. Jacobs said. "When they put in the seeds, we developers come in and let the trees grow." SETH KUGEL

Venture Capitalists Are Taking the Gloves Off

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
THE venture capital world is looking less like a genteel club and more like a brawling barroom.
 Venture capitalists are offering the companies they bankroll increasingly hard-knuckled deals that leave little wealth for a start-up's managers or original backers. The moves are leading some entrepreneurs, desperate for money, to decry today's investors as bullies. Some venture capitalists are even suing rival venture firms, asserting that the tough new terms are wiping out the value of their previous investments. 
 "People are playing hardball," said Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at Charles River Ventures, based in Waltham, Mass. 
The bursting of the Internet stock bubble more than two years ago wiped out many venture investments in dot-coms. Now, amid the bear market in stocks and limited prospects for investors or young companies to make money soon, venture capitalists are looking for novel ways to make money. As a result, "private companies are facing the most onerous terms from venture capitalists that we have seen in 20 years," said Steven E. Bochner, a securities lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., who represents venture firms. 
In the boom of the late 1990's, venture capitalists chose one of two options. They could be paid back their invested capital, share in profits and receive dividends. Or they could convert their preferred shares into common stock when the private company held an initial public offering or was sold. During that time of huge payouts for newly public and acquired companies, they usually chose No. 2.
But with markets now all but dead for initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to the East Coast are increasingly demanding -- and getting -- both options. This "double dip," known as "participating preferred," leaves far less potential wealth for a company's founders and previous investors. Venture capitalists are also negotiating more deals with heightened "liquidation preferences," in which start-ups agree to pay back the initial investment at least two or three times over. 
Previously, venture capitalists handed over money to a start-up in a lump sum. But more are now parceling out funds in tranches, and then only when the new companies reach certain milestones -- a sales target, for example, or the hiring of a particular chief executive. 
They are even trying to protect their investments through veto rights that permit them to block future investments from other venture capitalists who might dilute their stakes, said Mark G. Borden, chairman of the corporate department at Hale & Dorr, a law firm based in Boston. As a result, Mr. Borden said, a start-up company that casts its lot with a particular venture capitalist or group of investors may find itself tethered to those backers and unable to raise new money elsewhere.
ENTREPRENEURS particularly dislike one recent trend: venture capitalists have been pushing young companies to agree, retroactively, to lower the prices that investors now pay for shares should the start-up be worth less when it tries to raise more money later. Such a move, known as a "full ratchet," is intended to prevent an investor's stake from being diluted. But it can significantly reduce or even wipe out the stakes of a company's original investors and managers, giving the new investors most of the company for a song.
"If you were in the first round of investors, you generally now get crushed" when a start-up raises more money later, said J. Edmund Colloton, general partner and chief operating officer of Bessemer Venture Partners, based in Wellesley Hills, Mass.
Consider Mahi Networks, a private optical networking start-up. In three rounds of financing, from September 1999 to November 2001, Mahi raised $110 million from blue-chip venture firms like Benchmark Capital, Sequoia Capital, the GE Capital unit of General Electric and the venture arm of Goldman Sachs. At one point during the Internet boom, Mahi was valued at more than $180 million.
Last month, though, a new group of smaller-name investors, led by St. Paul Venture Capital of Minneapolis, acquired about three-quarters of the company for $75 million in financing. Before that, Mahi was valued at only $25 million, said Chris Rust, Mahi's president and chief executive. But most of that was tied up in employee incentives, including stock options, leaving almost no value for existing investors.
Despite having nurtured Mahi with money and advice, the early investors chose not to back the company further. With the new, lower valuation, "there was effectively no value attributed to all of our previous investments," said one venture capitalist whose firm was an early backer. "We were all completely washed out" in the last round, said the investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
There is no hard data on the prevalence of the newer, tougher terms. Venture capitalists are famously secretive about their deals, which are private and largely unregulated. But ask venture capitalists or securities lawyers who work with start-ups, and tales of onerous terms will abound. "At the end of the day, the money is coming with strings attached," said Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group based in Arlington, Va.
The shift has turned the conventional wisdom on its head. Venture capitalists once loved risk, but no more. The Internet bust and Wall Street's slump have left them scrambling to make money to repay their own investors and to justify their management fees.
Venture capitalists once clamored to be first in the door of a hot new company. Now they can usually make money only by being the most recent investor. "We're certainly looking for later-stage deals, where you get the benefit of the previous investors having taken the risk," said Todd Dagres, a general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.
Some entrepreneurs agree to the harsh new terms simply because they have no other way to raise cash to survive. But other managers now shun the investors, whom they call "vulture capitalists," bent on picking the meat off a young or struggling start-up. Today's venture capitalists "want to take advantage of you," said George R. Waller, chief executive of Strike Force Technologies, an employee-financed software maker in West Orange, N.J. Mr. Waller said he had turned away 30 venture firms in recent months because they had demanded, among other things, hard-to-reach sales milestones.
George J. Nassef, chief executive of ValetNoir, a start-up based in New York that makes marketing software for casinos, said several venture firms had even asked in recent months to have their potential investments secured with receivables, or money owed to ValetNoir by its customers. He turned them all down.
NOT surprisingly, the shift in financing terms is upsetting some venture firms that were early investors in start-ups but are now suffering as the companies seek to raise additional money at bargain-basement prices.
In one high-profile case, Benchmark Capital, a blue-chip Silicon Valley firm, sued the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial this month. Benchmark was an early investor in Juniper, an online financial services concern, having put $20 million into it in early 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst. It also contributed to a second, $94 million round that September. Juniper, based in Wilmington, Del., is seeking to raise $50 million from Canadian Imperial, which already owns around half the company, but on terms that would sharply dilute Benchmark's original, unspecified stake. Benchmark sued to prevent the start-up from raising the money. All the parties declined to comment on the case, which a Delaware judge threw out last week. 
Such friction was rare during the boom, when venture capitalists operated like a competitive but tight-knit fraternity, channeling deals to one another. Start-ups and their backers saw their interests as allied. But in tighter markets, "there's a lot of ugly behavior coming out," said Mr. Bochner, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer. "There's going to be much more litigation like this."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 4, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about disputes in the venture capital industry misstated a ruling in a lawsuit brought last month by Benchmark Capital against the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial, a start-up company that Benchmark helped finance. A Delaware judge denied Benchmark's request for a preliminary injunction to stop Juniper from getting new financing from the Canadian bank, a move that would dilute Benchmark's stake. The judge did not throw out Benchmark's suit.

To the Editor:
 Re "More May Not Mean Better in Health Care, Studies Find" (front page, July 21): At the very least, the research provides evidence that the health care sector is not driven by common market forces. This is especially interesting given the Bush administration's propensity for eliminating central oversight and promoting simple remedies like increased competition. 
 A lack of careful public planning would introduce the same opportunities for abuse into health care that we have seen with Enron. Also, studies like these indicate that abiding by traditional laissez-faire would cause wasteful disparities. Though health care constitutes a major portion of the economy, it is not governed by the conventional principles of economics.

HEADLINE: Not Quite Sex and the City 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
CLUB KIRA guards its secrets well. Waiters in tuxedos admit the male customers to this unmarked Japanese haven, tucked into a residential building on East 49th Street in Midtown, only after studying them through a hidden camera. A red awning signals the club's presence with just two stars: "kira, kira" means sparkle in Japanese. The businessmen who retreat here to unwind know that the shining stars are emblems of the club's young hostesses.
 In a cracker box of a lounge, Ryoko Karasawa and her customer huddled shoulder to shoulder on low leather seats. Around them, other couples leaned into one another. The women wore tight cocktail dresses. The men had arrived straight from work in dark business suits. 
 Ms. Karasawa refreshed her customer's whiskey for what seemed the hundredth time. She poured delicately, cradling the bottle in both her manicured hands. He was drunk, but the married executive did not let his tongue, or his hands, slip much. Not as much as other customers. And Ms. Karasawa was relieved. That night, at least, the $80 she would earn for five hours of work would come a bit easier. 
 Manhattan harbors some 15 Japanese hostess clubs, secretive bars that employ young women to serve as companions for the almost exclusively Japanese and male clientele. Most of the clubs are clustered on the East Side between 45th and 53rd Street.
Common in Japan, hostess clubs offer a hint of the illicit, a chance for ritualistic flirtation but no sex. In a city known for its libido, they represent not quite sex and the city. The small number of hostesses who sleep with their customers do so outside the clubs' auspices. For the men, these sanctuaries mostly provide, for a few hours at least, the illusion of back home.
 Even so, business has declined since Sept. 11, as the terrorist attacks dampened the city's night life. According to the Japanese Consulate, four Japanese companies have abandoned the city since September. In addition, the still-struggling Japanese economy means shrinking company expense accounts and limits on corporate entertaining. At least two expensive clubs have closed in recent months, and more customers are paying their own cover charges. 
 So, another layer of fragility has been added to a sometimes fragile world where half the hostesses don't use their own names, and where emotional sleight-of-hand is the order of the night.
 Club Kira's decor is tasteful but impersonal, as in an expensive hotel. Gleaming coffee tables are cluttered with bottles of Scotch, bowls of rice crackers and heart-shaped ashtrays. A murmur of jazz leavens the talk and laughter within the gray-blue walls.
There are no windows, no clocks, nothing to intrude on the club's mission to offer a timeless sense of refuge and relaxation to men who pay the $150 cover charge simply to sit and talk with the hostesses. Usually, the customers' employers pick up the tab.
 Diversion for the men comes at a high price. For the women who serve them, this means hard work. 
"When I was young, I didn't understand this as much, but a hostess's job is to help people have a good time," said Ms. Karasawa, 31, who was a hostess in Tokyo for 10 years. "Why else would they pay?" 
Ryoko Karasawa was the pseudonym she used on the job in Japan, and she did not want her real name revealed for this article. Other women interviewed also declined to give their full names.
 For the hostesses, most of whom are here on student visas, the clubs represent one of the few job options readily available to them. Some clubs pay the hostesses in cash, off the books. Many of the women hide their night jobs because they violate visa restrictions. Being a hostess also carries a social stigma in the Japanese middle class.
"Most young Japanese women have aspirations," said Ichiro Suganuma, a former manager of an expensive club who now works in the film industry. "They want to be a singer, be rich, see America. But when you come here, it's hard. There are a lot of other women like you."

Outside the Mainstream
In the last two decades, it has become fairly common for Japanese women to study and even work overseas. Still, a Japanese woman's decision to live abroad sets her outside a mainstream culture that guarantees her security as a homemaker, but is not concerned with her professional fulfillment.
"It's very striking that a lot of Japanese women don't have a long-term plan when they go abroad," said Karen Kelsky, a professor of anthropology at the University of Oregon and the author of "Women on the Verge: Japanese Women, Western Dreams" (Duke, 2001). "They have vague notions that they want a career, but they have no societal support for their career goals. It's a poignant situation."
Most New York hostesses fell into the job when they encountered the city's high cost of living. The entertainment at the hostess clubs has its roots in the geisha tradition, which dates to 18th-century Japan. Like the geisha, a hostess indulges her customer's every conversational whim, creating a space where he can escape routine and shed his workaday persona.
For this privilege, patrons pay cover charges of up to $150 at places like Club Kira and $30 an hour at the less expensive clubs. A few of the top New York clubs have sister clubs in Tokyo owned by the same people. But most clubs here are owned by Japanese men who have relocated permanently to New York. At the clubs, customers buy bottles of liquor at about three times the retail price. A bottle of Johnnie Walker Black for $120 is a popular choice.
Titillation is one of the top attractions; hostesses flirt and flatter. Officially, touching is prohibited, but it happens anyway. Sexual banter abounds, but actual sex is rare, and never on the premises. At the hostess clubs, it's men's egos that receive the most caressing.
 Club Kira sometimes gives its customers an extra chance to assert their masculinity. On holidays and other special occasions, a game of darts allows them to win savings off their bill if they strike close to the bull's-eye. One night, Ms. Karasawa, wearing a lipstick-red blazer and a long black skirt slit to the thigh, stood behind her customer and rooted as he took aim at the target, an easy seven feet away.
When her customer's sure throw shaved $100 off his bill, she clapped and smiled, perky as any high school cheerleader. When her turn came, her dart nicked an outer ring. Throughout the night, the women's darts always wobbled short of the mark.
 Insincere? Of course. But in the hostess clubs, it's a man's world.
When men pay for sex, "it's not sincere, it's really cold," Mr. Suganuma said. "The clubs are different. They're not sincere, but they're warm. Let's say you're a lonely guy in New York City. Everyone at the clubs tells you you're the greatest. If you want to smoke, they'll light your cigarette. If you want to drink, they'll pour your drink. Those little things really count."

The Hostesses' Shadow World
Each hostess's approach to negotiating this shadow world, and integrating it into her life, is different.
Ms. Karasawa is unusual among New York's Japanese hostesses because she doesn't hide her job from her friends and family. She said she was not ashamed to be a hostess. She decided she needed the flexibility of the clubs, because she can take the night off when she has an English-language class or another conflict. She said her parents know about her job, and offer moral support.
But Ms. Karasawa receives financial help from no one. She squeezes her tuition and other expenses from the $1,500 to $1,800 she takes home each month from Club Kira. Ms. Karasawa has to manage her money carefully. She buys her cocktail dresses on the outskirts of the garment district for $20 each.
 Though money is tight, Ms. Karasawa does not let her job take up more time than necessary. She already works five hours a night, five nights a week, at $15 to $18 an hour. Most clubs pay hostesses a $15 to $20 bonus if they bring a customer in with them by 9:30 p.m. A hostess will typically call her customer at work or e-mail him to arrange a dinner date, and then accompany him to the club. 
But Ms. Karasawa refuses to do that. "Customers are customers, not friends. I would have a better meal at McDonald's with a friend than an expensive meal with a client."
Ms. Karasawa said she often struggled with her customers' notions that hostesses are young women who spend all their money on recreation and neglect their studies. What bothers her more than sexually suggestive remarks, she said, are comments like, "If you don't have money, you shouldn't study abroad."
"It really sets me off when they say that," she added. "But I can't show my anger."
Unlike Ms. Karasawa, Noriko, 28, a former hostess at Club Gold, an expensive club on East 52nd Street, kept her hostess work a secret, even from her parents, who help her meet expenses. After Sept. 11, Noriko's hours were cut from four days a week to two or three, but she said she didn't mind, because her reduced schedule meant that her new boyfriend had less reason to be suspicious.
Even in jeans and a simple top, Noriko exuded femininity with her careful makeup and red-highlighted hair that fell in soft layers around her face. On the nights she worked, she told her boyfriend that she was out with friends or studying late at the library. About misleading her boyfriend, who is Japanese, Noriko said, "I didn't feel guilty, because I didn't have feelings for the clients." 
Recently, she discovered that her boyfriend had taken some of his business clients to an expensive hostess club. "I was kind of surprised," she said, "because he's not the type to go to clubs. But in his case, he has to go sometimes."
Noriko echoed Ms. Karasawa's frustrations about customers who wouldn't take her seriously. Last year, she earned a graduate degree from a top New York university, but her customers refused to acknowledge her achievement. "A typical customer I didn't like would say things like: 'Where do you live? You live in Queens. What do you do? You go to language school,' " she said, voicing a typical hostess stereotype. "They didn't give me a chance to answer for myself."

Relaxation Without Shop Talk
 Like most clubs, Club Gold is a dusky, timeless vault, its walls closer to saffron than gold. For those who keep track, closing time is 1:30 a.m. Noriko spent many nights at the club, restless and impatient for her guests to leave, eager to switch from her clingy dress to jeans and a sweater. But it's the manager's job, not the hostess's, to hint that the night has come to an end.
"I always told my hostesses that customers work hard for their companies," said Mr. Suganuma, the former club owner. "They need to be treated right, sent back to their companies refreshed. Whatever they say is right."
Men visit the clubs as a release from stress. Even among groups of co-workers, talk of the office or of serious issues rarely surfaces. "Usually the hostesses are very young, new in New York," said Y. N., a frequent club customer who asked to be identified only by his initials. "I'm more experienced. I give them advice, and they like it."
In New York and Japan, a hostess takes her conversational cues from her customer. If he wants to talk, she will listen with puppyish attention or laugh when he cracks a joke. A good hostess can also engage the most awkward man in banter. Most clubs offer karaoke, so singing can help move the night along. Food is never a diversion. Clubs offer snacks like cheese, fruit and crackers, but no meals.
Some men go to the clubs just to socialize with co-workers and enjoy a few hours in the company of attractive young women. Y. N. puts himself in this category. Married with two young children, he said he liked talking with the young women at any number of East Side clubs. But he restricts his visits to work-related socializing, paid for by his employer. He said his wife knows that he goes to the clubs. "What's the big deal?" he asked.
Others nurture hopes of having a relationship with a hostess. With these men, especially, a hostess must negotiate a narrow bridge in offering the illusion of sexual availability without suggesting the possibility of actual sex. Most of the customers are married. Most of the hostesses are single.

'They Want a Girlfriend'
"Even if they're married, they want a girlfriend," said Kanako, a former hostess at Club Gold. Kanako, 22, looks like an Asian kewpie doll, with big eyes and a round face framed by bright red hair. Petite and hip, she was able to wrap herself in the latest designer fashions by treating her clients like so many open wallets.
As is customary in Japan's service sector, men don't tip the hostesses, but some men give them gifts on special occasions, like birthdays or holidays. For Kanako, accepting gifts was part of maximizing her earnings.
 One married customer took Kanako out to buy a Chanel bag and to dinner at a nice restaurant. Then he told her that he had made a hotel reservation for the two of them. 
"His wife was due to deliver their baby in a week," she said. "Can you believe this guy, going on dates with girls while his wife is pregnant and has to stay home? I got mad, and asked him, 'Is that why you bought me these things, because you want to sleep with me?' He said, 'No, that wasn't the case,' and apologized. I got in a taxi and went home to Queens."
This spring, Kanako stopped working as a hostess. She had begun seeing a young Japanese man who said he would leave her if she didn't quit. "I preferred being poor with him to being rich without him," she said.
Hostesses who live in Manhattan find it harder to dodge customers' advances. The more aggressive men find out where they live and then drop by their apartments on the pretext of walking a dog or doing an errand. Some even note whether a hostess appears to be home. If her light is on but she doesn't pick up the phone, he will confront her the next time he comes to the club.
Ms. Karasawa, however, never entertains after-hours invitations. More experienced than the younger hostesses, she simply tells her customers that she does not want to see them outside the club.
Still, she understands the paradox of being a hostess in New York: it's her job to soothe away the tensions of life in a foreign land for men whose safety net is much wider than her own.
But, she said, "When it comes right down to it, we've got to look out for ourselves."

Wholesale Name-Dropping

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF we baby boomers have been criticized for anything, it is our tendency to live the high life. If we can afford nice things, we buy them. Why stay at a hotel when a resort is nearby? Why watch television on a little screen? We traded our sedans for sport utility vehicles, then got rid of the first models when the luxury carmakers jumped in. Now BMW, Mercedes and even Porsche, for goodness' sake, are putting such powerful engines into their sport utility vehicles that drivers can have it all -- an S.U.V. that is also a sports car. Did they do that just for us?
 So it is surprising that in other ways, we are edging in a direction that seems appropriate for our more practical parents. Even before the stock market began its plunge, we were becoming a generation of warehouse-club shoppers. Suddenly, price does matter, and, more surprising, we're bragging about it. 
 "It is a relatively new societal phenomenon," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. "People used to wow you about how much they paid for something. Today they impress you by telling you how much money they saved."
When I was a kid, my parents shopped at a warehouse-type store called Railroad Salvage, where, as I remember, the merchandise had that fell-out-of-a-boxcar look. Now the wholesale clubs are luring us not only with lower prices, but also with more high-end products. At dinner parties, I used to see shopping bags from Fresh Fields and Hay Day, the luxury grocers, in the hosts' kitchens. Now the food is coming from warehouse chains like BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club, where customers buy in bulk at lower prices. "Before, I'd hire a caterer when I'd have a party," one woman told me. "Now, I go to Costco."
When retail sales rose in June, the gain was led by discounters like Wal-Mart Stores, which runs Sam's Club, and by Costco Wholesale.
Mr. Barnard, who has seen Rolls-Royces in parking lots of warehouse stores ("It wasn't the chauffeurs who were shopping"), said boomers are the majority of customers.
Jim Hebert, president of Hebert Research in Bellevue, Wash., said the average Costco member is 48 and has a median annual income of about $74,000. Slightly more than half the members are baby boomers, he added. One explanation, beyond the quest for name-brand goods at low prices, is that boomers are raising families and have homes with enough room to store all the purchases.
"Costco is pretty typical baby-boomer demographics," Mr. Hebert said. "With the concept of buying in bulk, you have to have a house big enough to hold the bulk. It's sort of good for good-size families who have an extra freezer so they can buy things and store them. Baby boomers are the ones with the bigger families and living in the suburbs."
Greg F. Young, 46, a certified financial planner in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., who has two teenagers, said it was easy to get carried away at these places. "I've gone there to return something and spent $150," he said. "You see everything you need and it's in large quantities. You just know you're getting a better deal than at the supermarket, so you end up eating the same cereal for three months."
Two other Costco shoppers are Homa Sabet Tavangar, 36, an international business consultant, and her husband, Alex, 45, an engineer, of Berwyn, Pa. They also have two children.
"It used to be embarrassing saying you got something from there, but it's not embarrassing anymore," she said. "Now you show off what you bought."
Mr. Hebert called the trend the "Costco delight."
Richard A. Galanti, chief financial officer of Costco, said it was the "bragging rights" of finding good deals.
"Not only did they find it at Costco," he said, referring to products like Prada handbags and fancy wines, "but they're saying, 'Look at the price of this thing.' "
Mr. Barnard said that even the wealthiest people now think that it is stylish to save. "Regardless of what your economic status may be, you are forced to recognize that if you pay more, you're a bloody fool," he said. "That is essentially the secret that is driving such companies as Wal-Mart, Target and dollar-type stores.
"The discount store is something you would creep into in the middle of the night," he added. "But now it is wholeheartedly embraced. Nobody likes to be taken for a ride, especially the boomers."
MY wife, Christine, regularly chides me about filling up the basement with my warehouse purchases. "Do we really need 20 bottles of apple juice?" she asks. She has given me one wall of the basement to stack my hoard and dares me to step beyond that.
One morning, I was able to fight back after I caught her staring at me.
"What?" I said.
"You look very handsome today," she said, as if that were a rare event. She continued to study me. "Oh, it's the shirt. It's new. It looks great on you. Where did you get it?"
This was going to be fun. "Costco," I said, giving her my best Brad Pitt smile. "$14.99."
I should have told her that I had two more cases of them in the basement.

HEADLINE: What, Me Worry? 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
LAST Tuesday, Jeffrey K. Dorner, a medical secretary in Manhattan, thwacked a stack of envelopes marked Templeton Financial, Fidelity and American Express onto his desk and gazed at them as if they were a bad hand in a big-stakes poker game. 
 "I won't open any of them," Mr. Dorner said, his arms folded. "Why deal with the bad news?" 
 Bad news is epidemic right now. If seasons were ailments, the summer of 2002 has turned out to be one big kidney stone that just won't pass. 
In nine weeks, starting before Memorial Day, the stock market averages dropped more than 20 percent in value, one of the swiftest descents in Wall Street history. 
A study supported by the National Institutes of Health reported that hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, long touted as beneficial, puts women at risk for cancer. 
Global warming will choke water supplies, destroy coastal marshlands and cause scorching heat waves in coming decades, the Environmental Protection Agency warned in a report issued last month. And depending on the day of the week and which famous person has lost weight on the Atkins diet, bacon will either make you skinny and healthy, or it will make you fat and dead. 
Recession, terrorist threat, clogged arteries, a hole in the ozone the size of France? Fuhgeddaboutit! While lots of conscientious Americans are frantically juggling their finances and questioning their doctors, many are responding by simply not responding. 
Perhaps it is because the sea of potential troubles is too overwhelming, some experts on denial say. Or perhaps a little I-know-nothing-I-see-nothing is the typical mind-set of summer, that reverent time when Americans let things slide off their suntan-greasy backs as they lumber toward September, a month far more suitable to the twin straitjackets of anxiety and responsibility. 
Sociologists and psychiatrists have long considered denial to be an essential component of the human survival instinct. 
Katie Long, the director of publicity for Hyperion Books, said last week that her survival instinct, like that of most of her friends, was focused on financial concerns. 
"I made a vow at lunch not to look at my 401(k) statement for two years," she said. "No way."
Even though the markets perked up on Wednesday, the effects may only be temporary. 
Lewis Canfield, an art consultant, said that of course he was in denial, but he was not sure about the subject of his denial. 
"I am absolutely positive that there is something to be in denial about, but if I'm in denial about it, well, how would I know?" Mr. Canfield said as he traveled through Manhattan in a chauffeured sedan from appointment to appointment. "Wouldn't I be denying it? Isn't that why it's called 'in denial' ?"
Mr. Dorner, for one, said he would not think about opening his financial statement until the fall. And then, he said, "it will be only out of morbid curiosity." 
As the psychiatric darling of the last quarter century, denial is the symbol of an era bounded by Woody Allen's neuroses and Oprah Winfrey's gentle probings, a pop plaint that even generated a T-shirt slogan that is now exhausted about how denial isn't just a river in -- yawn -- Egypt. 
The late psychologist Ernest Becker, in his 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning 1974 book "The Denial of Death," wrote that without denial, human beings might become paralyzed by fear on their way to work, frozen on a corner awaiting "the suction of the infinite" -- and then never even make it to Dunkin' Donuts. 
Dr. James Pennebaker, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas who studies stress, said there was a thin line between denial and "overlooking." 
"If there is nothing you can do about the situation, if it is beyond your control, you have the option to either obsess about it or move on," he said. "A lot of these people worried about the stock market may just be moving on in their own quiet way."
For the six million American women of menopausal age on hormone replacement therapy, it is still hard to tell if they are in denial or just confused. Earlier this month, a large federal study of the therapy was halted because the drugs, a combination of estrogen and progestin, caused slight but significant increases in the risk of breast cancer. 
Adrienne Burros, an artist in New York, said last week that she has been taking hormone replacement medication for six years and, despite the recent news, has no immediate plans to stop. 
"I have read everything and still can't figure out what to do, so I have sort of given up on making any decisions at all," she said. "My friends are all in the same boat."
Ms. Burros said that her ability to deny that the therapy might be bad for her had only been helped by the fact that her doctor is, well, also in denial. 
"Even he doesn't know what to do," she said. "So as long as he is in denial, I can be too."
Robert Strang, executive vice president of Decision Strategies Fairfax International, a security and investigative concern, said that denial was the only way a lot of people, especially those in law enforcement, could get out of bed. 
"Nuclear attack, breaches in mainstream security, fear of water contamination," Mr. Strang said last week as he counted threats to domestic well-being on his fingers. "If you take any of those seriously, as seriously as they could be taken, well, you won't get out of the door in the morning. A healthy level of denial keeps the collective blood pressure down."
Some forms of denial actually keep blood pressure up. Eric Schlosser, the author of "Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal" (Houghton Mifflin), said that the popularity of fast food was an ideal demonstration of the human power of denial. 
It is, after all, the logical conceit behind the popularity of fast food. How else could Americans, who get fatter every year, simultaneously increase their intake of fast food, a source of hydrogenated fats not even approved by the Atkins diet? 
"Fast food is a very immediate source of gratification," Mr. Schlosser said. "While you are eating it, you don't think about where it came from, how it was made, what will happen if you eat too much." 
His theory was underscored by a lawsuit filed in the Bronx last week against four fast-food chains by a 275-pound man, who said that until he had two heart attacks it never occurred to him that a steady diet of take-out fried chicken and greasy burgers was a problem. 
Mr. Schlosser said there was a correlation behind the type of person who would worry extravagantly about terrorism and the kind of person who would order fast food. And then go into quick denial of both. 
"If you're worried about Al Qaeda," he said, "you'd also probably say: 'The heck with it. Supersize that, and make those fries a large.' " 
But denial also has its down side. People who avoid confronting bad news suffer in the long term, said Dr. George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon.
"Avoidance backfires in so many ways," Dr. Loewenstein said. "If you do not expose yourself to the bad news, you are unable to adapt to it, and it causes more distress." 
In fact, Dr. Loewenstein said, many people's emotional reactions to bad news, in the form of denial or avoidance, can register disproportionately to the severity of the crisis and cause long-term damage. The economic markets are shaky, yes, and Americans consider the perils of terrorism when they fly on an airplane, but neither the economy nor terrorism is as serious a problem as the long-term damage to the environment that the E.P.A. study raised, he said. 
"This will make me very unpopular in New York," he added, "but to me the issue of global warming is a problem of potentially catastrophic proportions larger than that of terrorism and the other issues around Sept. 11. To me that is an example of people's emotional reactions, their denial of what the real problems are, driving individual and policy responses that are not proportionate to our gravest problems." 
Scott Prendergast would not disagree, but he finds there are so many varieties of unfortunate news these days, personal and global, that he cannot keep track.
"I am in denial about the fact that I only have enough money to live on until Dec. 1," said Mr. Prendergast, an actor who is directing a film. (He is the driver in the Volkswagen commercials who asks his co-pilot for a french fry.) "I am spending the money I should be living on making the movie. It is boiling in Alaska, Alaska is melting, but I can't think about it. I can't think about it because what am I going to do? Go there and hold up the sky?"

HEADLINE: Looking for Ways to Make Deregulation Keep Its Promises 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
WHILE the political winds have shifted back toward regulation of the economy, many mainstream economists prefer to tweak deregulation and repair its flaws. Six economists offered their views to Money & Business. LOUIS UCHITELLE

JAMES POTERBA: Economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 During the rising stock market of the 1990's, many workers accumulated substantial amounts in their defined-contribution retirement plans, particularly 401(k)'s. Those who received the largest increases often held poorly diversified retirement portfolios, in many cases with large holdings of employer stock. 
 Owning company stock has the advantage of aligning the employee's incentives with those of shareholders, but it puts all the worker's eggs in one basket. If the company fares badly, the employee may be laid off. If the employee also holds significant amounts of company stock in a retirement account, the layoff could be accompanied by a sharp drop in retirement assets.
The incentive benefits of stock ownership may outweigh the lost diversification for top executives, whose decisions may significantly affect company value. But for rank-and-file employees, the diversification concerns are likely to dominate. Stock-price declines at Polaroid, Enron, WorldCom and other companies have decimated the retirement-plan balances of many workers.
Two regulatory repairs of the defined-contribution pension system could reduce the risk of similar episodes in the future. First, there should be limits on requirements that employees hold company stock in 401(k)-type retirement plans. Particularly when the defined-contribution plan is the only retirement plan, employees should have an opportunity to diversify.
Second, employers should be required to provide a minimal level of financial education to retirement plan participants. Many employers are currently reluctant because the distinction between "education" and "advice" is not clear. Employees who believe they were advised to hold assets that subsequently perform poorly might sue the employer that provided the financial education. Pension sponsors need a safe harbor that will protect them from suits if they provide their workers with rudimentary information that will permit them to make informed investment choices.

JONATHAN B. BAKER: Professor at American University's Washington College of Law and a former director of the bureau of economics at the Federal Trade Commission.
Last year, airline passengers were complaining about overcrowding, flight delays and lost baggage -- the byproducts of deregulation's success in promoting competition and low fares. Although many airlines are now losing money, that is not a failure of deregulation. Carriers spill red ink when air travel slows, then profit when the economy picks up.
The policy challenge is not the impossible task of holding back the boom-and-bust tides, but to ensure that the airlines compete vigorously throughout the business cycle.
During booms, major carriers may seek to discourage new service by low-cost, no-frills rivals on the model of Southwest. When an entrant starts to serve a city pair nonstop, the incumbent may aggressively expand its own capacity on the route to drive out the new rival, then cut back service and raise fares. To reduce this threat, underserved communities could be allowed to offer short-term "patents" to entrants providing new nonstop service, preventing an incumbent from adding capacity before the new service is established.
Also, corporate frequent-flier awards used for personal travel could be taxed as income, ending a subsidy that makes it tougher for new entrants to attract business passengers. 
When the economy is weaker, carriers may reduce service. But cyclical downturns should not excuse anticompetitive mergers between rivals with significant route overlaps. In addition, lost competition can be replaced by granting foreign carriers more freedom to expand service in the United States.

SEVERIN BORENSTEIN: Director of the Energy Institute at the University of California at Berkeley and professor of public policy and business administration.
Market forces can improve on the old, inefficient regulatory approach to electricity while avoiding California-like crises.
California's experiment exemplified why electricity markets have been so volatile: demand fluctuates widely, but production is constrained by generator capacities and electricity cannot be stored. Moreover, tight markets put some sellers in a position to run up prices by withholding output.
Regulated systems guard against shortages by building extra reserves of expensive generation capacity. Much of it sits idle except for a few hot days each year, an approach that is economically wasteful and environmentally irresponsible.
Two elements are critical to making a deregulated market work and ensuring sellers cannot drive up spot prices by withholding output:
* Real-time pricing of electricity -- where large industrial customers pay prices that fluctuate hourly with the wholesale price -- would encourage conservation on the peak-demand days, avoiding extreme price spikes and reducing both the chance of outages and the need for idle reserve capacity.
* Purchasing power through long-term contracts would help utilities and customers lessen the impact of large swings in spot prices.
With these foundations, market forces can produce a more efficient and environmentally sensible electricity industry than we've had under regulation.

LAWRENCE J. WHITE: Economics professor at the Stern School of Business, New York University.
Banks so far have not been center stage in the accounting meltdown of the last nine months. But a few -- notably Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase -- have played strong supporting roles, especially in Enron's antics.
Is deregulation a problem? Not yet. Deregulation has given banks more flexibility, which is generally to the good. But it also allows them to make more mistakes. Small mistakes are the problem of the shareholders, but if big mistakes lead to bank failures, the federal deposit insurance funds are at risk, and ultimately, taxpayers.
The savings and loan debacle of the late 1980's was a story of granting greater flexibility without adequate safety controls. Taxpayers paid dearly for that public policy error -- around $150 billion.
Safety regulation is in much better shape than it was circa 1985. But there is still one gaping hole: accounting information.
The inadequacies of generally accepted accounting principles are now legion. GAAP is even worse for financial regulation because it is oriented toward historical information about assets and liabilities. Bank regulators -- and the general public -- need up-to-date market-oriented information so that they can make better judgments about the riskiness of banks' strategies. With better monitoring, banks are less likely to stray.
Further, regulators need the information more frequently than once a quarter or even once a month. In this information age, the goal should be daily market-value accounting: real-time information about real values.

ELI M. NOAM: Economics professor at Columbia University.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, in effect, regulated today in order to deregulate tomorrow, once competition was achieved. But the meltdown of recent months suggests that this policy is failing.
The telecommunications industry is characterized by huge investments followed by tiny costs of serving additional customers. In competition, this drives down prices to unprofitable levels. It creates boom-bust cycles, of which we have encountered the first but surely not the last.
The key requirement is to raise the industry's revenues without killing competition. To do so, one needs an interplay of the retail prices that consumers pay and the wholesale prices carriers pay each other. Consumer retail prices are already set by a "price cap" formula. To that formula one should add automatic price adjustments based on well-defined economic indicators for the state of the industry's business cycle.
But only some of this extra money would remain with the local companies. The rest would be flown through to carriers and competitors that interconnect into them, by the regulators lowering the "wholesale" price that carriers must pay each other for interconnection.
Thus, a new regulatory bargain would be struck that is remarkably similar to the deal a century ago between AT&T and the government. This time, it would be in support of a multicarrier environment, to provide consumers with choice and innovation, though at a higher price than before. The alternative is remonopolization, not free markets.

GEORGE A. AKERLOF: Economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
If you let your toddler out of her playpen, you need to watch her more carefully. This wisdom is known by every American parent but has been systematically ignored in economic deregulation. For example, in the 1980's, savings and loans were given greatly expanded freedoms. But in misguided zeal for deregulation, regulatory budgets were cut, not raised. Enterprising individuals found ways to loot the savings and loans for their own gain. Taxpayers, as the ultimate guarantors of deposit insurance, were left holding the bag.
Californians also learned the lesson of the playpen in their experiment with electricity deregulation. Regulators fell asleep on the job; amid blackouts and skyrocketing prices, energy producers and traders manipulated the market.
Over the past generation, financial deregulation has increased the scope for financial mischief. Also, increasingly complex financial derivatives have reduced the transparency of corporate accounts, making mischief harder to track. We must revise our accounting codes accordingly and shore up the regulatory agencies, especially the S.E.C., which have been starved of funds for so long.
Now is the time to remember the lessons of the playpen: increased scope for action must be accompanied by increased regulatory oversight.

As the DollarSlumps, Whither the Stock Market?

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
AFTER two years of almost relentless decline, the United States stock market has a new source of distress: a falling dollar. 
 While the dollar rebounded last week, it is still down 7 percent since January against a basket of foreign currencies, with the euro and the yen showing particular strength. 
 When the dollar falls, American stocks can suffer in at least two ways. Prices of imports rise when expressed in dollars, raising inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates. And a declining dollar reduces the value of American assets, making foreigners less inclined to own them. 
But a falling dollar can also produce salutary effects, especially for companies that do much business abroad, in part because their foreign earnings rise when they are converted into dollars.
Analysts and fund managers assert that they do not pick stocks based solely on expectations of foreign-exchange movements. And currency fluctuations are difficult to predict: there is little agreement, for example, on whether the dollar's recent slide will continue.
Still, professional investors take exchange rates into account. If the dollar keeps dropping or stabilizes near current levels, their choices will be affected.
"If you want to play a weakening U.S. dollar, you buy the companies that are big exporters or those that make most of their profits overseas," said Shawn Johnson, research director at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. "The idea is simply that when you translate foreign revenue back into dollars, it helps dollar-based earnings. In the last few periods of dollar weakness, usually tied to a U.S. recession, this could have been a profitable short-term investment idea."
WHEN the dollar is weak, American companies' foreign revenue can swell because their products are cheaper to buyers abroad, raising the prospect of stronger sales as domestic competition is undercut.
Consumer product makers like Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive and Gillette derive much of their revenue overseas and may be well placed to make the most of a sustained period of dollar weakness, Mr. Johnson said.
Simon Melluish, a fund manager at Gartmore Investment Management in Conshohocken, Pa., near Philadelphia, also mentioned Coca-Cola, along with Procter & Gamble, another consumer goods giant with a large proportion of sales overseas.
But Mr. Johnson advised caution before buying traditional weak-dollar investments. Because many big companies now hedge their foreign currency exposure, he said, their stocks may not perform as well as they did previously in similar circumstances. "When the dollar starts to weaken, the companies won't get the full benefit, as they did in years past," he said. "In addition, many of the companies have placed production capacity overseas, matching costs and revenues. So I would not look at this as a windfall."
Predicting the impact of a weak dollar on the broad market is especially difficult. Analysts draw different conclusions from history.
"Dollar weakness is associated with weakening equity markets," John Bocchino and Michael Karagianis, strategists at Aberdeen Asset Management in London, stated in a report studying two periods of dollar decline, in the late 1980's and in 1994. "This is not just restricted to the U.S. equity market but generally produces weaker global markets.
"Sharp U.S. dollar weakness heightens investor risk aversion, resulting in a sell-down of risky assets such as equities and buying of risk-free assets such as U.S. government bonds."
But Byron R. Wien, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, focused in a note to clients on the dollar's plunge after the 1985 agreement known as the Plaza Accord, in which governments pledged to engineer a fall in the dollar. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 21 percent three months after the accord and 38 percent after six months.
"The message here is that a weak dollar was good for U.S. stocks generally in 1985," Mr. Wien said. "It may not work out that way this time, but the fear that a dollar decline would be a negative for equities did not hold."
There is wider agreement that a fall in the dollar benefits certain foreign stock markets, notably those in Asia outside Japan. When the dollar falls against the yen, exporters elsewhere in Asia gain an edge on Japan, said David Gait, senior analyst for Asia and emerging markets at First State Investments in Edinburgh. That advantage may be muted this time, he added, because of weakness in the American technology sector, a traditional buyer of Asian goods.
Another gain can accrue to Asian companies with debt denominated in dollars: as the dollar falls, so does their debt. Mr. Gait cited two companies that should benefit from that: Philippine Long Distance Telephone and Korea Electric Power. Both have stocks listed in the United States.
As a result of the economic and currency crisis in Asia in the late 1990's, many economies in that region are now more balanced, he said. Domestic consumption has joined exporting as an engine of growth. When the dollar was soaring, central banks had to tighten credit to keep their currencies strong; with the dollar in retreat, they can relax their grip. "We're beginning to see a recovery of domestic consumption and demand," Mr. Gait said. As Asians embrace the American shop-till-you-drop culture, shares of retailers and producers of consumer goods should do well, he said.
Among stocks he likes are the retailers Shinsegei, in Korea, and Esprit Holdings, a chain of apparel stores based in Hong Kong. Esprit is known as "the Gap of Asia" and has strong sales in Europe.
The biggest losers from a suffering dollar could be Japanese and European companies that depend heavily on American sales. Their products are suddenly more expensive than those of rivals in mainland Asia and the United States.
"The problem with dollar weakness is that there are few places to hide," said Steve Tyson, head of global equities at AXA Investment Managers in London.
Particularly exposed, he said, are Japanese makers of consumer electronics. 
Mr. Tyson also suggested avoiding European producers of consumer goods. Some food or beverage companies that are most exposed to the dollar are Cadbury Schweppes, Diageo and Allied Domecq in Britain, Nestle in Switzerland and the British-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. All five trade on American markets.
European makers of industrial equipment, for which the United States is a large market, could also suffer. Not only will their American sales translate into fewer euros, Swiss francs or Swedish kronor, but their big-ticket products may become prohibitively expensive. "The sector rarely outperforms when the dollar is weak," Mr. Tyson said.
BUT just as American companies hedge their currency exposure, the same strategies ease potential losses for European companies.
Among the few European companies that could show strength are food and clothing retailers. Their businesses are minimally affected by currency movements because a large proportion of their sales are in Europe, while their stocks gain value to American investors as the currencies in which they are denominated appreciate.
Two British companies he likes are Tesco, the supermarket chain, and Marks & Spencer, the retailer. Both are traded in the United States.
When pressed to name European companies outside Britain that should benefit from dollar weakness, Mr. Tyson suggested Hennes & Mauritz, the Swedish company that is the biggest clothing retailer in Europe. It is expanding its H&M stores in the United States, but those still accounted for less than 5 percent of revenue in June.
"They source their manufacturing in Asia in dollar-related currencies, so their cost of goods is down, and they are selling in Europe in euros and pounds, etc.," he said. "It's a real struggle to come up with names, which I think tells you something about Europe's sensitivity to the dollar. It is high."

Handicapping the (Once Almighty) Dollar

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
THE weakness of the dollar has left investors divided over the currency's direction, especially against the euro.
 Some analysts expect the euro, now trading at 99 cents after stumbling last week, to climb toward $1.20. That would be above its original trading level of $1.17 at the beginning of 1999. 
 Others, however, foresee a continued recovery of the dollar, with the euro moving back down to about 95 cents. The euro's low against the dollar was in October 2000, when it was at about 83 cents. 
In any case, there is a consensus that a multimonth or perhaps even a multiyear period of dollar weakness has begun.
A survey this month of global fund managers by Merrill Lynch shows a strong majority, 68 percent, naming the euro as their favorite currency over the next 12 months, with 13 percent favoring the dollar, 6 percent the Japanese yen and the rest stating no preference. The survey has found a tilt toward the euro for many months, even when it was falling against the dollar.
Shaun Roache, an equity strategist at Citigroup in London, predicted early this month, with the euro then at around 98 cents, that the momentum of the euro would carry it to $1.02 to $1.03 and that it would then reverse course. Indeed, its recent peak was just above $1.02, on July 19.
"As we go through the year, the U.S. economy will show signs of a rebound," bolstering the dollar's value, he said. 
"The news on Europe isn't helpful, either: strikes in Spain and other countries, fiscal deficits," Mr. Roache said. "It doesn't mean disaster in Europe, but it doesn't argue for a significant advance in the euro."
Making a case for a stronger yen is even tougher, given that the Japanese government has been intervening in the market, selling yen and buying dollars, to try to keep the dollar above 120 yen; it now trades at 119 yen. Below that level, many economists think that Japanese exporters would face hardship in the global marketplace as the relative cost of their products rises.
Mr. Roache expects the dollar to rise back to 130 yen over the next 12 months.
John Beck, chief investment officer at the Fiduciary Trust Company International in London, is more bearish on the dollar. The United States buys more goods and services than it sells, producing a net outflow of dollars, so it needs foreigners to bring those dollars back through investment, he said.
With stocks faring poorly, demand for American assets has fallen, taking the dollar along with it. That situation is unlikely to change soon, Mr. Beck said.
The United States current-account deficit -- a measure of the net exchange in goods, services and gifts among countries -- is approaching 5 percent of annual economic output, he said, and the government's budget surplus has vanished. "That cannot be constructive for the dollar on a medium-term basis," he said, adding that it was "most unlikely" that the dollar would "continue to be the superstrong currency it was."
Mr. Beck expects the euro to rise to $1.17, its original level. He predicted that the yen would rise, too, though much more modestly.
GABRIEL STEIN, an international economist at Lombard Street Research in London, said that based on current economic conditions, it would be reasonable for the euro to climb as high as $1.10 or fall as low as 95 cents.
"If you want to do a traditional manufacturing-cost comparison, the right cost is $1.10," he explained, "But I doubt it is likely to go as far as that. More likely, looking at overall fundamentals in the United States and Europe, the right rate is slightly below parity, between 95 cents and $1."
The dollar is bound to recover over the long haul, he said, because the structure of the American economy is sounder than those of Europe and Japan.
"It's in the nature of these things that when there's a big move, you have an overshoot," Mr. Stein said, "But long term, the dollar is likely to be strong again. Fundamentally, the economy is stronger in the United States than in euroland." CONRAD DE AENLLE

HEADLINE: Broken System? Tweak It, TheySay 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
GOING back two centuries, economists have worried about what Adam Smith described as the tendency of chieftains in a market system "to deceive and even to oppress the public." When the grasping got out of hand a century ago, government regulation made a great leap forward in the Progressive Era. There was another leap in response to the excesses of the 1920's. And now regulation is again on the agenda.
 For the first time since the Carter administration began deregulating in the late 1970's, the process has halted, and the winds are pushing in the opposite direction. The spreading damage to people's lives from plunging stock prices and disappearing pension savings has made regulation acceptable again. In a Harris Poll of 1,010 people this month, 82 percent supported "tough new laws" to reduce or prevent corporate fraud. 
 The House and the Senate, in response to the outcry, approved last week the first stab at renewed regulation -- a bill that would punish chief executives with jail for hoodwinking the public and would erect obstacles to future hoodwinking, particularly by accountants. President Bush says he will sign the bill quickly. 
But regulation is likely to stop there, or slow to a trickle. Republicans and Democrats are resisting a second act, arguing in effect that this one piece of legislation may be enough to repair the system, along with a bit more action to improve accounting for stock options and to protect pension savings. Or as Senator Carl Levin, the liberal Democrat from Michigan who wants these extra steps, said in an interview, "I do not think anyone here lusts to regulate."
Similar reluctance showed up in interviews last week with mainstream economists, even those who 25 years ago were leery of too much deregulation. In the growing debate over the government's role in the rocky, post-boom economy, the views of economists are important. They are the experts who would provide the rationale, and the cheerleading, for a new era of regulation, just as they have provided the reasoning and crucial support for deregulation. So far, the broad middle ground in economics is wary of reversing course.
"I want thoughtful regulation and not an inadequately thought-out regulatory response to the problems of the moment," said Janet Yellen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton. Ms. Yellen offered a caution repeated often in the interviews. "It slightly worries me that when people find a problem, they rush to judgment of what to do," she said. "We have to be careful of ill-considered regulation."
If stepped-up regulation is unlikely, so is more deregulation, even the proposal to let individuals invest some of their Social Security contributions in the markets. The deregulation wave appears to be suspended, and that in itself may be a historic turning point. The deception uncovered in recent scandals has elevated deregulation into a national crisis, by punching many holes in a process that had seemed to function as long as it was confined to particular industries and the players were more or less honest.
POLITICIANS and many economists now appear to hope that by monitoring the accountants and punishing errant executives, as the new Congressional legislation is intended to do, deregulation will become acceptable again. But there would be a greater emphasis on fine-tuning and occasional government intervention as problems arise.
For all the mayhem of recent weeks, most mainstream economists say they still hold to the theory that unfettered competition, achieved through deregulation, tends to lower prices and promote efficiency and innovation.
"If you go around asking academic economists, 'Do you think we should reregulate the airlines or trucking or any other deregulated industry?' you would get no votes," said Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton and a Clinton adviser who served briefly in the 1990's as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
There are dissenting voices, however, among some economists slightly to the left of the mainstream. James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas at Austin argues for balance between regulation and deregulation in an economy that relies for prosperity as much on the public sector as the private sector. And Robert Kuttner, co-editor of the American Prospect magazine, contends that mainstream economists are caught in a bind.
"You have a whole generation of economists who have devoted their careers to supporting deregulation," he said, "and now they are twisting themselves into intellectual pretzels to deny that they are recanting on deregulation." 
Instead of giving up on deregulation, many economists are proposing ways to fix it; that is, to tweak it so it works better. At times they are also calling for a regulation or two that would be narrowly focused on a particular problem that, in their view, is distorting markets that in other respects are efficient and competitive. 
The nation's academic economists are nearly all members of the American Economic Association, which has added only one session on regulation to the already-prepared agenda for its annual meeting in January. That session, titled "Lessons from Enron," will include a paper by James Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that will examine the dangers when employees are required to invest a large portion of their 401(k) accounts in their employer's stock, a practice that wiped out the retirement savings of many Enron workers when that company's stock collapsed.
To address this problem, Mr. Poterba favors portfolio diversification. But what if the price of diversification is an unwillingness by the company to contribute very much at all to a 401(k)? Companies often consider stock contributions much more affordable than cash subsidies. Should regulation go a big step beyond diversification and require a minimum pension subsidy, in cash, from the company?
There Mr. Poterba is not willing to go. "If contributing to pensions gets too expensive," he said, "companies will just not do it."
A SIMILAR preference for sticking with the current degree of deregulation, with repairs, pervades the thinking of the nation's economists.
Consider the airline industry. Deregulation started with the airlines in the Carter administration, which lifted federal restrictions on routes and on fare changes. The goals were to lower fares through competition, and to admit more new airlines to the industry.
Fares did come down, although often not by much, and certainly not for most business travel. As an alternative to lower fares, airlines lured travelers with frequent-flier miles. Some economists consider frequent-flier miles a deregulation flaw and would fix it by getting rid of these lures. Frequent-flier miles would presumably lose their appeal if the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the awards were income, subject to tax.
Or consider telecommunications, which Congress deregulated in 1996. Havoc followed. With the stock market bubble offering encouragement, telecommunications companies overexpanded, built up huge debts and engaged in ruinous price-cutting in a futile attempt to make use of idle networks. As the shake-out proceeds through mergers and bankruptcy, the odds grow that a few surviving companies will acquire enough pricing power to raise rates for the telephone, Internet and television cable services that so many Americans feel they must have.
That would give the survivors the sort of monopoly power that AT&T enjoyed until the courts broke up the company in the early 1980's. In the absence of competition, government had set rates and operating standards, a regulatory practice that many economists said stifled entrepreneurship and innovation.
But now that the telecommunications industry is shrinking to fewer companies, the new danger is too much pricing power. As a result, price regulations still in effect for local service may have to remain, said Eli M. Noam, a Columbia University economics professor.
"There was the expectation," he said, "that these tariffs would phase out through competition, but now that no competition is expected, the regulated rates are not likely to go away."
OR consider electricity. Deregulation got into a lot of trouble in California in the summer of 2000. The electric utilities had sold off generators and power stations and were buying electricity for customers on the open market, presumably at competitive prices. But in 2000 the suppliers spiked prices, partly because of power shortages but also through manipulation. That led to some fixes even before corporate scandals and plunging stock prices awakened much broader public interest in repairing deregulation.
California began to buy electricity under long-term, fixed-price contracts on behalf of the utilities, thus averting price spikes. And the federal government imposed price caps. Now Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, offers another solution for fixing a basic problem in electricity deregulation: inelastic demand, which means that households do not turn off lights and appliances or even cut back in the midst of a price spike. 
Big commercial users, however, can quickly ration use, Mr. Borenstein contends. He would install computerized meters in their operations that keep the owners informed of the fluctuating cost of electric power through the day as their utilities buy it. When the price became too high, the commercial establishments would cut back or shut down for a while. Demand would realign with supply and prices would soften for everyone -- in theory, at least.
But for all his enthusiasm for this proposed fix, Mr. Borenstein does not recommend the installation of the meters elsewhere in the country until Californians try them first, to make sure they work. 
Electricity deregulation has been proceeding state by state, and as Mr. Borenstein observed, "what happened in California has given everyone else pause."
"The states that have not deregulated are not going to start now," he said. "The ones that are moving toward it are putting it on hold. And the ones that have deregulated are grappling to fix deregulation."
From the 1970's until Enron, deregulation had mainly focused on specific industries: airlines, banking, trucking, electric power, financial services. The savings and loan crisis in the late 1980's produced some backtracking to deal with the shady and destructive lending that deregulation had allowed. Then with Enron came the quantum leap. Deregulation, it turned out, had fostered widespread greed. 
A similar surge of bad behavior had brought on the Progressive Era with Theodore Roosevelt and, in the 1930's, the New Deal -- periods in which America "cleaned up its act" through regulation, as Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard, put it. 
Regulation flourished in those eras in step with the public's suffering. Now the damage is limited; in the Harris Poll, only 25 percent said they had been hurt by the fraud and accounting problems.
Regulation, as a result, is making itself felt only in accounting reform and new jail penalties for executives, Mr. Kuttner of American Prospect argues. Still largely untouched are the next rungs: stock options and the conflicts inherent when a company is allowed to operate a commercial bank, a brokerage house and an investment bank. The Glass-Steagall Act separated those functions in the 1930's, but Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999.
Whatever the differences, a common thread runs through the corruption fostered by the robber barons in the late 19th century, the stock kiting and fraud of the 1920's and the scandals today. In economics, that common thread is called asymmetric or imperfect information, which means in effect that one party in a transaction knows more than the other party and can take advantage of the second party. 
Corporate executives, for example, know more about their companies' circumstances than shareholders, lenders and even employees, and can use that knowledge to swindle the others and loot their companies, by selling stock perhaps, knowing that it will plunge in value when misdeeds surface. 
TWO modern-day economists, George A. Akerlof at the University of California at Berkeley and Joseph E. Stiglitz at Columbia, incorporated asymmetric information into economic theory and won a Nobel last year for their efforts. Now Mr. Akerlof sees much greater enforcement as a necessary response to the misbehavior that has flourished in recent years.
But like most mainstream economists, he shies away from more regulation. Instead, he would greatly increase enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies to discourage insiders from taking advantage of their privileged information.
"It is not regulation versus deregulation that is the issue; we should have both," he said. "But if you have rules that allow a lot more freedom, then you need much more vigilance and enforcement, and we have starved budgets for enforcement."

HEADLINE: Banks Are Havens (And Other Myths) 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
SINCE the bear market began in March 2000, investors have been told that even if the economy suffered, the risks of investing in bank stocks were far lower than they had been in the recession of 1990. New and sophisticated risk management practices had enabled the banks to unload much of their lending risks to other market players, the argument went, while the institutions' ability to generate fees continued apace.
 But a risk that the banks cannot expunge is the fear taking hold among investors that the nation's largest financial institutions were central to the financing of the stock market bubble that has burst so spectacularly. That perception is not only punishing bank stocks, which were not long ago seen as a haven for investors, but it is also casting a pall over the entire market, fund managers say. If banks are found to have facilitated corporate misdeeds -- such as hiding losses at Enron, as has been alleged in Congress -- severe damage will be done to already battered investor confidence in the entire financial system. 
 "The banks have been both the least visible and the most important components of the financing of the new economy over the last 10 years," said Jonathan H. Cohen, portfolio manager at JHC Capital in Greenwich, Conn., and former head of Internet research at Merrill Lynch. "Investors know that most Internet and telecom companies were part of a bubble, and that many brokerage houses were involved in the sustaining of the bubble. Now people are getting around to focus on the role of the commercial banks."
Bank stocks, as measured by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW Banks index, have lost 10.4 percent in the last two weeks alone. The index consists of 24 major banks and large regional institutions. Leading the way down have been Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, which both fell 15 percent last week. 
Traditionally among the most respected financial institutions, Citigroup and J. P. Morgan were tarnished last week when their executives came under heavy questioning by Congress on their banks' role in the Enron fiasco. Both banks denied that they facilitated the hiding of debt at Enron, but several days after the testimony, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would scrutinize the banks' Enron-related activities.
Until May, the bank stocks were a port in the stock market's storm, a group to which investors retreated as many other sectors collapsed. Holding up these shares was the belief that the recession's short duration meant not only that big banks would soon find increasing demand from corporate clients but also that heavily indebted consumers would not default on their loans as they might have if the recession were prolonged. 
"Until recently, the feeling among investors was that banks have regulators and that will keep them out of trouble," said David A. Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights, a research firm in New York. "But no one was thinking that the banks enabled the rest of the world's business problems, and that will eventually get reflected in the operating performance of the financial companies."
AS bank stocks outperformed the rest of the market, their weighting in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index grew. That means that their recent downturn has hurt investors in the big, popular mutual funds that mirror the performance of the S.& P.
At the market's peak, for example, technology was the single biggest component of the S.& P. But as technology shares plummeted, financial services companies stepped into the top spot. At the end of June, financial companies accounted for 20 percent of the S.& P. The next-largest sector is information technology, at 14 percent.
Banks stocks have always been vulnerable in an economic downturn because they end up holding loans that sour with the economy. That will again be the case if the economy weakens, in spite of claims of advanced risk management techniques. But their role as potential facilitators of improper activities at companies like Enron or WorldCom or even as intermediaries that helped inflate the bubble is an additional worry for investors.
Some of the nation's biggest and most trusted banks are in this fix at least partly because of their increased reach in all areas of financial services in recent years. The Financial Modernization Act in 1999 eliminated most of the barriers to certain business set up for banks under Glass-Steagall, the legislation that came out of the Great Depression. This allowed commercial banks to compete with investment banks for the right to sell securities to investors. And the larger banks approached the business aggressively. 
For example, in May 2001, WorldCom raised almost $12 billion in a bond offering managed by Citigroup. The offering came when WorldCom's was still a high-grade name in the credit markets, and was presented to investors as an issue against which other investment-grade bonds would be judged, known as a benchmark. 
Because the WorldCom deal was a benchmark bond, any portfolio manager running a bond mutual fund had to own the security. So when WorldCom began its free fall earlier this year, a throng of bondholders were holding the bag. The bond sale allowed WorldCom to clear out a lot of its bank lines of credit and push back the maturity dates on the loans. 
Now, with WorldCom filing bankruptcy a little more than a year after the bonds were sold, investors are questioning how much due diligence was conducted by the banks that sold the securities.
Adding to bondholders' doubts about whether this bond deal should have been done is the growing awareness of just how close Jack B. Grubman, the telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, a Citigroup unit, was to WorldCom. Mr. Grubman has said that he attended board meetings at WorldCom. His relentlessly upbeat pronouncements on the company helped the $12 billion bond deal get done. 
There are considerable risks associated with the growth of financial services conglomerates. One is that top management and the board of directors cannot possibly know what lower- and middle-level employees are doing inside the bank. "Senior management and the board of directors must have very comprehensive orientation, knowledge and understanding of what's going on, and in many instances that is not the case," said Henry Kaufman, the economist and head of Henry Kaufman & Company in New York. 
And the nation's financial system, he said, is put at risk when these companies become huge conglomerates. "These conglomerates tend to move toward monopolistic practices," Mr. Kaufman said.
The banks' pitch, he said, is essentially this: "We want to be your banker, which means we want to make you the loan, syndicate the loan, underwrite your bonds and distribute them, we want to do your stock issues, we want to place your commercial paper and we want to manage some of the assets in your pension funds."
He added, "This not only diminishes competition, but it creates institutions that are too big to fail, because if they would fail then the response is they pose a systemic risk."
Some analysts say that in the interests of grabbing more of the lucrative securities underwriting deals that had been the province of the investment banks, commercial banks may have been eager to advise companies on how to get around tax rules and accounting regulations or leverage their balance sheets excessively. While such strategies may have been acceptable even as recently as last year, they are now drawing the attention of Congress and regulators and the ire of investors. 
The work that J. P. Morgan Chase did for Enron, and which is now being examined by regulators, was plain-vanilla stuff, according to its executives. "They are a normal financing arrangement," William B. Harrison Jr., the bank's chief executive, said during a conference call last week. After Enron's failure, normal financing arrangements like these have become questionable.
It is perhaps predictable that just as commercial banks raced to generate fees from underwriting debt securities, more of the companies issuing them are falling on hard times. According to a study to be released on Monday by Moody's Investors Service, a total of 89 corporate bond issuers defaulted in the first half of 2002 with bonds totaling $64 billion. Twenty-one issuers defaulted on issues greater than $1 billion each. None of these numbers include WorldCom's bankruptcy filing, which occurred in the third quarter.
"A stubbornly high pace of defaults, assisted by the spectacular number and size of failures in the telecommunications sector globally and by other issuers based outside the United States, made the second quarter 2002 one of the most severe periods of credit stress since the Depression of the 1930's," said David T. Hamilton, who wrote the study. 
MOODY'S said it expects the junk-bond default rate to hit 8.8 percent by year-end, down from the 10.7 percent peak reached in January, but still high. If the economy slips back into recession, banks could really be hurt.
"There are still big issues out there," Mr. Hendler at CreditSights said. "The C.E.O. sign-off date comes in a couple of weeks and there could be more of a shake-out from that," he said, referring to the new rule by the S.E.C. that chief executives must personally certify their company's financial statements. 
"Banks still have venture capital issues, where valuations could go down," Mr. Hendler said. "And on the consumer side, some banks gave a good outlook for second half, but there's not enough evidence that the consumer is fine. All this weighs heavily on the banks."

HEADLINE: When Color Should Count 

BYLINE:  By Glenn C. Loury; Glenn C. Loury, professor of economics and director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at Boston University, is the author of "The Anatomy of Racial Inequality."

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Ward Connerly is the black businessman who spearheaded the successful campaign for Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot initiative that effectively ended public affirmative action in the state of California. He is back in the news again, this time promoting what he calls the Racial Privacy Initiative. Asking citizens to check a "race" box on a school or government form forces Americans to pay attention to immutable and meaningless characteristics like skin color and ancestry, Mr. Connerly argues. His basic premise is that people otherwise disinclined to do so ought not be compelled by government to put themselves into a racial category.
 This argument, which at first blush looks like the logical extension of the campaign against racial preferences, will appeal to many voters. The initiative, submitted with 980,000 signatures, has already qualified to be on the March 2004 statewide ballot. 
 Yet, despite its superficial appeal, race-blindness is an ideal at war with itself: Strict adherence to this principle would impede its own enforcement and inhibit addressing the harmful effects of its own past violation. Fair employment laws are most effectively policed when courts and government agents can compare the racial composition of a company's work force with the racial demography of qualified prospective workers in that company's local labor market. But doing so requires the collection of data that classify individuals by race. And as the Supreme Court has acknowledged, rectifying the effects of past discrimination can sometimes be a government interest compelling enough to justify the use of racial preferences.
The trouble is that race-blindness is a narrow, technical aspiration and not a genuinely moral end. In matters of race, the most fundamental moral question is not about blindness at all. It is about what I call "neutrality." Race-blindness means having no information about a person's race, while race-neutrality means having no interest in the racial aspect of a social disparity. Blindness asks about what a public decision-maker can know; neutrality deals with the goals that a decision-maker can rightly pursue. Mr. Connerly and his opponents are arguing over whether we should be race-blind. But a question of far greater consequence is whether we should be race-neutral. Although a majority of voters may find race-blindness to be an attractive ideal, I believe many fewer are prepared to endorse race-neutrality because, in light of our history, race-neutrality is not a very attractive moral stance.
The single-minded adherent of race-neutrality would see no problem in the fact that black Americans are vastly overrepresented among those going to prison and among those infected with the AIDS virus. If one begins seeing the race of an inmate or AIDS victim as a matter of no moral relevance, one might conclude that we should pay no heed to the racial dimension of such problems. But racial inequality in the United States is a problem that profoundly affects the entire society regardless of whether it is due to current racial discrimination. I believe a great many Americans, even those who firmly oppose racial preferences, would agree with me about this. They want race-blind law enforcement, but they also worry that some 13.4 percent of black males age 25 to 29 were in prison or jail in 2001, compared with 1.8 percent of whites in the same age group. They endorse the race-blind provision of health services, but are disturbed to learn that blacks, about one-ninth of the population, were over one-third of Americans living with AIDS in 1999. They may want to use non-discriminatory college admissions rules, but are not indifferent to the racial composition of the entering class.
The distinction between blindness and neutrality becomes clear when one considers that often a choice must be made between alternative race-blind policies, some of which ameliorate and others that exacerbate the social disadvantage of blacks. While a race-blind public policy explicitly intended to harm blacks would never be acceptable, race-blind policies adopted for the purpose of reducing racial inequality are commonplace and well accepted. 
For example, to have city council members run for office from a number of nonracially drawn neighborhood districts, instead of electing them at-large, is to choose a race-blind electoral system. Yet this system could well enhance racial minority representation in city hall by allowing minority neighborhood residents to vote for someone from their district. Similarly, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit forbade the practice of affirmative action at the University of Texas, the Texas Legislature responded by guaranteeing a place at any public university to the top 10 percent of every high school class in the state. This 10 percent rule mainly benefits students at less competitive high schools -- in large part, black and Hispanic students, and certainly this was the intent. Both of these policies respect race-blindness while intentionally using a proxy for race to promote the higher goal of racial equality. And neither policy has been legally or politically controversial. 
These examples show why the key moral questions are most often about neutrality, not blindness: on the whole, most Americans still see reversing the effects of a history of immoral race relations as a good thing and perpetuating those effects as a bad thing. Once it is acknowledged that racial disparities are rightly a matter of public concern, we can see that the most transparent, effective and efficient means of dealing with these disparities will often entail making use of racial information. We should be willing to allow for modest violations of race blindness that yield significant reductions in racial inequality as a morally acceptable tradeoff.
Unfortunately, the failure to make a distinction between blindness and neutrality has led to doubts about the validity of discussing social justice issues in racial terms at all. Whatever the racial privacy crusaders may intend, and however desirable in the abstract their colorblind ideal may be, their campaign runs the risk of devaluing our collective and still unfinished efforts to achieve greater equality. Fervency for race-blindness has left some observers simply blind to a basic fact of American public life: We have pressing moral dilemmas in our society that can be fully addressed only when viewed against the backdrop of our racial history.

Salesmanship Got Us In. Can It Get Us Out?

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
OF course in retrospect, it all seems quite clear now. A lot of New Economy snake oil was sold on Wall Street and in boardrooms in the 90's and Americans, as they have always done, took large helpings, and then seconds. Good old American salesmanship -- the kind that brought you George F. Babbitt, Weight Loss Without Dieting! and Gov. Jesse Ventura -- was in rare form when it came to selling success-proof businesses.
 But if Americans love a good pitchman, they also pride themselves on common sense. So now that the New Economy has taken on the distinct taint of, say, the junk bond, the American investing public shows signs of going in the other direction -- turning its back on the reasoned sales pitch of even the most fundamentally sound firms. 
 So from this point on, it will be up to not just the pitchman on Wall Street to restore faith in the country's economic future, but to that equally revered expert in the art of salesmanship, the American politician -- who in his role as sculptor of the public mood has already been called on to sell the public a new confidence. 
So far, the experts say, it promises to be a tough sell.
It turns out that the end-of-the-century sales pitch was not so different from those of the swindlers among the river-town rubes in "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." Salesmanship, both by honest brokers and scoundrels, has a special place in American culture, if only because the country was formed without the uniform political, religious and class systems that confined other nations. Choice and the opportunity for self improvement have always created a marketplace.
"All of our political institutions and cultural institutions have been unusually geared toward commercial activity," said Bruce J. Schulman, a professor of history and American studies at Boston University. "And you can see that part of the success of hucksters comes from this idea, whether it is patent medicine or a new religion, that you are selling the possibility of transformation."
And there is a fundamental experience in this encounter, now all too familiar to those who tried to transform their futures with all those dot-com stocks. "Everyone has had the experience, certainly in the commercial world if not in the religious and political realms," says Professor Schulman, "that they are so impressed with the exalted language of the seller that they give up and try it, even if they know better." 
It was simply just not a great idea to acquire, invest in or do business with companies that had no earnings, no known potential to ever produce them, or products that the world could have lived without.
So how could they have been bought? 
Well, Pets.com had those cool commercials that featured sock puppets. And if people in their 20's who sold designer clothes online could convince seasoned 40-somethings on Wall Street that burning through investors' money on inner-office back rubs was all part of a business model, who was the American investor to question it?
Embracing hucksters is not just an integral part of the American political economy; it has played a role in selling ideas, wars and our national identity to the world at large. "This is not a new development, but rather the end point of a long historical development," said Robert Jackall, professor of sociology at Williams College. He cited the marketing of World War I to its detractors, the similar role taken up in the Second World War by the Advertising Council, and then the selling of the American dream to the rest of the world during the cold war, and after that the myriad commercial chimeras that arose during the boom period in the 1990's.
Among the last on that list was Webvan, the online grocer that sold investors on donating $1.2 billion before it collapsed last year. Shoppers found that using the company required them to plan too much in advance -- grocery shopping made harder, every soccer mom's fantasy. On a larger scale were the equally realistic dreams of synergy on which Robert W. Pittman sold Time Warner in merging with AOL.
Part of what made such will-of-the-wisps sell was the idea that any new idea might work, if only it was new enough and pitched well enough. Now that investors have seen through that notion, they seem wary not only of new ideas, but of any pitch at all. So even the best of companies are feeling the unparalleled sting of the jaded American.
Which raises the question: How do Americans get themselves out of this? Traditionally, they have turned to politicians, as they are doing now in the form of demands for new rules and regulations, and for calming words from the optimist-in-chief in the White House. Congress last week gave hope to fans of stricter oversight, but the jury is still out on the public mood. 
The presidential historian and biographer Robert Dallek sees a connection between what people will believe and the sensibilities of the politician trying to sell a notion. While Franklin D. Roosevelt's instincts led him right to what Americans wanted to hear during times of troubles, he said, Herbert C. Hoover's and Jimmy Carter's could not. 
"It is like Lincoln said: you can't fool all of the people all of the time," Professor Dallek said. "There has to be good sense to all this advertising. Hoover during the Great Depression was a disaster. He kept saying prosperity is right around the corner, and he kept trying to find a song or joke to reverse the mood. And that is relevant to President Bush's response to the economic downturn. It does not work for Bush either. It depends on how sensitive you are to the public mood."
In today's terms, how Americans react to a public figure's sales pitch can depend on who is doing the pitching, and the relationship between their need to believe and their mutual fund statements. If Alan Greenspan says exuberance can be irrational, as he did in 1996, investors pause before continuing to drive the market up. If he declares greed to be infectious as mega-companies go bankrupt, as he did this month, the investors screech to a halt -- at least long enough to let the market really dive. In other words, they listen, even if they don't buy everything he's saying.
If President Bush, on the other hand, says the economy is in good shape even as 401(k)'s shrivel, well, maybe Americans note that his own business career was not quite as successful as his political one.
But when New York's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, who made a fortune in the private sector, proclaims, "this is one of the unique buying opportunities that people have," is it pure coincidence that the Dow shoots up 570 points? (Actually, it almost certainly is. By then, Congress was awake and moving.)
Salesmanship isn't just a matter of the salesman, of course. It depends on the product and on the potential buyer. That same president who cannot move markets north can sell a war on terrorism. Obviously, that is partly because nearly 3,000 people were killed less than a year ago. 
ONE lesson from this is that if optimism doesn't always sell, fear is more dependable. Professor Dallek points to the fears Lyndon B. Johnson raised about Barry M. Goldwater's supposed nuclear recklessness in the 1964 campaign, and the fears President Bush's father raised about Michael S. Dukakis's supposed lack of toughness toward rapists and murderers in 1988.
In the stock market, "Fear is a big variable," said Richard E. Petty, the chairman of psychology at Ohio State University, "If you are a little anxious, that causes people to be very intense information seekers. Anxiety motivates them to find out what the right answer is. But if it gets too high, information gathering shuts down, and people tend to rely on experts as opposed to carefully analyzing it." In other words, even a tough sell can replace logic if it placates deep-seated fears. And in the end, a lot depends on what consumers want to believe.
This may partly explain why some Americans have become so discouraged about stocks that after buying high, they're now selling low, while experienced traders with better nerves tell them to do just the opposite.
And why investors have taken down innocent companies in the name of the many plagued by scandals. "There are a very very small percentage of companies where their accounting is in question," Mayor Bloomberg admonished New Yorkers last week. "Yet most companies are being tarnished by that and having their stock prices decimated. It's not a depression! Most of these companies really have substance. They have great products and great services that will be in demand for a long time."
True as that may be, will it sell? It is altogether possible. There is always something new, or old-new to sell. This is, after all, the country where millions of women became convinced in the last two years that low-rise jeans are actually a good thing.

U.S. and Central America: Too Close for Comfort?

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago, a word from a Central American military officer like Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova or Jose Guillermo Garcia could consign a prisoner to torture or a village to destruction. During the 1990's, many of these officers retired to lives as placid as their military careers had been bloody. Dozens moved to Florida to spend their sunset years at quiet retirement communities.
 Last week, a jury in West Palm Beach shattered their repose. It ordered General Vides Casanova and General Garcia, both former Salvadoran defense ministers who worked intimately with American advisers, to pay $54.6 million to three victims of the repressive campaign they helped direct during the 1980's. This verdict may become a precedent in efforts to prosecute other retired officers now living in Florida. 
 It also marks the latest chapter in one of the Western Hemisphere's longest-running dramas. From the time the Monroe Doctrine was introduced through the period of Cuban-influenced guerrilla insurrections, American leaders have worried about threats to United States security that could arise from Central America. For more than 150 years, the United States has kept a close eye on the isthmus and defended or toppled governments there when it saw fit. Nowhere else, in fact, has the United States imposed its will so bluntly for so long. The Salvadoran war of the 1980's was just one in a series of interventions whose effects continue to shape life in the region.
A familiar pattern has developed for these intervention in Central America. Every generation or two, the established order in one Central American country or another is threatened by some form of nationalism, and with United States support the threat is suppressed. Then Washington turns to other matters, and while it does, the next revolution slowly gestates.
The United States has behaved similarly in other parts of the world, most notably the region around Afghanistan. There American agencies spent billions of dollars to fight Soviet occupiers in the 1980's, but withdrew after victory and allowed Islamic fundamentalism to rise almost unchallenged. Far away in Central Asia, though, United States intervention is still something new. In nearby Central America it has long been acknowledged as the dominant factor in regional life.
"The only significant external influence in Central America continues to be the United States, whether you're speaking economically or in political-military-security terms," said John H. Coatsworth, who teaches Latin American history at Harvard. "Even when no official of the U.S. government above the level of a deputy assistant secretary is paying any attention, presidents and cabinet ministers in Central America are watching us closely for signs of what we intend to do. They live every day with the effects of the incredible destruction we helped promote during the 1980's."
The conviction of General Vides Casanova and General Garcia served as an increasingly rare reminder of the horrors that enveloped Central America during the 1980's. They and a handful of other officers supervised a devastating counterinsurgency war based in part on plans devised at the Pentagon. Their campaign succeeded in Washington's goal of stopping the advance of leftist guerrillas, but at a high cost in civilian life. 
United States intervention in Central America goes back to the mid-19th century, when one Nicaraguan faction invited the Tennessee adventurer William Walker to help it defeat another. He accepted the invitation, but after victory he declared himself president.
Since then, the pattern of periodic intervention in Central America, whether by individuals, corporations or government, has been one of the few constants of American foreign policy. In between these interventions, while the United States is engaged elsewhere, whole generations of Central Americans seek to bind their wounds. Episodes that flash quickly across the American consciousness reverberate profoundly through these poor and undeveloped nations.
A FORMER president of the Nicaraguan Congress, Luis Humberto Guzman, said that when Central Americans look at the United States, most feel "admiration for its prosperity, gratitude for its job opportunities and respect for a judicial system that does something like convict Salvadoran generals; but, at the same time, hatred for its arrogance and its support for dictatorial regimes." If he wrote a book about the relationship, he said, he might call it "A Bridge Too Near."
"South Americans like Bolivar tried to build relations of mutual benefit and respect with the United States, but in Central America we have only invited American intervention," Mr. Guzman said. "We invited Walker, and since then we have repeatedly asked for intervention to overthrow governments we don't like. This has been our great error. As for the United States, its great error has been not stopping before its interventions to assess whether the intervention is truly necessary, how intense it will become and what will be its long-term consequences."
Perhaps the most far-reaching United States intervention in Central America was the C.I.A.'s 1954 coup against President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman in 1954. That coup ended Guatemala's 10-year experiment with democracy, which the Eisenhower administration feared would give Marxism a beachhead in the Western Hemisphere. Though a short-term success from the American point of view, it set off a decades-long paroxysm of war and terror that took hundreds of thousands of lives and shattered an entire nation.
Guatemala's war has been over for several years. But the country is far from healed. Countless families are still grappling with their losses. Half a century during which calls for land redistribution and civil rights were met with fierce repression have left some of the world's most gaping social inequalities. Violent crime is surging, partly because so many young people learned violence from the example of their brutal leaders.
In Nicaragua, society was also profoundly shaped by the 40 years the United States maintained the Somoza family in power. That policy led to the 1979 Sandinista revolution and a subsequent counterrevolution sponsored by the United States. The Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega, whose admiration for Fidel Castro made him anathema in Washington, often delivered a monologue about how American intervention had disfigured his country. He would end: "This leaves scars."
Last week's verdict in Florida suddenly revealed one of those scars. For people in the United States, it was a reminder of how heavily the legacy of past interventions still hangs over Central America. Many Salvadorans cheered it as a vindication. Few could have missed the irony of seeing these retired generals condemned in the same country that once embraced them.

The RichHave More, and More to Lose

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Nervous investors certainly have reason to worry, with accounting scandals and weak earnings forecasts contributing to one of the worst bear markets in a generation. 
But for most Americans, stocks still represent only a small portion of overall assets.
 Middle-class Americans keep the majority of assets, almost 60 percent, in their homes, according to research by Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economics professor, and the housing market has been strong. 
 On the other hand, the very rich -- the top 1 percent in terms of net worth -- have almost one-third of assets in stocks and mutual funds, and therefore have a larger share of their wealth tied to the market. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

HEADLINE: When Executive Pay Depends on Revenue 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "An Idea Gone Haywire: Linking Executive Pay to Sales" (Market Watch, July 14), in which Gretchen Morgenson described the potential problems of pay packages tied to company revenue: 
 The current debate on executive behavior seems to miss two facts: First, there is no absolute truth in accounting, just different ways of presenting a complex reality. 
The second is that it is extremely difficult to find "correct" executive compensation schemes that will align the interests of management and shareholders. 
Fraudulent practices aside, it should be clear that no accounting reform will uncover some profound truth on corporate earnings that current practices hide. Reasonable people can differ in presenting accounting information. A simple example is valuing inventories or calculating capital gains. 
Regarding executive pay, it has been clear for a while that paying straight salary does not properly align the interests of shareholders and management. Attempts to address that problem have ranged from performance bonuses to experiments with stock and stock options. 
One recent idea has been to link pay to accounting profits, and we are now painfully aware of how fickle and subject to manipulation such numbers may be.
Some companies have tried to tie some executive pay to sales, which presumably are harder to manipulate. Of course, this is not perfect either, as the column pointed out. However, one can view such attempts as a sincere struggle to find an optimal management contract rather than as a cynical attempt to exploit shareholders.

HEADLINE: A Summary of the Major Actions of the Legislature's 225th Session 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
The 225th annual session of the New York State Legislature dragged quietly to a tentative close on July 2, after six months of partisan posturing and wrangling and very little real action.
 Time and again, Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republicans who control the Senate and the Democratic leaders of the Assembly appeared to make progress toward major deals, only to see them fall apart in waves of recrimination. It was, by all accounts, one of the most gridlocked years in memory, a sharp departure from the axiom that Albany finds a way to do business in even-numbered years, when officials must stand for re-election. 
 Even the end of the session was not agreed on, having become, like so many things about state government, something of a fiction. The session was scheduled to end on June 20, but trickled on, as each house found reasons to return a few times -- the last a session of the Senate on July 2 to pass a handful of bills -- and each has signaled that it might come back this year, if deals can be reached on major legislation. 
The biggest agreements of the year included giving Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg far greater control of New York City's schools, a big increase in health care spending despite a looming fiscal crisis, and, after two years of bitter conflict, a package of women's health care measures, including requiring insurers to cover contraceptives.
Chief among the long list of failures was the inability of lawmakers to agree on revamping the state's system of long mandatory sentences for drug crimes, enacted three decades ago under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.
High hopes were also dashed for legislation to reduce rising auto-insurance premiums and insurance fraud, a package of antiterrorism bills championed by the governor, a bill to raise the minimum wage, an overhaul of the state's toxic-waste-cleanup program, a statewide ban on smoking in restaurants and a law to prevent discrimination against gays. A requirement that clergy members report abuse of children to the authorities, agreed on in principle by all sides, appeared to run aground on what seemed like a simple language problem.
The session began with a deal between Mr. Pataki, a Republican who is running for a third term, and Dennis Rivera, a high-ranking Democrat and the leader of the largest health workers' union in the state, for $1.8 billion in new health care spending over the next three years. About half of that money will go toward pay raises for members of Mr. Rivera's union, 1199/S.E.I.U.
Despite questions about the fiscal soundness of the deal, it sailed through the Legislature in January, and the union repaid Mr. Pataki by endorsing him for re-election.
There were 745 bills that passed in both the Assembly and the Senate, most of them addressing narrow local issues like property transfers. Of those, Mr. Pataki has signed 198 into law and vetoed 2, but most have not yet been delivered to his desk.

Budget
LEGISLATION ENACTED
Lawmakers passed an $89.6 billion election-year budget on May 17, relatively early, given the recent history of late budgets and legislative gridlock in Albany.
While other states around the country were cutting spending, New York managed to avoid deep cuts to services and even provided a $420 million increase in education aid, about 3 percent.
The budget includes $3 billion in one-time revenues, however. It also relies heavily on uncertain new federal aid, spends nearly all of the state's reserves, and adds $900 million in debt.
All told, the budget raises spending by about 6 percent, though the portion paid entirely with state taxes and fees will go up only 3 percent. 
The Legislature imposed some new taxes and raised a number of obscure fees on items like hunting licenses to bring in about $85 million more.
The budget also counts on reducing the state work force by at least 5,000, through incentives for early retirement and a hiring freeze. 
The governor and lawmakers also agreed to shift many costs now borne by the state to the federal government through some unorthodox accounting. College scholarships, for instance, will be financed with $380 million from a surplus of federal welfare money, while special funds for the environment and health care were used to provide $400 million to help balance the budget.
New York City's schools got a one-time infusion of about $200 million -- actually money the state had owed the city for years for school construction -- to help Mr. Bloomberg pay for a new contract with city teachers.

HEADLINE: Business Ethics Issue Contrasts Candidates' Styles: Aggressive, Measured and Steadfast 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
Last week, as corporate chieftains were arrested and the stock market churned, Andrew M. Cuomo invited reporters to a Midtown Manhattan hotel ballroom stocked with his supporters and delivered a formal half-hour speech based on a four-page proposal on corporate ethics. It was a kickoff to a four-city tour by Mr. Cuomo with appearances by laid-off employees whose savings have evaporated. 
 His opponent in the race to become the Democratic nominee for governor, H. Carl McCall, responded with an e-mail message touting his record as a "national leader protecting shareholders." 
 And Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republican who is seeking a third term, ate sausage and peppers at country fairs.
The different approaches to the topic, arguably the most compelling of the week, illustrate the very different personal styles and campaign strategies of the top contenders in the governor's race. There is Mr. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary whose try-anything aggressiveness has sometimes been viewed as arrogant; Mr. McCall, the state comptroller whose measured movements have been taken for complacency; and Governor Pataki, an incumbent whose popularity and fund-raising success have allowed him to float above the fray.
While national politicians are busy devising ways to approach the Wall Street scandals as a campaign issue, it is in some ways odd for candidates in local races to weigh in. But New York is home to the stock market and many corporate headquarters, and candidates routinely travel to Ireland or Israel to expound upon issues way beyond their influence and day-to-day concern.
Mr. Cuomo's tour came as Congress agreed to toughen federal law. But he has vociferously argued that it is well within the scope of the governor to ensure the credibility of corporate books, if only because the issue affects jobs in the state. He released a report that concluded that 1,795 jobs in the state were lost as a result of scandals at six companies. If nothing else, the governor could use his bully pulpit to endorse change, said a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Peter Ragone, just as Mr. Pataki has spoken out against the Navy bombing in Vieques, P.R., and a recent court decision barring the Pledge of Allegiance from schools.
On Friday, asked what he had done to rein in corporate misdeeds, Mr. Pataki responded by praising federal prosecutors and Congress. "I think it's important that we have a strong federal law," he said.
On the other hand, Mr. McCall can, unlike his opponents, point to concrete steps he has taken to rein in abuse. He has led several shareholder suits against major companies accused of fraud, and early this month, he announced that money managers and accounting firms that do business with the state pension fund would have to adhere to stricter standards.
A spokesman for Mr. McCall, Steven Greenberg, seemed confident that voters were familiar with that record. "Corporate accountability is part of our economic message, and it's part of who Carl McCall is," Mr. Greenberg said. "His whole life is based on accountability and responsibility -- that's what his mother taught him." 
But Mr. McCall's record did not deter Mr. Cuomo. "Cuomo's nature is to seize the initiative, sometimes to his own disadvantage, and McCall's nature is to measure the situation and produce what he feels is a reasoned response," said Philip Friedman, a Democratic political and corporate consultant who is not involved with any candidate in this race. But, he added, "The odds are that neither strategy would be enough to unseat Pataki."
Mr. Cuomo's offensive is one of a string of attempts to find something he or Mr. McCall could sorely use: an issue that ignites voter enthusiasm or, better yet, pulls the governor off his cloud. 
So far, the candidates have tried to raise alarms about government spending, campaign finance, nursing homes, a possible subway fare increase and prescription drug prices. But voters are paying little attention, political analysts say, possibly because they are preoccupied with national issues like terrorism and economic security. And the salvo that drew the biggest reaction, Mr. Cuomo's attack on the governor for failing to lead after the Sept. 11 attack, backfired.
But Mr. Cuomo might have the advantage when it comes to the Wall Street scandals, said Jefrey Pollock, the president of Global Strategy Group, a Democratic polling firm. "You've got, clearly, a Republican governor who has benefited tremendously from the increase in the stock market and the boom economy, who also wants to play footsie with the folks in the White House. You've got Carl McCall boxed in, because he invested in a lot of these things. Andrew is the one who's probably boxed in the least." 
As state comptroller, Mr. McCall invests the $112 billion state pension fund, which has lost millions on stocks like WorldCom and Global Crossing. But Mr. McCall has said that it has still outperformed similar funds, and some analysts said they doubted the public would fault him for investing in some of the country's biggest companies. 
Norman Adler, a longtime political consultant, said it was not unwise for Mr. McCall to stick to issues that appeal to his core constituency, like education, as he did on Wednesday in front of a Manhattan school, while Mr. Cuomo pushed his corporate reform message upstate. 
But if Mr. Cuomo did not dominate the debate, then at least he nudged it. When Mr. McCall finished a speech on the inequity of state education funding, he was met with an awkward silence. Reporters had no questions about education. 
"You see," Mr. McCall crowed. "We've gotten our message across." 
Then someone asked about corporate accountability.

PERSON: Pete Seibert 

HEADLINE: Pete Seibert, Soldier Skier Who Built Vail, Is Dead at 77 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Pete Seibert, who transformed a sheep pasture in the Colorado Rockies into the Vail ski resort, died July 15 at his home in Edwards, Colo. He was 77.
 The cause was cancer, said Jennifer Brown, a spokeswoman for Vail Resorts. 
 In 2000, Ski magazine placed Mr. Seibert third on its list of history's 100 most influential skiers for building one of the first and largest of the new breed of postwar American ski resorts, with all the amenities of European skiing villages. 
Mr. Seibert's early inspiration came from pictures he saw of an idyllic Austrian ski resort when he was 10, Skiing magazine reported in 1999. He had already been skiing for three years on a pair of his mother's wooden skis.
Mr. Seibert served as a combat soldier on skis in World War II and was wounded so badly that doctors said he might never walk again, let alone ski. Three years later, he placed third in the giant slalom at the United States Nationals.
On March 19, 1957, he saw a skier's promised land when Earl Eaton, a sometime uranium prospector, took him on a seven-hour climb through deep snow to the summit of a mountain whose bulk had not been visible from the valley below.
Mr. Seibert was awed. It was an almost perfect hill, with slopes all around that permitted skiing in all directions, at different degrees of steepness; skiers of almost any level would be able to get down safely. The peak was 3,000 feet above a valley that seemed perfect for a ski village. At an elevation of 8,000 feet above sea level, the valley was just below the timberline, so the trees minimized the problem of high winds.
"My God, Earl, we've climbed all the way to heaven," Mr. Seibert said, according to articles in Denver newspapers over the years.
Mr. Seibert gave Mr. Eaton credit for finding Vail, which Mr. Seibert named for Charles Vail, chief engineer of the Colorado highway department from 1930 to 1945.
But most people give Mr. Seibert credit for the next critical steps. He secretly bought the land, telling anyone who asked that he was building a rod and gun club. He found people willing to invest in the still-unproven postwar ski industry. He organized construction and found a gondola lift in the Alps. 
Scant snow was on the ground when the resort opened in December 1962, so he hired Ute Indians to perform a snow dance. A blizzard materialized.
"Everybody else thought we were crazy, but we thought we could do any damned thing we decided to do," Mr. Seibert said in an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1989.
The result, with bed, board and bars close at hand, established a style that has since become familiar at American ski resorts.
It happened fast. In 1964, Sports Illustrated reported that "never in the history of U.S. skiing has a bare mountain leaped in such a short time into the four-star category of ski resorts."
Peter Werner Seibert was born on Aug. 7, 1924, in Sharon, Mass. He spent much of his youth in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, where he practiced with Austrian instructors who had left Europe as war seemed imminent. By 15, he was winning races.
In 1943, Mr. Seibert, then 18, joined the Army and volunteered for the 10th Mountain Division. In 1945, he saw combat in the Apennine Mountains of northern Italy, where he was hit by small-arms fire and two mortar shells, one of which blew off his right kneecap. He spent 17 months undergoing surgery and convalescing.
With the dream of starting a ski resort, Mr. Seibert headed for Colorado. Other members of the 10th Mountain Division did the same thing, forming the nucleus of the postwar skiing industry.
Though Mr. Seibert had to tape himself from his hip to his ankle and strap on a homemade leg brace, his skiing progressed to the point that he qualified for the 1950 United States Alpine ski team. But he wanted to get into the resort business, and he used the G.I. Bill to study hotel management at a school in Switzerland from 1951 to 1954.
He returned to Colorado to take a job with the Aspen Ski School and in 1955 became manager of the Loveland Ski Area. After three years, he moved back to Aspen as assistant manager of the Aspen Highlands resort. After discovering what would become Vail Mountain in 1957, he devoted himself to his dream. With the help of a small group of partners, he paid $55,000 for 520 acres.
The land was in the White River National Forest, and the Forest Service required him to come up with $1.8 million by December 1961 to cover construction costs. He decided that each investor of $10,000 would get four free lifetime lift passes. For $500 more, investors would get land for a home site.
The lots are now worth millions.
Mr. Seibert never realized a fortune from Vail. In March 1976, a frayed cable caused two gondolas carrying skiers up the mountain to plunge 125 feet to the ground. Four were killed and eight injured. Fearing lawsuits, Mr. Seibert sold his stake in Vail.
He later put together the group that developed Snow Basin, a ski resort in Utah. A cash squeeze resulting from a recession forced him to sell again. After working on several other ski developments, he returned to Vail as a consultant.
Mr. Seibert was president of the American Ski Federation and the National Ski Areas Association, and was inducted into the United States National Ski Hall of Fame. 
He is survived by his sons, Peter Werner Seibert Jr. of Edwards, Brant Albert Seibert of Boulder, Colo., and Calvin Pardee of Manhattan.
As recently as last March, Mr. Seibert was poking around Colorado, looking for another mountain to develop.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Waves Are a Riptide to Some, a Ripple to Others 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS and SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
They winced in affluent Westchester, they shrugged on 125th Street in Harlem, and in suburban New Jersey they headed for the mall, though with a slight buzz of unease and a keen eye for bargains.
 As the stock market whipsawed through a week of numbing losses, followed by a roaring one-day gain after two months of prolonged bleeding, the pain emanating from Wall Street has hit people in the New York City region in varying but distinct ways. 
 In Katonah, N.Y., a hamlet in northern Westchester County, investors bemoaned their losses and continued shifting their money into real estate. The well-to-do, however, kept on spending. On the streets of Harlem, there was mostly cynicism and ambivalence toward the turbulence of a distant world. And in Wayne, N.J., a citadel of middle-class comfort, many people said they had been bruised by the market but were more fearful that the continuing slump would choke the prosperity of recent years. 
Many of the more than three dozen people who were interviewed in three very different communities last week said they were largely removed from the Dow's wild ride and expected few immediate changes in their spending or style of living. But from the streets of upper Manhattan to the boutiques of Katonah, nearly everyone expressed a growing unease, even outright panic, about what lay ahead. Even those without stock portfolios said they worried about what the market's ugly gyrations could mean for their lives.
The pain is not just on paper for those approaching retirement, no matter what their financial status. Many people in their 50's and 60's said they no longer open their 401 (k) statements; others have decided to keep working for a year or two longer than they had expected. "I know things could change, but if they keep going this way, we'll be eating cat food in our golden years," said Jane Perkinson, 61, a production manager at Business Week, as she strolled along Katonah Avenue, a street lined with designer gift shops and real estate companies with pictures in their windows of the million-dollar homes they are selling.
Across the region, there was little optimism that the markets or the economy would improve anytime soon. For many, like Susan Broer, 46, the mad plunges of July became too much to bear. Last week, said Ms. Broer, an administrator at Manhattanville College, she moved her entire savings out of stocks and into bonds. "It might be too little too late," said Ms. Broer, who lives in Somers, near Katonah, "but I just didn't have the guts to sit there and watch anymore." 
While outsiders might imagine the village unruffled by the recent tumult on Wall Street, Katonah is not a solid bloc of extravagant wealth. Plenty of teachers, therapists and artists moved here before the boom of the 1980's, when quaint Katonah, an hour from Midtown, began drawing a more upscale crowd. There are old-timers, too, like Margaret Van Geldern, 43, a stay-at-home mother whose family occupies the Victorian house built by her great-grandfather. By most measures, the family has experienced little financial strain: they never played the stock market, their mortgage is nearly paid off, and Mr. Van Geldern, a construction manager, is still busy building $2 million homes throughout the county. But Ms. Van Geldern, whose teenage daughter is starting to look at colleges, knows how fickle the housing market is, and next year, she plans to go back to work. "My daughter wants to go to a good school," she said. "If people stop buying luxury homes, we're going to be in trouble."
That trouble has already arrived for many. Peter Vadnai, a freelance photographer who moved to Katonah three decades ago, discovered the lure of online stock trading in 1997. Most of his savings vanished with the pop of the dot-com bubble, and these days, Mr. Vadnai, 58, rarely turns on CNBC. "I guess as long as you don't bail out, you have a chance," he said hopefully, sitting at the Katonah Restaurant. "I just don't know if they'll come back in my lifetime."
It's not just the ailing stock market that plagues him. His livelihood, the commercial photography business, is sputtering, and he openly frets about the effect of terrorism on an already fragile economy. "All it takes is one person to blow himself up at a mall in Dubuque," he said, "and everyone will stop shopping at malls." 
Still, neither terrorism nor the dropping Dow seems likely to stop the rich from spending. The Saab dealership on Bedford Road continues to thrive, and Bob Menin, a veteran real estate agent, said home sales remained brisk, though prices have begun leveling off after tripling in the 1990's. He said many clients were planning to invest in multifamily homes or condominiums.
A few doors down at the Katonah General Store, June Goldfinger has had no trouble selling the $3,800 cashmere bathrobes and $5,000 silk dresses she designs. Like many of her customers and friends, she puts her extra cash into property, not stocks. Besides extensive holdings in Katonah, she said, she and her husband own real estate in Santa Fe, N.M., Manhattan and the Caribbean island of Anguilla. "I cater to the rich and the filthy rich," she said, showing off a $600 leather handbag. "They feel badly about what's happening to other people, but they're not feeling the pinch themselves."
The same might be said of Harlem, where declining blue chips are of little concern to many residents. People there are worried about getting a job, getting by and getting a good education for their children. A question about the market, in fact, usually brings a wry laugh. "On this side of 110th Street, we don't think of these things affecting us," said Kimathi Arnold, 32, as he walked home from work with a friend. "Our net worth is based on what we make. We don't have assets in the stock market, and the cynicism we have is learned through experience."
Mr. Arnold has an online trading account, but he said he had never used it. "I don't see the market as being a friendly place," he said, "especially if the money you lose means you don't put food on the table or have a place to live."
His friend, Jamal Goodridge, 28, said he kept his savings in bank certificates of deposit.
Both men work at Global Business Institutes, a private technical school where they counsel students. Many people they see have been struggling since Sept. 11, either because they lost jobs or family members did.
"After 9/11, no one has money to lose." Mr. Goodridge said.
Both men worry about the trickle-down effect from the difficulties on Wall Street. "The stock market is an indicator of how different sectors of the economy are doing, and if there's no confidence in the economy and corporations are going bankrupt at an alarming rate, then it makes a difference," Mr. Arnold said. "Honest hardworking Americans were told those 401 (k)s were going to be a revolution in how your money can grow. To us regular people, the stock market is something we are affected by but have no control over."
At Benjamin Optical, on 125th Street, business has been steady and good for the last few months. A stock market shiver, said a co-owner, Joel Minsky, does not show up right away and maybe not at all. "It hasn't affected the way anybody here behaves," said Dr. Minsky, 53, an optometrist who is carrying on a business his father founded 50 years ago. "It hasn't changed my thinking or planning for the future, either. I'm expecting it to turn around." He said he stayed away from stocks, and when it comes time to retire, he and his wife will draw on an I.R.A. and his wife's pension. "I'm 53 and I figure I'll work another 20 years," he said. "My father is still working and he's 84."
Across the Hudson River, in a middle-class swath of northeast New Jersey where many people try to live within their means, the last decade seemed to lift everyone's boat more or less equally. Jobs were plentiful and even blue-collar workers learned to embrace the market.
A soaring Nasdaq helped Allan Thiel buy a Harley-Davidson, but last Thursday, he and his wife, Rosemary, were prowling the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne trying to avoid pricier enticements like Abercrombie & Fitch and Banana Republic. 
Mr. Thiel said he had been an avid stock trader but now curses high-tech names like Lucent and Cisco, which make up the bulk of his portfolio. "I've been so depressed about the market," said Mr. Thiel, 54, who installs heating systems. "I don't watch TV anymore. I'm sick of those red arrows pointing down." 
Ms. Thiel lost her job recently with Omnipoint, but Mr. Thiel's business remains strong. Still, for now, the couple said they would stick to shopping at Sears and avoid using their credit cards. "We'll probably be fine if we're careful," Ms. Thiel said. "But what about our children's future? That's what I worry about."
Joan Danner, too, once enjoyed the fruits of a thriving stock market, which helped pay for her daughter's wedding and a big-screen TV. With the market gone bad, Ms. Danner, a receptionist, has given up the extras. She is increasingly anxious that the shrinking pot in her I.R.A. account will stall her retirement. "At this rate, we'll have nothing in a few months," said Ms. Danner, 54, as she scanned the aisles at Sears for summer clearance sales. 
Her husband recently lost his job as an insurance underwriter but found another one, although at a lower salary. Her own job, she added, is far from ironclad. Beyond an early retirement, other dreams, like a renovated bathroom in their home in Fairfield, will have to be deferred. "It's been harvest gold since the 70's," she said with a laugh. "But that will have to wait. For now, we're going to live day to day."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Minor Leagues Hit the Mark

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON 

DATELINE: BROCKTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
It is Saturday night in this hardscrabble city of idle shoemaking factories, and the place is jumping.
 Just past empty storefronts in Brockton's downtown 15 miles south of Boston, a crowd of nearly 5,000 has packed a new $17 million minor league baseball stadium to watch the Rocks, the home team named after the former heavyweight champion and Brockton native Rocky Marciano. 
 The upper grandstand, where seats cost $4, is jammed with families giggling at festivities that include a fan race against a large rock deposited in the basepaths (the rock has not won this season), a water balloon-tossing contest and a shirtless boxer who jukes and jabs his way through the stands, pausing only to deliver bouquets of flowers to women. Fans clutch commemorative Marciano bobblehead dolls, a promotional handout, and children's groups abound. Just the night before, local Girl Scout troops had camped in the outfield after the game. 
There was also a minor league baseball game going on, but like the drive-in, the mall or the bowling alley before it, the stadium and its game were only the pretext for a community gathering. On the field, the Rocks, also known as the Rox, were losing. In the stands, the score was registered in smiles. And the home team was winning in a rout.
This summer, it is likely that more people than ever before -- perhaps as many as 40 million -- will flock to small ballparks to watch minor league baseball games in North America. That's more than half the number that will attend major league games this season.
Affordable, family-friendly and a spiritual touchstone to small-town America, minor league baseball is enjoying an unprecedented boom. Not only has attendance approached record highs established in pretelevision days, but an astonishing number of new ballparks -- frequently publicly financed -- have also sprouted in every region of the country. Since 1995, 78 minor league parks have been completed in the United States, and 2 in Canada.
As Major League Baseball grapples with economic problems, a deteriorating image and a possible players' strike, minor league baseball is a phenomenon of fun where a family of four can attend a game for less than $40, food, drinks and parking included, and the children will probably come away with a player's autograph, too.
"People never gave up on a night at the ballpark; they were just starving to feel the connection," said Dave Echols, general manager of the Brockton franchise. "We give them a game they can almost touch, and a good time, too."
Expansion and unparalleled growth have come with consequential change. Minor league baseball has become big business, with franchises selling for as much as $25 million. The mom-and-pop operators once typical in the minor leagues, whose job it was to rake the pitcher's mound and flip the burgers in the concession stand, have increasingly given way to corporate ownership groups with sophisticated financing schemes and multimillion-dollar budgets.
Debt among minor league owners has doubled in the last five years, according to industry officials, and has led to questions about the long-term financial health of some franchises even as more cities continue to pursue minor league fields of dreams. It is estimated that as many as a third of the roughly 200 minor league teams are not profitable. Last year, the Portland Beavers in Oregon, whose stadium got a $38 million face-lift, had about $10 million in operating losses.
It is also possible that financially troubled Major League Baseball, which pays for the salaries, health insurance and equipment for all the players and coaches on the 160 minor league teams affiliated with big-league franchises, may decide to reduce that subsidy when its contract with those teams comes up for renewal in two years. That could have a devastating effect on the budgets of many minor league teams.
For now, though, there is no stopping minor league baseball's booming place in North America's sports culture. From Aberdeen, Md., to Edmonton, Alberta, teams are playing in bustling parks. The core appeal? Minor league baseball is successfully marketing fun.
And while that is a nostalgic notion, it is revealing that the selling is being done in an altogether different, and modern, way. Because going to a minor league game is anything but an old-fashioned trip to that dusty old ballpark downtown.

Tradition Takes a Back Seat
Nowhere is the shifting face of the minor league baseball industry more evident than 150 miles west of Brockton in the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts, where the city of Pittsfield has had a minor league baseball team off and on for a century. Since 1919, Pittsfield's Wahconah Park has played host to those games, making it one of a handful of ballparks, including Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, dating from that era.
Lou Gehrig and others of his era played at Wahconah and they would recognize it still, from the wooden grandstand to the wooden rafters from which hang wooden owls, whose presence discourages pigeons from nesting and eventually soiling the clothes of patrons seated in the wooden benches below. With tiny locker rooms, dugouts and concession stands, Wahconah is ancient and charming, almost museum-like.
Built before baseball was played at night, Wahconah was laid out so that the batter faces west, not east, as is customary in most modern parks. This can lead to a blazing sun shining directly into batters' eyes from beyond the center-field fence, and yields the most peculiar Wahconah feature: games interrupted by a sun delay.
For years, players in Pittsfield tried to embrace the Wahconah charm and endure the lack of amenities. Along the way, Pittsfield's civic leaders declined to replace the stadium. As recently as the 2000 season, the Mets' Class A farm team in the New York-Penn League called Wahconah Park home. Then the Mets decided they would be better off in the $39 million KeySpan Park in Coney Island.
A Class A affiliate of the Houston Astros took the Mets' place in Pittsfield, but the team announced last year that it was leaving for a $14 million, state-financed ballpark in Troy, N.Y.
When the Astros' departure was made final, an offer was made to move another New York-Penn League team, the Utica Blue Sox, to Pittsfield -- provided a plan for a new stadium was approved. But voters in Pittsfield overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to create a civic authority that would have built a new park; the Blue Sox headed to Aberdeen, Md., where they moved into the $22 million Ripken Stadium.
"Pittsfield has so many other fish to fry," said the city's first-year mayor, Sara Hathaway, who campaigned against a new stadium. The city had an $8 million deficit last year. "There are some morale issues in Pittsfield and some of that is because there isn't a new stadium," she said. "But I don't spend a lot of time worrying about it."
Pittsfield's Astros team is averaging more than 3,000 fans this summer in Troy's Joseph L. Bruno Stadium, named for the majority leader of the New York State Senate, who was instrumental in securing the state construction money. It has wide concourses, picnic grounds, rows of concession booths, a year-round merchandise store, major league-quality dugouts and locker rooms, a state-of-the-art underground hitting and pitching tunnel, and a video scoreboard capable of showing replays.
The stadium, known as the Joe, also has 10 mezzanine-level luxury boxes, which are sold out for the next three years, at $15,000 annually for 38 home games.
Meanwhile, an unaffiliated independent league team -- the same league Brockton plays in -- has taken up residence in Pittsfield, but attendance for the team, the Berkshire Black Bears, is roughly a third of what the Astros draw in Troy. At Wahconah, there have been minor renovations, including a luxury box of sorts: two wicker chairs, a wicker table and an area rug off the main aisle behind home plate.
"We still have a great baseball tradition here," Hathaway said. "There's still nothing wrong with an afternoon at Wahconah Park with the family."
Which is undoubtedly true, but increasingly, cities like Pittsfield, which were staples of minor league baseball for decades, are falling out of the loop. A trend toward newer, more profitable stadiums -- and frequently more affluent markets -- that began in the mid-1980's has become a gold rush.
Whether it is Lexington, Ky., Lansing, Mich., or Lowell, Mass., minor league baseball has moved to places where families with the most disposable income reside within easy driving distance. Success has been written in teeming grandstands. Lexington, a Class A team, set a South Atlantic League record by operating 4 percent above the stadium's 6,033-seat capacity. Lansing established a national Class A attendance record. At Lowell, where every game has been a sellout since 1999, standing-room-only tickets go on sale 10 hours before game time, and there is frequently a line.
In 1983, the city of New Britain, Conn., built a new stadium to lure a minor league team from nearby Bristol. In 1996, a bigger and more plush stadium -- with luxury boxes, souvenir store, picnic grounds and a rooftop sports bar -- rose next to the existing stadium, which was only 13 years old.
So New Britain, which has lost most of the manufacturing plants that built its reputation as the Hardware City, now has two minor league ballparks. The older stadium is used primarily for amateur tournaments. The new stadium is setting attendance records.

A Quality-of-Life Issue
The notion that a new stadium can act as an engine for economic development has been debunked by a paper trail of academic research longer than 73 Barry Bonds home runs measured end to end. Economists studying the effect of new major league and minor league ballparks have almost universally concluded that such projects -- with some exceptions -- offer very little tangible economic return for the taxpayers' dollar.
"They don't feed any positive economic growth or impact," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, who has written extensively on the subject. "It won't produce a huge per capita increase or mean many more jobs. People don't travel great distances to see these teams. It is revenue recirculated in the community. They spent it at the minor league ballpark instead of the cineplex."
Zimbalist and other economists agree on the likely exceptions: cities where the ballpark is but one piece of an extensive urban-renewal effort with goals more far-reaching than providing sporting entertainment.
"If it's part of a long-term project, a stadium might improve the gestalt of a downtown," Zimbalist said.
To those in the minor league baseball industry, that is precisely the point -- it is all about the feel-good effects. In Brockton, city leaders point to the brightly lighted, packed baseball stadium as proof of what's new in a city once viewed as drab and aging. Waterfront development, much of it initiated by a new minor league ballpark, has transformed the aura of the downtowns in Trenton and in Bridgeport, Conn.
Marvin Goldklang, who heads a group that owns five minor league teams and is a consultant to two others, conceded that the economic benefit of a baseball franchise is hard to quantify.
"But it is real," Goldklang said. "Just open the local chamber of commerce's pitch book. We're on the first few pages. For a small- or medium-sized city or region, a minor league team is more central to attracting new industries to the area than at the major league level."
In Troy, Bruno justifies the $14 million spent on the Joe in similar terms. "It's a place where people come together and enjoy themselves," he said. "We've directed a lot of money into the arts in the capital region over the years. Why? For the same reasons. It's a quality-of-life issue."
This is a message not lost on economists, at least when discussing minor league baseball.
"If you believe in the power of minor league baseball," Zimbalist said, "it doesn't matter if it raises income levels and creates jobs. The American culture does love baseball; it's good, wholesome entertainment. That's how it should be evaluated."
At the River Dogs' games in Charleston, S.C., there is a concierge booth, where fans can make their postgame dinner reservations. The River Dogs have also held a women's night at the ballpark, when men were turned away at the gate. The game sold out. The River Dogs also played host to something called Nobody Night.
Before their July 7 game with the Columbus (Ga.) Red Stixx at Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park -- another place nicknamed the Joe -- the River Dogs padlocked the gates so that the official attendance would be zero. That broke the previous record for the smallest crowd at a professional baseball game, which had been 12 people for an 1881 game between Chicago and Troy.
Several thousand River Dogs fans congregated outside the ballpark July 7, some watching from the picnic grounds beyond the center-field wall. After the fifth inning, when the game became official, the gates were opened and fans streamed in to find candy and T-shirts (not to mention unclaimed foul balls) awaiting them in the empty seats.
The River Dogs' president is Mike Veeck, son of the legendary baseball owner and promotional wizard Bill Veeck. The father sent a midget, Eddie Gaedel, up to bat as a way to draw attention to his lowly St. Louis Browns in 1951; the son came up with Nobody Night, as well Lawyer Appreciation Night, when each attending lawyer was charged twice the ticket price and billed again every half inning. Proceeds went to Legal Aid.

'Homespun Family Entertainment'
At the River Dogs' games, as at nearly every minor league park these days, there is continual between-inning entertainment: sumo wrestlers, dance contests, mascot races, pie-eating contests. 
"We're selling homespun family entertainment," said Bill Gladstone, who took his Astros' farm team from Pittsfield to Troy, where it became the Tri-City Valley Cats. "It's still about the game, but it's a game where the fans talk to the players and sit close enough to hear the dugout chatter."
Bill Dowling, president and principal owner of the New Britain Rock Cats, was once executive vice president of the Yankees.
"Everything about the major leagues costs so much now, and the players are perceived as greedy or unconcerned," Dowling said. "We appreciate that we have to entertain you for the $7 you paid to get in.
"So we entertain. We sell joy."
The actor Bill Murray is a part owner of a handful of minor league teams nationwide, including Brockton, where a comic's touch is evident throughout the ballpark. While most of the signs over the food service areas read "Concessions," one reads "Confessions" and another "Contentions."
Among the standard fare on the menu board is this prominently displayed item: pan-seared tuna steak, which is permanently listed as "Tomorrow's Special." 
Even the stadium public-address announcer, John Dolan, gets into the act. When a batter from the visiting Elmira Pioneers hit a home run, the buzz that had filled the ballpark came to a halt. The batter circled the bases in complete silence until he finally touched home plate, when Dolan paused and said into his microphone, "Whatever."
In minor league baseball, it is all in the program. Literally. Inside the cover of a Brockton Rox game program, there is Murray's picture and his official title with the team: director of fun.

A Troubled Game, An Informal Poll

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
THE New York Times had its baseball poll; Lou Harris has his. Late Thursday night, I decided that I would have mine: the William C. Rhoden Anonymous Informal Impromptu Attitude Survey. My survey consisted of 17 questions designed to get at an elusive, gnawing truth about why we continue to put up with baseball and its labor problems. 
 Why do we in the United States continue to maintain baseball as part of the big three bread-and-butter sports -- along with football and basketball -- when soceer is clearly a better game? I'm not a huge fan of soccer, but the game certainly points us toward our global future more than baseball, a provincial relic that becomes less relevant with each new season. Soccer's World Cup, with its concentration of internecine rivalries and strong community identification, gives truer meaning to the concept of a World Series than does baseball. 
 Still, we put up with this nonsense to feed a psychological need that has less to do with the game than with a need to cling to a rapidly fading past and hold off a menacing future. 
The game of baseball deals in nostalgia; the business of baseball counts on collective public amnesia to keep the shell game going. Most of us remember when we watched our first baseball game; few remember the vows we made only eight years ago never to watch another baseball game.
In an effort to get at the why of all this, I came up with my own poll. I distributed 50 questionnaires, most of them at Shea Stadium on Friday evening. The ages of respondents ranged from 17 to 66, and their professions ran the gamut: auto mechanics, homemakers (their word, not mine), financial analysts, investment bankers, retired schoolteachers, carpenter, community activist. Lawyers, of course. Most began watching the game around 8 years old.
My overriding interest was to see how many of these fans viewed baseball players as fellow workers. Eighty percent said they did not identify with players as fellow workers, 16 percent said they did and 4 percent had no answer. On the bottom-line issue of a strike, 90 percent of those polled said that the players should not strike, the remaining 10 percent said they should. 
Twenty-six percent of the respondents said there was no rationale for a strike. The rest were divided. Most said the players had a short athletic life and were entitled to maximize their earnings. Some said players were underpaid. Still others said workers should get what they could get.
I didn't ask for names, but Ann Cotty did not want to be anonymous. A 24-year-old graduate student from Kingston, N.Y., Cotty sat behind home plate Friday at Shea. She wrote that she had been watching baseball since she was an infant, and that her love for the game would not be affected by a strike. "But for major league baseball, respect will be lost to a large degree," she wrote.
Cotty wrote that she would come back to the ballpark if the players went on strike, adding, "But I know I will be in the minority and the tremendous salaries of the players will cost me a great deal in tickets and other parts of the ballpark."
Finally, Cotty wrote: "A strike will hurt everyone. Fans will lose the entertainment and excitement of the ball games, owners will be unable to pay even the league minimum salary when very few seats are filled in their ballparks. And don't forget the workers who make minimum wage who will be unemployed when their millionaire co-workers decide to strike." 
Cotty was the only one to sign a name, but almost everyone had additional comments.
A 52-year-old administrator, who is rarely contented on the job, was unmoved by the great amount of money players make. The administrator said that the players should strike, that they were underpaid and that pro baseball players were entitled to whatever then could extract from management.
A 49-year-old bell captain, who thought that the players should strike, saw the battle between players and owners as a classic battle between labor and management. "The management's job is to get the maximum labor from workers at the lowest cost," the bell captain wrote. "The workers must strike for maximum benefits."
A 65-year-old retiree, who said the players should strike, thought the Attitude Survey was unfair.
"This is slanted against the players," the retiree wrote. "The owners need to share revenue or keep to their budgets. Player salaries will fall in line if owners are rational."
A 24-year-old who works in the sports information department at Army said the strike was "all about greed; the owners the players, all they want is more."
What makes players different from the average worker? "They work 200 days less than the average Joe," the 24-year-old wrote.
A 44-year-old who is self-employed said that the only rationale for a strike was pride on the part of players, who, the 44-year-old wrote, were "unable to concede defeat in any way to their owners." He resents the amount of money the players make, sides with management in all labor situations and does not see players as typical workers. At the same time, he said he fantasized about being a player and had watched the game since he was 6.
Every poll has a couple of key points. Mine were: Is baseball still our national pastime? If the players strike, will you come back to the park? 
Seventy-two percent said that baseball is still the national game, and 28 percent disagreed. The person from Army wrote: "Baseball is not the national pastime. It's just a nickname."
As for returning after a strike, 56 percent said they would be back. Sixteen percent said they would not, but with qualifications like "probably," "likely not," "not for a long time" and "to a lesser degree."
Then there were those who stayed above the fray. Jean-Paul Bellin watched Friday's Mets game with his wife and their two sons. Asked about the American pastime and whether he would he return to baseball, Bellin answered: "No. I am French. It's too far!"

Garbage In, Garbage Out. A Princeton Success Story.

BYLINE:  By Jo Piazza 

 BODY:
Bookworms may no longer be Princeton's only larval export.
 By October Thomas Szaky, a sophomore from Canadia who is majoring in economics, hopes to have his worm-based waste management business, Terracycle International Inc., meet a goal of disposing of 15 tons to 30 tons of organic waste a day in Princeton Township. 
 The venture began with Mr. Szaky's simple curiosity over a friend's composting bin. It took Mr. Szaky about 10 months to raise $20,000 to build what he said he recently discovered was the world's largest continuous flow reactor -- or in a non-Princetonian's parlance, a conveyor belt where garbage goes in, worms digest it and soil comes out.
With the help of university students, including a team of three undergraduate engineers, Terracycle is currently disposing of most of the organic waste produced by Princeton's dining halls as well as local summer camps.
By October the company, which has offices in Princeton and Toronto, hopes to raise another $500,000 in private capital to expand the system and promote it to the rest of Princeton Township's waste producers -- restaurants, supermarkets and landscaping companies.

I.O.C. Chief Keeps Links To Nations Balanced

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

 BODY:
The International Olympic Committee president is essentially a roving ambassador, and Dr. Jacques Rogge did plenty of roving in his first year in the position, visiting 30 countries and meeting with Olympic athletes and world leaders, including President Bush, Jiang Zemin of China, Gerhard Schroder of Germany and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
 His most important journey was to Salt Lake City in February for the Winter Olympics, which were successful but rocked by a figure-skating judging scandal and the subsequent awarding of double gold medals. 
 Rogge, a 60-year-old orthopedic surgeon and former Olympic sailor from Belgium, continues to espouse probity, transparency and the need to rein in the cost and size of the Olympic Games. On July 16, the one-year anniversary of his election, he spoke about the road traveled and the road that stretches ahead.
Q. How has your perspective changed in the last year after all the meetings with the primary actors in the Olympic movement?
A. I've been even more convinced by the need to have a very close and positive relationship with governments, while at the same time keeping your independence. You might know that I was one who fought on the front line for the independence of the national Olympic Committees during the American boycott in 1980 with Jimmy Carter and the same in 1984. So we need to be independent, but at the same time you cannot build anything without the great support of governments. And even when speaking about the Salt Lake City Games, government support, which was very welcomed and absolutely needed, was far higher than it has been in the past in the United States. So, government support and the links with government are really essential.
Q. After one year, what would be your primary agenda items for the Olympic movement?
A. Definitely the No. 1 issue is doping, and everything we have to do to reduce this evil. And we are working very hard. We have tripled the number of tests. We caught seven positive cases in Salt Lake City, whereas in the 18 previous Winter Games, from Chamonix in 1924 until Nagano in 1998, we only caught 5. That does not mean there is more doping but definitely that we catch more cheats. We wholeheartedly support WADA (the World Anti-Doping Agency). We created WADA, so we put a great emphasis on that. We've done so already. 
And definitely the second thing is that I'm keen on reducing the scale and complexity of the Games. The commission is now in the study phase to examine where we can make cuts without affecting the quality. The third thing is the Olympic program, which I think we have to adapt. That is always a very sensitive and emotional issue. But we need to make the program a little bit more modern and to adapt to the changing needs of young people and sports fans.
From 1948 in London until Sydney, we've had a constant increase of number of sports events and disciplines and we then decided that for Athens we would freeze the program to 10,500 athletes, 28 sports and 301 events. So that's the first time in 50 years there was no increase in the program. The next phase is to fine-tune within those limits.
Q. Would you be in favor of increased professionalization of refereeing?
A. Absolutely. You need it at the top level. Of course whatever you introduce at the very top level could have repercussions on the grass-roots level and in the small clubs and in the minor leagues and in all the hundreds of thousands of little clubs in the countryside. They can't afford to have video replay and so on. So you have to draw a line. Where do we begin with professional referees? But definitely at the very top, yes.
Q. Looking back at Salt Lake City, how do you feel about the way you handled the skating controversy? Are you concerned that the decision to award a second gold medal to the Canadian pair was made too expeditiously?
A. The second medal for me is a matter of fundamental justice. We took the right decision in agreeing to the proposal of I.S.U., and they worked well with us. Where I failed definitely, and I admit that frankly, is that I failed in understanding that this would create a lot of criticism in Russia. And I was not proactive in addressing that. Neither at the level of Russian public opinion, which is never easy when you are in a place like Salt Lake City and there is a time difference of not less than nine hours. And I also have not been proactive at the level of the government, who faced hostile public opinion. So I should have done more on that, and it's a good lesson for the future. Everything has been talked out now. The Russians understand why we did it. But again, the lack of communication has not been good, and I take the blame for that. 
Q. And you have no concern about the legal procedure being pursued through the Court of Arbitration for Sport and its eventually coming back and rebounding on the decision to award the second gold?
A. Listen. If C.A.S. makes a decision, we will abide by it, of course. That's normal. We've done our duty. In both cases, both in the doping cases and in the case of the judge. In the judging case, we had a written confession admitting that there was manipulation, and in the case of the Russian cross-country skiers, we had a positive doping test. So we've acted on that.
Q. Do you view what happened with the United States Olympic Committee president, Sandra Baldwin, who resigned after admitting to falsifying her resume, as a step back for the Olympic movement?
A. From a personal point of view, this is tragic for Sandy, and I really felt bad for her. But you have to put this into perspective. This was an act; call it an act of pride or vanity, from which she never made one dollar. She never used it for applying for a professional position. She's a volunteer. She made an error, yes; she paid dearly. But I think there are other issues in the United States of a far graver nature. You are a country now living in a totally new era of security in general, the threat of terrorism, major economic shock, crash of Wall Street, ethics in the reporting of major companies. But here you have a woman who has devoted her life to sport. It's sad, but it's not substantial.
Q. We seem to be in a period of shrinkage with concerns about economic viability. What's your feeling from sponsors and television about the future for sports?
A. We recently had meetings with broadcasters and experts. The I.O.C. is being protected by the fact we had long-term agreements, and all the sponsors have clearly said: "Don't worry. We'll continue with you." The size of the sponsors we have, as multinational world leaders in their fields, means they can absorb the economic shock and they see the long term. Without revealing names, you will hear about the signing of sponsors in the coming weeks and months for the period after Beijing in 2008. 
Q. You don't envisage any deflation in the price of rights for the Olympic movement?
A. No. What we hear is that the value of the brand -- I don't like that word -- but the value of the brand is still intact. When people negotiate for 2010 or 2012, they don't negotiate with the present economic crisis in mind. 
Q. There is continuing interest in Athens and how things are unfolding. Given the success of Sydney and Salt Lake City, is it as important that Athens get it 100 percent right in 2004?
A. It's not going to be the Sydney Games. The city is different. The size of the population is different. In Sydney, you had no problem, no shortage of land. It's a continent on its own. You could build Homebush Bay from scratch. You can't do that in Athens. Everywhere you dig, you find archaeological remains. There are delays. Environmental rules are far stricter and so on. But I think the human factor will be extremely good. I have no concerns for media and broadcasters. They will be very well served. The athletes will have good venues, good competitions. We might experience more difficulties in terms of transportation. We will experience more difficulties for accommodation.
For the general public and spectators, it will be a bit more difficult. However, the athletes will not suffer. The Olympic family, selfishly, will not suffer either. The 50 billion audience we generate in 16 days will see very good Games. 
Q. Anything you see on the doping front that has come across your desk that concerns you?
A. WADA is investigating into genetic transfer, which is needed. From what I hear, and I read a lot, I am still not as pessimistic as public opinion. Because for the public, it's Frankenstein. We know that's not going to be the case. We know that testing will be possible.
There is an ongoing and improving collaboration with pharmaceutical companies. The fact we found so fast darbepoetin at the Olympics was really the effort of working closely with the pharmaceutical companies and also with the man who actually masterminded the drug. To discuss with the pharmaceutical companies to find a good test in due time. That's really important.

A $70 Million Gap Seen in Suffolk Budget

BYLINE:  By John Rather 

 BODY:
Lower-than-expected sales tax revenues and higher social service costs are threatening Suffolk County with a projected budget gap of more than $70 million next year unless action is taken, Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive, warned last week.
 Mr. 
Gaffney said the county would have to consider cutting services, promoting early retirement and raising fees to address the problem. He said he might also revive an effort to sell future tobacco settlement revenues. County legislators rejected such a sale last year. 
 Mr. Gaffney's approach to averting a deficit will be reflected in the proposed 2003 budget he will send to the county legislature on Sept. 20, and which is now being drafted.
Kenneth Weiss, the county budget director, said sales tax revenues were not expected to meet the 4.6 percent increase projected in the current budget. He said that if the trend continued, revenues would be $33 million below estimates for 2002 and 2003. Add a projected deficit of nearly $44 million in the social services budget through 2003, and the overall deficit would rise to nearly $77 million.
Mr. Weiss said that other counties and New York City were experiencing lower-than-projected sales tax revenues. "Everybody is having the same problem," he said. "The sales tax is driven by the economy."
He said the recent stock market slump would "affect consumer confidence, and consumer confidence is the driving force behind retail sales."
Revenues from the 8.5 percent sales tax in Suffolk account for a major portion of total county revenues. Suffolk keeps 4.25 percent of the total. The state keeps 4 percent and the remainder goes to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. John Rather

HEADLINE: Relief Workers, Our Better Selves 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Anthony Lake is right in calling for a memorial at the United Nations honoring those who die doing their duty ("Honoring Relief Workers," Op-Ed, July 22). 
 Humanitarian workers represent the better nature in us all. 
Their safety should be of concern to us all, as well.
The United States government supports the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator through our assessed obligation as well as through contributions to specific operations.
International organizations need to keep better data on acts of violence against humanitarian workers, including rape. A greater understanding of the extent of such violence will help us plan better for their safety.
The United States government supports a resolution before the United Nations Economic and Social Council acknowledging the need for aid workers to have safe and unhindered access to the civilians they are helping. This fall, the General Assembly should continue to make the safety of humanitarian workers a priority.

On Wall Street, Present Is Prologue

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
Wall Street continues in feverish, nervous malaise. Its pulse keeps going up to 120 under hourly rumors of defalcation int his or that great corporation, railroad, or others. Faith in financial agents is gone. Every treasurer and cashier is "suspect," and no wonder after the recent epidemic of fraud.

George Templeton Strong, Oct. 27, 1873
 THE language is stuffy - defalcation is just a fancy word for embezzlement, which itself is a genteel way to say "stealing." But otherwise, this entry from Mr. Strong's New York diary sounds like it could have been written yesterday.
 And while the current parade of corporate scandals, the insider-trading allegations and the overall stock-market smash-up has shocked many New Yorkers, there are a few for whom this is all old hat.
 "For historians, it's unbelievably boring and repetitious," said Mike Wallace, a professor of history at the city University of New York and co-author of the Pulitzer-Prize winning "Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898."
 Financial fiascos have been a feature of New York life for centuries; in 1854, Mr. Wallace said, "the railroads were the dot-com boom, and there was wild speculation." Leading, of course, to insider trading, fraud and, ultimately, financial catastrophe.
 The good news, for New York, is that the city has survived countless such episodes. The bad news is that the consequences have often been severe and long-lasting.
 The panic of 1857 left tens of thousands of jobless people on the streets. After the panic of 1873, hundreds of New Yorkers starved to death. The panic of 1893 resulted in economic depression. After the crash of 1929, "New York suffered badly," said Charles R. Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College and a historian of Wall Street. "There were more Hoovervilles here than anywhere else."
 The grinding stock market declines of 1973 and 1974 helped land the city in fiscal hot water; the crash of 1987, some economists aver, helps explain why New York went into recession well before the rest of the country and emerged far later.
 If anything, finance has taken on a greater role in the city in recent years. "It's not entirely true but New York is a one-horse town, but we've lost manufacturing and lost the port," Mr. Wallace said. "Washington is a one-horse town, and so is Hollywood, but they don't have these huge swings."
 But Wall Street is built on boom and bust. During the boom years, New York profits more than anywhere else. During the bust years, the city suffers more.
 It's not only because stockbrokers are out of work; so are all the lawyers and advisers and accountants and clerks and building cleaners and, these days, computer experts who flock around the financial business. Restaurant owners, bauble sellers, opera singers and cigar vendors lose valuable clients; so do housekeepers, golf pros and manicurists. Heck, so do newspapers.
 New York's image also suffers when the stock market swoons, exposing financial shenanigans. "As early as the 1830's, people in Ohio were enraged," Mr. Wallace said. "They were ralling about the people living in Sybaritic luxury in New York while we virtuous farmers live in penruy."
 After the stock market melted down in the 1970's, the rest of the nation generally approved of Gerald Ford's "Drop Dead" attitude about New York. The spectacle of a Wall Street bigwig being hauled off in hand-cuffs did not do much to burnish New York's image in 1987.
 So you have to wonder how the rest of the country will feel about New York now that more Americans than ever have staked their financial futures on the stock market. True, Enron isn't based in New York. But the banks that profited from it and the brokerage firms that flogged it (and all those other now-worthless stocks) are.
 It may turn out to be too bad that the Rigas family were accused of using ill-gotten gains from looting Adelphia Communications to buy a place on the Upper East Side. Couldn't the Rigases have gone back to Coudersport, Pa., to get arrested?
 So while there's no guarantee that times will get together, the outlook isn't exactly rosy. "I think New York's in for it this time," Mr. Geisst said. Or, as George Templeton Strong put it more than a century ago, "There is a prospect of a hard, blue winter."

Once UponA Time, A Restless C.E.O. . . .

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
WELCOME to story time in corporate America.
 The old story went like this: chief executives were in such demand that they were apt to jump ship at any moment. 
 The new story says that the scrutiny of large companies has caused some C.E.O.'s to consider resigning and others to balk at a promotion to the corner office.
The next story is already emerging. It says executives will begin quitting in droves if boards force them to hold on to their company stock in an effort to tie the executives' pay to their company's long-term health. 
The storytellers have most often been the executives and the recruiters and pay consultants they hire. By suggesting that the job market for chief executives is fluid, the tales of executive wanderlust have conveniently offered an economic rationale for enormous executive pay. The evidence, however, is about as impressive as the wardrobe of the emperor in that other fairy tale.
The job of C.E.O. is fabulously attractive, allowing somebody to lead thousands of people, often in an organization where they have spent years. Few people leave voluntarily before they are ready to retire. Surprisingly few have even been willing to leave one corner office for another elsewhere.
This is a crucial point at a time when policy makers and corporate leaders are both struggling to stop the bleeding on Wall Street and to help the fitful economic recovery. It means that reforming executive pay -- a central part of re-establishing corporate America's credibility -- may not be nearly as hard as some people think.
Set that aside for a moment, though, and return to the first story, the one about jumpy C.E.O.'s ditching one company for another.
Since 2000, a year in which executive turnover spiked, 77 of the 200 biggest companies have hired a new boss, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, a compensation consulting firm in New York. How many of those companies had to do so because their chief executive took another corporate job? Two.
David M. Cote left TRW for Honeywell, and John H. Dasburg left Northwest Airlines for Burger King. That was the sum total of the wanderlust.
Most departing chiefs retired and remained on their company's board, according to news accounts. A good number were forced out.
Yet many companies, including USX and Verizon, lavished their executives with so-called retention bonuses. Dozens of others cited retention to justify big pay packages, even -- as was the case at Enron recently -- when the executives could hardly expect to be sought-after candidates for other jobs.
The new version of the myth says the recent criticism of corporate America has turned the chief executive's job into an unappealing one. David F. D'Alessandro, the chief executive of John Hancock Financial Services, recently said that he had run into a peer at Yankee Stadium who told him: "I'm thinking of actually getting out, retiring. I didn't sign up for this."
There is no reason to doubt Mr. D'Alessandro, but don't expect the unnamed executive to make good on the threat. In fact, check back six months from now to see if anybody running a healthy company ceded his power and perks.
The idea that executives have little loyalty, however, serves an important political purpose. It allows them to argue against a serious idea for altering executive pay.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has proposed requiring top executives to hold all their company stock as long as they are in their jobs. Congress is unlikely to adopt the plan, but some analysts think that boards of directors might enact milder versions of the policy on their own. Executives have begun to fight the effort, saying that talented leaders would quit after their stock price had risen, sell the stock and find new work.
IF boards are wise, though, they will realize that finding a new company to run is not easy. Bank One and Citigroup already have stock-holding rules for top executives, and neither has suffered an exodus. Boards can also backload pay packages, giving executives an incentive to stay.
The economic theory needed to design such a contract is fairly basic. Boards and investors simply have to decide that they will not bend to executives' wishes as often as they did in the slap-happy 1990's.
The idea is not perfect, of course. Some executives, anticipating a big stock decline, will still decide that quitting and selling makes more sense than sticking around to receive more shares. Should anybody really be worried, however, if a company loses an executive with that mind-set?

Time for Faith in Brokerage Shares?

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH HARRIS 

 BODY:
AS investors have grown disenchanted with Wall Street, the stock prices of major brokerage firms have tumbled sharply. While the stocks may well fall further, some analysts say they may be a good value.
 The weak economy and the depressed stock market have cooled activity in investment banking, whether mergers and acquisitions or initial public offerings -- all major sources of revenue for many companies in the group. Though trading volume has surged during the market turmoil this month, it declined in the second quarter, reducing brokerage income. Moreover, the firms earn fees from assets under management, which have also fallen. On top of that, corporate scandals and questions about analyst bias have dogged the group. 
 These pressures have led to declines of more than 30 percent this year in the share prices of companies like Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab.
Questions are arising about when the industry's stocks will reverse course, but "I can't say a rally is imminent," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.
Still, he said, on a valuation basis, the companies have begun to look attractive. Earnings remain positive, attributable in part to cost-cutting and diversification.
In addition, the price-to-book values of brokerage firm stocks -- the price divided by the net value of assets -- are approaching levels not found since 1998. Merrill Lynch trades at 1.4 times book value, compared with its former low of 1.5, while Morgan Stanley has hit 1.96, compared with its 1.7 low, Mr. Moszkowski said.
Charlotte A. Chamberlain, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, said, "They're priced like snow shovels in July." 
Still, David H. Ellison, who runs both the FBR Financial Services fund, which was down 4.4 percent this year through Thursday, and the FBR Small Cap Financial fund, up 9.2 percent, says investing in shares of brokerage firms is premature. He prefers to delay until the economy is in a clear upswing. "These are bull-market companies when the market's doing well and capitalism is functioning in an ebullient environment," Mr. Ellison said.
That has hardly been the case recently. Merrill Lynch has come under particular pressure because of an investigation over possible conflicts of interest among its stock analysts; it recently reached a settlement with Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York State attorney general. Merrill is also reorganizing and announced last week that E. Stanley O'Neal would become chief executive in December, a year ahead of schedule, and will replace David H. Komansky as chairman in April.
Strong performance in nonbrokerage areas has been a buffer to stocks of other brokerage firms. Bond trading and underwriting contributed to 46 percent of 2001 revenue at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, Mr. Moszkowski said. That has helped to limit stock price declines this year to 1 percent at Bear Stearns and 19 percent at Lehman, he said.
Schwab, however, remains more of a retail brokerage firm despite its diversification into wealth management; its earnings fell 7 percent in the first six months of 2002 from a year earlier. Schwab stock has lost 42 percent this year.
In the past, brokerage stocks have rallied in advance of economic improvement. Merrill Lynch's stock price, for instance, more than doubled in a five-month period beginning at the end of October 1990, when the economy was in recession.
"Long before you have a recovery these stocks will react positively because the market is always one of those things that anticipates," said Anton V. Schutz, portfolio manager of the Burnham Financial Services fund, which was up 3.2 percent this year through Thursday.
WHILE the combined earnings of the 10 largest securities firms declined from the first quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2002, the group did not lose money, performing well compared with other recent turbulent periods. From the end of 1987 through the end of 1990, the industry's earnings were in the red for 5 of the 13 quarters, starting with a $700 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1987, when stocks crashed, said David M. Trone, an analyst at Prudential Securities. And in 1994, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, the group lost money again in two quarters.
The brokerage firms he covers are "very comfortably in the black and there are no individual firms that have lost money," Mr. Trone said. 
Anna M. Dopkin, an analyst and portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Financial Services fund, is also encouraged. "So far, they've proven to be better stores of capital this time around thanks in part to a lower tolerance for risk," she said.
But Ms. Dopkin sees equally attractive investments in other industries, like bank stocks. For now, though, she does not have to choose because few investors are moving money into her fund, which was down 17.6 percent this year through Thursday.
"I wish the money was pouring in, because I could spend it," she said.

Police for Hire in Russia's Business Jungle

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
IN Russia's morning newspapers these days, a frequent staple is a police raid on corporate wrongdoers. Uniformed men with guns round up anxious office workers. Files are searched. Managers are marched out of their offices.
 In many cases, the policemen wear ski masks to intimidate those under siege, prompting the Russian public to call their raids mask shows, a sardonic reference to a Soviet-era comedy troupe. 
 On the face of it, these are scenes of law enforcement in action, something Americans might actually envy as they think about their corporate scandals. But a closer look shows something entirely different going on. 
In fact, those policemen are acting not for the state but for corporate rivals. Underpaid and underappreciated in their day jobs working for the government, they're moonlighting for the highest bidder. And they're not enforcing the rule of law so much as rules of the business jungle bent by canny operators to their own advantage.
All of this is playing out -- and stirring some protests -- against a debate within Russia about the role of law itself as the country evolves from a brutal form of communism through a Darwinian form of capitalism. At the end of the road, reformers hope, will be a somewhat more rational business atmosphere. Two years ago, when he was a candidate, Vladimir V. Putin, now the president, summed up the quest aptly, if clumsily, when he promised that under him Russia would get a "dictatorship of the law." 
Consider the recent example of Slavneft, a Russian oil company that is emerging from state ownership. After it fired its chief executive earlier this year and its shareholders elected a new one, Yuri Sukhanov, who was better connected politically and who promised to be less autocratic, the former chief executive responded by hiring about 40 police officers and physically taking over the company headquarters in downtown Moscow last month. 
On the surface, it seemed to be the case that the law was on his side. He said he was enforcing a court decision that had ruled his dismissal illegal, and he cited a criminal investigation that had begun against his successor.
But the court ruling had been made in a distant Russian region where the company had neither business nor a base. And the case against the new chief executive was soon dropped, with authorities citing "absence of a crime."
In short, this was a battle between two business groups for control of a state-owned company in anticipation of a planned privatization in the fall. 
The battle highlights a peculiar development in Russian capitalism. Police and prosecutors with crumbs for salaries are being hired, or simply used, as tools in business battles, and the practice has become increasingly prevalent since Mr. Putin became president. 
"Quite simply, you can hire the authorities for money," said Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a deputy in parliament and leader of the liberal Yabloko party. In the last two years, he added, "it has become an institution."
In part, the trend is a side effect of Mr. Putin's emphasis on building a strong state. While Boris N. Yeltsin relied on powerful business executives to help run Russia, Mr. Putin promised to "eliminate them as a class," and turned to police and prosecutors to restore order. As doors to Kremlin offices closed, business, no longer allowed to roam Kremlin corridors, hired law enforcers instead.
As Russia continues to try to sort out who owns what in its newly privatized economy, the practice is giving big businesses a strong edge over smaller, weaker ones, and as a result the development of small businesses has slowed. Though the economy as a whole is now expanding for a fourth year, economists say the growth has been almost exclusively in very large companies.
A recent study by the Center for Economic and Financial Research in Moscow and the World Bank found that a mysterious glass ceiling stops small concerns from growing beyond a certain size. A possible explanation, said Yekaterina Zhuravskaya, director of the study, is that they are blocked by bigger rivals that control local authorities.
In fact, the Slavneft spectacle threw a spotlight on the problem at a crucial moment for legal reform. Government reformers are rewriting laws to block such maneuvering. A new criminal procedural code took effect this month, and a business law code will take effect by the end of July. Under these new rules, the police and prosecutors will have to seek a court order to conduct a search, and other state administrative and enforcement agencies will lose the right to start criminal investigations. Under the new laws, the distant provincial court would not have been allowed to rule on the Slavneft case, the search of the office on the day of the takeover would have required a court order and under next year's rules, it will be more difficult for prosecutors to start criminal investigations of corporate managers. 
Pavel V. Krasheninikov, a deputy in parliament and former minister of justice, who is helping rewrite the laws, said reformers are "rooting out the conditions for abuse," which are "catastrophic for our economy."
On July 17, Russia's interior minister, Boris Gryzlov, issued a warning to moonlighting policemen to stay out of property disputes.
A big problem is that the abuse defies the image of the orderly, reformed Russia that Mr. Putin is projecting to the world. Even so, many say it is a bit too much to expect Russia to fit in just yet to the rest of the capitalist world's notions of a rule of law, and that even the clumsy misuse of the police and courts represents a step forward in this country's economic evolution.
"It is civilized corruption," said Lev M. Timofeyev, author of "Shadow Russia," a book on corruption in the Russian state. "Prices are set. It is clear whom to pay. It's much better than corruption anarchy, when you don't know whom to pay and, any moment, bandits or police could pay you a visit. Business can't develop in those conditions."
Or as Mr. Krasheninikov put it hopefully, "Twenty years from now we'll see this all as very uncivilized."

Detroit and California Rev Their Engines Over Emissions

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
IF Detroit and California ever made a sitcom together, it would be sort of like "Dharma and Greg."
 Detroit, the strait-laced company town, just can't figure out that wacky California. Is it the nation's biggest car market, or is it the most troublesome? Is it the land of Ronald Reagan and Lee Iacocca, or of tree hugging hippies who want every car to be electric? 
 Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger lives there, and he drove a Hummer before anybody else. But another resident is Gray Davis, the Democratic governor of California, who signed a controversial bill on Monday to cut greenhouse gas emissions. That, needless to say, could mean fewer Hummers. 
"There's more than a little concern among the car companies about how bad the relationship with California has gotten," one industry executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
"There needs to be a stand-down, but the more we want to talk, the more radical and out of control they get," he added. "You'd almost like to see a white knight come in here and arbitrate."
The state's new legislation, which will almost certainly be challenged in court, would sharply cut emissions of carbon dioxide, mostly by imposing new, yet-to-be-determined regulations on cars and trucks sold in the state by the 2008 model year. It is only the latest challenge the industry faces from California, which has regularly been aggressive in setting air-quality standards. The state has set tougher rules on emissions of smog-forming pollutants than the federal government.
The industry's view of California was summed up last week in an editorial cartoon in The Detroit News. A middle-aged couple stand in their driveway, next to their sedan. They are looking quizzically at their neighbor, Mr. Jones, who is riding a galloping horse out of his garage, briefcase in hand.
The Joneses, the cartoon's caption read, "say their new, state-of-the-art low-emission vehicle meets California's C02 emissions rules."
By signing the bill, Mr. Davis put his state squarely at odds with Washington. The Bush administration has pulled the United States out of the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement on regulating greenhouse-gas emissions. And in March, the Senate handily defeated a bill that would have significantly raised gasoline mileage requirements for the first time since the 1980's. Tailpipe emissions from cars driven in the United States constitute the world's fifth-leading source of greenhouse gas, according to the Sierra Club. The nation as a whole is the top producer of such emissions. 
REPEATED defeats on Capitol Hill have made California an appealing alternative battleground for frustrated environmental groups and politicians. Senators John McCain and John F. Kerry, who led a failed Senate effort to raise fuel standards, sent a joint letter to California legislators encouraging them to consider the bill. "Big money and the special interests went to the mat to stop us," Mr. Kerry said earlier this month. "I'm just glad to see they weren't able to smother a real dialogue in California."
Republican leaders, and influential Midwestern Democrats like Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, have long prevailed in their opposition to toughening federal gasoline mileage requirements. The industry's expected legal challenge to the new California legislation will likely argue that the state's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from automobiles is superseded by the federal government's fuel economy regulations, because the two issues are closely correlated.
"We will see if CO2 is something different from fuel economy," Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said last Thursday. 
"We are clearly aware of our responsibility and that of the industry to increase fuel economy," he added. "We don't think it's the best approach to force the customer into a mix of vehicles that they wouldn't buy on their own."
Companies like Chrysler have argued that California's regulations are already forcing them to produce small cars that consumers don't want and to develop costly and in some cases obsolete technologies. The most immediate threat is California's zero-emission vehicle mandate, which would force the industry to derive 10 percent of its sales from low- and zero-emission vehicles, like battery powered cars. The plan has been delayed by a legal challenge from General Motors and DaimlerChrysler.
Environmental groups counter that California's regulations have been the only real impetus to developing cleaner technologies like hybrid engines that use electricity and gasoline, or hydrogen fuel cells, a technology many automakers see as one day replacing the internal combustion engine.
Detroit, for its part, says it is giving customers what they want. All one has to do is look at the sales figures. Last year, for the first time, sales of passenger cars were overtaken by less fuel-efficient pickup trucks, S.U.V.'s and minivans.
While G.M. phases out Oldsmobile, the Hummer brand, based on the Humvee military transport, is rising in its place. This month, G.M. began selling the Hummer H2, a smaller vehicle that can fit in some garages. Still, at 8,600 pounds, it is so big it is not subject to the same fuel-economy rules that govern other cars. G.M. estimates the H2 gets about 13 miles per gallon, which would put one H2's carbon emissions at 3.4 metric tons in a typical year, compared to 1.9 tons from G.M.'s Chevrolet Malibu sedan. 
A recent magazine advertisement showed the imposing grill of the Hummer looming over an arid, treeless landscape under a pale sun. 
"Hummer," the ads copy reads. "Like nothing else."

The Comic Side of Vicente Fox

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
NOT many heads of state would publicly acknowledge that their first years in office were fitted for the funny pages.
 In Mexico, however, where television and radio stations cannot always reach the rural poor, comic books inform as much as they entertain. They have long been powerful messengers, shaping public opinion with hundreds of thousands of copies distributed each month. 
 President Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola salesman with a keen sense of marketing, seems stuck in a serious image crisis. On July 2, 2000, he became Mexico's first democratically elected opposition president, ending the 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Voters since then have expressed increasing disappointment in President Fox because his government has failed to live up to the expectations for change that fueled his rise to power. 
With his popularity ratings continuing a steady decline, Mr. Fox turned for help to Kaboom! Studios, a team of cartoonists whose work for the creators of "The Simpsons" won them international acclaim.
A 24-page comic book titled "July 2: Now No One Can Stop the Change in Mexico!" hit the streets a couple weeks ago. Readers called it a high-gloss version of comic books published in the past by PRI candidates for president and, in recent months, by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the mayor of Mexico City. 
The comic is meant to be a superhero's story: a mild-mannered business executive wins the nation's first democratic elections, transforms a system of corruption and impunity into a government that upholds law and order, and shares power with the people. In some frames President Fox is depicted with the same square jaw and stern glare of the Man of Steel.
In a nod to the demands of the masses, there are subliminal hints of sex and violence. Women are curvy and show lots of cleavage. And there are scenes of gun-wielding police officers fighting criminals to the ground. But the main messages, narrated by a group of hip-looking college students, are aimed squarely at readers' political conscience. 
The strategy isn't novel. In 1999, for instance, the Chinese government produced comic books that demonized the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement. Government-issue comics and cartoons are not always used for self-serving propaganda, however. They have been published in the United States and Africa to combat AIDS. In Bosnia, they have warned children of the lingering dangers of land mines. In Japan, they help explain the complex economic system. A book of line drawings in Peru was distributed to promote immunization and family planning among peasants. And in Thailand they have been used to teach rural mothers how to breast feed.
The Fox comic, of course, is strictly about image management. It is paid for and published by the office of the president and is heavily slanted, avoiding any criticism of Mr. Fox. The fact that crime rates are still high, the comic says, is a matter for state and local governments. It exaggerates the president's record of achievements, pronouncing, for example, that "all students have quality schools."
And, of course, there is an odious archenemy, Ivan. Everything about him is dark -- his hair, his clothes, his attitude. The comic book opens with Ivan slouched arrogantly in his chair, wearing a long black trench coat, platform boots and a T-shirt with a skull on the front. His ragged black hair hangs down his to his shoulders. And he guzzles from a can like a drunk, with drops dribbling down his chin.
Other students scold Ivan for sleeping through the election that brought President Fox to power. The day marked the start of "a deep democratic change in Mexico," the students said.
Ivan, however, remains unconvinced. He has the fewest lines in the comic book, but his are the words increasingly echoed by people across the country.
"What change are you talking about," Ivan asks, "if everything has stayed the same?"

CORRECTION-DATE: August 4, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A headline last Sunday about government-issued comic books in Mexico used a misspelled given name in some copies for the Mexican president, who sponsored their publication. He is Vicente Fox, not Vincente.

HEADLINE: At Trade Center Site, A Wealth of Ideas; 
Competing Interests Are Fighting To Have a Say in Reviving Downtown

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
A tangle of interests is at work in Lower Manhattan, seeking to influence the rebuilding of the World Trade Center and, more broadly, the structure and methods of the downtown economy. 
 The effort is hardly the most complex attempt at urban planning or public development the city has ever undertaken, in scale, in scope or in infrastructure. 
 But the political, aesthetic and commercial interests that are involved in the effort bring with them such a dizzying array of positions and agendas that it is often quite difficult to keep track of who wants what.
How do the interests of Gov. George E. Pataki, for example, who with the governor of New Jersey controls the agency that owns the World Trade Center site, differ from those of Larry A. Silverstein, who controls the rights to build office space there? 
And how might the interests of the families of the victims of the attack on the World Trade Center diverge from those of, say, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg or the people who live near ground zero?
As the vendor himself might say at Yankee Stadium, "You can't tell the players without a scorecard."
Created in 1921 as a regional planning body to settle disputes over the use of the common harbor and the Hudson River, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is jointly controlled by the governors of each state: New York's appoints its executive director, and New Jersey's, its chairman. The authority built and controls public works linking the two states, including the Holland Tunnel and George Washington Bridge; operates the region's three major airports; and owns several business and industrial parks. But its consuming passion for the last 10 months has been the 16 acres of land where the World Trade Center stood.
The Port Authority's interests in the rebuilding process are several, the simplest being revenue. In 2001, in the largest real estate transaction in New York history, the agency sold control of the site for 99 years to a group of investors led by Mr. Silverstein, a New York developer, in a deal valued at $3.2 billion. To help guarantee that it continued to receive the $120 million annual rent due from the Silverstein group, the authority required that all six design plans for rebuilding the site restore all of its office, retail and hotel space.
How meaningful that annual income is, however, is open to question. After payments in lieu of property taxes to the city, the authority nets about $90 million for other capital projects -- only about 2 percent of its $4.5 billion budget.
More important for the authority's long-term outlook is Mr. Silverstein's lawsuit against his insurers, who before Sept. 11 wrote a $3.5 billion policy on the trade center. 
The $3.5 billion is what the insurers would pay "per occurrence" of some catastrophic event. The question before the court is, was the attack by two hijacked airliners, aimed at bringing down the twin towers, one occurrence or two? The difference means billions for the rebuilding effort.
Finally, the authority is seeking to regain its heart and soul. Most of its executives suffered through the 1993 bombing and rebuilding of the trade center, only to see it vanish in the space of a few hours last fall.
Few public employees represent the "can do" spirit more than the authority's engineers -- one reason it has been difficult for the agency to share the rebuilding work with the rest of the world.

The Governors
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York is pretty much universally thought of as the nexus of power in the rebuilding effort, and he has taken an avid interest in the process -- not surprising given that it is the most visible public project in the state in a year when he is seeking re-election.
In November, as the Port Authority was still reeling from its losses, Mr. Pataki created the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to oversee the rebuilding, in one stroke expanding his influence from the 16-acre site to much of Downtown Manhattan.
The development corporation's board consists of 16 members. Eight are appointed by the governor and eight by the mayor of New York City. (Four mayoral appointees were chosen last year by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and four this year by Mr. Bloomberg.)
That gives the board some appearance of balance between city and state interests, but Mr. Pataki is first among equals, having appointed the board's chairman, John C. Whitehead, a former Wall Street executive, and its president, Louis R. Tomson, a longtime Pataki aide.
In his book "Divided We Stand: A Biography of New York's World Trade Center," Eric Darton describes an event that captures perfectly the relationship between New York and New Jersey as it affects the World Trade Center.
In early spring 1961, David Rockefeller, the head of Chase Manhattan Bank, and Nelson Rockefeller, the governor of New York, met with Austin J. Tobin, who led the Port Authority, to present plans for the World Trade Center to Gov. Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey.
As Mr. Darton describes it, Governor Meyner, peering over the drawings and model for the development, shrugged and turned to Governor Rockefeller.
"What's in it for me?" Mr. Meyner asked.
Since Sept. 11, Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey has had little to say about the fate of the site and its effect on New Jersey.
But that silence should not be mistaken for indifference. Much of the Port Authority's income goes to build transportation projects in New Jersey. 
Most recently, Mr. McGreevey convinced the development corporation to conduct a public hearing about the rebuilding plans, which is scheduled for late August, in New Jersey.

The Mayor and the Council
Mr. Bloomberg, for months, mostly kept quiet about his wishes for the site. But when he did speak, he stirred things up. His comments last month about a memorial -- that essentially, less is more -- upset many relatives of victims of the attack. Then, after being briefed on the initial designs for the 16 acres, but before the plans were released to the public, Mr. Bloomberg gave them a lukewarm review and said that he would be submitting his own ideas.
Mr. Bloomberg's criticism gave added weight to subsequent criticisms of the plans from architecture and design professionals and the general public. Most recently, the mayor began to push for more housing at or near the site.
City Council members have been largely ignored in the redevelopment process, though not for lack of speaking out.
When rebuilding officials testified at a Council hearing early this year, they were peppered with questions about the ethnic makeup of the development corporation's board, which at the time consisted of nine white men and two women, one of whom is African-American. Three of Mr. Bloomberg's four subsequent appointees are members of ethnic minorities.
The Council also has pushed for recognition of problems visited on Chinatown and the Lower East Side after Sept. 11, which led to the expansion of grant programs in those neighborhoods.

Lower Manhattan Development Corporation
The development corporation saw how ephemeral its power really was this spring, when its chief planner, Alexander Garvin, released a request for proposals from architectural firms to help redesign the trade center site. Port Authority officials quickly swatted down the effort; Mr. Garvin withdrew the request, and soon another call for planners was jointly released by the Port Authority and the development corporation. 
A further sign of its relative lack of power came in the Port Authority's insistence that all the site's office and retail space be restored. Given that a major portion of the land had to be reserved for a memorial, planners were left with few options but to produce a very dense arrangement of buildings. 
The agency does have some muscle, though, in the form of money. Congress required that the corporation get at least $2 billion of the $21.7 billion appropriated for rebuilding. That has occasionally left state and city officials asking for money for business recovery programs from an agency appointed by city and state executives. And the development corporation's outreach efforts, including helping to pay for the recent town hall meetings to consider the initial six rebuilding plans, set the stage for the ensuing public revolt.

The Victims' Families
The dust from the collapse of the twin towers had barely settled when people began to talk of how to memorialize the victims of the tragedy. But even 10 months later, many family members cannot bring themselves to visit the site, much less engage in a public debate over its future. The public face of the group -- often referred to simply as the families -- has been represented by a relatively small number of people, but it has become clear that collectively they are not of one voice.
In the early days, some family members vowed to chain themselves to bulldozers if any effort was made to build anything on the site where their loved ones had fallen. Those threats have dissipated, but the momentum behind a "soaring" memorial, as Mr. Giuliani put it, has not. Frustrated with their reception from Mr. Bloomberg, family members have made efforts to re-engage Mr. Giuliani in the public discussion about a memorial. Most recently, Mr. Pataki has emerged as their biggest champion.

The Design Professionals
As commercial life in the city slowed considerably after Sept. 11, designers and architects quickly found their creative juices bubbling over, and they were unable to keep themselves from thinking about what form the rebuilding process would take. They wanted to be involved, if only to rescue the city from the mad rush that so often results in bad design decisions' being justified by short-term economic goals.
Three groups have made repeated contributions to the public dialogue: the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, a coalition of civic groups and community and professional associations; New York New Visions, a group of architects, urban planners, designers and others who laid out a program of development priorities and an array of possible designs for the site and surrounding areas; and Rebuild Downtown Our Town, made up mostly of local residents, many of them also designers or planners, with an interest in community affairs.
These groups have researched and reported on everything from how memorials are conceived and constructed around the world to the history and functions of holes cut in construction site fences to allow the public to peer in. The latter effort helped shape a specially designed "viewing wall" to be built around the site, containing information about the rebuilding effort and the history of the trade center, as well as places to leave small tokens honoring the attack victims. The Civic Alliance also conceived and organized the "Listening to the City" town hall meetings, attended by 4,500 people last weekend.

The Residents
Nearly every constituency involved in the rebuilding thinks it is being ignored, perhaps none more so than the residents in Lower Manhattan, which was the city's fastest-growing neighborhood before Sept. 11. The dust that billowed across the area as the twin towers collapsed settled in thick blankets in their homes, their schools and their offices. (More than half of those who live downtown walk to work.) They lost most of their shopping areas, their streets were torn up, their backyard has been flooded with tourists and they face the prospect of being under a five-year siege from construction companies and developers.
Relatively few of them have opted to move out, however, evidence of the quality of life in a section of the city with unparalleled waterfront access. When Mayor Bloomberg said that many people opposed turning the trade center site into a cemetery, he was voicing this group's frustrations. That has put them into a sort of natural conflict with many victims' relatives, but there are few groups as committed to a poignant and meaningful memorial than those who will be in the closest proximity day in and day out.

Mr. Silverstein
In the days immediately after Sept. 11, Mr. Silverstein brashly declared that he would rebuild the twin towers. And he and his investors have the contractual right to rebuild what was on the site on Sept. 10. The Port Authority has interpreted that literally, saying that Mr. Silverstein's lease gives him the right to build two towers, each more than 100 stories tall. But the authority also says such a plan would be economically unfeasible. Even if a landlord could lease that much space, who would rent the top 20 floors or so? Therefore, the authority says, the lease should be renegotiated.
Westfield America, part of an Australian shopping mall company, had a more complex lease, which allowed it to increase to at least 600,000 square feet its 430,000 or so square feet of retail space at the site, including the building of at least two floors of mall space above ground on the trade center plaza.
The trade center's retail space was among the highest-grossing in the country. With plans developing for a major transportation hub stretching from the World Financial Center eastward under the site to the Fulton Street subway complex, Westfield America is unlikely to want to move from the site, and so far, aesthetic concerns about the juxtaposition of retail sites with the sacred ground around a memorial have gotten little attention.
Squaring off against Mr. Silverstein are developers who have a lot of empty office space on their hands, both downtown and across the city and region. Few of them, particularly those with downtown properties, which tend to be older and of lesser quality, are eager to see 11 million square feet of splashy new office space come on the market.

Downtown Businesses
Public officials say they want the downtown area to diversify so that it does not rely so heavily on financial services. That is happening to some degree, as financial companies move out of Lower Manhattan in search of more hospitable working conditions, better access to the suburbs and fewer problems in general.
If location is everything for a small business, proximity to the World Trade Center went overnight from being a dream to the worst kind of nightmare. Some 100,000 potential customers disappeared after Sept. 11. Businesses were shut down for days or weeks, some were looted, many were left without the support to continue or the wherewithal to conceive how to deal with the new environment. Grant and loan programs helped, but for most small businesses, only nominally so.
As the rebuilding effort proceeds, many shops and stores will come back. And, enlivened by new residents in the area and the continuing growth in businesses that feel safe enough to operate downtown, small businesses and retail stores will begin to flourish again. But if, in several years, a 600,000-square-foot mall opens, it could suck the life back out of those businesses that struggled to make it back. That is what keeps small-business owners awake at night.
Mike Wallace, the historian and author of "Gotham," the history of the city's early development, said that in scale, the current rebuilding of Lower Manhattan "doesn't even begin to approach the efforts of the New Deal era, when vast projects threw up highways, housing, hospitals, schools, docks, etc." Similarly, the regional plans of the 1920's and 1930's were far more sweeping and all-encompassing. The development of the street grid, the subway, the Robert Moses-era projects intended to put the population into their automobiles -- all required a grander effort, with more creative thinking and more political muscle, Mr. Wallace said, calling the current effort small potatoes. 
But for those who have a stake in it, the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan is seen as an effort that will decide how successful New York City is in the 21st century. As they jockey for position, one thought lingers in the back of their minds: Let's not mess it up.

HEADLINE: Talks on Kashmir Urged by Powell 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 27 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived in India today at the start of a weeklong Asian trip to shore up support for the campaign against terrorism, with his first issue the flare-up over Kashmir that has threatened war between India and Pakistan, two nations critical to the campaign. 
 As Secretary Powell landed, for his third visit to India and Pakistan since October, Indian officials promptly raised complaints about what they say is continued cross-border infiltration from Pakistan into Kashmir. 
 Secretary Powell said he would press for talks between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region, but added that the timing would be up to them and that he did not expect a breakthrough on this visit. Instead, he told reporters traveling on his plane from Washington, "I'm going to be talking to both sides about what we can do to keep the momentum going." 
Six weeks ago, Secretary Powell's deputy, Richard L. Armitage, won a pledge from Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, for a permanent halt to border crossings into Kashmir by militant groups. These incursions into the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir have brought repeated violence and led to a military buildup along the border.
Indian officials, while acknowledging that border crossings are down, maintain that the problem has not stopped altogether and say that they will not open political discussions with Pakistan until the infiltration stops. They also say they will keep their large troop presence along the border through the end of October and scheduled local elections in Kashmir this fall.
"We do not think the necessary conditions exist" for talks, the Indian foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, said as Secretary Powell arrived for a meeting this evening before conferring with other Indian officials and then heading to Pakistan to meet with General Musharraf on Sunday.
From South Asia, Secretary Powell will travel to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines, and to an international conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Brunei next week, where he is expected to win a pledge for shared financial and immigration information in the campaign against terrorism.
"All of those nations have increasingly realized that terrorism is a danger to each and every one of us," Secretary Powell said. "It's not just an American agenda. It has to be an international agenda."
In Indonesia, which is the world's most populous Muslim country and has been a somewhat reluctant partner in the effort, Secretary Powell is expected to discuss renewing American assistance after a nearly decade-long suspension over concerns about human rights abuses.
In the Philippines, where 1,000 American troops have ended a six-month stint training local soldiers in counterterrorism tactics, Secretary Powell said he expected to discuss the next round of efforts.
"But the details of that and the sequencing and the timing of all that, I would leave to Don Rumsfeld and his colleagues to work out," Secretary Powell said, referring to the defense secretary.
Secretary Powell has spent scores of hours in telephone diplomacy trying to keep the two nuclear rivals from going to war at a time when the United States is more involved in the region than it has been in decades and badly wants the cooperation of both countries in the campaign against terrorism. He is the latest in a continuing parade of international officials who have come in rotation in an effort to hold down tensions.
Today in Islamabad, the European Union's foreign policy and security chief, Javier Solana, praised General Musharraf's efforts to curtail the infiltration to date but said he hoped Pakistan would do more. "We would like him to continue taking decisions in that direction with the same courage, with the same energy and with the same determination that he has shown," Mr. Solana said. "I am sure he is going to take that."
But in an interview with CNN that was broadcast here this evening, the Indian foreign minister, Mr. Sinha, expressed disappointment at the pace of progress.
"Although there has been some decline in infiltration, infiltration continues at very significant levels," he said. "What had been promised to us was the complete and permanent stop to infiltration. It's almost six weeks now. That's not in evidence at all."
Indian officials say that infiltration by militants from Kashmir has been creeping up since last month, and that infiltrators are now crossing in smaller groups and seem to be based closer to Pakistani troops for better cover and help in crossing.
Asked en route here about the likelihood of Indian complaints about continued infiltration, Secretary Powell smiled and said: "I think I'll wait to respond until after my ear has been filled. There is constant discussion and debate as to the extent of infiltration across the Line of Control. It's not the most, it's not the easiest thing to measure, and it's hard to measure with any precision.
"I have sources of information that I'll review with the Indians," he added. "Then I will discuss all of that, of course, and receive President Musharraf's judgment when I get to Islamabad."
Secretary Powell said he would encourage both sides to back free elections in Kashmir, "and to permit an international presence, people from outside to travel to Kashmir during that period, widely and openly, to help the Indians show the international community, show the world, that it is a free, open, fair election."
Speaking briefly to reporters before his meeting with Secretary Powell, Mr. Sinha said that outsiders would be welcome on an "individual basis" at the time of the elections. But in the CNN interview, he said: "The elections will be held on time. The elections will be free, fair and hopefully peaceful. There is no reason for anyone to question the democratic credentials of India."
Secretary Powell said a resumption of direct dialogue between India and Pakistan "is going to take some additional work." He added, "We're going to have to see some more additional changes on the ground, and I will just do everything I can to begin the talks to begin the talks." 
Secretary Powell said he would also raise with General Musharraf "the continued need to be vigilant with respect to Al Qaeda activities and Taliban activities drifting over the border into Pakistan."

HEADLINE: BUSH HAILS VOTE IN HOUSE BACKING TRADE LEGISLATION 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives delivered a major victory to President Bush early this morning, narrowly voting to approve a broad trade package that gives him the authority to negotiate trade deals that he has called essential to economic growth.
 The razor-thin 215-to-212 vote came at 3:30 a.m., after a long evening of arm-twisting by Republican leaders and White House aides and hours after Mr. Bush himself made a rare appearance on Capitol Hill to lobby Republicans personally for a package that has been deadlocked for years. 
 Most Democrats supported organized labor's view that free trade is causing the loss of domestic manufacturing jobs. The vote was largely along party lines, with 27 Republicans voting against the measure and 25 Democrats supporting it. 
Representative Robin Hayes, a Republican from North Carolina, a textile state -- who provided the crucial vote last year when the House passed its original bill by just one vote -- voted no this time, with the vote tally showing that the president's victory was assured.
The vote came little more than 24 hours after House and Senate negotiators unexpectedly struck an agreement on compromise legislation late Thursday night to give the president the right to make trade deals that Congress could not change but only ratify or reject. The legislation also breaks significant new ground for workers. It creates a program of subsidized health insurance, in addition to other job training benefits for Americans who lose their jobs because of foreign competition. The measure calls for the government to pay 65 percent of the health insurance costs for such workers in the form of refundable tax credits.
With trade a highly partisan issue and with powerful crosscurrents in the House, Republican leaders refused to begin the August recess without action, fearful that the deal would become ever more difficult to pass as the elections approached and labor stepped up its pressure.
The trade negotiating authority has substantial support in the Senate, where its passage as early as next week seems nearly assured.
Mr. Bush hailed the House vote today, saying the authority would help reach trade agreements that "will open markets, expand opportunity, and create jobs for American workers and farmers."
But while the negotiating authority strengthens the White House's hand in presenting any agreement to Congress, negotiating major trade agreements remains a long and arduous process. The United States, Canada, Mexico and 31 other countries in the Western Hemisphere have been negotiating over a proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas since 1994. While a draft text of such an agreement has been published, it is full of the square brackets that indicate areas of continued dispute. The negotiating parties have declared as their goal the conclusion of an agreement by 2005, after the next presidential election.
The negotiating power Mr. Bush seeks was held by five earlier presidents but expired in 1994. President Bill Clinton never convinced Congress that the authority should be renewed, in part because of concern among Democrats that trade deals cost American jobs and lower environmental standards. Once Mr. Bush took office, the House passed trade authority by just one vote in December. The Senate later approved its version by a heftier margin, leading to negotiations that reached agreement on Thursday.
Passage was particularly sweet for Mr. Bush because he has been trying to shore up confidence in the stock market. He has argued that the trade bill will help the economy recover from last year's recession and the recent market gyrations even though the fruits of any trade deals are years away.
Another major agreement, on bankruptcy legislation, ran into an unexpected problem in the House, when anti-abortion Republicans rebelled against a provision that would prohibit people who attack or block access to abortion clinics from declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying court-ordered fines.
Short of the votes to pass the bill that would make it more difficult for consumers to declare bankruptcy to get out of paying debt, the House left for the summer without taking action, a delay that leaves the agreement's ultimate fact uncertain.
On the trade legislation, Mr. Bush, aware that the House vote would be critical to the pact, came to Capitol Hill on Friday to make his case personally to his party. But trade is always a difficult issue in the House, and even after Mr. Bush's direct intervention the outcome of the vote remained uncertain for hours. 
Senior administration officials including Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's chief trade negotiator, worked by the side of Republican officials in the Capitol trying to round up votes. The office of Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, was the nerve center of the operation, and Mr. DeLay worked the House floor right up to the final outcome.
A series of spats and rebellions from testy lawmakers who were trying to leave for a monthlong August recess added to the uncertainty. "We have what is known in Texas as a running gun fight," Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said as the outcome was still uncertain this morning.
Full-scale debate began only just before 2 a.m., with Democrats complaining bitterly about the hour. "The best time to bring up a historic bill is at 1 o'clock in the morning, to debate it until 3 in the morning," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat.
While Democrats spoke out against job losses from trade, most Republicans said the measure would bring more economic growth and lower consumer prices. "We've fallen behind in terms of trade relationships because the president has not had this power," said Representative Bill Thomas of California, who as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee negotiated the deal.
Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Republican from export-dependent Seattle, argued that the bill would "enhance our competitiveness, create jobs and help bolster our economic recovery."
But some Republicans from textile states broke ranks and joined the opposition, fearful that free trade would cost textile jobs in their districts. "You're going to put some of my people out of business," said Representative Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. 
Although the pact was praised by the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, the House Democratic leadership was working to defeat it, side by side with organized labor. Democrats who were disappointed by the agreement argued that the health care tax credits did not ensure that displaced workers would be able to afford coverage in the private health market. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, said the measure failed to "enhance human rights, reaffirm worker rights and promote environmental protection."
Although Democrats knew that some of their moderates would support the measure, they wanted at the least to keep most of their party voting against the bill as a tactic to force Republicans from vulnerable textile and steel areas, where trade is less popular, to cast a "yes" vote that could be used against them in the election. Today labor officials vowed to try to defeat certain Republicans who had rallied around Mr. Bush. John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "Working people will hold them accountable for their decision in November." 
Besides providing Mr. Bush with new trade authority and workers with assistance, the trade measure had several other provisions. It would end most tariffs on imports from Colombia and other Andean nations and cut duties on goods from poor nations working to improve human rights.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 8, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 28 about the passage of a broad trade package by the House of Representatives referred imprecisely to the timing of the vote cast by Robin Hayes, Republican of North Carolina. Mr. Hayes, who opposed the measure, had told Republican leaders several hours before that he intended to vote no, according to aides. He did not wait until the final seconds to see if the Republicans needed his support in the vote, which was 215 to 212. The congressman's office asked in mid-August for a clarification, but the request was e-mailed to a vacationing reporter.

HEADLINE: Finding a Formula for Medicare Drug Benefits 

BYLINE:  By Marilyn Moon; Marilyn Moon is an economist at The Urban Institute and the author of the forthcoming "Medicare: A Policy Guide."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The political debate over how to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare has dragged on now for more than four years. Prescription drugs have become an integral part of health care delivery, but unlike insurance for most working families, the Medicare program for older and disabled people provides almost no drug coverage. Politicians from both parties know they have to do something, but the hurdles are big: money and control.
 The debate in the Senate is still ongoing. But large differences along party lines remain, and the Republican House plan that was passed on a party line vote in June makes hopes for compromise remote given the desires of consumers for broad coverage and of drug companies for minimal government controls. 
 The sums needed are enormous; over the next 10 years, Medicare beneficiaries are expected to spend $1.8 trillion for drugs. Thus, while the Senate Republicans' top offer of $370 billion over eight years is a lot of money, it represents only a bit more than one-fifth of drug spending over that period. The Republican plans contain big gaps in coverage and allow restrictions on what drugs will be covered. Democrats offer more coverage, but at a cost of $500 billion or more.
Since all proposed plans would be voluntary, those who spend relatively little on prescriptions need to be wooed into participating with the promise of receiving some benefits. Otherwise, only high users will enroll and any program will become very expensive over time.
All the competing plans offer generous coverage above a certain level of spending for those with catastrophic expenses. The differences arise in how to treat people who spend below the catastrophic level but still spend several thousand dollars annually on drugs. The Senate Democratic proposal requires beneficiaries to pay a portion of the costs, up to $4,000 a year. Beyond that limit, all drug costs are covered. But under the House Republican plan individuals must pay 100 percent of their drug expenses between $2,000 and $5,300.
Increasingly, many people on Medicare are ending up in this middle spending range, particularly those who take one or more drugs every day for a chronic condition. Drugs for such common ailments as hypertension, high cholesterol and arthritis cost $1,200 to $1,500 a year, creating a substantial financial burden for the chronically ill.
A viable compromise is to offer comprehensive coverage for those with low incomes and catastrophic help for all other beneficiaries, an approach that seems to be gaining favor in the Senate. But this plan would still cost about $400 billion, while providing little help for most Medicare recipients with chronic illnesses.
Money accounts for only part of the differences between the two parties. A big disagreement is over how the benefit is structured -- and the precedent it sets for Medicare's future. The Democratic approach basically would have Medicare pay for drugs the way it now pays for hospital and physician benefits. Republicans want instead to have the benefit offered by private insurers. Compromise on this ideological question is especially difficult.
The Democratic approach is simpler and relies on Medicare's well-tested structure. But drug manufacturers, fearing that Medicare would impose price controls on drugs, are strongly opposed to enlarging Medicare itself to cover drugs.
Supporters of a private insurance structure argue that only competition among plans can achieve substantial control over rising prescription drug costs. But this theory has not been proved in other contexts. The private managed-care option in Medicare, for example, has raised costs to the federal government. Meanwhile, many Medicare recipients have had to suffer with plans that cut benefits or, worse, are withdrawn altogether because the companies offering them have quit the Medicare program entirely for lack of profits.
A privately administered drug benefit would be particularly problematic. If private insurers carry the risk for drug costs, they will probably structure their plans in ways that put high users of drugs at a disadvantage. For example, they can establish a list of preferred drugs (a formulary) and either not cover certain drugs or charge more for drugs that are not on the list. There are, for example, many anti-cholesterol drugs, but a formulary may not include the drug that works best for a particular patient. Consumers who need many drugs are likely to find it hard to decipher which medications the plans will cover and at what cost.
Ultimately, lawmakers and the rest of us must decide whether we trust government to deliver a new drug benefit effectively. What we do know is that the need for drug coverage is too great to let this issue remain unresolved.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Like Narcissus, executives are smitten, and undone, by their own images.

BYLINE:  By Tim Race 

 BODY:
THERE'S nothing wrong with a little self-esteem. It's grandiose delusion that causes all the trouble.
 How else to understand the case of the 78-year-old founder of Adelphia Communications, John J. Rigas, and his two sons? The three were led away in handcuffs last week by federal authorities, who accused them of "rampant self-dealing" and using Adelphia, a publicly held company, as a "personal piggy bank." If guilty as charged, the Rigases may represent yet another example of the narcissistic entitlement that permeated so many companies in recent years. 
 Few of the nation's executives now accused of fraud may have set out initially to break the law. What's more likely is that they became lost in a narcissistic fog in which they imagined that they were above the law -- that the rules no longer applied to people as grand as themselves. 
And so, if federal investigators are to be believed, we have seen narcissism on parade in a variety of costumes:
*The Rigases, the authorities say, took out loans to themselves using the company as collateral.
*Samuel D. Waksal, the socialite founder of ImClone Systems, is said to have given his friends and family stock guidance not available to hoi polloi.
*L. Dennis Kozlowski, one of the world's highest-paid executives as chief of Tyco International, had the wherewithal to spend $13 million for paintings by Renoir and others, but not the inclination to pay sales tax on them, according to the grand jury indictment.
*Scott D. Sullivan, the financial architect of WorldCom's wondrous ascent, is accused of buffing the books rather than risk tarnishing his image as a corporate wunderkind.
Narcissism isn't meant here as mere metaphor, but in the sense of the psychiatric personality disorder recognized and classified by the American Psychiatric Association. The condition is named for Narcissus, a beautiful youth in Greek mythology who fell in love with his own reflection and then pined away, not realizing the object of his fancy was a mere image. Beyond simple self-regard, the narcissistic disorder refers to a destructive pattern of thought and behavior whose traits include an unrealistic sense of one's importance and power, an excessive need for admiration and a lack of empathy for the feelings or needs of others.
Whether the Rigases or any of the other executives under indictment or investigation would clinically qualify for the narcissistic label, is beside the point: the stock bubble -- in which paper wealth created auras of power and invincibility -- seems to have bred an environment in which the narcissist who may lurk within many of us was able to emerge in feverish full bloom.
"It happens every decade; the proportion of these cases increases during times of market euphoria," observed Jay A. Conger. He is a professor at the London Business School and a widely published author on management behavior, whose 1990 article, "The Dark Side of Leadership," is widely cited in the literature of narcissism in the executive suite. (The article's case studies include the rise and fall of the charismatic entrepreneur John Z. DeLorean, whose DeLorean Motor Company's dubious books -- let the record show -- were audited by Arthur Andersen.)
Professor Conger, in an interview, said the "romance of leadership" that is common in the business world tends to put top executives on a pedestal.
"This can become a liability if the leaders begin to believe they are geniuses," he said, calling Enron a classic example. "They begin to believe they and their organizations are one-of-a-kind, that they're changing the face of industry. They desire entitlements beyond any other C.E.O.'s."
And if problems arise -- the debts mount, the revenues fall short of grandiose forecasts -- "the narcissists want to restore the image, they may do things to protect the image," he said. "And it may not be the C.E.O. who does the unethical things. It may be their subordinates, who want to protect the C.E.O. and themselves, who are in the ecosystem of narcissism."
The destructive nature of narcissism makes it "Malignant Self Love," according to Sam Vaknin, who has written a book by that title (Narcissus Publications, 1999), an overview of psychiatric narcissism. Mr. Vaknin, 41, who was born in Israel, now lives in Skopje, Macedonia, where he runs a Web site about the narcissistic personality disorder (http://samvak.tripod.com/) and is an economics correspondent for United Press International.
Mr. Vaknin's expertise stems in part from his having received a narcissistic personality diagnosis from a prison psychologist in Ramla, Israel, in 1996. Mr. Vaknin served 11 months there for engaging in stock manipulation while he was a well-known and widely celebrated director of an Israeli investment firm, Mikbatz Teshua.
In a lengthy e-mail dialogue, Mr. Vaknin declined to discuss the specifics of his own case, but he did offer his analysis of the narcissistic personality in the context of financial fraud.
"The narcissist lacks empathy -- the ability to put himself in other people's shoes," he wrote. "He does not recognize boundaries -- personal, corporate or legal."
"The narcissist regards himself as one would an expensive present: he is a gift to his company, to his family, to his neighbors, to his colleagues, to his country," Mr. Vaknin wrote, saying that such a person's sense of inflated importance and entitlement "makes him feel immune to mortal laws and somehow divinely protected and insulated from the inevitable consequences of his deeds and misdeeds."
To talk to the experts is to get the sense that narcissism is an occupational hazard of the corporate world. Ask David S. Gerson, a doctoral candidate at the University of Washington's business school, who is finishing his dissertation on narcissism in the workplace. When he first proposed the topic, Mr. Gerson recalls, his dissertation committee worried he would be unable to unearth enough examples of the grandiosely self-deluded. As it turns out, Mr. Gerson said, "it's fairly prevalent in organizations."
And while psychiatrists say that the narcissistic disorder tends to develop before or around age 4, when the afflicted may have trouble maturing beyond the me-centricism of early childhood, Mr. Gerson is among the business management researchers who argue that, in a conducive corporate culture, adults "can learn to be narcissists."
"Rather that thinking that these business people were evil to start with," Mr. Gerson says of the recent parade of rogues, "we should recognize that they were in a system that encouraged that behavior."
He, like Professor Conger, argues that because narcissism is a latent human condition that periodically flourishes, the only business antidote is oversight and accountability -- perhaps the sort of measures provided for in the corporate-conduct legislation Congress passed last week.
Of course, rules are one thing, effective enforcement quite another. It all depends on whether the narcissists are running the asylum.
Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been under fire lately from members of both political parties. But Mr. Pitt, who recently proposed a promotion and pay raise for himself even as his critics called for his resignation, has remained adamant that he is by far the best man for the job.
As Mr. Pitt put it in a recent interview with The New York Times, "it is an enormous advantage to the public to have somebody who knows about the securities business and the securities law as I do, and it would be unthinkable to deprive people of my expertise."
Monitoring this news from Skopje, Mr. Vaknin e-mailed that Mr. Pitt's was "one of the more narcissistic statements I ever came across."

HEADLINE: Technology Climate Is Gloomy, But Its Future Still Seems Bright 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Given the free fall of technology stocks and the waves of layoffs and bankruptcies lately, now might seem an odd time to say this, but it's true: the digital revolution rolls on, and it may have only just begun.
 Yes, the technology industry appears to be a place of unrelieved gloom these days. Hopes for a modest recovery later this year were probably buried for good last Thursday when the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest supplier of computer chips to other companies, delivered a surprisingly bleak outlook of weak demand for the second half of 2002. 
 Announcements come daily of companies cutting back on spending and payrolls, from struggling start-ups to industry stalwarts like Intel and I.B.M. By some measures, the slide in technology stocks since their peak in March 2000 now approaches the magnitude, in percentage terms, of the market collapse in the worst years of the Depression.
Clearly, a lot of the money, glamour and people have left the technology business. And yet, the technology itself continues to spread, in every way. 
That fact does not spell success for any particular company or justify high stock prices. But it does mean that over the long haul, the technology sector will generate more than its share of business opportunity and economic growth -- as it has since the 1960's, when computers appeared in big companies, universities and government agencies. Sure, excess capacity and price-cutting make the current business environment brutal for the producers. But not for the consumers. The numbers for the technology in use worldwide -- personal computers, cellphones, handhelds, digital cameras, DVD players, MP3 music players and households online -- all continue to grow apace.
And the expansion of the technology goes beyond digital devices. Increasingly, computer science has spilled over into other fields. Computing has helped transform everything from the way scientists plumb the mysteries of biology, chemistry and physics to the way Detroit designs cars and Hollywood makes movies. As it moves beyond traditional calculation, computer science is becoming more and more interdisciplinary, introducing the computing arts to a wider circle of people including more women.
And in good times or bad, the scientists, inventors, engineers and entrepreneurs -- the beating heart of the technology industry for decades -- are still in the game. It is such people who push the technology ahead on its uncertain but inexorable journey toward a few, often unanticipated, markets that prove to be lucrative -- despite the many inevitable failures along the way.
Dan Bricklin, 51, the co-inventor of the electronic spreadsheet nearly a quarter-century ago and still an active entrepreneur, observed last week, "The people who really have a love for this stuff -- the technology and what it can do -- never stop." 
Mr. Bricklin and Bob Frankston developed VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program, and began marketing it in 1979. VisiCalc was the first "killer app," or killer application, in the personal computer business -- an industry begun, notably, in the deep economic recession of the mid-1970's. The spreadsheet showed a practical, business use for the desktop machines. 
Over the years, Mr. Bricklin, a programmer and a graduate of the Harvard Business School, has followed his muse through a series of start-ups, mostly modest successes but some disappointments as well. In 1990, he was a founder of the Slate Corporation, which was to make software applications for pen-based computers, like those produced by Go and Apple's Newton. "The whole idea," Mr. Bricklin recalled, "was that pen computers would sell well," which they did not.
His current company, the Trellix Corporation, founded in 1995, produces and sells software that allows small businesses to build and operate their own Web sites. Its customers have included Cnet, Bizland, Terra Lycos and Thomas Register. In the last two months, Mr. Bricklin said, Trellix has seen a strong increase in business. "The Internet is a fantastic success, a force that has entered lives of regular people, and it is not going away," he said.
Venture capital investments, to be sure, are less than in the boom times of 2000. But the financing spigot is far from shut off. In the first two quarters of this year, venture investments -- mostly in information technology start-ups -- were running at a quarterly rate of about $6 billion, according to VentureWire Research, which tracks venture capital.
That level is way below the peak of $27.4 billion invested in the second quarter of 2000. But the recent rate is also 40 percent higher than at any time before the second quarter of 1999, going back more than a decade. 
Today, the fledgling companies that receive financing tend to be ones that sell useful technology that can save corporations money in basic data-processing chores like storage, security and network management. "Those companies are still doing well and getting money," said Richard Shaffer, editor in chief of VentureWire.
Softricity, a software start-up in Boston, has just received an additional $15 million in venture financing -- even though the company has adopted its technology, changed its name and overhauled its business model since it was founded in 1999. The technology grew out of software written for the Computer Museum in Boston, which distributed educational game software for children to many personal computers over a network. At the time, David Greschler, a founder of the company, was the director of exhibits at the museum.
The company retooled its technology into a service for downloading software from big Web portals, like ZD Net, and raised $22 million in the height of the dot-com bubble and called itself SoftwareWow.com. That idea soon looked doubtful, and the founders went back to the drawing board. They fine-tuned their software to make it a tool for running and managing software applications on PC's in corporate networks, and renamed the company Softricity, a utilitarian moniker, combining software and electricity.
For Mr. Greschler, the start-up experience has been an exhilarating education in the patience, persistence and flexibility required to be a technology entrepreneur. The appeal is to "take an idea you've worked on for years and try to get it over the line," he said. "We're not there yet, but we're moving in the right direction." 
The Siggraph convention in San Antonio last week provided a snapshot of both the slump and the long-term trend in technology. Attendance at the show, an annual gathering of the computer graphics community, was estimated at 20,000 to 25,000, down sharply from last year. "But the hard core is here and just as excited as it has always been," said Andy van Dam, a professor at Brown and a computer graphics pioneer.
Mr. van Dam recalled the trouble he had in 1960's when he set up a special interest committee for graphics within the association for computing machinery -- a move that led eventually to the huge Siggraph annual gatherings. Back then, he had a hard time finding 30 people to sign a petition, and the computer association was skeptical about granting committee status to computer graphics.
Today, Mr. van Dam says, a standard desktop PC, with a $200 graphics card, can render images of cinematic quality that five years ago could have been achieved only with a professional work station that might have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. "We're talking about revolutionary progress, better than Moore's Law," Mr. van Dam said, referring to the observation years ago by Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, that computer processing power doubles every 18 months. "And we're still at the beginning." 
Computer graphics is only one facet of computing, but it has become crucial to fields as diverse as crash-testing in the auto industry, molecular simulations in drug design and special effects in Hollywood. "Even the movies that are not science fiction are half digital," noted Rick Rashid, director of research at Microsoft. "Look at 'Gladiator.' You need the Roman Coliseum? You just build it digitally."
In one field after another, computing has made ever deeper and broader inroads, not just as a tool but as different approach to problem solving. Biology is perhaps the most obvious example, a discipline that moved out of the petri dish and onto the hard disk. The metaphor of human genome research is computational: humans are information processing machines, and DNA is the code that humans execute. "It's not data processing, it's a new view of biology," said Edward Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington. "And that's happening all over. Computer science is pervading all other disciplines."
That has led to a lot more interdisciplinary work, so that these days much of what people do in various fields involves computer science, even though its practitioners do not think of themselves as computer geeks -- particularly among the generation that takes PC's and the Internet as much for granted as it does light bulbs and telephones.
A case in point is Jennifer Walk, 20, who is entering her junior year as an economics and math major at Yale this fall. Ms. Walk has programmed in C, C++ and some statistical-analysis programming languages. She likes the practical problem-solving of computing -- so different, she says, from the abstract theory of math. In fact, she took a summer job at Microsoft. 
But Ms. Walk says she has no interest in becoming a computer scientist. "I can't picture myself programming 8 or 10 hours a day as a career," Ms. Walk said. "And that's how I think of it."
Some university computer science departments have begun offering interdisciplinary programs. Partly as a result, the number of woman computer science graduates is inching up, although women still represent only 19 percent of those receiving bachelor's degrees in the field.
For many of this generation, computing often shapes the way they see the world and solve problems. "They think about the world in terms of information and information processing," said Seth Lloyd, a professor at M.I.T.
Seema Ramchandani, for example, entered Brown in 1998 and pursued a traditional pre-med program. "I wanted to be a doctor all my life," she explained. But after taking one of Mr. van Dam's courses as a sophomore, she changed her mind. Ms. Ramchandani, 20, will begin a master's program in the fall that combines computer science and neuroscience, which she describes as "more a computational view of what goes on in the brain."
Her research, she explained, is endlessly fascinating. "How can something so random work so well," she observed. "The brain is just a hack."
"You and I are quatranary," Ms. Ramchandani said, referring to the four letters, designated A, G, C and T, after the chemical units in DNA.
Pointing to a notebook computer in the room, she said, "And that's binary," a reference to the 1's and 0's of computer code.

HEADLINE: A National Snapshot 

 BODY:
Every decade, by order of the United States Constitution, America counts its inhabitants and, in the process, takes a valuable snapshot of itself. The 2000 national census instantly told us that the country had grown to almost four times the size it was a century ago. Now, as the Census Bureau reveals the richer details from that counting, we can find clues about exactly how the populace has changed. 
 One out of every nine residents is now foreign-born, and we have already seen some of the responses. On the one hand, politicians from coast to coast are signing up for Spanish lessons. On the other, radio ads in still-homogeneous states somberly warn that if the borders aren't closed, Des Moines will soon look like Los Angeles or New York. While that sort of improbable paranoia is hard to worry about, the extent of the xenophobia now infecting parts of Europe is a reminder of how important it is to stand behind the concept of the United States as a nation of immigrants. 
 The census also sent warnings about a more mundane problem -- traffic. More than three-quarters of Americans drive to work, with the average commute up from 22.4 minutes in 1990 to 25.5 minutes now. Monster traffic jams have spread to monster suburbs around cities like Atlanta. At some point, as the globe warms and the icecaps melt from burning fossil fuels, this nation of commuters will be steaming too long in their cars and will begin transferring their anger where it belongs -- to Congress and the White House.
The census also shows why health care has started to rank high on every poll of voters' concerns -- the nation is growing older as the steadily wrinkling baby boomer group adjusts the nation's median age upward to 35.3 years compared with 32.9 years a decade ago. Some areas of Florida have already begun outfitting ramps and slowing down stoplights for the elderly. The rest of the nation will soon have to follow.
Many Americans reported a dramatic improvement in their income by 2000, although their sense of good fortune may have taken a beating lately. But even at the height of the economic boom, the level of poverty showed little improvement -- a sign that the rising tide had left plenty of boats on shore.

HEADLINE: With No Party to Call His Home, Golisano Bids for a Ballot Spot 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
In embarking on his third bid for governor, B. Thomas Golisano, a billionaire entrepreneur and founder of the state's Independence Party, has unleashed a campaign of lavish spending, a multipronged strategy to get a spot on the ballot and a goal apparently of frustrating Gov. George E. Pataki at every turn.
 This month the Golisano campaign began broadcasting a barrage of campaign commercials on television stations throughout the state. Despite his high visibility and his intention to spend huge sums -- he said he would put as much as $70 million of his own fortune toward the campaign -- the task remains for Mr. Golisano to find a way to get onto the November ballot. 
 For now Mr. Golisano, a Rochester businessman, appears to be immersed in several efforts to get on the ballot. Most prominently, he is taking on Mr. Pataki in the Sept. 10 primary of a highly fractured Independence Party. At the same time, he is trying to win the nomination of the state's Conservative Party through a write-in campaign. On still another front, he is pushing for an additional ballot line by trying to create yet another political party in the state. 
Although Mr. Golisano's chances of eventually winning the governor's race are widely dismissed by many political strategists, he is taken seriously for the ways in which he can be a nuisance to the two-term incumbent governor, mainly by using his vast resources to undermine Mr. Pataki's attempts to run on minor party lines.
Moreover, Mr. Golisano, a self-made billionaire who started the Rochester-based payroll services company Paychex and has been on Forbes's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, has the potential to resonate with voters on some issues. His background as a political outsider with business acumen, which he is tirelessly promoting in television ads, allows his campaign to evoke many of the themes that Michael R. Bloomberg used in his bid for New York City mayor last year.
Mr. Golisano's criticisms of the governor may also help him connect with some voters. He has contended that Mr. Pataki failed to reform education and campaign finance and that he has done nothing to stoke the economy upstate. Mr. Golisano is expected to use a good portion of his $70 million in campaign spending on ads with an anti-Pataki theme.
Mr. Golisano did not respond to several requests for an interview. But Roger Stone, his consultant, said that Mr. Golisano's message would resonate particularly well with voters in the western part of the state as well as those upstate, on Long Island and in the suburbs of New York City. He added that Mr. Golisano could easily win the Independence Party primary because of widespread discontent about taxes and the economy upstate.
"The Golisano voters are overwhelmingly middle-income people who are squeezed by the highest income, sales and property taxes in the country," Mr. Stone said.
Although Mr. Golisano has mounted what many political observers describe as an intense effort win the votes of the Independence Party's registered members, many suggest that winning the primary of a party he founded eight years ago remains a challenge for him. 
"It's clearly an uphill battle for him," said Evan Stavisky, a political consultant who works mainly with Democratic candidates. "His allies within the Independence Party have lost control of the grass-roots level, which inherently makes this an uphill battle."
The Golisano camp may face another hurdle. Not only are many registered Independence Party members unaware a a primary is scheduled, Mr. Stavisky said, but many are also not even aware that they are in the party. The number of registered Independence Party members has soared to nearly 220,000 from about 130,000 in the 1998 gubernatorial race. But Mr. Stavisky and other political strategists suggest that many people registered for the party mistakenly, believing that they were identifying themselves as "independent, and thus unaffiliated with any party."
"You have people who don't know they are in a party," Mr. Stavisky said, "and getting them to participate in a party primary is difficult." 
What is clear is that there is a political war between the Golisano and Pataki camps. Mr. Golisano's campaign has taken the unusual step of supporting two different candidates for lieutenant governor, on two different minor party lines. His choice for the Independence Party is Bill Nield. For the Conservative Party line, he is supporting Dan Mahony (no relation to J. Daniel Mahoney, the party's founder). 
Mr. Pataki's main ballot line is that of the Republican Party, where his running mate is Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue. Under state law, should Mr. Pataki appear on either the Independence or the Conservative lines with a lieutenant governor candidate other than Ms. Donohue, the votes he got on those lines would not count toward his overall total. So Mr. Golisano could fail in his attempt to get on those two party lines but by supporting his own candidates for lieutenant governor he could still deny Mr. Pataki votes on them.
"It's one of those weird quirks in the state election law that plays brilliantly into the hands of Tom Golisano," Mr. Stavisky said. "It's clearly an attempt to make life difficult for George Pataki."
But Mr. Stone said that his motivation was to allow voters in the Conservative and Independence Parties to choose their own nominees for lieutenant governor. "There is not going to be a coronation of George Pataki," Mr. Stone said. "There will be two primaries. Why does the idea of an open election terrify these Pataki people so much?"
Mr. Pataki's campaign complicated matters for Mr. Golisano last week by filing a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Rochester, charging that 15 workers hired by the Golisano campaign to collect signatures in his effort to get on a ballot line were residents of Florida, rather than New York, as required. The Pataki campaign has asked that Mr. Golisano's petition forms be invalidated.
"The law is that the signatures have to be collected by citizens of New York, and Tom Golisano didn't do that," said Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for the governor. "Nobody should be able to break the law."
Mr. Stone said that the suit is frivolous and is intended to be an annoyance by the Pataki campaign. "It's just a Republican dirty trick that is designed to intimidate voters from signing the petitions." He said that under the law, those who collect signatures need only to "work or have an office" in the area they are canvassing. 
Pataki campaign officials insist that Mr. Golisano does not pose a credible threat in the Independence Party primary nor in the general election, should he prevail in any effort to secure a ballot line. They point to the fact that in his earlier races, in 1994 and 1998, Mr. Golisano never won more than 8 percent of the vote.
"The governor has strong support among the electorate," said Kieran P. Mahoney, a senior adviser to Mr. Pataki. "And he has the same level of support among registered Independents. I think the governor is in strong shape in this primary."
Clearly, the Independence Party primary represents a potent means of gaining a spot on the November ballot, since the party members range across a broad political spectrum, from Mr. Golisano himself, a businessman, to Lenora Fulani, a neo-Marxist and former leader of the New Alliance Party.
But even the campaign for the Independence nomination is highly complicated. Mr. Golisano's support among rank-and-file Independence Party voters has apparently waned, his support at the convention shows, and his supporters have fought bitterly over party rule reform with a party faction that calls itself the "Democracy Coalition." And while he secured enough votes to earn a spot on the party's primary ballot, he got just 30 percent of the votes at the party convention. Even the party's state chairman, Frank MacKay, is supporting Mr. Pataki.
"Golisano eked out 30 percent of the vote that is weighted heavily toward the Rochester area, where Golisano is strong," said Jacqueline Salit, an Independence Party state committee member and the spokeswoman for the party in New York City. "On a one-person, one-vote basis, he would have received 18 percent."
Mr. Golisano faces a deadline in about two weeks for gathering signatures for the Conservative Party nomination. But the most promising step for Mr. Golisano may be forming yet another political party, the same method he used when he established the Independence Party eight years ago. To form a party it is necessary to secure the signatures of 15,000 registered voters in the state by mid-August.
For now, the question is what kind of turnout the Golisano and Pataki camps will achieve in the Sept. 10 primary. An Independence Party primary for attorney general four years ago drew fewer than 3,500 voters. But this year, with strong television advertising and a strong voter registration drive by both campaigns, along with interest in the fiercely competitive Democratic gubernatorial primary no one seems certain what will occur.
"It's an important primary to both campaigns, and both campaigns have a lot of money to identify who the Independence voters are," said Jerry Skurnik, a partner in Prime New York, a political consulting firm. 
"But the fact is, it's uncharted water and no one quite knows what will happen."

HEADLINE: Side Effect of Welfare Law: The No-Parent Family 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
When studies last year showed that the share of the nation's children living in single-parent households had declined in the late 1990's, many welcomed the results as signs that the 1996 welfare overhaul was working.
 But new research underscores a smaller, unwelcome trend: a rising share of children, particularly black children in cities, are turning up in no-parent households, left with relatives, friends or foster families without either their mother or their father. 
 Researchers say they cannot pinpoint the forces driving parents and children apart. But among them, they said, may be the stresses of the new welfare world -- loss of benefits, low-wage jobs at irregular hours and pressure from a new partner needed to pay the rent.
The findings are helping reopen the debate on what shifting welfare rules are doing to families. They are contributing to second thoughts among some of the most optimistic analysts, even as the White House and some lawmakers are pushing to make the welfare law's work requirements even stricter. The law now requires 50 percent of welfare recipients to work up to 30 hours a week, with some exceptions for hardship. 
One important study of census data in each state, recently presented to an audience of welfare experts at Harvard, concluded that among those most affected by the welfare changes -- black children in central cities -- the share living without their parents had more than doubled on average, to 16.1 percent from 7.5 percent, when researchers controlled for other factors.
"What we're seeing is the complex relationship between this thing we call welfare reform and the impact on families," said Wade F. Horn, the Bush administration official who oversees the welfare program. "In some cases we see positive effects on family structures, and in other cases we see more children living in no-parent families." 
Mr. Horn said new welfare demands might expose an unfit parent whose children are better off in foster care. On the other hand, he added, a West Virginia mother told to seek work in Ohio may feel obliged to leave a child behind to finish school.
"What it tells us," he said, "is that we need to do an even better job on understanding the complexities of these programs on real people."
In a support group in the Bronx, grandparents raising grandchildren spoke of the many pressures their families faced. Linda Woods, for example, finds it easy to understand how a decline in households with single mothers and a rise in children living apart from both parents could be two sides of a coin.
Ms. Woods's daughter, a sickly high school dropout who once worked in sales, supported her own daughter, China, on welfare after the girl's father abandoned them. Unable to work in exchange for benefits, she eventually qualified for Social Security disability payments and found a boyfriend with a job.
"She got married to him too quick," Ms. Woods recalled. "I tried to tell her, 'You're making a big mistake.' " Two years ago, she added, China, then 7, telephoned from her mother's home in Queens, begging to be rescued from conflicts with her stepfather.
Now Ms. Woods, 53 and retired because of ill health, is struggling to care for China without any public aid. China's mother, with a second child to support, has separated from her husband. 
Last year, analysts at the nonpartisan Urban Institute reported that the share of children in the United States living in households without their parents rose to 3.5 percent, or 2.3 million children, in 1999, from nearly 3.1 percent, or 1.8 million children, in 1997, a significant increase. 
Recently Greg Acs, an author of an upbeat Urban Institute report last year on the rise in two-adult households, titled "Honey, I'm Home," took a second look at his study's unreported results and found that among low-income children, a population more likely to be affected by welfare changes, the share living with neither parent had risen to 5.7 percent in 1999, from 4.7 percent in 1997, double the overall increase.
"If the first story is the decline in kids in single-parent households, then the next story is, where are they going?" Mr. Acs said. 
Many, if not most, he said, are living with two parents or a mother and boyfriend. But, he added, "vulnerable children in vulnerable families are increasingly likely to be in no-parent households." 
The author of another report on the increase in children in two-adult families, Wendell Primus, now says he has a more nuanced view of his findings. His optimistic take had been particularly influential because he resigned in 1996 as deputy assistant secretary of Health and Human Services to protest what he feared would be the severe impact of the welfare overhaul on children.
"An individual child is sometimes better off living with grandmother, but as a societal matter, more kids living with neither parent can't be viewed as a good thing," Mr. Primus said. 
Children who do not live with their parents do significantly worse on average than those in single-parent homes, child welfare experts say, with higher rates of school failure, mental health problems and delinquency.
Some researchers, however, are not persuaded that the upturn in such children is tied to welfare changes. The share of children living without their own parents has fluctuated in the past, with peaks linked to the crack epidemic, AIDS and recessions.
But the economists at the University of California and the Rand Corporation who analyzed the impact of welfare changes on children's living arrangements found a very strong link. Comparing Census Bureau surveys before and after different welfare changes in all 50 states throughout the 1990's, and controlling for other economic factors, they found that on average the share of black children living in cities without their parents more than doubled after the changes even as the share with an unmarried mother dropped to an average of 51 percent from 64 percent. 
The effects, researchers calculated, translate into about 200,000 more black, urban children living without a parent.
In contrast, weaker results for Hispanics more consistently fulfilled the intentions of legislators, said Hilary Hoynes, an economist and an author of the study: Hispanic mothers were more likely to be married after welfare changes, and Hispanic children somewhat less likely to live in a single-parent home but no more likely to live without their own parents.
Other researchers suggested that the contrast could partly reflect changing Hispanic immigration, higher marriage and fertility rates by recent immigrants and different cultural traditions in coping with adversity.
One lesson emerging from other recent research, said Doug Besharov, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, is that cumulative figures can mask very different, even contradictory effects for different groups and hide the impact of rules that vary from county to county.
"It's an incomplete puzzle," Mr. Besharov said. 
The life stories shared in the Bronx grandparents' group help resolve some of the seeming contradictions. 
Margaret King, 64, a retired telephone worker with custody of two of her five grandchildren, said that when her daughter lost welfare benefits, the young woman had to depend more on her children's mentally ill, drug-abusing father.
At one point, Ms. King said, after the family was evicted from their Queens apartment and placed in a temporary shelter in the Bronx, the mother became desperate to keep her welfare-to-work job at the city's Human Resources Administration in Lower Manhattan. She left three children with their father at the shelter for lack of a baby sitter, and the youngest, a brain-damaged toddler, cut himself badly on an open can while the father was sleeping off a drinking binge. The mother, who has already turned over her two older children to their grandmother, was charged with neglect and is now at risk of losing the others to foster care.
"She was always a good mother," the grandmother said. "She had no choice, and the system didn't help her."
The King family's experience was echoed in a report last month by Mathematica Policy Research Inc., a nonpartisan research organization. Its study of Iowa's stringent welfare-to-work program found that 7.2 percent of applicants randomly assigned to the program in March 1997 had a child in foster care two years later, compared with only 3.2 percent among those randomly assigned to a control group under the old welfare rules. 
Robert Lerman, a researcher at the Urban Institute known for his work on the benefits of marriage, said there was no consensus on the effects of welfare changes on family structure. He was disappointed recently himself, he said, when he sought confirmation of Mr. Primus's earlier finding that the share of black children living with married parents had jumped to 38.9 percent in 2000 from 34.8 percent in 1995. 
Looking at newly formed black families in the Urban Institute's large, nationally representative sample, Mr. Lerman instead found a drop in the share of children under a year old living with married parents, to only 26 percent in 1999, from an already low 36 percent in 1997.
Over all, Census Bureau surveys indicate that the number of people in female-headed households declined to 27.4 million in 2000, from 29.2 million in 1995, Mr. Primus said.
But, he added, the number mainly seems to reflect "doubling up and coupling up out of economic necessity, the way poor people have historically managed," a pattern that includes leaving children with relatives.
"The number is still truly astonishing," he said, "but I think the implications of this number are not as rosy as just the number would seem."

HEADLINE: Is Economic Double Dip Lurking on the Horizon? 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Only once in the last half-century, 20 years ago, has the United States suffered two recessions in quick succession. Now, the recent plunge in the stock market and a cooler economy have generated a debate about whether history will soon repeat itself.
 The most recent recession, many economists agree, ended late last year. In the first half of this year, the economy -- including housing, retail spending and industrial production -- recovered nicely. 
 But some economists are increasingly concerned about the prospect of a relapse in 2002, a "double dip" recession. 
Leading the list of fresh worries is the downturn in the stock market, which has fallen by roughly 20 percent in two months. The long slide in portfolio values could hurt consumer spending, which has been the economy's most robust support.
Volatile businesses like high technology and telecommunications, once at the vanguard of economic growth and stock gains, are also struggling.
"Although many companies had decent second-quarter earnings, outlooks came crashing down," wrote Steven M. Milunovich, a Merrill Lynch analyst, of profit reports last week from technology companies.
Dell Computer said its market was likely to remain sluggish. Intel, the leading maker of computer chips, now expects the only improvement in the third quarter to come from typical yearly buying patterns, rather than outright shifts in demand. After WorldCom's flameout, investors are questioning the solvency of some other telecommunications companies as well.
Even companies with good outlooks are having trouble raising money. There has been little more than a trickle of new stock offerings for more than a year, and short-term credit has been scarce except for the most-sound companies. Recently, long-term bond deals have also become harder to sell.
"You start monkeying around with the supply of credit, and things can change pretty quickly," said Stephen D. Slifer, the co-chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. "It's not only a stock market event anymore, it's starting to spill over into capital markets more generally."
Despite the disappearance of about $7 trillion in portfolio wealth since the stock market peaked, consumers have not cracked.
But they have certainly become more cautious. Sales of existing homes and big-ticket items like washing machines slowed in June, as consumer confidence slid markedly, according to surveys by the University of Michigan. Stories abound of lost business at restaurants and shrinking retirement portfolios.
All this is enough evidence for some economists to conclude that another recession could come soon. But others say the economy is unlikely to sag quickly into recession.
"I look at the stock market on one side and go, 'Boy, this is ugly,' " Mr. Slifer said. "And then I go, 'Wait a minute, there's nothing really happening.' "
A potent mix of low interest rates, lower taxes, high productivity growth and vanishing inflation, Mr. Slifer said, will probably propel the economy into another upswing.
But lately, the disagreement among economic forecasters about what will happen next has widened. 
For example, the team at J. P. Morgan now thinks the economy will grow by 4 percent this year after a strong second half. By contrast, Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist of Morgan Stanley, says it is likely that the economy will fall into another recession by December.
Much of the discrepancy stems from a difference of opinion over whether consumers will rein in their spending. As stocks rose in value during the last two decades, the economy was supercharged by an extra boost in consumption. On the way down, though, consumption has not deteriorated significantly -- at least not yet.
"We definitely think that there's going to be feedback from the stock market weakness back to the real economy," said William C. Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "It's hard to know if that's going to happen quickly or slowly, but it has to happen. We're not expecting a double dip, but we're definitely worried about it."
Mr. Dudley says he expects the economy to grow by about 2.4 percent this year, but he sees more risks of worse than better outcomes.
In the past, some economists estimated that as much as 5 percent of the changes in stock market wealth translated into consumers' spending. So a 20 percent drop in the stock market might generate a dip in consumption of about 1 percent, or $70 billion to $80 billion.
But a senior government economist says he thinks the amount is far smaller. "It's on the order of a few tenths of a percent off growth of G.D.P.," he said, referring to gross domestic product.
Robert J. Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University who serves on the committee monitoring the business cycle at the National Bureau of Economic Research, is also skeptical that the stock market's plunge will knock consumers seriously off their stride. He says he expects lower interest rates to encourage new spending, especially as homeowners continue to lower their monthly mortgage payments by refinancing home loans.
Refinancing gave back about $100 billion to household incomes in 2001 and could add $50 billion this year, said Robert A. Van Order, chief international economist at Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored buyer of mortgages. "Whether people refinance or not, there's been a lot of wealth created by the increase in house prices," Mr. Van Order added.
Professor Gordon, who recently refinanced his home, said that the refinancing activity could offset the negative effect of the stock market. "If you get an $80 billion loss from the stock market, and you get an $80 billion push from refinancing, it's a wash," he said.
Furthermore, much of the nation's stock market wealth is locked up in retirement funds, Professor Gordon said. Because consumers hold those funds for the long term, he reasoned, they might simply assume that stocks would gain back much, if not all, of their value in time for retirement.
It is also worth noting that the "double dip" in the early 1980's was an extraordinary event. The Federal Reserve's crusade to quell the rampant inflation of the 1970's led the economy into recession, beginning in January 1980. In March, President Jimmy Carter asked the Fed to impose emergency credit controls, which panicked consumers so much that the economy fell even more sharply. But as soon as he released the controls that summer, interest rates dropped and the economy started to recover.
Double-digit inflation resumed, and the Fed fought back by sending interest rates higher again. Without low interest rates to stimulate a recovery, the economy fell into recession in July 1981.
So there is much more to the economy than just the stock market. Just ask the men who turn the dials of economic policy in Washington. In two speaking appearances last week, Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, emphasized the strength of automobile and home sales, both hovering near record levels for months, and manufacturers' success in trimming inventories. He predicted that the economy would grow by 3 to 3.5 percent this year.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, says he thinks the economy could do even better this year. In testimony before Congress earlier this month, he talked of gains in worker productivity as a sure route to higher corporate profits and rising wages, which would lead to more spending by businesses and consumers.
Professor Gordon, once an outspoken skeptic of predictions of permanently higher productivity growth, now is a believer. "It's pretty hard to pin it down, but it looks like the trend growth of productivity has increased since 1995 from 1.4 percent to somewhere between 2 and 2.5 percent," he said. "Everybody has nudged up their estimate of that trend."
While many economists play down the risk of a double-dip recession this year, some investors still worry that the United States is in for a prolonged period of slow growth of the sort Japan experienced during the last decade.
But that turn of events is unlikely, said Richard B. Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. He noted that the American economy reallocates workers and capital much more quickly than Japan's.
"There are a lot of companies in Japan that are technically bankrupt or insolvent right now that the Japanese won't let go out of business," he said. "Correspondingly, the Japanese have not been willing to write off bad loans."
Though the collapse of stock market wealth will put a dent in the economy, he said, American companies and investors have reacted quickly to reverses. "We don't let things fester over long periods of time," Mr. Berner said.
Lower taxes, bigger federal spending and low interest rates should prevent the United States from lapsing into deflation as Japan did, he says.
Indeed, Mr. Berner said his colleague at Morgan Stanley, Mr. Roach, had still not managed to convince him that a double dip was a certainty, though he now gives it a 40 percent chance. It will be some time until the danger passes, he added.
"You're going to see the residue in this post-bubble environment," he said. "You're not going to feel safe until next year."

Adding Life and Color To a Once-Faded City

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
It seems an unlikely marriage: Peter Max, the psychedelic art phenomenon from the 1960's, and this faded river city.
 But Mr. Max, who is still going strong, has set his sights on a building here to house his creative vision, and city leaders are hoping that he will do for Poughkeepsie what the Andy Warhol Museum did for Pittsburgh. 
 As recently as the 1990's, Poughkeepsie was virtually written off. Its population had dropped by a third since mid-century. Ten people were slain in its four square miles in a single year. And Main Street, with a deserted pedestrian mall, was a listless tableau, marked by empty storefronts with dated signs. 
But within the past year, driven by surging property values across Dutchess County and a focus by the city government on revitalization, Poughkeepsie is showing not only a pulse, but actual promise.
This spring, the Mid-Hudson Children's Museum moved into an empty building on the waterfront next to Waryas Park, where the city has installed a walkway and old-fashioned lighting.
Nearby, the 1918 train station was renovated with new signs, and next to the station the Metro-North Railroad completed an $18 million parking garage, with a design that appears plucked from an Impressionest painting.
"It's the Taj Mahal of parking garages," said Robert Dooley, who is redeveloping a vacant Victorian building by the train station into offices, stores and restaurants. "It's hard to imagine that you want your building to look like a parking garage, but they made a statement there."
Another developer, Joseph A. Bonura, who owns the Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel, is working with the city to transform a 13-acre brownfield, an abandoned industrial site on the river, into a mixed-use complex to include a boutique hotel, restaurants, a catering business, office space and a marina. He said he hoped to build offices, condominiums and a restaurant on an additional 13 acres.
"There's nothing on the waterfront," said Mr. Bonura, who opened a successful restaurant last year across the Hudson River in Newburgh, another moribund city that has recently breathed new life. "Since 9/11, a lot of people are looking for office space up this way."
Clearly the sexiest development on the horizon is taking place a bit inland -- along the stretch of Main Street where the city ripped out the pedestrian mall last fall.
The old Luckey Platt department store, a wedding-cake of a building that once anchored the downtown but that has sat idle for 15 years, a symbol of the city's woes, will soon be in the hands of Mr. Max, who has reached an agreement with the city to take it over for $1.
Mr. Max said he wanted to fashion a small museum and cultural center out of the 150,000-square-foot structure. The museum would feature his own work and that of other modern artists, while the center would offer courses and forums on everything from the creative process to animal protection to the environment.
Plans also call for the building to include artists' lofts on the upper floors and a restaurant on the ground floor. "It's a wonderful structure, a tremendous blank canvas for me," said Mr. Max, whose successful studio in Manhattan employs 105 people. The project would cost in excess of $20 million to develop, he said.
Asked if he was concerned about the vacancies and depressed aura that still color the business district, Mr. Max said: "I think that will change in a minute. I have already heard that there are many people optioning sites all around the building."
Mr. Max, who owns property across the river in Woodstock, said he had been searching for a property in St. Louis to house a museum when he learned of the Luckey Platt property from a friend in Poughkeepsie. Then the mayor, Colette M. Lafuente, showed up at his door.
"The mayor came to see me at my studio," Mr. Max recalled, "and she was very, very excited and showed me a picture of a very large building and she said I could have it."
No single event set Poughkeepsie on a downward spiral. Rather, a number of forces conspired against the city: the carving up of neighborhoods to build highways; the creation of the dreary pedestrian mall; competition to local stores from regional malls; employee cutbacks by I.B.M., a major employer; and the city's decision to level charming neighborhoods and replace them with public housing.
And despite the fledgling renaissance, many problems persist. There is still no supermarket for the 29,000 residents. The median household income is $29,389, compared with $53,086 nationally. The percentage of families living below the poverty line rose to 18 percent in 2000, from 11 percent in 1990.
Still, many in this city credit Mrs. Lafuente, who lost her husband on Sept. 11, for bringing Poughkeepsie back from the brink, in part by embracing the arts.
"Colette has just been a fireball here for the city," said Chris Silva, executive director of the Bardavon 1869 Opera House, a 944-seat theater that has featured such varied artists as Patti Smith and the Moscow Ballet. "She's an incredible optimist, and it's contagious. You need that in a city like this."
The Bardavon, where Mark Twain lectured during its inaugural year, has itself experienced something of a rebirth, drawing 120,000 visitors annually, up from 40,000 in 1994. Its facade has been restored, complete with a glittering new marquis, a replica of one from the 1920's.
Besides focusing on real estate development and the arts, Mayor Lafuente and the city's Common Council have addressed crime. The city has doubled its police budget since Mayor Lafuente took office in 1996 and added 20 officers for a total of 100. There have been two murders so far this year, both drug-related -- nothing to crow about, but still an improvement over recent years.
"That has been key," she said. "People have to feel safe. I have one more year as mayor because I'm term-limited, and I keep hoping for one year without a murder."
There is another encouraging sign. People are moving in, not out: for the first time in a half century, according to the 2000 census, the population actually rose, if ever so slightly. "There's a turnaround," said James A. Marquette, the city administrator. "We have a good way to go, but it's visible. It's not just talk."

HAMPTON, COLIN CAMPBELL

 BODY:
 HAMPTON-Colin Campbell. Of Amelia Island, Florida, a former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of UNUM Corporation, parent company of UNUM Life Insurance Company, died on Wednesday, July 24, 2002, in a local hospital. Mr. Hampton died after heart surgery. He was 79. Under Mr. Hampton's chairmanship, UNUM became the first mutual life insurance company of size to "demutualize" officially converting from a mutual company to a publically owned company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In the process, the company's surplus was distributed to its policy holders in part in cash and in part in stock amounting to a total distribution of roughly $652 million. Mr. Hampton was a true visionary. From the time he became CEO in 1970, until his retirement in 1988, UNUM's assets substantially increased from $270 million to over $7 billion. Profits increased over this time period from $2.5 million to $125 million. The company gained reputation as the leading seller of Long Term Disability Income and the only insurance company with a dominant position in both Group and Individual Disability Income. Mr. Hampton was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of the late George Wellington and Jean Stewart Hampton. He graduated from Vanderbilt University, attended New York University Graduate School of Economics; received an M.B.A. from the University of Maine and an honorary Doctor of Science in Business Administration from Thomas College. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II as a First Lieutenant, receiving the European Air Medal with Oak Leaf Clusters. 
He married his college sweetheart, Marjorie Alice Brown, of Savannah, Georgia, in June 1951. Mr. Hampton first entered the investment business in 1949 in New York as a security analyst with Bankers Trust. In 1956, he joined Union Mutual Life Insurance Company in Portland, Maine, as a security analyst in the Investment Department. Mr. Hampton quickly moved up in the company, finally becoming Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in 1970. Mr. Hampton served the state of Maine in numerous ways. He was a Director and Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in the Greater Portland region, Chairman of the Maine Committee on the Judicial Responsibility and Disability, and Chairman for the Greater Portland United Way Campaign and Cumberland County Chairman for the March of Dimes. He served as co-chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's "Campaign to Remember," Maine State Campaign, raising a then record $1.3 million. He was the Maine State Chairman for the U.S. Olympics. Mr. Hampton received the Eleventh Annual Pine Tree Distinguished Citizen Award for his outstanding contribution to the community. Mr. Hampton served as a Director of Colonial Life and Accident Insurance Co., American Council of Life Insurance, Life Office Management Association, Central Maine Power Company, Key Trust Company of Maine, Peoples Heritage Bank, Maine Medical Center, Portland Boys' Club and Associated Industries of Maine. He was a senior member of the Conference Board, a Trustee of the Maine Court Facilities Authority, Westbrook College, New England College Fund, Inc., and MGI Properties, Inc. He was Chairman of the Health Insurance Association of America and for Vanderbilt University for the state of Maine. He was a member of the Portland Country Club, the Cumberland Club, the Newcomen Society, the Torch Club of Western Maine, the Cabinet of Vanderbilt University, the Amelia Island Plantation Ocean Club and St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Amelia Island.

HEADLINE: A Failure of Democracy, Not Capitalism 

BYLINE:  By Benjamin R. Barber; Benjamin R. Barber is a professor of political philosophy at the University of Maryland and the author of "Jihad vs. McWorld."

 BODY:
Congress passed sweeping legislation to reform corporate conduct and governance last week, and President Bush has pledged to sign it. A mere two months ago, the prospects for such broad reform were grim, as Congressional Republicans and the president himself favored a more limited approach.
 The new law -- among other reforms, it creates an independent oversight board for the accounting industry and curbs executive abuses like sweetheart loans -- may appear to be the reassertion of the public will over private interests. But it fails to address the deeper scandal: the real cause of spreading corporate malfeasance in America is a lack of faith in democratic institutions themselves. 
 Politicians on both sides of the aisle long insisted the scandals could be traced to a few rotten apples in an otherwise healthy barrel; a few radicals worry that the barrel itself (the capitalist system) is rotten. But business malfeasance is the consequence neither of systemic capitalist contradictions nor private sin, which are endemic to capitalism and, indeed, to humanity. It arises from a failure of the instruments of democracy, which have been weakened by three decades of market fundamentalism, privatization ideology and resentment of government.
Capitalism is not too strong; democracy is too weak. We have not grown too hubristic as producers and consumers; we have grown too timid as citizens, acquiescing to deregulation and privatization (airlines, accounting firms, banks, media conglomerates, you name it) and a growing tyranny of money over politics.
The corrosive effects of this trend are visible not only on Wall Street. The Bush administration, which favors energy production over energy conservation, has engineered a reversal of a generation of progress on environmentalism that threatens to leave the Superfund program underfunded, air-quality standards compromised and global warming unchecked. These policies can be traced directly to that proud disdain for the public realm that is common to all market fundamentalists, Republican and Democratic alike. Such attitudes represent a penchant for a go-it-alone economics that undermines the social contract and turns corporate sins into virtues of the bottom line.
Even in foreign policy, where unilateralism and the repudiation of partnerships might suggest a muscular governmental policy, there is a tendency to treat the international sector as a Hobbesian "state of nature," anarchic and disorderly, where "force and fraud are cardinal virtues" and the life of men is "nasty, brutish and short."
The United States fails to see that the international treaties it won't sign, the criminal court it will not acknowledge and the United Nations system it does not adequately support are all efforts, however compromised, at developing a new global contract to contain the chaos. The American belittlement of these efforts betrays a strategy that enhances global anarchy in the name of preserving national sovereignty. Thus the new global disorder is as incapable of constraining global crime as the deregulated domestic market is incapable of containing corporate crime.
Market fundamentalism, which defined the era of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, encourages a myth of omnipotent markets. But this is as foolish and wrong-headed as the myth of omnipotent states, which reigned from the New Deal to the Great Society. It tricks people into believing their own common power represents some bureaucrat's hegemony over them, and that buying power is the same as voting power. But consumers are not citizens, and markets cannot exercise democratic sovereignty.
The ascendant market ideology claims to free us, but it actually robs us of the civic freedom by which we control the social consequences of our private choices. We are unlikely to achieve a genuinely public and democratic plan for the World Trade Center site, for example, by polling the myriad private interests with a stake in the development of the site. Democracy is more than consumer polling. It demands the consideration not only of what individuals want (private choosing) but also of what society needs (public choosing).
The truth is that runaway capitalists, environmental know-nothings, irresponsible accountants, amoral drug runners and antimodern terrorists all flourish because we have diminished the power of the public sphere. By privatizing government functions and refusing to help create democratic institutions of global governance, America has relinquished its authority to control these forces. Within the United States, we foolishly think we possess a private liberty that allows us to work and prosper individually, not together or in conformity with a social contract. In the international realm, we seem to believe that our claim to national sovereignty allows us to operate unilaterally -- America first and foremost, not together or in conformity with a global contract.
On Sept. 11, no one looked to Bill Gates or Michael Eisner, let alone Kenneth Lay or Martha Stewart, for national leadership. On that day Americans remembered the true meaning of words like citizen and public servant and relied upon firefighters, mayors, Congress and the president. Why then today do we expect corporate executives or "market professionals" to cure the disorders of anarchic market capitalism -- which, as Theodore Roosevelt understood, responds only to democratic oversight? And how do we expect a go-it-alone superpower to depose terrorists who exploit the global interdependence America is reluctant to recognize?
These ends are public, the res publica that constitutes us as a common people. To secure them is the common task of every citizen -- as well as the principal responsibility of the president and Congress, whose problem is not that they may have once been complicit in the vices of capitalism, but that they are today insufficiently complicit in the virtues of democracy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bodyguards Buy Time for Afghan Leader 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, July 28 

 BODY:
American security guards in T-shirts and jeans, carrying large assault rifles, were prowling the president's office here this weekend. The first half dozen members of an American security force were in place to guard President Hamid Karzai, working alongside their Afghan counterparts.
 Mr. Karzai's decision last week to accept protection by American Special Forces has caused conflict. It has upset his Afghan security detail and their superiors in the Defense Ministry and brought warnings that it will resonate badly among the fiercely independent Afghan people. 
 But it has made foreign diplomats and military leaders, who are concerned about Mr. Karzai's survival, breathe more easily. It has stirred hopes among members of his administration that it signals a new assertiveness on his part to extend the writ of the central government and address the country's most pressing problems.
"There is a need for speed and decisiveness," said Hedayat Amin Arsala, a close adviser to Mr. Karzai and one of his four vice presidents. "It is important to consider all the implications, but once we take a decision, it is important we move fast and with decisiveness. I think President Karzai is doing this now." 
Mr. Karzai is at a crossroads, many here say. A month after a grand council, or loya jirga, of 1,600 representatives voted to give him a two-year term as head of state, the pressure is on him to perform.
The loya jirga, while a huge success in itself, ended with a sense of disappointment as Mr. Karzai appeared to opt for accommodation rather than confrontation with the regional strongmen and the powerful Tajik faction who had already dominated his cabinet and in fact control the Defense Ministry. 
Delegates, and particularly his own ethnic group, the Pashtuns -- the country's largest ethnic group -- left dissatisfied. They contended that Mr. Karzai had allowed the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, to be sidelined and had not taken advantage of his popular mandate to bring balance into the government.
Seven months after the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan's problems remain enormous, and the public's expectations are only becoming more pressing. Mr. Karzai's supporters say he must deliver on security and disarmament and resurrect the economy to provide jobs and reconstruction, or risk losing support.
"He got a big mandate in the loya jirga and now people are expecting him to do what would have been very difficult to do before," Mr. Arsala said.
But Mr. Karzai, determined to avoid more bloodshed, has moved slowly, even timidly. That has left at least one warlord in eastern Afghanistan openly flouting Mr. Karzai's authority, and it has led to accusations that the president himself is controlled by the powerful Tajik defense minister, Gen. Muhammad Fahim.
There are palace mutterings that the Tajik faction, and specifically General Fahim, was behind the assassination of Vice President Hajji Abdul Qadir earlier this month. The Tajiks run not only the Defense Ministry, but also the powerful intelligence service and the office of the administration.
Mr. Karzai's decision to accept the American offer security guards was in part an apparent move to break from the control, or the perceived control, of the Tajiks. "It is a clear indication of what he feels about the people around him and what they can do," said one foreign diplomat. 
The protection of American bodyguards will give the president a few months to act more firmly against those who stand in his way, in particular those who run the security and defense ministries and the warlords who still dominate the regions, an Afghan official said. 
Mr. Karzai has formed a national security council that serves as an inner cabinet and that meets daily, accelerating the decision-making process, Javier Solana, the European Union's high representative for common foreign and security policy, said during a visit to Kabul today. 
"Deep down there are more things in motion now," Mr. Solana said. "Now he is taking control," he said of the president.
Other ethnically balanced commissions are being formed to oversee crucial changes in the country's military and national security procedures and disarmament. Mr. Karzai has also dispatched ministerial delegations on fact-finding missions, one to the north of the country to investigate reports of violence against the Pashtun minority there, and four more to try to solve security problems on the main roads. 
When reports of fighting around the old Soviet air base in Shindand, in western Afghanistan, came in last Monday, Mr. Karzai halted a cabinet meeting and sent four top officials to investigate and quell the fighting. His actions have been welcomed by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Afghanistan, which has repeatedly complained about the security problems caused by armed factions. 
"For months we have waited for the government, through the presidential administration, to act," said one United Nations official. "This is the beginning of a possible new relationship between the center and the periphery." 
The official praised the strong positions taken by the commission investigating violence in the north and the cabinet's decision to act on the commission's report, in particular its call to arrest six commanders thought to be responsible for recent unrest. The new activity by the central government has been popular in the affected regions, and even the famously independent-minded governor of Herat, Ismail Khan, welcomed the attention from Kabul, a presidential spokesman said.
Yet so far the evidence of any real changes is thin, and praise of Mr. Karzai's newly exercised power may be premature. The six commanders in northern Afghanistan remain at large, and if some fighting has been quelled, the underlying power struggles involving regional warlords remain unresolved. Disarmament is going to remain extremely difficult while one faction, the Tajiks, hold sway over the defense minister, a presidential adviser said.
International supporters do not appear to be willing to provide more resources to strengthen Mr. Karzai beyond providing him with bodyguards. There is no support for extending the international security force beyond Kabul, Mr. Solana said, and the Afghan national army will take years to build.
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz admitted on a recent visit to Afghanistan that he had "no doctrine or blueprint" for tackling the problem. The American commander of coalition forces, Lt. Gen. Dan K. McNeill, has been making regular visits to regional strongmen to urge them to cooperate with the government and with the national army.
"I give them the same message, that it is in their best interest to support what is presently a legitimate government," General McNeill said last week at his headquarters in Bagram air base outside Kabul. "It is important to support Mr. Karzai, because he is the head of that legitimate government."
Members of Mr. Karzai's own administration say that in the end he will have to get tough. "He's going slowly because he doesn't want bloodshed," said a presidential spokesman, Fazel Akbar. "We want to solve the problems through negotiation. But maybe we need a little bit of dictatorship."

HEADLINE: Budgeting Now for Tomorrow 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's recent announcement that he might cut the city's work force to balance next year's budget offers a reminder that he is not running for office this year. Gov. George Pataki and the New York State legislators, who are facing the voters, have created a state budget that is built on such financial whimsy that they will almost certainly have to return to Albany after the election to face hard realities. Congress, which is heading for midterm elections, shows no signs of dealing seriously enough with Washington's big new budget deficit and the next stage of tax cuts that will only add to the federal shortfall. 
 In contrast, Mayor Bloomberg has wisely decided he wants the city to start facing the bad news now. The budget gap next year is estimated at $3.7 billion to $6 billion, and every dollar saved this summer lowers next year's bill. His first step has been to ask all of his commissioners -- including police, fire and schools -- to propose cuts of 7.5 percent. This is a large whack at what has already been advertised as an ultra-lean budget. The mayor is hoping that commissioners who now have a few months' seasoning might better recognize places to economize or positions to leave vacant. By threatening layoffs, which can be so disruptive in the city, the mayor also hopes to tame unions facing new contract talks and sustain the pressure on Albany and Washington for more financial aid. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has to take care, however, that the city doesn't slide back to its old days, with more homeless on the sidewalks, more schools without decent equipment, crime levels inching upward, litter sweeping the streets. A city that now depends so much on tourists can't afford to slow down basic services despite a frail economy and the daily fibrillations on Wall Street.
The mayor has hinted that cutting services or even workers might not be enough to balance the budget as required by law. That can only mean new revenues -- that is, tax increases -- which clearly make the most sense in this climate, if done judiciously. The commuter tax, or some similar levy on the many nonresidents who work in the city, needs to be high on his list. Property taxes or an income tax surcharge targeted for schools could follow. The mayor may be moving too slowly in the right direction, but at least he's starting early.

HEADLINE: Saying No to Free 9/11 Aid, Many Families Hire Lawyers 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
When the federal government promised last fall to compensate the relatives of victims who were killed or injured on Sept. 11, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America urged its members to join an altruistic and patriotic endeavor without precedent: offering free legal advice to the thousands of bereaved families who would be in line for billions of dollars in awards.
 "If ever there were a time when lawyers could pursue their calling for a noble purpose; if ever there were a cause that demanded our most magnificent effort as lawyers, as human beings, as Americans -- this is it," read a brochure for Trial Lawyers Care, the pro bono Sept. 11 organization set up by the national association. 
 If only doing something for free were quite so simple.
First, families of victims became frustrated by delays in assignments of the free lawyers, as the trial lawyers association encountered a shortage of local volunteers. Then, other lawyers, unpersuaded by the noble calling, began signing up families as formal clients. Now at least 500 families -- or more than a quarter of all the families who have sought legal advice -- have hired paid lawyers who could collect fees of up to 25 percent of the awards paid by the federal Victim Compensation Fund. 
On top of that, nine of New York City's biggest white-shoe firms have formed their own pro bono initiative, arguing to families that neither the free lawyers provided by the trial lawyers association nor the paid professionals are good enough. Only they, their argument goes, can be truly effective in navigating the government fund that has proven to be far more complicated than anyone had anticipated.
Not even the patriotic calls to action made months ago by the trial lawyers group have escaped barbs or backhanded compliments.
"It's very noble and beautiful of the trial lawyers association to do this, and bless their little hearts," said Guillermo A. Gleizer, a lawyer in Manhattan whose firm represents more than 100 injured victims and is charging fees of up to 25 percent. "But we represent a client in every single problem related to the Sept. 11 tragedy -- hospitalization, credit cards, mortgages -- and we want to make money. Guy works, guy gets paid. That is the American way."
And so if the idealistic impulse of Trial Lawyers Care was to cushion families from worrying about the maneuvering and motivations of lawyers, the realistic reckoning now, nearly 11 months after the attack, is that the legal landscape may be as confusing as ever -- complicated by competing lawyers and contradictory stories about who is good, who is not good or who might simply be up to no good.
For their part, officials with Trial Lawyers Care, known as T.L.C., say their bumpy beginnings are over. They have a Web site -- www.911lawhelp.org -- and they are immensely proud of how they have put together a national network of 1,200 lawyers dedicated to the largest pro bono effort in American history. But they are frustrated, too, by the cynical perception that a free lawyer is not as good as a paid one.
And do not get a T.L.C. lawyer started on the morals of colleagues who are collecting money from victims.
"It's infuriating, and frankly, I don't have much regard for them," said William L. Mauk, the former director of litigation support for T.L.C. "I think they are taking advantage of a national tragedy."
To date, only 620 families have applied to the fund, which is expected to pay each family an average of $1.5 million. But with the first awards set to be announced by Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master responsible for administering the fund, the hundreds of families who have not even chosen a lawyer may feel compelled to do so soon.
From the outset, the trial lawyers' association has praised the fund as an expeditious no-fault alternative to civil litigation by offering families awards that are guaranteed, though smaller than possible jury verdicts. And despite suspicions that the lawyers were mainly trying to polish their image, T.L.C. forged ahead, led by many lawyers who said they were motivated because of personal connections to Sept. 11.
Indeed, many families, touched by the dedication of T.L.C. lawyers, say that they would be lost without them.
"Sometimes I'm just like, thank you, thank you, thank you, because I don't know what else to say," said Leonor Ramos-Santoro, whose husband, Mario, was an emergency medical technician. Her T.L.C. lawyer is Paul A. Scrudato. "They're taking care of things that I wouldn't have a clue about. It really brings me to tears."
But T.L.C., which is expected to cost more than $1 million, has also experienced growing pains.
Recruiting enough volunteers experienced in personal injury or wrongful death cases has been hard, especially from the local area. Today, about one-fourth of all T.L.C. lawyers are from outside the New York region. 
The application process has been far more difficult than anyone expected, and subject to frequent clarifications from Mr. Feinberg. Lawyers say that a typical case requires not just a couple of hours of fill-in-the-blanks paperwork, but sometimes more than 100 hours of tricky legal work.
David Salvo, whose father, Sam, died, said that he waited several months before he even got so much as a phone call from T.L.C. Disheartened, he ultimately switched to a law firm in Chicago, Nolan Law Group, which specializes in lawsuits against airlines. It is charging its two dozen or so Sept. 11 clients a 10 percent cut of the final fund award, and up to 25 percent of any litigation award.
"It took forever, and I was getting frustrated because I wanted some help," said Mr. Salvo, who has not yet decided whether to apply to the fund or to file a lawsuit. "So I contacted Nolan, and they gave us the pros and cons of everything. They were great."
As T.L.C. struggled, some lawyers -- particularly those with aviation disaster firms -- began touting their services to the bereaved families. Many of these lawyers questioned the fund's methodology and its intentions as part of an airline industry bailout. "The dream of every defendant is that the other side doesn't have lawyers," Mr. Gleizer said. "The second best is, O.K., go to some free lawyers."
Some firms insisted that if the families chose the fund, they would be able to win bigger awards than their pro bono counterparts. In return, they said, they would collect a commission, usually 10 percent of a family's award.
The pitch is resonating. More than 200 families have turned to Kreindler & Kreindler, an aviation-disaster firm in Manhattan. About 60 have signed up with the law firm of Michel F. Baumeister. The list goes on.
"Not that T.L.C. is doing anything wrong; I applaud what they're doing," said Kenneth P. Nolan, a partner at Speiser, Krause, Nolan & Granito, which represents more than 50 families, including a few for free. "But some people don't trust the system, and they want someone who's used to fighting the system."
Some firms are also reaching out to families desperate for intangibles like familiarity or shared geography.
John D'Amato, a partner at Russo Scammardella and D'Amato in Staten Island, said he thought T.L.C. was a wonderful concept. Shortly after Sept. 11, he offered free legal help to families on estate matters. But then families began beseeching his firm, which includes Guy V. Molinari, the former Staten Island borough president, to help with the federal fund.
"There's a comfort level," he said. "I know them. I see them at the Y. I see them at Staten Island Yankee games."
But to represent all 30 or so of his clients for free would be impossible "because I would go out of business," Mr. D'Amato said. So his firm is now charging families 5 percent for the first $1 million from the federal fund, and 10 percent of any money over $1 million.
The question of whether to represent a Sept. 11 family for free, or for a fee, has produced some passionate rhetoric, not all of it nice.
Some fee-charging lawyers, for instance, say that families who choose a free lawyer get what they pay for. T.L.C., in turn, says that anyone who chooses to pay, say, 10 percent for something they can get for free is being hoodwinked. T.L.C. officials also grumble that they are doing the bulk of the trailblazing legal work in testing the boundaries of the fund.
"We're defining how the program works," Mr. Mauk said. "They're sitting on the sidelines, and they're going to piggyback on our cases."
Stepping gingerly into the middle of these two opposing forces are some prominent law firms that are helping specific groups, using different approaches.
One notable pro bono initiative, launched by the New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, features nine prominent firms, including Shearman & Sterling; Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft; Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton; and Debevoise & Plimpton. Together, they are providing a wide array of services -- in areas like immigration, financial planning and family law, in addition to help with the federal fund -- to about 70 poor union families, many of whom are illegal immigrants. Cadwalader has also produced a Sept. 11 handbook that is available at its Web site, www.cadwalader.com.
Unlike T.L.C. or the paid professionals, this group is not even seeking reimbursement for their expenses, which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars.
"This is pro bono in the truest sense of the word," said Bryan Pu-Folkes, the coalition's coordinator. 'I don't think it's possible for any law firm to provide legal services that are superior than this project because it's comprehensive and holistic."
On the other end of the economic scale, Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 658 employees, has persuaded a coterie of high-powered law firms to assist their families for a nominal fee of about one percent of any money received from the federal fund. That way, officials say, Cantor families will have legal experts in their corner who are familiar with the company's compensation history and projections.
Whether all of this legal jockeying makes any difference remains to be seen. In an interview, Mr. Feinberg, the special master, said that his position was one "of studied neutrality." But so far, he says, there has been "no appreciable difference" between the quality of the lawyers' work, paid or not paid.
Through it all, many families say that they are not sure where to turn, who to trust. Even Kristen Breitweiser, a widow who used to practice law, finds the process daunting. That is why she feels lucky that a friend who works at a major New York firm is handling her case, for free.
"It's very nerve-wracking for everyone," said Mrs. Breitweiser, whose husband, Ronald, worked at Fiduciary Trust International. "You worry about the widow with two kids who's not functioning properly, and all of a sudden she wakes up out of her fog five years later, and she's like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?' These are big, big decisions, and you just hope that they're thinking clearly and they have proper representation."

HEADLINE: Corporate Abuses Cause Bipartisan Indignation 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: ONTARIO, Calif., July 26 

 BODY:
Myra Clay went to the bank here this week and moved her retirement savings from the stock market into a fixed annuity. An unemployed quality assurance inspector, she says she worries about her future and the nation's. She is infuriated at Wall Street corporate executives and the politicians she says have protected them.
 In short, Ms. Clay is precisely the kind of voter Democratic leaders say could deliver the party control of Congress in November and the White House in 2004. 
 Except for one thing. As angry as Ms. Clay is -- she says the profiteering on Wall Street will be the first thing on her mind when she votes this November -- she says she does not think Democrats will be any tougher than Republicans in confronting corporate abuses. Ms. Clay, a Democrat, said that although Republicans might be more inclined to hoist the corporate banner, both parties were too financially indebted to Wall Street to do much about it, no matter what Democrats in Washington are saying these days. 
"I don't think either one of them is better," Ms. Clay said on the steps of the public library here in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. "And the corporate contributions have a heck of a lot to do with it."
Ms. Clay is hardly alone. In a series of interviews over two days in this sprawling community of 160,000 people about 30 miles east of the Los Angeles County line -- the kind of growing, middle-class and blue-collar exurb that often decides elections these days -- voter after voter expressed distress at what was taking place a nation away on Wall Street.
But voter after voter said that when it came to curbing abuses in corporate boardrooms, it made no difference which party was in power.
The resignation and exasperation they voiced suggested how difficult a task the Democrats face as they seek to turn the fall elections into a referendum on one dominant issue.
"It has nothing to do with party lines, it has to do with the almighty dollar," said Sue Bonetti, a retired teacher whose husband is four years away from what suddenly looks as if it could be an uneasy retirement. "What are they going to do -- cut the belt that feeds them?"
Ruby Stewart, 41, a corrections officer who was with her four daughters at the Ontario Mills mall here today, laughed when asked if it mattered which party controlled the White House and Congress.
"With who they have running?" Ms. Stewart said. "I think it would be wet and wet, to tell you the truth: no difference, no difference whatsoever. Wet and wet. You don't have anybody up there who is going to look out for the interests of the public. They are only interested in themselves."
Remarks like hers suggest that the activity on Wall Street and the frenzy in Washington to respond to it have reinforced the cynicism about politicians that Ross Perot tapped when he ran for president in 1992.
The anger and indignation were palpable and personal. More than a few people said they had watched their retirement accounts tumble with the stock market. But many added that this issue would not prompt them to vote for one party over the other. In fact, they said, they might not vote at all.
Bruce Lee, 52, a writer who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, said it was "completely irrelevant" who was in charge. "The overwhelming majority of both political parties sold out 20 years ago," Mr. Lee said. "There may be some question as to who bought them, but they have been bought."
Bob Ferguson, 75, a retired plastering contractor, echoed that point with a comment made only partly in jest. "When you buy a Republican, he stays bought," Mr. Ferguson said. "That's the difference between the two parties."
Beyond that, the interviews here reflected the conflicting opinions Americans have of their president today. Voters from both parties expressed concern about President Bush's close identification with corporate interests, and his handling of the economy. Yet almost without exception, they applauded his handling of the war on terrorism, conveying admiration for the president during this difficult time.
"When can you think of a time that a guy has been beset with more problems?" Mr. Ferguson said. "All you can do is play the hand that's dealt you, and I think he's done a good job playing a bad hand."
Mr. Ferguson, a Republican, voted for Mr. Bush in 2000, but even Charlotte Smith, 45, a Democrat who voted against him, seemed open to the idea of voting for him in 2004. "He's actually doing better than I thought he would," Ms. Smith said.
Conversely, the views offered about Al Gore, who handily defeated Mr. Bush in this state four years ago and must do so again in 2004 if he hopes to win the White House, were hardly favorable, even among Democrats. Several people expressed annoyance that Mr. Gore had kept such a low profile for so long after the Sept. 11 attacks, and some said he had relinquished any claim to be the head of the opposition or his party's leading candidate for 2004.
"I used to think Gore but I'm not sure now," said William Lopez, 50, a Democrat and an elementary school teacher, who was wearing a Bruce Springsteen T-shirt. "Maybe because after the election, he stood away -- he kept away. He kept away too long. I know he was trying to be a gracious loser, but at the same time, maybe he could have took a stronger stand on everything."
Ms. Clay, the quality assurance inspector, said she had voted for Mr. Gore in 2000 but would be inclined to vote for Mr. Bush in a rematch. "Gore gave up on me," she said. "When he lost the election, he just kind of faded in the bushes. He's weak." 
The responses on the subject of Wall Street were noteworthy because they came as the Democratic Party was maneuvering to hold the Republican Party responsible for corporate abuses. Democratic strategists who just weeks ago were gloomy about their November prospects say the corporate issue is a way to nationalize the election, in effect, giving dozens of Democratic congressional candidates a single issue to use against the Republicans.
There was, in fact, a sentiment voiced by the people interviewed that Republicans in general -- and the president in particular -- had deep ties with corporate interests, evidenced by financial contributions to the party and the number of former corporate executives in the Bush administration. "He's too associated with corporate America, oil companies," said Jerome Rinkus, a Russian language teacher. "His vice president as well."
Yet many voters suggested that business ties were not necessarily a bad thing. Many also said such connections were counterbalanced by what the Democrats have been doing in Washington. "Both are involved in taking corporate monies," said Tom Alpert, a pilot for Northwest Airlines. "And I think that if you look at the House and the Senate in either party, you're going to find that neither party is totally pure."
But in a changing political climate affected so much by international turmoil, no one was prepared to say that what was happening today would matter much in November -- much less two years from now.
"Today it's very important," said John Eubank, 65, a retired network computer engineer. "Something else might come forward in the next two years. And who will remember?"

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH/Janos Marton; 
A Protected Space, Where Art Comes Calling

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
If Dr. Janos Marton ran the world, there would be protected spaces everywhere for people with mental illness to create paintings and sculptures, drawings and lithographs, installations, murals and collages, poetry and novels, songs and symphonies.
 The abandoned buildings on the grounds of old state hospitals would be turned into sheltered workshops. 
 Warehouses in urban centers, where the mentally ill pace the streets and scrounge meals from garbage cans, would become safe harbors, working studios filled with color and form.
Delusion and hallucination, pain and sorrow, fear and manic exuberance would find their outlet in something quite simple, the creation of works of art. 
Dr. Marton's vision is hardly an idle one. At the Living Museum, housed in Building 75 of the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens, the state hospital's former main kitchen and dining areas, he is the director of just such an "art asylum," a refuge where in the 19 years since the museum opened more than 800 men and women have shed their identities as psychiatric patients and bloomed instead as artists.
Their work has been widely exhibited, most recently at the Queens Museum. Several artists have attained prominence in the world of outsider art. 
"Artists at the Living Museum don't really care about the diagnoses: they ignore labels," Dr. Marton wrote in the catalog for the Queens Museum show. "What counts is their behavior, the outcome of their labor. It's not therapy. It's art that matters."
Dr. Marton, a psychologist, was born in Hungary in 1949, the son of a dissident economist who was taken off to prison for six years on the day of his son's birth.
His generation, Dr. Marton said, grew up with the shadow of communism and the legacy of the Holocaust. "We were the children of Marx and Coca Cola, and rejecting both." 
In Vienna, where his parents moved in the 60's, he absorbed the Freudian atmosphere of that city, and in high school, he became familiar with the art work of the psychiatric patients at the Landers Clinic, a state hospital in a nearby hamlet, Maria Gugging.
The art program there occupied its own building, known as the House of Artists, and the painter Jean Dubuffet included the work of several Gugging patients in his collection of outsider art or "art brut."
After studying psychology at the University of Vienna, Dr. Marton completed a doctorate in psychology and a master's in fine arts at Columbia University and went to work as a psychologist at Creedmoor.
In 1983, Dr. Marton invited Bolek Greczynski, a Polish artist known for his work in political art and experimental theater, to join the hospital staff. Together, the two guided the transformation of an abandoned building into a place of extraordinary beauty.
Mr. Greczynski was the museum's first director. Dr. Marton took over the post in 1995, shortly after Mr. Greczynski died. Today, 70 or so artists work at the museum regularly.
In a recent interview, Dr. Marton discussed the museum's goals and the relationship between art and mental illness.

Q. A longstanding argument in psychology is about whether creative genius is in some way tied to mental illness. Do you find that there is a link?

A. There is this question of, Would van Gogh have been a great artist if he would not have been mentally ill? I think that mental illness is an asset in art. You don't have to be mentally ill to be a great artist, but you definitely have to work very hard to get to a spot where mentally ill people are automatically.
Mental illness is one of the most horrifying conditions that a person can experience. But what I'm trying to do is to see the good and the positive aspects and to build on those. If you have delusions, for example, I see it as fertile ground for great art work.
The point is that art is not going to take away your mental illness. But it builds on the symptoms of mental illness. Great art really occurs in the domain where schizophrenic processes often occur.
In the regular hospital setting, that is something they'd want to get rid of, because that's what makes you crazy, what defines you as a mental patient, what gives you the diagnosis.
But I celebrate those aspects.

Q. A psychiatrist at Gugging once said the number of truly gifted artists among the mentally ill was about the same as among other people, that is, very, very small. Do you agree?

A. I think that the idea of talent is overrated. The traditional definition of art and what is good art and what is valuable art went out of the window with Marcel Duchamp. I am a fan of Gugging, but they are much more conservative. We pay homage to Andy Warhol's Factory, to Duchamp. We are much more applied modern art, conceptual art.

Q.You have said that the Living Museum is about art and not about therapy. And you don't do traditional art therapy here, where the paintings or drawings are interpreted and talked about in terms of the patient's life. But at the same time, the experience of working here has a tremendous impact. Could you talk about the transformation that takes place for many patients?

A. The self-definition of the mental patient is an incredibly self-destructive one, because of the societal scorn and because you are stripped of every other aspect of your humanity. You cease to be a tailor or a journalist or a mother or a soccer player, and whatever identity you have is all reduced to that of a mental patient. You become "the other."
And that has self-esteem issues, and this internalized self-concept is more destructive than even societal discrimination.
But then suddenly you think of yourself as a painter, as a poet. You can, realistically, too, because the Living Museum provides you with a realistic framework to do that. You exhibit. People come to see your work. Suddenly, the disadvantage of your existence, which is time and boredom and waiting -- that's the reality of mental illness, endless waiting, endless emptiness, endless void -- suddenly turns into an asset: "Oh my God, I have time to paint!"

Q. Are there any rules for patients who come to work at the museum?

A. The dialectic of rules is, of course, that the more rules you have the more controlling you have to be. So in a way, we have no rules here, because this demand for no rules creates no need for rules.
Most mentally ill people are oversocialized by the time I get my hands on them. They have been told over and over again to do this, to do that, not to do this, not to do that. So in a way, pointing out rules doesn't help. 
And second, which is that the rules are really self-imposed rules. If you own the place, when it's yours, if you set your own rules, you work along internalized rules. And it has worked fantastically. Nothing negative ever happened here.

Q. How is the Living Museum organized?

A. You have a collective going here that is based on need, and not on democracy or equity. It is more like a family structure, that people get what they need and not what they deserve.
An example is that if you are needy and more in a psychotic state, then I give you more attention. I help you more with your materials. I give you more space. You get better treatment. You get maybe an extra amount of nice herbal tea and you get a sweeter spot, even though you misbehave, because you are not doing well. And if you are doing well and on top of the day, you get neglected more.

Q. Doesn't rewarding illness with greater attention encourage people to stay sick?

A. People don't get sick because of lack of attention. That's one of the big problems, that mentally ill people are often treated like bad children. They are approached in a moralistic way, and it doesn't work. People don't misbehave in a mentally ill way because they are bad. It's a brain disease. Their problem comes from above. They're not responsible. There is such a thing that the illness takes over.
In the mental health system, people are often scolded for having what's called "poor activities of daily living," that you're messy, you stink, you neglect your hygiene. But in reality, it is connected more to your lack of medication than to your behavior. Once the medication stabilizes you, then your hygiene improves.

Q. You have talked about the need for more art centers or "asylums" like the Living Museum. How would this work?

A. Right now there is a lot of real estate being taken away from the mentally ill. For example, state hospitals are closing down, and these are gigantic real estate complexes that are being sold off or given away and basically being taken away from the mentally ill people of the state. And so there is a lot of real estate to be had that could be used for art asylums.
These are not art therapy programs. The practical distinction would be that instead of therapists you would need artists to run these places.
The idea of an asylum goes back to the idea of integration versus segregation. The old asylums were in the context of segregation. Creedmoor was built far away from urban centers. It was difficult to get to. And the idea was to separate people.
It was ultimately, of course, a discriminatory idea. However, once you were there, it was a different matter. The mental patients were running the place. They were working. So you had better food, because Creedmoor has fantastic soil. You could grow things.
You were among similar people, so you did not have this constant fear of being rejected and measuring yourself against others. You felt comfortable among your own, which had many positive aspects for people. It is similar to all-girl schools. They are not determined so much by the male energy.

Q. How does the concept of asylum relate to art?

A. Great art is created in asylums. An asylum per se means protection. And protection is needed for the mentally ill. The pressure of the outside world is tremendous. We still don't have a cure for mental illness.
If you look at the situation of people with mental illness, in general in the world and specifically in New York, it is in need of reform, to put it mildly. It is in a crisis. Ask yourself the question, "Would I want my mentally ill child to be in any of the situations that are available for him or her currently where you live such as adult homes or the street?"
Creedmoor is a five-star hotel compared to what is going on mostly.
Art asylums would create a kind of social gentrification like what happens in urban gentrification. Artists move into dilapidated areas like SoHo or TriBeCa, and over a period of a decade that area gets gentrified.
Only artists will put up with a lack of water, a lack of heat, a lack of elevators.
I'm thinking of using artists to gentrify the social sphere. These places can be a cultural center for the whole society. And only artists have the discipline to put in that much energy and work hours to create something like you have at the Living Museum.
And people with mental illness have a special role in my mind. If you've heard voices, there is a certain experience that emerges, a certain truth, and the art can be the vehicle to communicate this to the world.

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
In Argentina, Struggling To Survive A Depression

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 23 

 BODY:
"The Marriage of Figaro" has been performed many times at the venerable Teatro Colon, but the premiere of the latest production last month came with a twist that reflected the hard times here. Because the collapse of the Argentine economy in December has meant periodic shortages of paper, no program was available for the opera's opening night.
 "Neither you nor the artists nor I deserve this," Emilio Basaldua, the Colon's artistic director, told the crowd that evening. Audiences at later performances have been getting a program, but one whose production cost is one-quarter that of the past; it is made of coarser paper, with six photos of performers to the page, rather than two. 
 As Argentina struggles to survive a four-year economic calamity that in statistical terms is now the equivalent of the Great Depression in the United States, the impact on the nation's cultural life is felt in every way and at every level. Cultural producers are not only scrambling to try to do more with less, they are being forced to rethink the role, function and nature of culture in Argentine society. 
The easiest way to measure the crisis in the arts is in terms of opportunities lost and events canceled. Popular music artists ranging from Rod Stewart to the jazz guitarist Mike Stern have called off shows here, for example, and the sparkling new Buenos Aires Museum of Latin American Art has had to cancel a pair of major exhibitions, one featuring works by Roy Lichtenstein and the other Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo.
"Those shows were extremely expensive and had to be suspended because they were beyond our operating and financial capacity," said Marcelo Pacheco, who became director of the museum in June after his predecessor resigned. "I'm not averse to high-impact shows, but not if they consume two or three years' worth of my budget."
But the situation here is even more complicated. In the words of Marcos Aguinis, a prominent author and a former culture minister, "the paradox of Argentina today is that in spite of the crisis, culture continues to resist, and that even without money you continue to have expositions, conferences and other activities."
So while bookstores are closing, sales at the recent Buenos Aires book fair were up by 25 percent over last year. Corporate sponsors for arts events have dried up, but the employees of an abandoned plastics factory have turned it into a cultural center offering plays and tango shows. And though 20 percent of the nation's 155 cultural magazines have ceased publication, traditional folk music forms like murgas and candombe are reviving. "In times of extreme crisis such as this, people have a greater inclination to participate and to do things that establish an identity," argued Jorge Telerman, the culture secretary for the city of Buenos Aires. There is a feeling here, he added, that since "our culture is the only thing left to us, we can't afford to lose it."
Since its opening nearly a century ago, the Teatro Colon has been Argentina's symbol of culture. But to keep the theater's programs running since Mr. Basaldua took over as artistic director last October, "one month before the country exploded," as he put it, he has had to confront situations that would be unimaginable to directors of similar institutions in other countries.
In late April the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill opera "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny" was being presented, precisely because "Buenos Aires was the city in the real world that most resembled Mahagonny at that time," Mr. Basaldua said. But the government had just ordered all banks closed indefinitely, no money was available anywhere, and the Colon ended up simply throwing its doors open to the public and offering the last performance free.
A month earlier, demonstrators had broken into the theater and disrupted a show, responding to rumors that President Eduardo Duhalde and an elite group of the rich and the powerful decked out in jewels and furs were in attendance. In reality the theater was offering a concert at discount prices intended to attract middle-class patrons who might otherwise no longer be able to afford tickets.
The Colon's plans for the rest of this season remain unchanged, including a production of Alban Berg's "Wozzeck" at an abandoned factory. With the value of the peso having dropped from parity with the dollar to as low as four to the dollar, Mr. Basaldua said his problem is not this year's program but next year's.
"How can you possibly negotiate contracts when you don't know how much a peso is really worth?" he asked. "We are working from day to day."
At the moment Mr. Telerman is confronting a similar problem for the same reason. He received $10 million just before the collapse for the expansion of the Museum of Modern Art, but now finds that construction companies refuse to make bids on the project because they do not know when or how they will be paid.
Buenos Aires remains one of the few Latin American cities close to fulfilling Unesco's recommendation that 5 percent of government budgets be directed to culture. But that spending is now way down in dollar terms as a result of the devaluation: from $145 million to $34 million for the city, Mr. Telerman said, and $45 million to $10 million at the Colon.
The "immense distance between the reality of the crisis and the image of Buenos Aires as a city under siege," hasn't helped either, Mr. Pacheco said. Museums abroad have become more cautious about lending works following Sept. 11, and street disturbances earlier this year, which have largely ended, made Argentina appear dangerous and drove insurance rates beyond the country's ability to pay.
With it difficult to attract or afford foreign artists, some of the gap has been made up by Argentine artists living abroad who want to help. Daniel Barenboim, for instance, agreed to perform the complete cycle of Beethoven's sonatas at the Teatro Colon from July 27 to Aug. 10 for "a fee that is symbolic, a fraction of what he could be earning elsewhere," as Mr. Basaldua put it.
"The money is not the important factor for me in this case," Mr. Barenboim said in a telephone interview from Germany. "This has to do with the fact that I was born there, that both my parents were born there, that I still have relatives and friends there, that I went to the Colon often as a child and that my first musical memories are there."
Hoping to increase revenues, the Colon has stepped up efforts to rent out its opera sets, and has recently done so to companies in Brazil and Spain. It has also opened its doors to popular music artists like the Argentine rock star Gustavo Cerati, who performed recently with the National Philharmonic Orchestra in a show that dismayed some traditionalists but drew widespread critical praise. The Colon's management has also taken advantage of the crisis to revise generous labor contracts negotiated in 1978. The Colon remains "an island of artistic perfection in a country in ruins," said Pablo Batalla, the theater's financial director, who also argues that political stability and artistic quality are not directly related. "The best of Greek classical theater was performed when the gates of Athens were about to burn," he said. The crisis also appears to have had the beneficial effect of forcing a new realism on Argentina's intellectuals and cultural elite. Many illusions have had to be discarded, the most pernicious of which may have been that Argentina had more in common culturally and politically with Italy or Spain than with neighboring countries.
"Argentina, and Buenos Aires in particular, has always felt it was expelled from Europe and obliged to be anchored in Latin America," Mr. Pacheco said. "But that fiction, and the image we constructed of a country that wanted to be what it was not, cannot be sustained any more. Now, for better or worse, we are forced to be interested in the place that we are really a part of."

HEADLINE: Implacable Force for Family Planning 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
What a moment for an American to take over the world's largest family planning organization.
 "We're completely at odds with Bush policy," said Dr. Steven W. Sinding, who becomes director general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London this month. 
 Because the federation's agenda includes access to abortion, it receives no American money for any of its programs in more than 180 countries. Yet this is a time when millions of people in the third world are clamoring for more contraceptives and health workers are short of condoms to fight the spread of AIDS. 
On July 22, the administration also ended American support for the United Nations Populations Fund, citing its activities in China, where birth control has been coercive. On that issue, the White House overrode the State Department, which had sent experts to China to look at the fund's programs and found no evidence that American money had been funneled to such programs. 
"At a moment when in some ways the priority is shifting from birth control to disease control," Dr. Sinding said, "it's devastating that the resources are not available to these organizations that are the primary channels of service to women in the developing world." 
In Africa, and possibly Asia, more women than men are being infected with the virus that causes AIDS. 
Dr. Sinding, 58, has many credentials, including posts as former head of the population office of the United States Agency for International Development, senior population adviser to the World Bank, director of population sciences at the Rockefeller Fund and, most recently, professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. He learned the basics at the grass roots in Pakistan, the Philippines and Kenya.
He is ready for a fight, after seeing population programs under renewed assault from Washington. He sees a chance to make noise at the international federation, which works in concert with voluntary national organizations like the Planned Parenthood Association of the United States. Dr. Sinding wants to rekindle the fire of the federation's founders in 1952, among them family-planning pioneers like Margaret Sanger.
"I'm determined to move I.P.P.F. back to that brave and angry posture on issues that are today's most difficult and controversial, because I think that to some extent it's lost its pioneering spirit," Dr. Sinding said in an interview in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan as his wife, Monica Knorr, a geriatric-care expert, packed to move. "Since I.P.P.F. doesn't receive any money from the United States, there's no penalty associated with speaking out on those issues that the United States is being so recalcitrant on." 
In the United States, Dr. Sinding said, reproductive health and choice have become entangled in a culture war irrelevant to global realities. The Reagan-era ban on money to any organization that even counsels abortion was continued through the first Bush administration, then lifted by President Bill Clinton, only to be reinstated as the second Bush administration took office. The issue has become a partisan battleground. 
"The saddest thing is that this domestic political debate has such a profound impact around the world," Dr. Sinding said. "Women suffer deeply." 
Pregnancy is the leading cause of death among girls ages 15 to 19 in poor countries, many of them child brides forced into arranged marriages or children trafficked in the sex trade. 
"There will always be unwanted pregnancies, especially among women in poverty, and women so young that their pelvises are not yet formed to the point where they can safely deliver a child," he said.
About girls 14, 15 or 16 forced into sex, he said, "to condemn them to bear a child that may very well cause them to die is just morally indefensible."
Administration officials say the $34 million that Congress allocated for the United Nations will not be wasted but will be put to good use through A.I.D.
"We program more than $400 million in family-planning right now in more than 64 countries," Dr. Anne Peterson, assistant administrator of the Bureau of Global Health, said. "The $34 million is a significant amount of money, and it could go in a number of different countries and be programmed fairly easily."
Dr. Peterson said it would not be hard to find nongovernmental organizations willing to accept American restrictions on any involvement with abortion or abortion rights. 
"In many of these countries," she said, "that's where their own country and culture is on the abortion issue. And so they're very comfortable that we also have our funding that has that restriction on it."
Before heading to London, Dr. Sinding had collected a few wounds from service on the front line of the culture war. In 1984, when the Reagan administration suddenly announced at a United Nations conference in Mexico City that it was ending family-planning aid to countries and organizations that were involved in abortions, Dr. Sinding was running population policy for A.I.D.
"The Mexico City policy came out of the blue," he said. "It caught the State Department totally unawares. The senior population person at State resigned over this issue. The White House basically took control, which was most unusual."
State Department and aid officials were stunned by the severity of the policy.
"It basically said two things," Dr. Sinding said. "We categorically oppose abortion and we're going to defund any foreign nongovernmental organization that does it, even with its own money. And we don't think as a government that population is all that big a problem.
"Until Reagan, there was a bipartisan consensus. If anything, there was more Republican support than Democratic support for population funds. It was based on a belief that there was both a national security and an international development rationale for dealing with population. That consensus was broken in the 1980's. Population became a highly partisan issue -- and has remained so ever since."

HEADLINE: British Judge Splits Ruling On Suit by Cantor Fitzgerald 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 29 

 BODY:
A British High Court judge handed down a split ruling today in a bitter dispute of the rival bond brokerage firms Cantor Fitzgerald and Icap, backing Cantor's accusations that Icap unlawfully poached one broker after the firm lost 658 employees in the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
 But the judge, Richard McCombe, dismissed complaints by Cantor that Icap, which is based in London, illicitly lured two other brokers from Cantor's London offices. Mr. McCombe also cast doubt on suggestions that Icap's activities represented part of a deliberate attempt to weaken its rival after Sept. 11, as Cantor had initially argued. All three of the traders hired away from Cantor by Icap were London interest rates swaps traders. 
 While the attack on the World Trade Center "provided the backdrop to what happened," the judge said, "the events of Sept. 11 did not have an immediate or direct effect upon the business of the department of Cantor with which I am concerned." Indeed, the ruling seemed to support accusations by two former Cantor brokers, Ed Bird and Spencer Gill, that they were "constructively dismissed," a legal term meaning that Cantor forced them to quit by bullying and what Icap called "inappropriate behavior at the hands of Cantor's management."
Mr. Bird, for example, said a senior manager once wiped spittle on his face.
Only in the case of the broker Luigi Boucher did Judge McCombe rule that Icap had offered an "unlawful inducement" to persuade Mr. Boucher to breach his contract with Cantor. The judge granted an injunction preventing Boucher from starting work at Icap for several months. A Cantor spokesman called the ruling a victory.
The case offered a mirror-image of a lawsuit in 1999, when Cantor was found guilty of poaching about 20 employees from Intercapital Debt Trading, now part of Icap. At that time Cantor was ordered by a London court to pay damages then worth about $1.7 million.
Judge McCombe said damages against Icap in the latest case may be awarded in September. The High Court will also determine costs and consider any appeal by Icap, he said.
The case has been closely followed here because of Cantor's attempt to link the charges to Sept. 11. When the case opened in June, Andrew Hillier, a lawyer for Cantor, said Icap had "embarked on a systematic and carefully planned attempt to poach" leading brokers from Cantor's interest rates division. Cantor had been suing both Icap and the three brokers, who all claimed constructive dismissal.
The two companies compete as intermediaries executing bond, currency and other trades for investment banks.
The London case also raised eyebrows with an inside look into what was depicted as a decadent lifestyle among brokers and traders in the City -- London's equivalent of Wall Street -- with frequent visit to lap-dance and strip clubs.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
Untangling Muddy Waters and His Blues

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES

 BODY:
CAN'T BE SATISFIED
The Life and Times of Muddy Waters
By Robert Gordon
Illustrated. 408 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $22.95.
 The story of Muddy Waters is the archetypal path of the blues. McKinley Morganfield was born in Mississippi in 1913 and picked cotton on a Mississippi Delta plantation, where he was nicknamed after the river itself. He sang at fish fries and juke joints and was recorded on the plantation for the Library of Congress. He moved north to Chicago, where he plugged in his guitar and led a band that transformed the sound of the deep rural blues for urban audiences, making music full of pain and pride, menace and lust. 
 He became the "Hoochie-Coochie Man," the "Mannish Boy"; he boasted "Got My Mojo Working." Waters was discovered in turn by homesick Southerners, by radio listeners, by well-meaning folkies and by rock musicians who would blast his songs to a worldwide audience. He was exploited, misused, revived and eventually revered before his death in 1983.
Robert Gordon, a writer and filmmaker who has devoted himself to music from Memphis and points south, seeks out the details behind the archetype in "Can't Be Satisfied." Working through the tangles of a largely oral history, Mr. Gordon has retraced itineraries, sorted through conflicting memories and given credit to undervalued figures like John Work III, the musicologist who helped the folklorist Alan Lomax find Waters on the Stovall Plantation and record him in 1941. 
Waters had already been working his way around the Delta as a musician. He resettled in Chicago in 1943, and in 1947 he began recording for Chess Records, which would be his label until 1975. Though Waters's band was driving club audiences wild, Chess waited years to record Waters with that band rather than other, more old-fashioned lineups. Waters had hits in the early 1950's, but his blues was pushed off the charts by rock 'n' roll. Mr. Gordon, with obvious exasperation, shows how Chess kept trying to remake Waters to fit perceived trends: as a "folk singer," with "The Muddy Waters Twist," with horn sections, amid a psychedelic hubbub, and, more sensibly, with younger English and American blues-rockers. 
The label's accounting practices were hazy at best. While blues-rock bands were playing his songs in arenas, the illiterate Waters was persuaded to sign over the copyrights to Arc Music, Chess's publishing company. Eventually Waters and his manager retrieved them after a lawsuit, and Waters left Chess to revitalize his music and career by restoring his unvarnished Delta attack.
Mr. Gordon's extensive research is tucked into endnotes that give alternate versions of incidents and add some irresistible anecdotes. The biography itself moves briskly, pausing every so often to explain the economics of cotton or to reclaim the startling power of Waters's music when it was made.
A version of "Rollin' and Tumblin' " from 1950 "is little more than a harmonica, a bass drum in overdrive, an occasionally ferocious slide guitar and the orgiastic humming of several grown men," Mr. Gordon writes. "The sounds are pugilistic and sexual. Someone yelps. Someone else responds. The randomness of the interjections is frightening, the rapid-fire drumming disorienting. Muddy's slide rings like loose spokes on an iron wheel, haywire. The harp is hypnotic. Chant and hum, chant and hum. Violence hangs everywhere, the sex heated and raw." 
The music, as Mr. Gordon calmly documents, came from a milieu straight out of gangsta rap: guns, booze, knife fights, fast women and sleazy deals. Waters was a lifelong womanizer who met his last wife, Marva Jean Brooks, when she was 19 and he was over 60. He had at least six children, most illegitimate; mistresses and a daughter were lost to drugs. One former band member was sentenced to life in prison for murder. The pianist Otis Spann, a vital part of Mr. Waters's groundbreaking 1950's band, drank hard and was dead at 39.
Waters's indomitable voice, the lyrics to songs like "Rollin' Stone" (which named a band), and the slash and quiver of his guitar playing hinted at all he had seen. But he revealed little of himself offstage, even in interviews. Mr. Gordon faces an enigmatic and inconsistent character he can track but not quite animate. 
Waters could be as stubborn as the unchanging Delta core of his music, but he could also be disappointingly complaisant, as he was through his years at Chess. Mr. Gordon concludes that Waters carried with him not just the sounds of the Delta cotton fields, but the mentality of the sharecropper who was perpetually indebted to the plantation owner for the "furnish," the supplies and necessities to get through the season that were charged against his share. In an interview that Mr. Gordon cites, Waters said, "It was just, 'I belongs to the Chess family.' " 
That passivity has little connection to Waters's music. His songs are grounded in pride and fierce virility. Mr. Gordon's sharp and comprehensive biography can only accept the paradoxes, recognizing Waters's failings while giving full respect to his mojo.

HEADLINE: Festivals, Festivals Everywhere; 
Summer Arts Events Multiply, Testing Limits of Growth

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
They began innocently enough, as high-minded diversions on warm summer nights shared with mosquitoes and lake breezes. But this summer the number of arts festivals nationwide has reached an all-time high of about 3,000, drawing an audience estimated at up to 130 million and accounting, by industry estimates, for close to $2 billion in spending. 
 With the number of arts festivals nearly doubling, by some accounts, since the mid-90's, the festivals have changed the ways Americans consume culture. 
 "Culture has become a destination," said Kate Maguire, executive director of the Berkshire Theater Festival, whose alumni include Eva Le Gallienne, Buster Keaton and Katharine Hepburn. 
Increasingly, she said, people are planning their summers around arts calendars and becoming more discerning, making greater demands on festivals like hers. "It's no longer, 'Let's put on a play in two weeks,' " she said. "A lot of avant-garde work is being done." 
This year more than ever, from the culture-gridlocked Berkshires to Lincoln Center, Charleston, Santa Fe and points in between and beyond, summer festivals of music, theater, dance, film and the visual arts are springing up with particular abandon. 
In some places, the festivals are crowding each other to the point that some arts managers feel they are competing for audiences and artists. But by and large, the managers say that the multitude of offerings provides a critical mass for an explosion of cultural tourism. 
"It's the mall effect," said Paul Kellogg, director of the New York City Opera and of the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., one of the leading opera festivals, founded in 1975. "The summer population will go to an area where there are three evening performances rather than one."
Arts festivals alone account for close to $2 billion a year in spending, not counting art purchases and lodging revenue, according to Jim Shanklin, founder of RSL Interactive, a Seattle marketing services company focused on the arts and a developer of festival Web sites. That does not include about 2,000 more folkish arts and crafts festivals and another 20,000 novelty and other festivals not related to art.
From the Lake Chelan Bach festival in Lake Chelan, Wash., to the New York City Tap Dance Festival on 42nd Street to innumerable Shakespeare festivals, the proliferation has been in all directions. But opera, in particular, seems to breed opera.
"People who like it tend to go to a lot of it," said William Florescu, general director of the Lake George Opera, who shares his audiences with Glimmerglass, the Berkshire Opera in Great Barrington, Mass., and the Saratoga Performing Arts Festival. 
When pressed, some arts directors acknowledge feeling the squeeze of summer competition for audiences and artists. The Opera Theater of St. Louis, which recently completed its 27th season of staging innovative works in an annual May-to-June festival, suffered a dip in single-ticket sales it attributed to a free Shakespeare festival that started last year.
The field is definitely growing more crowded, said Charles MacKay, the general director. 
"When we go to engage singers, we have overlapping dates with Glimmerglass or Santa Fe," he said. Artists juggle offers from the Utah Festival Opera, the Opera Festival of New Jersey, the Des Moines Metropolitan Opera, the Lake George Opera, the Cincinnati Opera and others.
So, Mr. MacKay said, St. Louis has sought to mix traditional crowd pleasers with unusual works that offer opera fans the chance "to put another notch in their belts." The season's four offerings included the world premiere of Cary John Franklin's "Loss of Eden," about the Lindberghs and the Hauptmanns, and a rare staging of Ambroise Thomas's 1868 romantic "Hamlet," and they drew ticket buyers from 42 states and five foreign countries. 
The recently concluded Lincoln Center Festival, now in its seventh season, adopted a similar offbeat and avant-gardish approach, presenting the American premiere of "Ta'ziyeh," an Iranian musical epic based on the battle between the prophet Muhammad's grandson, Imam Hussein, and Caliph Yazid on the Kerbala desert in A.D. 680.
"I get calls all the time" from advice seekers wanting to put on festivals, said Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival and another of the nation's more prestigious arts festivals, the Spoleto festival in Charleston, S.C. "Send out your five-year plan. Then they see it's so overwhelming many never call back."
The Virginia Arts Festival adopted another tactic to differentiate itself when it pitched its tents in eight Southeast waterfront communities six years ago. It set its season from the end of April to the end of May, before other festivals get going. That, said the artistic director, Robert W. Cross, put it at an initial disadvantage because traveling artists tended to wrap up their tours before the Easter lull and stayed home until the summer season. 
But capitalizing on the tourism lure of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia Beach and Norfolk, the festival gained a quick foothold, this year drawing about 70,000 visitors to performances by the Dance Theater of Harlem, Mark Morris, a collaborative "Romeo and Juliet" with Shakespeare & Company in the Berkshires and the Buffalo Philharmonic, and a giant tattoo of military bands and drill teams. Almost one in four visitors came from out of the area, double the percentage when the festival began. 
Summer arts festivals have been around for ages, most prominently in Europe, where Bayreuth, the Salzburg Festival, the Casals Festival, Documenta and many others have long been fixtures. 
In the United States, the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Ill., originating as an amusement park in 1904 to boost ridership on the railroad, became one of the nation's first outdoor classical music meccas and has been the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra since 1936. The Tanglewood Music Festival just outside Stockbridge, Mass., has been the summer home of the Boston Symphony since 1937 and now attracts some 250,000 patrons a season. Jacob's Pillow, the pre-eminent summer dance festival, in Becket, Mass., was founded by Ted Shawn in 1933, and the Berkshire Theater Festival, now in its 74th season in Stockbridge, began life in a playhouse converted from a casino built by Stanford White in 1888.
The postwar years brought a proliferation of festivals, including the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954, but according to Mr. Shanklin of RSL Interactive the field began really booming as a commercial sector in the mid-1980's.
The International Festivals and Events Association, founded in 1957 and based in Boise, Idaho, counts some 3,300 members -- almost triple the number in 1995 -- from the Kentucky Derby Festival and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to the Barbecue Goat Cook-Off in Brady, Tex. Since the University of Illinois at Urbana created the first curriculum in special events management and marketing in 1990, seven other universities have followed suit with undergraduate and advanced programs. There are also annual prizes for creativity in festival organizing, called the Pinnacle Awards. 
The vast majority of festivals have little to do with the arts, but the arts sector has also been growing rapidly, the group's records suggest.
Although comparative data is hard to come by, one veteran manager, Joseph Lillis, executive director of the 50-year-old Sausalito Arts Festival in California, said he believed that the number of arts festivals might have doubled in the past 10 years. An industry Web site, www.Festivals.com, which opened in 1995 listing three events -- Thanksgiving parades in New York, Philadelphia and Detroit -- now tracks 40,000 festivals of all kinds, and the number has been growing by about 1,000 a month. The list includes almost 5,000 arts festivals in the United States, broken down by category: arts and crafts, 2,074; dance, 369; film, 817; fine arts, 511; literature, 679; and theater 505. Another Web site, www.festivalfinder.com, lists hundreds of music festivals by date, location and type of music, from a starlight concert series in Kennesaw, Ga., to an international accordion celebration in Leavenworth, Wash., to a guitar festival in Buffalo to countless easy-to-mount chamber music festivals. 
The lure for communities is not hard to fathom. Even free festivals nourish the local economy. Mr. Lillis in Sausalito said his 60,000 patrons spend an average of $17 each, bringing in more than $1 million, plus gate receipts of $600,000. Thanks to that kind of success, the festival recently built a park and gave it to the city.
For a microcosm of the arts festival world, perhaps nothing can match the Berkshires, with some 65 nonprofit arts groups. "We've done Shakespeare & Company, Jacob's Pillow and now this," said Katie Daily, lunching with two friends from Manhattan on a blanket at Tanglewood one recent Sunday during a chamber music recital.
The night before, Garrison Keillor and his "Prairie Home Companion" held forth on the same manicured lawns. "I live in Minnesota," a bleary-eyed Mr. Keillor said the next day. "We're not a festive people. We're a cautious people. We have small festivals, 20, 25 people in our backyard." 
At the Berkshire Theater Festival, meanwhile, Guy Pellegrinelli of Pittsfield, Mass., turned out with his wife, Mary, for the Kander and Ebb musical "Zorba," in the main theater. "There's a certain element of friendliness that comes with the warm weather," Mr. Pellegrinelli said.
Ms. Maguire, who usually greets guests from the stage before performances, said the mix was carefully thought out. In addition to "Zorba" that weekend, there was a swing-era adaptation of "The Magic Flute" for a younger audience at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield and a performance of "Dimetos" by Athol Fugard in the more experimental Unicorn Theater.
"There's no competition; the community wants it all -- dance, theater, music," she said.

HEADLINE: Stoking a Stock Market 'Revolution' 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 29 

 BODY:
Raymundo Magliano, the chairman of the Bovespa, Latin America's mightiest stock market, heaved a sigh as he checked the monitor perched on his elegant antique desk one afternoon early this month and summed up the state of Brazil's markets by spelling out a Portuguese word: C-A-O-S.
 Ten floors below, on the exchange's trading floor, chaos indeed reigned as the Bovespa index registered yet another day of losses. 
 Even before global markets were plunged into their current turmoil, many Brazilian blue-chip companies had listed their shares in New York; because a tax in Brazil made trading in New York much cheaper, much of Bovespa's trading volume went with them. Many local investors, meanwhile, have stayed away from the Bovespa because years of high interest rates to keep inflation under control and defend the Brazilian currency have made a simple bank deposit a safer and often more lucrative bet. The recent accounting scandals involving some of America's top corporate names also have not helped. 
So it may seem a strange time to be making a pitch to spread "people's capitalism" through share ownership across Brazil and push for fresh policies to reverse nearly five years of capital flight to New York markets, but that is just what Mr. Magliano is doing.
"What we want to do is transform the Bovespa into a market for all," he said. Mr. Magliano, 60, an exuberant former broker, took over as Bovespa chairman in January 2001.
"We are revolutionaries, and we are going to spark a cultural revolution."
Given the current economic climate -- and with only about 2 percent of Brazilians owning stocks, compared with roughly half of American adults -- he is going to need a lot of revolutionary fervor.
While Brazilian stocks climbed slightly today, the Bovespa index is down 31 percent so far this year. The currency, the real, is slumping, today sinking to its lowest level since it was introduced in 1994, to 3.2 for for every United States dollar. The country's benchmark C-bond has also taken a hammering. The only thing that seems to be rising is Brazil's country risk -- the premium the country must pay over United States Treasuries to raise cash on capital markets. 
The latest market crisis in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, was set off by fallout from Argentina's collapse. It is built on fears that Brazil may have to reschedule or even default on its own hefty $250 billion public debt, and on growing concern on Wall Street that Luiz Inacio da Silva, the presidential candidate of the left-wing Workers' Party, could triumph in the elections on Oct. 6.
So far, by doggedly lobbying the government, staging headline-grabbing events including a one-day bourse strike to protest a crippling 0.38 percent tax on financial transactions and hiring actors to stage shows on how to invest in the market at union-sponsored Brazilian Labor Day celebrations this spring, Mr. Magliano has managed to chalk up some victories.
Starting this month, stock transactions are exempt from a tax that is levied on everything from cash withdrawals to checks, known as the C.P.M.F. tax, which had made Bovespa's transaction costs as much as 165 percent higher than that of the New York Stock Exchange. Congress has passed a new corporate law strengthening minority shareholders' rights. And the Bovespa recently started a bourse called the Novo Mercado, modeled on the Neuer Markt in Germany, to increase liquidity and provide smaller Brazilian companies with an alternative source of money.
There is much debate, however, about whether these moves are enough to stop what even Mr. Magliano acknowledges is serious decay.
In 1997, Bovespa's daily average trading volume was around $1 billion, about the same as Toronto's exchange. Today, it has an average volume of $200 million, less than one-sixth of Toronto's. About 40 percent of investors have migrated to American depository receipts of blue-chip Brazilian companies. In the last year, 13 Sao Paulo brokerage firms have closed.
"The major companies no longer participate" in significant volume "on the local market, and the smaller companies that do are left with a bourse that has no liquidity," said Eduardo da Rocha Azevedo, the Bovespa president for two stints in the 1980's, who now runs the Sao Paulo brokerage firm Convencao. "This is the Brazilian model, and it's all wrong."
Mr. Azevedo blames the center-right government of the president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, which is generally seen as market-friendly. A combination of the C.P.M.F. tax and the failure to promote popular capitalism during Brazil's huge privatization program sapped Brazilian capital markets, Mr. Azevedo said.
A base interest rate stuck at 18 percent to defend the real and keep a lid on inflation has also driven investors away from stocks and toward fixed-rate investments, further draining Bovespa's liquidity and discouraging smaller companies from coming to the market to raise capital. So far, only two companies have listed on the Novo Mercado since it opened in February.
"Today, it's better to sell your assets, put the money in the bank and stay at home watching TV," Mr. Azevedo said.
As the Bovespa has slid, an increasing number of market players have demonized the New York Stock Exchange, accusing it of stealing away Brazilian listings. Last year, the appearance of the finance minister, Pedro Malan, at the exchange for a ceremony promoting listed Brazilian companies spurred the Bovespa traders' strike and the push for the C.P.M.F. tax exemption.
But Roberto Castello Branco, head of investor relations at the Brazilian mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, which lists on both the Bovespa and the New York Stock Exchange, said that since listing in New York raised the profile of Brazilian companies, it should also raise investor interest in Bovespa.
"It's not a zero-sum game," Mr. Castello Branco said. Besides, he said, "a company that is a global player like ours has an obligation to list in New York or London." 
While most analysts say that Mr. Magliano's campaign is headed in the right direction, they also say that a more concerted effort will be needed from the next government to revive Bovespa.
The changes thus far "are necessary and welcome," said Fernando Exel, president of the financial consultant Economatica in Sao Paulo, "but they're not going to generate business overnight."
Mr. Magliano says the recent oversubscription of a local offering of shares of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce held by the Brazilian government is proof that his efforts to get ordinary Brazilians to invest in stocks will pay off, if investors are given the right incentives.
The government allowed workers to use some of their social security deposits, and some 800,000 workers signed up, nearly three-times oversubscribing a 1 billion reais ($334 million) offering.
Under a similar plan, some 370,000 workers subscribed to an offering of the state oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras. Mr. Magliano predicts strong interest for the coming sale of shares in Banco do Brasil.

HEADLINE: Easing Palestine's Humanitarian Crisis 

BYLINE:  By Peter Hansen; Peter Hansen is commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

DATELINE: GAZA CITY, Gaza 

 BODY:
A consensus has emerged in the Middle East, among people of otherwise widely divergent views, on one point: something must be done for ordinary families in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They face a crisis of such dimensions that it threatens everyone in the region.
 On July 16, Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister, telephoned Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, to ask for an international effort to help the Palestinian people. Last Wednesday Daniel Kurtzer, the American ambassador in Israel, calling the situation in the territories "a humanitarian disaster," urged Israel to lift travel restrictions on Palestinians. And on Friday the New York Times reported on an ongoing study by the United States Agency for International Development that has found dramatically increased malnutrition and anemia among Palestinian children. By Sunday, Prime Minister Sharon had announced an easing of travel and other restrictions and had named Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to coordinate relief of Palestinians.The United Nations hopes these decisions will be swiftly implemented in such a way that they make a substantive difference to ordinary Palestinians. 
 Mr. Sharon's phone call came on a day when Mr. Annan was meeting in New York with his colleagues in the Quartet -- Secretary of State Colin Powell, Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, and Javier Solana, the European Union's high representative. They agreed that full humanitarian access would be the fastest way to begin improving the Palestinians' plight, and that the United Nations should lead the humanitarian effort.
The United Nations already has the largest humanitarian operation on the ground in the Middle East, with 10,500 staff in the West Bank and Gaza alone: the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Since 1950, UNRWA has catered to the basic health, education and welfare needs of refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and their descendants -- some of whom still live in so-called refugee camps, which are townships of two- and three-story buildings, while many others are scattered across the region.
Since September 2000, the agency has also been trying to lessen the humanitarian impact of violence, curfews and closures on the refugees in the West Bank and Gaza. It has massively increased its provision of food aid: whereas before the strife such aid went to 11,000 refugee families, it is now targeting almost 220,000 families. As the Palestinian economy has stagnated, the demands on agency resources have soared.
Israel has long understood that the relief agency's work is an important factor in the stability of the large Palestinian population on its doorstep. In 1967, when it took control of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel asked the agency to continue its work there -- a responsibility that, without the agency, would have fallen on Israel's shoulders. More recently, in November 2001, the Israeli delegate to the United Nations General Assembly expressed Israel's "appreciation for the efforts of UNRWA in providing important services, especially in the fields of health care and education."
Despite such statements, there have been attacks on the agency by some commentators in Israel and America alleging, wrongly, that the relief agency is not part of the solution to the violence in the region, but is part of the problem.
The agency faces many difficulties in serving such a highly politicized population, even though it does not police or administer the refugee camps (where one third of refugees live). The agency is committed to ensuring that its installations remain free of militant activity and demands that its 22,000 staff members -- 99 per cent of whom are Palestinian refugees -- do not allow their political beliefs to interfere with their duties. These efforts have brought attacks from Arab commentators (and some in the agency's staff union) claiming that the agency suppresses freedom of speech.
However, in an environment as polarized as the Middle East, the agency would soon loseall credibility if it allowed its commitment to the norms of justice to be diluted by a fear of criticism, regardless of where it might come from.
The agency is working with its donors to tackle some of the difficulties created by the political landscape. For several years it has produced school materials promoting tolerance, nonviolent conflict resolution and human rights. The agency plans to expand this program with further financial support from the United States, which has long been the most generous funder of Palestinian refugee relief. Such support and understanding from the international community is vital if the relief and works agency is to continue to operate apolitically in a politically polarized region -- and to relieve the desperate situation of Palestinian refugees.

HEADLINE: ON THE GROUND: In Seattle; 
Old Economy Still Vital In High-Technology City

BYLINE:  By LYNN ELSEY 

 BODY:
High technology, with Microsoft at the helm, has put Seattle on the map. Still, lumber and agriculture formed the city's industrial backbone, and the old economy continues to play an important role in the Puget Sound area. The retailers Nordstrom and Costco are here, as are the insurance giant Safeco (which has acquired naming rights to the home of the Seattle Mariners, Safeco Field) and, of course, Starbucks and its ubiquitous coffee houses.
 The wobbly American economy has not spared Seattle. The jobless rate, which hovered around 3.3 percent in the late 1990's, has doubled since then, and the once robust housing market has weakened. Boeing's decision to move its world headquarters to Chicago last year cost the area 13,800 jobs, to say nothing of a measure of Seattle's pride. On the other hand, Amazon recently reported quarterly results that were slightly better than expected. 

HOTELS
The Renaissance style FOUR SEASONS OLYMPIC (206-621-1700, from $295) provides all the expected five-star amenities, including high-speed Internet access, a health club that will lend you running shoes and transportation in the hotel's Mercedes S Class house car. The hotel's stately lobby is popular for informal business meetings.
With its arty atmosphere, the ALEXIS HOTEL (206-624-4844, from $295) reflects the hotel's proximity to Seattle's creative-arts district, although guests are as likely to be corporate lawyers as advertising types.
For those on a tight budget, the MAYFLOWER PARK HOTEL (206-623-8700, from $135) is small enough to be personal but large enough to offer 24-hour concierge service and a small exercise room. It is centrally located and an easy walk to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center.
The BELLEVUE CLUB HOTEL (425-454-4424, from $230) is a brief cab ride to Microsoft headquarters as well as the offices of dozens of smaller companies in Seattle's high-technology sphere. Laptops seem de rigueur in the lobby, and the hotel offers free broadband access, cordless phones in all rooms and a technical-support hot line.

DINING OUT
Chuck Stonecipher, president of Advanced Digital Information, says he can't remember the last time anybody at his company went out for a traditional business lunch. "When our suppliers or customers visit, we work over sandwiches that are brought in," he said, adding, "On the rare occasion that we do something more formal, we tend to go to restaurants with good local seafood," like RAY'S BOATHOUSE (206-789-3770, $135 for dinner for two with wine and tip) or the THIRD FLOOR FISH CAFE (425-822-3553, $146) in Kirkland.
Downtown, fish gets a serious steakhouse treatment at the OCEANAIRE SEAFOOD ROOM (206-267-2277, $145). The menu features huge portions of seafood favorites like Alaskan halibut cheeks along with old-fashioned comforts like relish trays, creamed corn and asparagus with Hollandaise sauce; diehard steakophiles can always order the filet mignon.
At ANDALUCA (206-382-6999, $100), the "great glass plates, interesting food and a reasonably priced Spanish wine list" get a thumbs up from Karen Johnson, senior vice president for corporate development at Metro One Telecommunications in Portland.
Recent renovations have toned down its brocaded stiffness, but the GEORGIAN ROOM ($130) in the Four Seasons Olympic retains an air of hushed formality and is considered one of Seattle's most impressive dining experiences. The menu is light, offering reasonably priced contemporary Northwest cuisine.
Jayne Lipe, president of JLipe Consulting, says her favorite place to take clients is BIS ON MAIN (425-455-2033, $95) in Bellevue. "The food and wine are absolutely delicious, service is excellent, and the atmosphere is quiet enough for a good discussion," she said.

NIGHT LIFE
The METROPOLITAN GRILL (206-624-3287), a traditional brass and green-leather place, is a popular spot for business travelers as well as local entrepreneurs; its walls are lined with photos of athletes and well-known business executives who have enjoyed the high-octane Martini and cigar-enhanced atmosphere.
Wine aficionados head to CASCADIA (206-448-8884) for the wine list and live piano music or to BRASA'S bar (206-728-4220) for Mediterranean warmth and celebrity sighting. But the city's best entertainment is found on the field at the Mariner's new ball park, within walking distance of downtown.

ON YOUR OWN
Washington State is the country's second-largest producer of premium wines after California, and several wineries on the dry eastern side of the Cascade Range, including CHATEAU ST. MICHELLE (425-415-3633) in Woodinville and HEDGES CELLARS (425-391-6056) in Issaquah offer tours and wine tastings daily.
SEATTLE SEAPLANES (206-329-9638) offers 20-minute flights with views of the city and its landmarks, including the Space Needle, the Elliott Bay waterfront and the homes of the rich and famous along Lake Washington.
If you visit the Seattle Center (home of the Space Needle), be sure to mosey over to the Experience Music Project, Paul Allen's interactive ode to rock 'n' roll. Opened in 2000 with as much fanfare for the building's unusual architecture and vividly colored stainless steel and aluminum walls as the opportunity for the general public to partake in high-end karaoke, it is often rented by corporations for parties and other events.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Sprite tries to increase sales with a campaign about thirsts.

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
IN an attempt to re-engage young consumers, Sprite, the lemon-lime soft drink sold by the Coca-Cola Company, is taking another new turn in a campaign that emphasizes individual passions -- or thirsts -- through the stories of real young people.
 The campaign, which began last night, is tied to several promotions and is the latest attempt by Sprite to turnaround sales and market share that declined in 2001 for the second consecutive year. Sprite spent more than $75 million on advertising last year, according to CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 This is the first effort for Sprite from its new agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. The campaign, titled "Portraits in Thirst," replaces the "Voices" campaign created by the longtime Sprite agency, Lowe & Partners Worldwide in New York. That campaign showed teenagers using rap or rhyme to express their interpretations of attributes that Sprite suggested, like "crisp," "not too sweet" and "absolutely clear." 
Though it sticks with the "Obey your thirst" theme that was used in "Voices" and that dates to 1994, the new campaign invites a different response by asking a question: "What's your thirst?"
Last year, Coca-Cola shifted the Sprite assignment to Ogilvy after more than 15 years of working with Lowe, part of the Partnership unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and predecessor agencies. Before the "Voices" campaign, previous Sprite advertising from Lowe had relied on light humor through parodies of marketing efforts.
The recent campaign did not stem declines in sales volume and market share, according to John D. Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest in Bedford Hills, N.Y. Last year, Sprite sales were down 1.8 percent, and market share declined one-tenth of a percentage point. That came after a slow 2000, in which Sprite sales were down 2 percent, and market share declined two-tenths of a percentage point.
"Sprite was one of the three top carbonated soft-drink growth brands during most of the 1990's," Mr. Sicher said. "It has run into some growth problems in recent years."
He cited three factors. "One is, as a light, clear beverage it's being affected by the dramatic growth in bottled water," Mr. Sicher said. "Second, it has needed some aggressive promotion and new advertising for some time. Third, it has not had any product innovation such as Mountain Dew, Coke and Pepsi have."
To address the disappointing statistics, the new ads go beyond previous efforts to relate to young people, ages 12 to 24, by offering unusual but trendy tales. In the spots, Mike Lopez, a low-rider bicycle builder, and Rikkia Mills, a female drag-race-car driver, who were found through interviews with teenagers and executives in industries like music publishing, are shown in urban settings with hip background music from Jurassic 5 and the Donnas, respectively. They explain their own thirsts: Mike's is "style," which he expresses through building low-rider bicycles. Rikkia's is "speed," which she shows through her drag-race car driving.
"There's been a fundamental shift in the consumer landscape," said Darryl Cobbin, vice president and brand director for Sprite in Atlanta. "We think young people had a bit more cynicism two or three years ago."
"This campaign is a bit more optimistic, broader in range and it also begins to take us into different passion points for young people," he added.
The concept is rooted in the television commercials, which will include appearances on BET, Fox, MTV, TBS and WB, but will extend to promotional events where young people can explore and develop their own.
"What Ogilvy has been able to bring to us is this notion of integrated marketing with a capital 'M,' " Mr. Cobbin said. "When we talk with them about a new campaign, they do not approach us with a series of executions exclusively. They come back to us with ideas that will go across different mediums that will accomplish our different communications objectives."
One promotion will be the Liquid Mix Tour, a 15-city concert festival beginning in mid-August that will include music, street sports, artistic demonstrations and fashion. The line-up includes the rapper Jay-Z and the alternative rock group 311. 
Another element will be a contest in conjunction with Def Jam Recordings in which young people can win a Sprite cap or a three-day clinic to learn about the hip-hop music business from executives at Def Jam Recordings.
Consumers can have further "experiences" with the pursuit of their own thirsts at the Sprite Web site, Sprite.com. In addition to viewing more vignettes about Mike and Rikkia, they will be able to create their own portraits based on their specific interests.
"The role of television is obviously in its mass reaches very important, but if you look at the life of the audience we're trying to reach, they don't spend their days in front of the television," said Scott Flood, senior partner and worldwide managing director on the Coca-Cola business at Ogilvy. "They're spending an increasing amount of time, as we all know, online. They're interested in and are engaging in events."

HEADLINE: A Grim Choice In Westchester: Harsh Cutbacks Or Higher Taxes 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, July 29 

 BODY:
The Westchester County budget director, Kathleen M. Carrano, recently laid out some of the options for county officials trying to close a $102-million budget gap in the coming year. 
 Lay off 402 employees and cut 58 vacancies. 
 Eliminate 914 day care slots for low-income families.
Close seven parks and four pools. 
Raise bus fares by $2 a ticket, and golf fees by $3 a round.
By the end of the exercise, those cutbacks and others accounted for only $65 million in county expenses -- leaving another $37 million to go. "We've been through these times before," she said. "They're painful, and they're difficult, and we always come through. But it will be a very different government than before."
This summer, it seems that just about everyone has been afflicted by budget woes, from the family next door to the lawmakers in Washington. Even prosperous counties like Westchester are finding themselves running short of money, though for the most part, financial analysts say they are still in better shape than Nassau County and other places with chronic fiscal problems. 
Last week, the Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, warned that the county might be forced to cut programs and services drastically, or raise the property tax levy by 29 percent or higher. Alternatively, he has called for a 1 percent increase in the sales tax that would collect an extra $100 million a year, of which $75 million would pay for increased costs for Medicaid and other state-mandated programs. 
"I'm not very happy about it," Mr. Spano said. "If this was something we caused, I would take responsibility and say, 'I did a bad job.' But that is not the case at all."
Across the New York region, local governments say they are being squeezed on one side by the escalating costs of Medicaid and other mandated programs, and on the other, by declining revenues and investment returns. In particular, the tremendous growth in sales tax revenues in recent years has slowed as consumers shop more frugally.
"Counties are at a crisis point," said Robert R. Gregory, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, which has unsuccessfully lobbied state legislators to limit the counties' expenses for Medicaid as a way to relieve some of the financial pressure. "They can no longer absorb the cost of the Medicaid program locally." 
State officials said they had already provided millions of dollars in additional state money to county governments, and taken other steps to help them pay for state-mandated programs. "As we move forward, we will continue our efforts to assist county governments, keeping in mind that the state faces its own unprecedented fiscal challenges as a result of 9/11 and the national economic downtown," said Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the New York State Division of the Budget. 
Faced with these realities, a growing number of counties are seeking to plug their budget holes by raising sales and property taxes. Since January, a half-dozen counties have received approval from the State Legislature for a sales tax increase. Rockland County leaders, for instance, raised the sales tax by 0.62 percent to 7.87 percent in March to collect an additional $14 million for this year's budget. 
In Westchester, officials depleted $36 million this year from a $40 million reserve fund that was started in 1999. They had hoped to replace the money with new revenue from a 1 percent increase in the sales tax, but so far, Mr. Spano and other county officials have been unable to win support for the proposed increase from state legislators. 
Westchester currently has a 6.75 percent sales tax, one of the lowest in the state. Exceptions are the citties of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains and Yonkers, whose combination of local, state, and county taxes range from 7.75 to 8.25 percent.
Since state legislators ended their session earlier this month, any approval for a sales tax increase would be unlikely before the Westchester budget process begins in November. So Mr. Spano, a Democrat who once pledged to reduce property taxes, said that he had to consider other options, including a 29-percent increase in the property tax levy -- one of the largest in county history.
Next year, the county's budget is expected to grow by $79.9 million to $1.37 billion, a 6.2 percent increase. More than two thirds of that increase, $54.9 million, would be used for Medicaid and an educational program for handicapped children. The rest would cover rising costs for the state pension system, public transit, the county jail, and other services, Ms. Carrano said. 
Meanwhile, the county's revenues from sales tax revenue, investments and the tobacco settlement are declining. Based on midyear figures, county officials have lowered this year's sales tax projection to $257 million, $2.1 million less than the previous year.
Westchester's budget crisis has already prompted county legislators to crunch numbers months earlier than usual, and citizens groups to mobilize against tax increases of any kind. County leaders raised the property tax levy this year by 3.8 percent, the first increase since Mr. Spano took office in 1998.
County Legislator Clinton I. Young Jr., the Democratic majority leader, said he would not support any proposal for a "double-digit" property tax increase. "No one wants to see services cut or jobs lost, but what alternatives are there?" he asked. "It is unconscionable to raise property taxes by 29 percent."
Kelly Jones, president of the Taxpayers' Alliance of New York, a Westchester citizens group, said that county officials should take this opportunity to evaluate "what is essential, what is not so essential, and what is just nice to have" and make broad cuts. "The county overspends because it's addicted to taxes," he said. "If they are saying things are that bad, then where are the drastic solutions?"

HEADLINE: These Colors Don't Run, But They Droop; 
Bodegas and Their Awnings Are Both Looking Tired

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
The streets of a city all have a signature of their own, a one-of-a-kind mark fashioned by front stoops and storefronts and the sights, shapes and smells of each wave of immigrants who come to chase after their dreams. 
 In vast swaths of New York, the street signatures have accent marks -- the red-and-yellow metal awnings that hang like droopy eyelids over thousands of Latino-owned grocery stores, called bodegas. The origins of the red-and-yellow bodega awnings and their near-universal application are something of an urban mystery. But it is no secret that the awnings are now disappearing from the city's streetscape, victims of tough times and changing tastes. 
 Red-and-yellow awnings were once a potent symbol of the raw economic and cultural potential of Hispanics -- now the largest minority group in the city -- who arrived in New York with their own language and their own brash, noisy vision of how city life is supposed to be lived. 
The awnings were the height of modernity in the 1970's, the next step after the 19th-century canvas awnings that greengrocers hand-cranked to shield their vegetables from the sun. At a time homeowners across America were turning to siding as a protective miracle, that the awnings were aluminum and plastic was a mark of modernism. Overnight, or so it seemed, the red-and-yellow awnings were everywhere in Latino neighborhoods. 
Thousands of red-and-yellow awnings still hang over the bodega entrances, but most are dingy and bent, lost in a sea of brighter, bolder, bigger signs for the barbershops, fried chicken places, nail salons and electronics stores all around them. 
Today's bodega owners say they would like to join the other businesses and install the newer-style awnings that would make them look modern and successful. But how can they rationalize the expense, they say, when bodegas, even with their long hours, have tortilla-thin profit margins? 
"As a business right now, bodegas have become very competitive and it is difficult for owners to make it," said Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz, director of the Program of Economic Policy Management at Columbia University. Korean delis continue to spring up around them, and supermarkets all over the city now offer Latin foods at cheaper prices. 
Bodega owners say that if they stand for anything, the old awnings have come to represent a struggle to survive that the bodegueros, often originally from the Dominican Republic, seem to be losing.
"Bodegas mean only one thing," said Jose William Garcia, a 39-year-old Dominican who has owned the Colmado Lopez, a grocery at Broadway and 161st Street, for 18 years, "mucho trabajo y poco dinero": much work and little money. 
Some bodega operators even suspect that the awnings may have played some part in limiting their economic potential. 
"The universal way the same red and yellow were applied all over New York really shows a lack of creativity on our part," said Teodoro Ventura, 58, an associate owner of a bodega at St. Nicholas Avenue and 191st Street in Washington Heights. 
Mr. Ventura, who worked for the Dominican government as a regional director of agricultural development before coming to the United States more than 10 years ago, said the uniform awnings made the bodegas seem as if they belonged to a chain run by and for Dominicans. 
"That meant we were exclusive -- just for Dominicans -- when we should have tried to be inclusive, open to everyone," Mr. Ventura said. "What we have done is keep ourselves on the margins of society." 
Hispanic immigrants longed for a taste of home almost from the moment they arrived in the United States. They quickly found their way to bodegas, because they once were the only places to buy plantains, yucca or cassava bread. More than that, they served as informal meeting rooms, places to chat in Spanish, trade gossip from home and, when money was tight, to buy milk and coffee on credit. 
Nearly every bodega is owned individually, for independence is what drives men like Mr. Garcia, the bodega owner on Broadway, to spend nearly half their lives behind the counter. 
Attempts to create a strong federation of bodega owners in New York have stumbled many times. Yet the stores all seem to be of one mind when it comes to the shape, size and colors of their awnings. 
They are so uniform that James E. Rauch, an economist at the University of California at San Diego, who studied minority entrepreneurship in New York, said non-Hispanic businessmen look with admiration -- even jealousy -- at what seems to be a huge cooperative effort by the bodega owners. 
Pamela Fairclough, financial controller of the Community Food Resource Center, an organization in New York that studies food and hunger, said the awnings are the byproduct of the long-standing competition between a few large non-Latin grocery wholesalers, including Krasdale Foods and White Rose Food, that supply most of New York's groceries and supermarkets. 
"It might have looked like a variety of different players were involved, but there weren't," Ms. Fairclough said. The bodegas all bought supplies from either of the two major wholesalers. The wholesalers in turn helped them break into the bodega business, which traditionally required little in the way of capital or experience. 
Krasdale officials say they provided financial assistance to help bodega owners start out, but they never actually provided the awnings. Rather, they said they simply recommended that bodegas have awnings, and provided the names of suppliers who could install them. (An official with White Rose confirmed that the company did some business with bodegas, but said that no one there could remember the origin of the awnings.)
The first bodega to hang a corrugated red metal awning with a yellow plastic skirt and black lettering is lost to history. But the idea quickly spread by word of mouth. With one or two bodegas crammed into nearly every street in Hispanic neighborhoods, envious owners saw the new signs go up and wanted the same thing.
Then other awning suppliers tried to cash in on the growing popularity of the style, ordering materials in bulk, which allowed them to reduce prices and sell the style to even more businesses. 
"It's the same if you walk into any Korean market or nail salon today," said Tama Starr, president of the ArtKraft Strauss Sign Corporation. "Each one is slightly different but they all have the same design consciousness and they all carry the same brands. And if someone comes up with a new technique, they all have to have it within a short time."
And the red-and-yellow color scheme? Valentin Pena Hernandez, who works at El Gigante Supermarket at Broadway and 161st Street, was confident that he knew what the colors meant. "They signify the Dominican flag," said Mr. Pena Hernandez, who is Mexican. But as is evident in almost every bodega, including El Gigante, the Dominican flag is predominantly red, white and blue.
Interviews with more than two dozen bodega owners and workers, as well as with sign company executives and academics, suggest that the colors were selected not for patriotic or symbolic reasons, but simply because they are striking, something advertisers have exploited for years. C-Town supermarkets, Cafe Bustelo, McDonald's and other companies use red and yellow. 
Carlos de Jesus, manager of the Elvis Grocery at St. Nicholas Avenue and 189th Street, recently installed a new yellow skirt on the old awning when the name of the store was changed from Katy to Elvis. "They didn't even ask us what colors we wanted," he said of the sign company. 
"No bodega owner would think to say 'Give me different colors,' " Mr. DeJesus said. "He just wouldn't. Maybe the sign companies bought all the same yellow material and now they give a better price if you use it. Who knows?"
Modifying the Elvis bodega awning cost $250. Elvis Rodriguez, the store's namesake, said he had thought about buying the new generation of awning, made of canvas or plastic stretched over a frame of aluminum tubing like the barbershop next door. But that would have cost $1,500, and he was no closer to being able to afford that than he was to hire the Goodyear blimp to advertise his business. 
"This has worked till now," he said, referring to the corrugated metal awning that is no longer manufactured, but can be repaired by itinerant sign makers. "It calls attention to the store, and at night we put the lights on underneath so someone down the block can see that we're still open. It's always been like that."
Most of the original bodega owners were Puerto Ricans or Cubans. Some were quite successful. They sold their businesses to newcomers from the Dominican Republic, who after a few years sold the businesses to relatives or employees. 
Today it is Mexicans, who are installing awnings painted in their own red, white and green color scheme, inspired by the Mexican flag. Other bodega owners are letting Pepsi or Coca-Cola provide new awnings, in exchange for putting their own logos on them.
Someday perhaps, all the red-and-yellow awnings will be gone. But their colors will remain in the collective memory of Hispanics and in works of art like the paintings of Stephen Beveridge, an immigrant artist from Scotland who has lived on upper Broadway for 15 years. 
For him, the shapes and spirit of the bodega awnings came to stand for the city. "I see the awnings as a symbol of hope and home in what can be an impersonal, challenging environment," Mr. Beveridge said. He has incorporated the awnings in his paintings, since they are part of the signature of his street. 
"On my way home," he said, "I can recognize which block I am on by the bodega on the corner."

HEADLINE: As Career Wanes, Armey's Fund-Raising Waxes 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29 

 BODY:
Dick Armey may be retiring from Congress, but he is not retiring from Republican fund-raising.
 Mr. Armey, the House majority leader, is spending much of what will be his final summer in Congress raising money that will go both to individual Republican Congressional candidates and to his political action committee, the Majority Leader's Fund. 
 Just last week, an invitation circulated on Capitol Hill that invited donors to hear Mr. Armey speak at a $500-a-plate luncheon on Aug. 9 at the Union League Club in Manhattan, with all the proceeds directed to the Majority Leader's Fund. Among the sponsors of the event are Lawrence Kudlow, the economist and television commentator, and Roger Hertog, the financier who is a founder of The New York Sun. 
According to the fund, Mr. Armey traveled to 24 states in the first six months of the year and raised more than $2 million for Republican candidates and state parties. In March, he was the host of a fund-raising dinner -- the Retain Our Majority Program, or ROMP -- that collected $850,000 for eight Republican candidates.
The pace of his fund-raising suggests that the Texas Republican intends to remain influential in the party long after he has left Congress, and that the Majority Leader's Fund may be converted into an all-purpose political fund for Mr. Armey to draw on in his next career, whatever that is.
Mr. Armey, a former college economics professor, is mum on questions about what he will do next, and what will become of the fund. His aides say they have no idea about his post-Congress plans, despite news reports suggesting that he may consider a career as a Washington lobbyist, or may want to return to academia.
"I know that he is looking forward to spending time with his family and his wife, but I also know that he is committed to fulfill his obligations to the party, and he is having a great time on the road this year," said Jaylene Farry, the executive director of the Majority Leader's Fund. 
She said that "he remains in very high demand -- I think he just connects with voters out there."
According to its most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission, the fund raised $1.3 million from January through June and had $196,000 on hand. Of its $1.2 million in expenditures during the six-month period, about $272,000 went to Congressional candidates, most of it in the form of $5,000 donations to individual House and Senate campaigns.
The Majority Leader's Fund is separate from Mr. Armey's re-election fund, which was effectively shut down after his announcement last December that he would not seek another term in the House. Mr. Armey had hoped to turn his House seat over to his son, Scott, a county judge in Texas. But the younger Mr. Armey was beaten in a runoff election for the Republican nomination.
Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, a group that favors limits on political fund-raising, said there was "nothing aberrational" in Mr. Armey's decision to raise so much money in the final months of his Congressional career.
"It's the way of Washington," Mr. Wertheimer said. "He's continuing to raise huge sums of money to, no doubt, help his colleagues."
Mr. Wertheimer said that while Mr. Armey was barred from converting money from his re-election fund to personal use, there were many fewer limitations on his use of the money in the Majority Leader's Fund.
Mr. Kudlow says he organized the New York fund-raising lunch next month at Mr. Armey's request.
"Dick asked me to help organize something," he said. "It will be small. If we can raise 10 grand or 12 grand, we'll be pleased. I've known Dick very well for many years, and I'm a big fan." 
Mr. Kudlow said he was not surprised by Mr. Armey's busy fund-raising schedule in the months before his retirement. "It's obviously going to be a tough fight to keep the House," Mr. Kudlow said, "and so he's trying as hard as he can to help."
Even as he continues to raise money on behalf of Republican candidates, some of Mr. Armey's friends and supporters are raising money for him -- not for a re-election campaign this time, but for his official retirement portrait.
The National Journal reported last week that a group of Mr. Armey's former aides, including Ed Gillespie, a Republican political operative, and Kerry Knott, a top Microsoft lobbyist, were seeking checks to help raise the $100,000 needed for the painting, which is to hang in the Capitol.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 30 about political fund-raising by Dick Armey, the House majority leader, referred imprecisely to his son Scott, who sought the Republican nomination to succeed his father in Congress. Scott Armey had been a county judge while he was seeking election, but then resigned to take a job with the federal government.

PERSON: Abraham M. Lackman 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Young Troublemaker, Now Mature and Moderate

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
SOME people say it was the governor who tried to have Abraham M. Lackman, then a graduate student in economics at the State University at Albany, expelled. 
 It was the summer of 1975. The city was in a fiscal crisis. But the state was viewed as immune from money troubles. Mr. Lackman had a summer internship with the Democratic-led state Assembly. Long before "off-balance sheet" was uttered by anyone not wearing a green eyeshade, he researched and wrote a report on the hidden debt loads of various state authorities. 
 No one paid much attention, except his professors, who asked to send the report to The Municipal Bond Buyer, a trade publication. It published the entire thing, on the front page.
The state's debt rating was downgraded. Certain telephone calls were made. 
"I was supposed to go to the university and make charges against this kid and get him out," remembered Robert S. Herman, then special assistant to Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut. "I said, 'Stanley, if he goes I go.' "
The episode established Mr. Lackman as troublemaker and budget prodigy. Official forgiveness came when Gov. Hugh L. Carey offered him a job. But, he said: "I don't see it as creating mischief for the sake of mischief. I see it as stirring the pot for the greater good."
Mr. Lackman soon went to work for the Senate finance committee, where he found a way to sidestep lawmakers' mistrust of Mayor David N. Dinkins's request for an income-tax surcharge to pay for the "safe streets, safe city" plan. He took the mayor's statement from a news release -- that the surcharge would put at least 31,000 officers on the streets -- and wrote it into the law.
For a year, in 1994, Mr. Lackman became Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's first budget director, until he grew tired of being separated from his wife and two sons, now 27 and 23. 
It was his protege, Marc V. Shaw, now deputy to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who who floated his name for the job. Mr. Lackman presided over difficult budget cuts and encouraged a hard line in labor negotiations.
"We were known as these two short Jews with beards," Mr. Shaw said. "The difference is he's a real Republican and I'm not."
But Mr. Lackman, who has been the secretary of the Senate finance committee for eight years, credits himself with tugging his current boss, Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, toward the center. 
He is given to moderate pronouncements like: "Labor has a constituency. They represent their constituency, and they're actually trying to do the right thing." Or: "Across-the-board tax cuts are very expensive. And it's not at all clear how successful they've been."
Slight and smiling, Mr. Lackman pads about the Capitol with a looseness that belies his bottom-line concerns. He is, perhaps, a poet among apparatchiks, one who can discuss in detail the making of amarone, a strong Italian wine (let the grapes rot in the sun first). Although he says, "I never thought of myself as, like, golf," he picked up the sport after seeing a red fox cross a green. 
At a party with Gov. George E. Pataki, the two agreed that Big Pink, the storied house near Woodstock where Bob Dylan recorded, should be included in the governor's proposal for a state heritage trail, Mr. Lackman recalled.
Mr. Lackman has friends on both sides of the aisle. He recently visited Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, at his weekend house in the Catskills, and he is on call when the three Albany leaders, Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno, just cannot agree. Again. 
"If people criticize me," he said, "it's because I'm willing to compromise, to understand the argument of the other side. I don't automatically assume the other side is wrong. It's easy to be a Reagan Republican or a McGovern liberal if you don't want results."
AT the same time, he defends the widely ridiculed process of making laws in Albany. "The level of grappling with thoughts at the leaders' meetings is fairly high," he says.
The child of two Holocaust survivors, Mr. Lackman, 54, was born in Belgium. His parents moved to New York and became garment workers, then owners of a raincoat factory, and their son became a left-wing radical at New York University. After college, he managed the Eighth Street Bookshop in Greenwich Village, visited by Abbie Hoffman and Allen Ginsberg. He became interested in economics when in the gasoline crisis in the early 70's he made money on investments in alternative-fuel stocks. 
He acquired a more conservative outlook. "I was very disillusioned with the whole culture, particularly 'if it feels good, it's O.K.,' " he said.
Like any poet, Mr. Lackman has a trove of old ideas that floundered -- building a bridge from Oyster Bay to Connecticut to energize Long Island's economy and lifting rent regulations but requiring landlords to give some of the proceeds to a fund for cheaper housing.
More often, he says, he is on the mark. He will leave in November to be president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, where he will lobby for private institutions. The trend, he says, is toward economic development like the deal to attract Sematech, the microchip maker, to Albany, in which universities will have a large role. "If you have the right idea at the right time," he said, "you can make a change."

HEADLINE: Our Banana Republics 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
New Jersey has always been a good state for scandals, and last week provided two. One, the case of Web-snooping by a Princeton admissions officer, which involved a total of 11 applicants to Yale, was the subject of front-page stories across the nation. (Disclosure: I'm a Princeton professor.)
 The other -- further revelations about the way dishonest budgeting by former Gov. Christie Whitman crippled the state's finances -- has dire implications for all of the state's eight million people, who face the prospect of higher taxes on their houses, more potholes in their roads, fewer teachers in their children's classrooms and worse medical care for their parents. This story received no national coverage at all. 
 Experts already knew that the Whitman administration had used creative accounting to justify a series of tax cuts. Last year New Jersey Policy Perspective, a local think tank, released a study of fiscal policies in the 1990's titled "Take the Money and Run." Among other things, the state stopped contributing to its pension funds. This made the budget look a lot better, but created a financial hole. In an attempt to fill that hole Governor Whitman violated the basic principles of pension funds by having them engage in stock arbitrage, borrowing money to speculate on the market. 
Now the state's taxpayers must make up for an investment loss of $22 billion, most of a year's tax receipts. But don't cry for New Jersey; Mrs. Whitman wasn't alone in her misbehavior.
For one thing, many corporations with pension plans used a similar trick to inflate their bottom lines. As the current issue of Business Week explains, the pension time bomb involves large numbers; I'd say it's the equivalent of at least 50 WorldComs. 
Furthermore, Mrs. Whitman's policies were by no means the worst among the states. That honor may fall to Tennessee, though Alabama, where a cash crunch stopped all jury trials for awhile, may run a close second. 
The fact is that in recent years many states have been run like banana republics. Responsibility gave way to political opportunism, and in some cases to mob rule. When Tennessee considered a tax increase last year, legislators were intimidated by a riot stirred up by radio talk-show hosts. Only when lack of cash forced the governor to lay off half the work force did the state, which has the second-lowest per capita taxes in the country, face up to reality.
The only reason Tennessee doesn't look like Argentina right now is that it isn't a sovereign nation; since the federal budget was in good shape until recently, there's a safety net. And the federal budget was in pretty good shape because the Clinton administration, unlike state governments, behaved responsibly. Budget projections were honest -- if anything, too cautious -- and boom-year surpluses were used to reduce debt. 
But the responsibility era is over. Even as state governments face up to the consequences of cooked books in the 1990's, the Bush administration is following in their footsteps.
The latest antics of the White House Office of Management and Budget have even the most hardened cynics shaking their heads. It's not just that projections for fiscal 2002 have gone from a $150 billion surplus to a $165 billion deficit in the space of a few months; it's not just that the O.M.B. projects a much smaller deficit next year, when everyone else -- including the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee -- says the deficit will increase. It's also the fact that O.M.B officials simply lie about what their own report says.
"The recession erased two-thirds of the projected 10-year surplus. . . . The tax cut, which economists credit for helping the economy recover, generated less than 15% of the change." So reads the agency's press release. Yet as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, the actual report attributes 40 percent of the budget deterioration to tax cuts, only 10 percent to recession. Maybe dishonesty in the defense of tax cuts is no vice.
State governments turned into banana republics in part because voters didn't realize that a charming, personable chief executive can also be an irresponsible opportunist, seeking political advantage through policies that ensure a fiscal crisis on someone else's watch. Now the same governing style has moved to Washington. And this time there's no safety net.

HEADLINE: Charities Find Donors Scarce As Market Losses Compound 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Ashoka, a nonprofit organization that helps develop social service agencies around the globe, sent an S.O.S. last month to potential contributors. "Three of our top seven donors lost 90 percent of their wealth last year," the letter said, explaining Ashoka's straits.
 Many other businesses that usually contribute heavily to charity have suffered financial setbacks too, said Bill Drayton, the former McKinsey & Company consultant who founded Ashoka and is its chief executive. "We don't know the exact numbers, but they're selling things that make one believe they're in some difficulty," Mr. Drayton said. 
 So charities keep adding holes to the belts they had tightened as the economy soured and then cinched again after Sept. 11. Measures being taken include postponing new programs and increasing solicitations.
"Charities everywhere are struggling even more than they were at the end of last year," said Trent Stamp, the executive director of Charity Navigator, an online charity watchdog organization. "Everyone knows foundation endowments are down, and donors are getting hit by the stock market."
Ashoka, the charity of choice for many entrepreneurs, described the solicitation as "an unusual appeal for help," but such appeals are all too familiar to donors these days.
"We're getting all sorts of earnest pleas from organizations saying collections are down and programs are threatened," said Daniel J. Rose, the real estate developer whose family is among New York's most philanthropic. "This has been a year of great stringency for charities."
Mr. Rose has an unusual perspective. He also founded the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, or HEAF, a small nonprofit organization that provides enrichment programs to urban students with the goal of getting them into New York's elite public high schools.
Contributions to the fund have dropped significantly over the last year, so its staff has been making what Mr. Rose called herculean efforts to attract new donors and re-enlist dormant donors. But HEAF is also making contingency plans.
"I think every charity today is hoping life will get better but uncomfortably preparing to adjust if it doesn't," Mr. Rose said, "which means eating into reserves, deferring programs you wanted to start and retrenching."
Mr. Stamp, whose Charity Navigator service analyzes tax returns of some 1,200 charities and rates them, said many have stopped hiring and reduced or eliminated programs. 
But the pain has not been equally spread among organizations, Mr. Stamp said. The charities he said would weather the donor drought best were service providers like food banks and homeless shelters, whose effectiveness can be measured easily, and community trusts, which have expertise in giving. 
"Dollars are scarce, so donors are even more concerned that their giving is not wasted," he said.
The breaking of a major pledge in the New York area last became public in the late 1980's, when Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrageur who was convicted of insider trading, failed to make good on commitments to Princeton University and the Jewish Theological Seminary.
But rumors about major donors reneging on pledges now abound. Cultural institutions have spread whispers about various Wall Street figures who are in arrears, but no officials will make those charges on the record, because embarrassing donors is taboo in the charity world.
To maintain commitments while dealing with the realities of the economy, several major donors have said they are extending the time over which they will be paying off pledges. Ted Turner told The Wall Street Journal his stake in AOL Time Warner Inc. had lost so much value he planned to stretch a five-year, $250 million pledge to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which works to abolish nuclear weapons, over seven years.
At Ashoka, Vinette Brown, the associate director of development (charity's word for fund-raising), said she has seen some donors who were unable to pay off pledges. For instance, Ashoka has received $2 million of a five-year, $5 million pledge but does not expect to receive the remaining $3 million, Ms. Brown said. A $1 million oral pledge has evaporated, she said.
"It's not the person's fault," Ms. Brown said. "His stock is at 1 percent of its peak level."
Luckily for Ashoka, only 10 percent of its endowment is exposed to the fluctuations of stocks, so it has not suffered as badly as many charities, including the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, whose endowment is down more than 50 percent; the Lilly Endowment, which is down more than 40 percent; and the Ford Foundation, down 30 percent.
Ashoka has made up some of the contribution deficit by finding new donors, like the American Indian Association, which gave $500,000, and the Hilti Corporation, which is underwriting a program in Egypt. Still, it has cut $3 million from its budget, and Mr. Drayton was not optimistic.
When the impact of the oil crisis struck foundations in 1975, their giving dropped 28 percent and did not recover for 10 years, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
"This looks worse than it did then," Mr. Drayton said last week when the stock market was dropping. "This bubble is worse than anything we've ever seen in the entire financial history of the United States, and that is not encouraging." 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 1, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the finances of charities affected by the decline in the stock market misidentified a donor found by one nonprofit organization, Ashoka, to make up part of its deficit. The donor is the American India Foundation, not the American Indian Association.

HEADLINE: Labor to Press for Changes In CorporateGovernance 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Organized labor will announce plans today to throw its considerable weight -- in lobbying and in shareholder fights -- behind efforts to reform stock options, severance pay and pensions.
 At a labor rally on Wall Street, John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., plans to announce the labor movement's support of several proposals, among them recording stock options as expenses and prohibiting top corporate officials from selling company stock while in office. 
 Noting that scandals at Enron, WorldCom and Arthur Andersen had cost 28,500 workers their jobs, Mr. Sweeney will call on the Securities and Exchange Commission and the three main stock exchanges to agree to a single higher standard for publicly traded corporations. 
"When corporate criminals invade our workplaces and our markets to steal our jobs and our savings, we must react every bit as decisively as when thieves enter our homes and try to bring harm to our loved ones," Mr. Sweeney will tell union members, according to the prepared text of his speech.
Labor unions have already played a role in moving accounting reforms through Congress and in several successive shareholder battles that have brought about changes, among them persuading the Walt Disney Company to stop using the same firm to audit its books and to do consulting work for it. In his speech today, Mr. Sweeney says that labor will step up these efforts -- in meetings with executives and in shareholder fights, demonstrations, lobbying and e-mail campaigns.
He promises that the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 66 unions representing 13 million workers, will work for reforms, company by company, starting with the Standard & Poor's 100. He says unions will use more than $5 trillion in union pension funds to pressure corporate managers to be more responsive and responsible.
He will also call for changes to give pension funds more power to choose directors who do not rubber-stamp the decisions of company executives. He also raises the possibility of banning stock options altogether, and he wants workers to be able to choose representatives on the boards of their 401(k) plans.
Although unions represent only a fraction of the workers at companies hit by corporate scandal, labor leaders say this is an opportune time to rein in executive compensation and to align the interests of executives more closely with those of investors and workers.
"Nearly 100 years ago, robber barons hijacked our country and our wealth by taking advantage of the legal and regulatory voids created by our change from an agricultural to an industrial economy," Mr. Sweeney's speech says. "Now we're faced with 21st century corporate pirates who took advantage of our transition from an industrial to an information economy to kidnap working families and take us back to the past."
Citing the efforts of the Stanley Works to reincorporate in Bermuda, Mr. Sweeney will call for outlawing the use of offshore tax havens, which he says make it easier for companies to evade taxes and accountability. He will also call for revising bankruptcy laws so that workers who lose their jobs because of corporate scandals will not receive a mere fraction of the severance pay due them.
When Enron employees found themselves without jobs and with their 401(k) plans largely wiped out, the federation led a fight in bankruptcy court to obtain more severance pay for 4,200 laid-off workers. Enron said it could pay only a fraction of the severance pay they were owed, but the workers won a $34 million settlement promising up to $13,500 each.
Today, Mr. Sweeney will announce the federation's plans to file a similar lawsuit on behalf of 17,000 laid-off WorldCom workers. 
Charles M. Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said: "A lot of folks in the governance area have been calling for a lot of these things for a long time. I think stock options should be expensed, and I don't think C.E.O.'s should be selling their stock when they're still working, except under extraordinary circumstances."
Mr. Elson said the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s pledge to play a larger role should give a big lift to the corporate overhaul movement.
"Labor has been a very active voice in the governance area and a very successful voice," he said.
Mr. Sweeney joined a labor demonstration yesterday at the Stanley Works in New Britain, Conn., to protest its plan to reincorporate in Bermuda. On Wednesday, he plans to lead a labor rally at the headquarters of Fidelity Investments in Boston, the world's largest large mutual fund company, to protest its policy of not disclosing how it votes in shareholder battles.
After his speech today, Mr. Sweeney plans to meet with Richard A. Grasso, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of the Goldman Sachs Group, to discuss his ideas for corporate overhaul.

HEADLINE: Officials Seek More Designers For Downtown 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Responding to criticism of the plans to rebuild Lower Manhattan, officials overseeing the development said yesterday that they wanted to open up the design effort to more architects and planners.
 The proposal, which originated with directors of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation after six initial plans were released two weeks ago, would broaden the process to include smaller design firms and foreign teams. 
 Many such groups were excluded from consideration for the first design contract because of their relative lack of experience working on big projects in New York. For instance, the firms were required to have 10 years of urban planning experience and to have worked on at least three $100 million projects. 
Officials involved in the rebuilding effort, including two directors of the development corporation who favor opening up the design process and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they believed some effort to expand the number and type of firms submitting ideas for the World Trade Center site would come to fruition over the next few weeks. They noted that the criticism of the first site plans had apparently persuaded several city and state officials to overhaul the design effort to win public support for the process and the plans for the site. 
Last week, Gov. George E. Pataki said that planners should consider broadening their site designs, possibly moving commercial space previously on the trade center site to nearby areas, leaving more potential space for a memorial and cultural development on the site. And Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has also criticized the initial plans, saying that he intends to submit some of his own ideas, including putting housing on or near the site.
One development corporation official said the new effort would not begin with an entirely clean slate.
"This would be very different from creating a full-blown new master plan," one director of the development corporation said. "It would take the things that people responded to in a very positive way. Then it would try to have new groups of architects look at those possibilities in different ways, to open up the ideas and discussions."
Development corporation officials are still negotiating with officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the owner of the site and the development corporation's partner in the rebuilding, over the terms of a new process. 
While the Port Authority's approval is not required for the development corporation to hire new design consultants to come up with ideas, the two agencies have made an effort to work together. 
Earlier this year, the development corporation issued its own request for proposals from architecture firms to create the plans for the trade center without consulting the Port Authority. When the Port Authority objected, the request was quickly withdrawn and a new request was issued with the inclusion of the Port Authority.
Spokesmen for the two agencies would not confirm or deny that a new design process was in the works. A spokesman for the Port Authority, Michael Petralia, said the agency "is getting public input on a number of ideas on how to move forward in order to ensure a successful effort."
He added, "It's premature to comment on any particular idea except to say our focus should be on ideas that help us move forward in an open, well-thought-out manner."
Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for the development corporation, said, "We're considering a range of ideas on how best to incorporate public input, but at this stage many of them are just ideas."
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, Michael McKeon, said the governor was "open to ideas that continue to improve the process. If the directors decide to pursue something like that, we'll take a look at it."
The six site plans released two weeks ago were designed by a team of planners and architects headed by Beyer Blinder Belle, a New York firm. They were widely criticized as uninspired and uninteresting, with critics responding unfavorably to the dense array of commercial buildings that surrounded a central site, which was reserved for a memorial to victims of the attack on Sept. 11. 
Beyer Blinder Belle officials did not return two telephone calls seeking comment.
The process in which Beyer Blinder Belle was selected also was criticized for limiting the field of potential designers by requiring extensive experience in urban planning and involvement in major projects.
The new call for designers and architects would have less onerous requirements for experience, officials said. Smaller firms with some design credentials and less formal experience would be eligible. Foreign firms also would be encouraged to apply.
New York New Visions, a coalition of civic, architecture and design groups that has contributed ideas related to the rebuilding effort, called on the development corporation and the Port Authority yesterday to expand the planning effort and to "rethink its goals, priorities and process."
"What we have before us are not master plans that provide a range of choices to the public and decision makers," said Marcie Kesner, the co-chairwoman of a New York New Visions task force that analyzed the initial six designs. "Before dealing with the details of site plan or design, our elected and appointed officials must define a compelling vision for this public site and for Lower Manhattan. This has not yet happened."

HEADLINE: Staff Members of Wall St. Journal Returning to Offices Near Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Amid the irritating minutiae that attend any move, the first large contingent of Wall Street Journal reporters and editors returned yesterday to their offices in 1 World Financial Center next to ground zero, where everything was familiar and nothing was familiar.
 The blue-black carpets were so new that they bristled. The state-of-the-art telephones worked, or failed, with the normal whimsy of state-of-the-art technology. Snippets of office talk mixed journalistic commonplaces ("I still don't have a good anecdote that would tie this all up.") and musings about old neighbors ("The fruit vendor, the one with the beard who worked on Liberty Street, I wonder where he is?"). 
 The Journal was far from the first business to move its employees back to the neighborhood. Construction delays, environmental testing and staff concerns ensured that they returned well after other World Financial Center tenants like Deloitte & Touche and the Battery Park City Authority.
But Sept. 11 is such a part of the newspaper's institutional history -- the comprehensive coverage its scattered staff produced for Sept. 12 won a Pulitzer Prize -- that the permanent return of the first 80 or so workers to the place they fled and later feared was both a personal and a semipublic event.
"I was struck by the fact they frosted the windows in the lobby," said the economics editor, Constance Mitchell Ford. "When I left that morning, that's where I looked. The first tower had just fallen. People were running and screaming and debris was falling." She added, "I'm so relieved my office window doesn't look that way."
A handful of editors like Ms. Ford, two assistant managing editors, and the managing editor, Paul E. Steiger, were on hand to greet returning journalists. Steven V. Goldstein, vice president for communications at Dow Jones & Company, The Journal's parent, shuttled television crews and non-Journal reporters through the construction workers and boxes. No corporate officers were on hand.
The newly appointed publisher, Karen Elliott House, was on a vacation that could not be postponed, Mr. Goldstein said. Her husband, Dow Jones's chief executive, Peter R. Kann, was with her. 
"The reporters did notice that there was a lack of senior people here to welcome us back," said Tom Lauricella, a Journal mutual funds reporter and newsroom director for the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, part of the Communications Workers of America. 
A survey taken in the late spring by employees affiliated with neither the union nor the management found that 72 percent of the 175 people asked wanted to relocate elsewhere. The finding of asbestos residue in an air vent earlier this year, after the Dow Jones offices were given a clean bill of health, heightened employees' worries. After its removal, studies by both union and management contractors found the site to be clean.
Mr. Goldstein said three of the seven floors leased by Dow Jones would be reoccupied by 400 Journal and Dow Jones employees. About 250 others, including Journal copy editors and art designers, have been relocated to South Brunswick, N.J. Others, like the employees of the Web site wsj.com, will now move from New Jersey to Dow Jones's offices in SoHo.
About 800 employees of The Journal and its sister publication, Barron's, had worked at 1 World Financial Center last year. Dow Jones is now due to resume payments to its landlord, Brookfield Financial Properties.
"It's weird to be back," Mr. Lauricella said. "I think we all expected it to be an odd experience. We're in the same office building, on the same floor, but everything is completely different."
Some journalists had gone on earlier company tours of the site, and editors like Mr. Steiger had made their own inspection trips earlier. The impact of the return, Mr. Steiger said, "is not going to sink in until I'm actually in my office and at my desk and walking around." But even now, he said: "When you kind of go by where the towers were, so-called ground zero, it kind of aches at you. That will happen for people for a while."

HEADLINE: 9/11 Memories Cast Shadow On Primary 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Even as the Democratic candidates for governor ratchet up campaigning in the final weeks before the primary, their advisers are anticipating a period when they will have to soften the tone, shift the emphasis to leadership and at least evoke a mood of reconciliation.
 Usually such transformations occur the day after a primary, when the loser espouses a message of unity and healing, for the good of the party. This year, though, the day after is Sept. 11, and political advisers said the first anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon would loom large in campaigns, particularly in New York. 
 Eleven states -- including New York -- and the District of Columbia have primaries scheduled for Sept. 10. Analysts predict the closeness to the anniversary will influence everything from the candidates' advertising to the tenor of stump speeches. 
Any negative campaigning, a tactic often employed at the end by trailing candidates, is not likely to play well with voters in a somber mood, the analysts predict. More mundane tactics, like get-out-the-vote calls a day or so before the primary, are likely to be altered, shifting perhaps to reminders of the patriotic duty of voting.
For New York, the timing has the potential to throw a major complication into what is expected to be a hard-fought race.
Several political analysts say the anniversary is likely to change the tactics of the two Democrats, Andrew M. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary, and H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, including how they spend their money and the content of their advertisements.
It will also deprive the winner of a much-desired boost the day after the primary: even as their Republican opponent, Gov. George E. Pataki, is sure to be prominent at public events, neither Mr. Cuomo nor Mr. McCall expects to campaign on Sept. 11.
"There is definitely an unclosed wound in the New York voter's psyche," said Norman Adler, a longtime political consultant not affiliated with either campaign, "and people have to be very careful that they are not rubbing dirt into it." 
Stuart Rothenberg, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter, said that although the anniversary was most significant in New York, many consultants in the array of congressional, gubernatorial and local primaries in other states were also weighing how to handle campaigning leading up to Sept. 11.
"Some consultants say it will be a 24-hour event, but I am doubtful of that," Mr. Rothenberg said. "I just think there is going to be enough national media coverage leading up to the anniversary of the tragedy that it is going to create a certain feeling, and that will make it difficult to run a traditional campaign with attacks and the usual political rhetoric."
Last year, the Democratic mayoral primary fell on Sept. 11, but voting was halted after the attacks and rescheduled on Sept. 25. The candidates mounted largely subdued campaigns under the blanket of attack coverage.
As it is, the September political calendar presents severe complications.
Campaigns normally pull out of the August doldrums after Labor Day, which is Sept. 2. This year the candidates must also consider Rosh Hashana, which begins a few days later at sundown Sept. 6 and normally brings a lull in campaigning, particularly aimed at Jewish voters. The holiday ends Sept. 8, just a couple of days before the primary. 
Political analysts predict that the campaigns will end up with a more solemn tone, with fewer negative attacks and with campaign stops that emphasize the candidates' leadership qualities. News coverage is likely to be focused elsewhere, so the candidates may be forced to use more commercials, giving a potential advantage to the candidate with more money. Mr. Cuomo has raised more money than Mr. McCall. 
The need for more delicate, softer steps on the campaign trail could place the trailing candidate at a severe disadvantage. Normally, candidates in that position would consider negative advertisements and attacks on the stump to get attention and tarnish their opponent's image.
"The playbook calls for going after one opponent or another," said David Axelrod, a political consultant who has advised both Mr. McCall and Dennis Mehiel, a candidate for lieutenant governor. "But whether people will tolerate that, I don't know. Just the word 'attack' is repugnant around that time."
"I think it is going to be a tough period if you are out there savaging one another at a time when people are in a reflective, somber mood," he added.
Another consultant, Richard Schrader, who ran Mark Green's campaign for mayor last year during a primary delayed by the Sept. 11 attacks, agreed.
"I don't there there will be attack ads," he said. "The public will not be in a mood for politicians attacking one another. It will look self-serving."
Since Sept. 11 is expected to be high in voters' minds, the candidates must find a way of addressing the issue without looking as if they are capitalizing on it.
Already, Mr. Cuomo suffered a setback when he criticized the leadership of Mr. Pataki in contrast to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, saying he merely "held the leader's coat." Mr. Cuomo's standings in public polls dropped afterward.
When asked about campaigning near the anniversary, the candidates and their strategists, while not revealing details, did indeed say that, even more than usual, they would seek to portray the candidates as effective, stable leaders. That is partly to contradict Mr. Pataki, who many strategists believe has benefited from his prominence in Sept. 11 coverage.
"One of the lessons of 9/11 was the need for real leadership in these new times, and I believe the campaign will highlight that," said Josh Isay, campaign manager for Mr. Cuomo.
Voters, said Mr. McCall, "are going to say, 'Wait a minute, who is going to be in charge? Who are they? What have they done?' And particularly they know we have an incredible challenge ahead not just because of Sept. 11 but the economic challenge."
A top campaign aide to Mr. Pataki said, "I think for the public, post-9/11, the issue of leadership and where we stand on security are much more important."
There is disagreement over whether the attention paid to the anniversary will diminish voter turnout during the primary. Some believe it will be hard to mobilize voters paying more attention to the anniversary, while others look to recent history as a better guide.
Despite predictions that the terrorist attacks would leave voters less inclined to go to the polls, turnout in the mayoral primary last year was the highest since 1989, 26 percent. 
Either way, consultants believe the standard get-out-the-vote pitch will not do. A nightmare scenario is calling voters just as they are watching a tear-filled tribute to a fallen firefighter or police officer.
Mr. Adler said a campaign caller might instead emphasize the importance of voting, suggesting a script that might say, "Tuesday is Election Day. These terrible events were done by people who wanted to destroy democracy . . ."
Of course, the anniversary events will come to an end and regular campaigning will resume. It is worth noting that last year's mayoral runoff on Oct. 11 ended with the Democratic candidates, Mark Green and Fernando Ferrer, accusing one another of negative, divisive attacks.
Aides to both Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo said they planned to resume campaigning within a day or so of the anniversary, depending on the atmosphere.
Then they will have to assess the degree to which the anniversary coverage affected Mr. Pataki, who is far ahead of either Mr. Cuomo or Mr. McCall in the polls and has resisted the Democrats' attempts to engage him.
David Garth, who was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's political strategist in last year's campaign, said the candidate who can most identify himself with his predecessor, Mr. Giuliani, or even get an endorsement from him, would gain the most. At this point, he said, "Pataki is associated with Giuliani."

HEADLINE: 8 Years After Invasion, Haiti Squalor Worsens 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
Sonia Jean-Pierre's life is one of apocalyptic misery. With hardly any food or work, her only refuge is a concrete cell. The searing sun is blotted out by cardboard pasted over the windows. On the wall by her bed, she has scrawled, "Jesus Christ is coming soon," like a promise of salvation to greet her every morning. 
 Ms. Jean-Pierre and hundreds of neighbors live as squatters inside the old Fort Dimanche Prison, once the brutally efficient killing chamber of the Duvalier dictatorships. A prison no longer, it has been renamed, hopefully, Village Democratie. 
 The poor cram themselves into the dingy cells and even inside the old sentry towers that look out over the surrounding shanties, where 2,000 more souls live without water, schools or electricity. Some are so desperate they eat pancakelike disks of bouillon-flavored clay. Poverty is the only jailer. 
"We are free prisoners," said Ms. Jean-Pierre, who rested one recent afternoon on the cool concrete floor. "We are still living like prisoners." 
Nearly eight years after the United States led an invasion of Haiti to oust a military junta and restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, Village Democratie is just one measure of this country's despairing slide. 
Increasingly exasperated with Mr. Aristide's government, which has yet to resolve a two-year-old deadlock with its opposition, the United States and European countries have blocked some $500 million in aid, hoping to encourage greater democracy. Critics say the decision has merely eroded the hopes and deepened the poverty of this country's seven million or so people.
For a nation as poor as Haiti, withholding the money has become both carrot and stick. Haiti still lingers near the bottom of the United Nations' annual survey of living conditions. Life expectancy is less than 53 years. Preventable diseases go untreated. The yearly income of the average family is less than is needed to sustain a single person. 
Mr. Aristide calls the withholding of the aid an "embargo." His American supporters, including the Congressional Black Caucus and well-paid lobbyists, say it is immoral to withhold the aid and punish the Haitian people, as government agencies go without budgets, plans or projects to provide water, health care and schools. Some $150 million from the United States, they note, might not only improve roads, water and health but also create jobs. 
Still, diplomats and aid officials say, Mr. Aristide's use of the term "embargo" reflects calculated rhetoric more than reality. Trade and travel continue, and relief, including contributions from the United States, flows into Haiti through nongovernmental groups. 
Solving Haiti's problems, they argue, will take more than just an infusion of aid. Most important, they say, Mr. Aristide has yet to prove that his government has escaped the corruption and destructive self-interest of governments past.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate, which arose over a disputed election, and the international response to it, have stalled what little functioning government democracy might have brought.
"The situation is getting worse for the majority of the people," said the Rev. Jan Hanssens, a Roman Catholic priest who sits on the Justice and Peace Commission of the Bishops' Conference. "There is certainly no hope unless there is a drastic reassessment of Haitian society itself. If things simply go on as now, there is no chance." 
Along the streets of Village Democratie, faith in politicians is as elusive as a decent job. Faded posters of Mr. Aristide, wearing the presidential sash and with his arms outstretched, are his only presence.
Laughing young men crouched at the entrance to the former prison and gambled a few wrinkled gourde notes, the country's currency. Inside, past corridors whose crumbled walls reveal a weed-choked courtyard, people walked home after church clutching hymnals titled "Songs of Hope." 
Inside tiny rooms with cardboard walls, slim shafts of sunlight cut through the haze of charcoal smoke from braziers where pots of rice boiled. There are no sewers or running water anywhere in the neighborhood, and when the rains come, they leave fetid puddles where malaria-carrying mosquitoes breed.
"Aristide said here is the room of the people," said Dorlis Ephesans. "But he has never showed his face here." 
Some of the residents had tried to leave Haiti during the 1991 coup that ousted Mr. Aristide. Some made it to Miami, some died and others, like Israel Arince, were caught at sea and returned.
The same America that sent him back to Haiti and restored Mr. Aristide to power in 1994, Mr. Arince said, now makes life impossible.
"They have blocked the country from getting aid," he said. "We are human beings and we do not like to live like this. Only animals should live here."
In La Saline slum, down a busy road near the prison that is often choked with carts and traffic, pigs waded through streams of human waste and poked their snouts into mountains of garbage in a drainage canal. Young women dropped plastic buckets into a sewer and hauled out a gray water they would use to wash their floors. Potable water is too expensive.
"There is no way to be healthy here," said Elisena Nicolas, who spends a third of her income on water. "But you have to keep the children clean."
As hard as it is to conceive, people come to La Saline to escape rural misery. In the Central Plateau town of Cange, doctors with the Zanmi Lasante clinic said children commonly died from malaria or diarrhea, while tuberculosis and AIDS killed their parents. Even polio, once thought to have been eradicated, has resurfaced recently.
Although the clinic receives no international aid, doctors said they worked with many Haitian government clinics in nearby villages where the frozen aid has left them unable to cope. In recent years, their volunteer clinic's patient load has tripled to 120,000, with patients sometimes walking five hours for free care.
Dr. Paul Farmer, an American who helped found the clinic in the 1980's, said he could not prove that the blocked aid resulted in more suffering, but the deteriorating conditions were evident. International aid, provided on an emergency basis to charitable groups, was no substitute for a working government, he said. 
"One of the world's most powerful countries is taking on one of the most impoverished," he said of the United States decision to withhold aid. "I object to that on moral grounds. Anybody who presides over this blockade needs to know the impact here already."
But Haiti's record of official corruption and mismanagement, regardless of who was in power, has given pause to many international aid officials. A recent study by the World Bank concluded that 15 years of aid through 2001 had had no discernible impact in reducing poverty, since projects were carried out haphazardly and government officials did not sustain improvements. 
Today, for instance, a maze of rat-infested pipes is all that is left of a potable water project after funds ran out before the pipes could be connected to the water main.
At the same time, political opponents and diplomats said, the government has money to provide cars for legislators or pay off neighborhood groups that are its foot soldiers and that, the opposition charges, have been used to intimidate government opponents. 
As a result, diplomats and aid officials said Mr. Aristide must not only resolve his political crisis, he must also show that he will allow economic and administrative reforms to guarantee that any forthcoming aid will be honestly spent. 
"We are saying we want to help you," said a European diplomat, who noted that the European Union was ready to provide $350 million. "But you must help us help you. You comply, I'll comply."
Absent any aid or a political pact, people scrape by as they have for years, sharing what little they have or sacrificing themselves for their children. In the neighborhood of Fort Sinclaire, a dilapidated maze of shacks, indigent teenagers with tuberculosis sleep on sheets spread out on hard concrete porches. 
A soft carpet of soggy wood chips blankets the entrance to the neighborhood, as men carve wooden bowls to sell to tourists who have yet to return to Haiti. Lionel Agustain, a woodworker, sometimes earns two dollars a day, not enough to prevent him from losing his home a few years ago.
A friend lets him sleep on a rickety cot inside a gym where the weights are improvised from gears and other car parts. The walls are tauntingly decorated with wrinkled posters of bodybuilders with bulging chests and biceps. Mr. Agustain is thin, and he sometimes eats only a bowl of rice. 
"We don't know when they are going to fix things," he said. "We suffer. And when you suffer enough, you die."

 Output at Japan's factories fell for the first time in five months but was expected to rise the rest of the summer. 
Industrial production declined a larger-than-expected 0.7 percent in June from the previous month, partly a reaction to an unusually large gain in May. The government also expects output to rise 1.6 percent in July and another 1.8 percent in August. Exports of electronics and automobiles to the United States have largely been behind the gains.

From Almost No More To More Than Enough

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
The Minnesota Twins are not supposed to be alive, much less in first place. Their owner wanted them eliminated last winter, canceled like a bad check. They were destined to become ghosts, shadow remnants of baseball's financial nightmare. Contraction, Commissioner Bud Selig called it, a tidy euphemism, as if he wanted to omit a few letters from a word instead of an entire team with a rich history and two World Series titles.
 A court fight saved the Twins, but only with a guarantee through next season. Resilient on the field, the Twins (64-42) have built an apparently unassailable 14-game lead in the American League Central and may be ready to challenge the Yankees in the playoffs. If there are any playoffs. Given baseball's self-destructive state, the Twins face the real possibility of winning the division and losing any chance of reaching another World Series because of a work stoppage. 
 Celebration of the team's success here has been tempered by disillusionment, anxiety and uncertainty. Attendance has been indifferent this season. The issue of a new stadium remains unresolved. The Twins want out of the dreary Metrodome, into a ballpark with a retractable roof, but ownership recently rebuffed a dalliance from St. Paul, citing the uncertainty of relocation costs. 
The Twins are for sale, but it seems very unlikely that anyone would want to buy them until baseball's labor strife and the stadium issue are settled. Public sentiment seems to be grudgingly in favor of a new stadium, if public spending is held to a reasonable amount, but the future of the team and its location have become wearying in the Twin Cities. 
"This thing keeps rising up like Jason from 'Halloween,' " said Kathy Lantry, a city councilwoman from St. Paul, who opposes spending public money on a baseball stadium. "You think you've killed it and it comes back. You're constantly fighting it."
In the Twins' clubhouse, the mood is one of relief and determination that comes with a second chance, optimism of the nearly condemned. The team endured eight consecutive losing seasons through 2000, then faded from first place after the All-Star Game break in 2001. Many of the players have come up together, agonized through defeat together and now want to succeed together. Few have ever participated in the playoffs, have ever received playoff recognition and playoff money.
All are aware that the franchise might sustain permanent damage from a strike, pointing to the dispiriting example of Montreal, which led the National League East in 1994, missed the postseason because of a work stoppage and nearly became a discarded brother in contraction last winter.
"Montreal was in the same position and never recovered," catcher A. J. Pierzynski said. "We don't want to have to go through that."
Starter Rick Reed, who arrived last summer in a trade with the Mets, added, "It would tear some hearts out of some people's chests in here."
Of course the Twins would join the other 29 major league teams in the event of a strike, said Denny Hocking, the team's player representative. A union has to do what it has to do. But Hocking appears to have no stomach for a walkout. He knows the public is sickened by what it considers as bickering between millionaire players and billionaire owners. The recent encouraging talk from negotiators buoys him.
"It's like working as a postal worker -- you work from Jan. 1 to Dec. 23, and you're going to get your Christmas bonus on Christmas Day and you walk out," Hocking said. "That doesn't make a lot of sense."

Team Is for Real
In more certain times, this is a team that a city could grow to love. They are pleasant, hard-playing guys, and they have gained baseball's biggest division lead despite having one of baseball's smallest payrolls ($41.5 million). Ron Gardenhire, the first-year manager, has kept his players looking ahead toward the postseason, not behind toward teams trying to catch up. The starting pitching has excelled, the bullpen has been dependable, the bats have been pounding and the ability to come from behind has been remarkable. Some players seem to have taken the threat of contraction as a personal affront to their abilities.
"Sooner or later, someone is going to have to say this team is for real and start to recognize that," Hocking said. 
Torii Hunter, the brilliant center fielder, added: "Look at what we went through. We were almost no more."
For years, fans could be counted on for dutiful support. The Twins won the World Series in 1987 and, a season later, became the first American League team to draw three million fans. Another title followed in 1991, and attendance in 1992 reached 2.5 million. This year, winning has actually attracted smaller crowds, at least until 40,300 fans showed up on July 27 and 30,500 on July 28. 
Last Friday, the Minneapolis and St. Paul newspapers both ran front-page stories about the Twins' mediocre attendance. Until this latest homestand, the Twins were averaging a meager 21,668 fans at home -- 23 percent below the major league average of 28,114, and 45 percent below the average of 39,068 drawn to the parks of baseball's other division leaders. Even with a weekend boost, the current average attendance of 22,251 is slightly lower than last season's average. A number of reasons might account for the drop: a downturn in the economy, a pennant race that lacks suspense, an imbalanced schedule, the reluctance of fans to sit indoors during the short summers in Minnesota, constant bad-mouthing of the Metrodome by Twins officials.
"We've been telling the legislature and the public it's a lousy place," Jerry Bell, president of the Twins, said in an interview. "Some people believe it."
Perhaps no other metropolitan area is more sophisticated about the financial realities of modern sports than the Twin Cities. The Minneapolis Lakers of long ago left for Los Angeles, the Minnesota North Stars went to Dallas, the Timberwolves nearly skipped town to New Orleans, the Twins threatened to ship out to North Carolina. The National Basketball Association's $120 million contract was also born here in the paycheck of Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett.
It is hardly surprising that fans here are dubious about contraction of the Twins, especially given reports that Carl Pohlad, the team owner, stood to receive $150 million, more than his team is reportedly worth in the Metrodome. And public trust was not engendered by the revelation that Selig had once received an undisclosed and, perhaps improper, loan of $3 million for his Milwaukee Brewers from Pohlad in 1995. Local suspicion holds that the Brewers stood to benefit from contraction of the Twins by siphoning its television market and fan base.
Lingering resentment from the threat of past and future contraction was given as a reason for low attendance by a number of fans interviewed July 26 at the Metrodome. "When people say, 'I'm going to pull your team from you,' and it's possible you'll be without a team after next year, do you really want to watch that team play?" said Daran Gaudineer, 37, who drove three hours from Des Moines.

Winning Draws Fans
Neither Pohlad, an octogenarian banker, nor Selig are popular figures here. A Pohlad joke making the rounds: "Did you hear that Carl Pohlad just got a pacemaker? No, I didn't know he had a heart." Local fans seem gleeful that Selig's Brewers have cratered in the National League Central. And Milwaukee has provided yet another example of how a new stadium does not remedy attendance ills if the team is not competitive.
"How will a stadium stave off contraction in the future?" said Sarah Steinhilber of Blaine, Minn. "We could be left paying for an empty stadium."
But, Steinhilber added, she would most likely give reluctant support to a new stadium if it meant keeping the Twins in Minnesota. Many fans seemed to feel that way, with a kind of Norwegian reasonableness, that the Twins are a civic asset and worth keeping, as long as the public did not have to pay an outrageous amount of money.
"The threat of contraction, whether it was real or not, was a wake-up call," said Jay Weiner, a St. Paul journalist and the author of "Stadium Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and Bush League Boondoggles (2000, University of Minnesota Press).
Still, several fans, including season-ticket holders, said they would not return if there was a strike and a canceled postseason, as in 1994. "I'd spend my money somewhere else," said John Santoro of Woodbury, Minn. "They'll end up killing themselves."
That is the exact fear voiced by Dave St. Peter, the Twins' senior vice president for business affairs. "I'd have grave concerns about this franchise's ability to continue," he said. "It scares the hell out of me. I can't put it any other way."

Home-Field Advantage
A strike-ruined postseason would provide a great irony along with bitter feelings. As much as the 20-year-old Metrodome is maligned, it provides a tremendous home-field advantage. The Twins are 11-1 in the postseason there. They won all four home games in both the 1987 and the 1991 World Series, taking each in the seventh game. The American League is also scheduled to play four home games in this year's Series.
"The cards are all set up just right," Bell, the Twins' president, said of the Metrodome. "It's a lousy place for the visiting team. They should hate it."
Even if a strike is averted, or resolved before the playoffs, the future of the Twins remains murky. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which operates the Metrodome, sued to keep the team in Minnesota, and Major League Baseball settled by agreeing to sustain the team through the 2003 season. Without a new stadium and income from luxury boxes and parking that now goes to the Minnesota Vikings, the Twins have said they cannot survive.
The stadium issue appears headed back to the state legislature in January. A proposed referendum on a bar and restaurant tax to pay for a $330 million ballpark in St. Paul was scuttled two weeks ago. The Twins said they could not make a long-term commitment to St. Paul because the team's share of the stadium bill -- $120 million -- might rise by tens of millions of dollars in still undetermined costs for land acquisition and infrastructure.
A site being discussed now is a warehouse district in downtown Minneapolis. But there is no guarantee for the Twins. The Vikings will also be asking for a new stadium in January. Meanwhile, the state faces a budget deficit, a new governor will be in office and up to a third of the legislators will be freshmen.
"I think, in the long run, we'll probably get a stadium here," said Marshall Tanick, a Minneapolis sports lawyer who has followed the issue closely. "But hazarding a prediction now is like predicting the stock market. The situation is so volatile. Whatever happens, it will go into extra innings."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
BroadRally Sends Stocks Up 5 Percent

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks shot higher yesterday in a broad rally that sent the three major measures up more than 5 percent.
 Instead of surging and plunging during the day as they have recently, stock gauges rose in a relatively straight line all day. Only 22 of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index ended the day down. 
 The gain was the third in four sessions for the broad market, which has now made a sharp rebound from its five-year low last Tuesday. 
Since then, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen more than 1,000 points, or 13 percent. That four-day gain is the biggest for the Dow since 1933.
The rebound may be helping to establish a bottom in the market, some stock analysts said, pointing to the volatility and heavy volumes as indicators. But rallies from lows have fooled investors in the past.
"Could the market fall below 8,000 again?" asked Robert J. Froehlich, chief investment strategist for Deutsche Asset Management. "Sure," he answered, but "there is a growing consensus that if we are not at a bottom, we are near a bottom."
For the day, the Dow gained 447.49 points, or 5.4 percent, to close at 8,711.88. The S.& P. 500-stock index rose 46.12 points, or 5.4 percent, to 898.96. The Nasdaq composite index was the big winner, gaining 73.13 points, or 5.8 percent, to 1,335.25.
At times ignoring bad news, investors seemed to scramble back into the market in hopes of buying stocks at their lows.
"I am a long-term investor; I am not an active trader," said Ken Straus, 43, a partner in a consulting firm, as he was buying a stock index fund yesterday at a midtown Manhattan office of Charles Schwab. "Everything I heard over this weekend said that we were near a bottom," he added, referring to comments by the Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, and others.
Mr. Froehlich said yesterday's big move was not spurred by some good economic or corporate news. Instead, investors reflected on the gains last Wednesday, when the Dow and the S.& P. 500 had their biggest one-day percentage gains since the 1987 market crash, and on how much of those advances were sustained at the end of the week.
News that would have dampened the spirits of investors in past days was taken in stride yesterday.
Accounting problems in the telecommunications sector spread to Qwest Communications International Inc., the local telephone company in 14 Western states. The company said on Sunday night that it had incorrectly accounted for $1.1 billion in transactions from 1999 to 2001. Shares of Qwest fell a penny yesterday, to $1.49.
The Williams Companies, a major pipeline company, said that it had lost $498 million from the trading of natural gas in the second quarter, echoing the problems of other major energy traders. Shares of its stock rose 93 cents, or 88 percent, to $1.99.
The best performers yesterday and over the last four days were big losers for the year, suggesting that investors looking for bargains are driving the rally. Williams, for example, is down 92 percent for the year and the worst performer in the S.& P.
Shares of J. P. Morgan Chase rose 13 percent yesterday, but are down 31 percent for the year, the eighth worst performance in the Dow. 
Charter Communications Inc., the cable television company, was up 37 percent yesterday, but remains down 78 percent for the year.
A week ago concerns were growing about whether the economy might fall back into recession as consumers decided to spend less and save more as their stock portfolios shrank. There was also speculation that another interest rate cut would be needed from the Federal Reserve, whose short-term rate target is 1.75 percent. Prices declined yesterday on the futures contracts for the Fed's short-term interest rate target, the federal funds rate, indicating that those expectations were diminishing.
Other positive signs came from abroad. Stock markets rose in Europe before Wall Street opened and gained more on the American rally. The dollar moved higher against both the euro and the yen, as foreign investors showed interest in American markets again. Since the stock market began its rebound last Wednesday, the dollar is up nearly 1 percent against the euro and almost 2 percent against the yen. Late yesterday, the dollar was worth 1.02 euros, up from 1.01 euros Friday, and 119.79 yen, up from 118.85 Friday. 
Another sign of a brightening outlook is the recent collapse in the price of gold, a haven in times of uncertainty. In the last week, the price of gold has fallen 6.5 percent, to $302.40 an ounce. Noting gold's fall from nearly a five-year high, the World Gold Council said some investors were switching out of gold and back into stocks.
Mr. Froehlich also pointed to the recent volatility in the market and the heavy volume from the market's decline last Tuesday through its recent rally as signs of a market bottom. The volatility index of the Chicago Board Options Exchange hit an intraday high of 56.74 last Wednesday, which was just under the peak of 57.31 on Sept. 21, the low point after the terrorist attack.
Daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange was more than 2 billion shares for most of last week, setting a record of 2.79 billion on Wednesday. Trading was lighter yesterday at 1.8 billion, but still well above the average for the year.
Bond prices fell sharply as some investors who had retreated to the bond market for safety shifted some money into stocks. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 111/32 , to 10215/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.55 percent, from 4.38 percent on Friday.
The four-day rally of 13.1 percent in the Dow tops the 12.1 percent gain registered in the four days after the 1987 crash. (The next day the index fell 8 percent, but the market was nonetheless on the road to recovery.)
That, in turn, was the best four days for the Dow since April 18-22, 1933, during the depths of the Depression, when the index leaped 15.3 percent. In that case, stocks continued to advance for several months.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Sales Abroad Push Profit 20% Higher At Honda 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 29 

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company said today that earnings rose 20 percent in the April-June quarter, thanks to strong demand overseas for its minivans and sport utility vehicles. But weaker sales at home, a stronger yen and a potential slowdown in United States clouded the company's outlook.
 Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker after Toyota Motor, remained confident, however, about its prospects the rest of the year. It left its full-year forecasts unchanged and planned to expand production at its plants in the United States and Asia. 
 Toyota Motor also raised its 2002 production forecasts today.
Honda said that global sales rose 10 percent, to 1.94 trillion yen ($16.33 billion), a high for the April-June quarter. It earned 107.5 billion yen ($905 million) -- slightly below analysts' forecasts.
Demand in the United States for the Odyssey minivan, Pilot sports utility vehicle and other cars has been so strong that Honda nearly exhausted its supplies of certain types of specialty steel after the Bush administration imposed higher tariffs on imports of the product. To keep its factories running, Honda shipped several hundred tons of steel to the United States.
The results were announced here today by Koichi Amemiya, an executive vice president of Honda.
Even as Honda succeeds in the United States, its sales in Europe remain relatively weak. In Japan, sales fell 7 percent in the quarter after a strong 2001. Its popular compact cars may have run their course, analysts say.
More worrying, the yen's 12 percent rise against the dollar since February presents problems because Japanese-made cars become more expensive to buyers paying in dollars. A stronger yen can also cut into dollar-based profits that Honda repatriates.
Honda, more than other Japanese carmakers, would also be hurt if the United States economy slumped back into a recession since it sells half of its cars in North America. These worries have cut 15 percent off Honda's share price since May.
"We can not see a very clear view of the North American market," Hiroyuki Yoshino, Honda's president, told reporters earlier this month. "There are changes in the U.S. economy, and all we can do is cope with those changes."
To offset the potential impact from foreign exchange fluctuations and better respond to changes in demand in the United States, Honda will spend $425 million to expand its factory in Lincoln, Ala., so assembly lines there can pump out as many as 150,000 extra vehicles a year starting in September 2002.
The expansion is part of Honda's worldwide effort to develop factories wherever its cars are sold. Earlier this month, the company announced a new set of targets for 2005 that include increasing global sales by a quarter and nearly doubling motorcycle sales.
To meet these goals, Honda will begin building cars in China and Taiwan and expand production in Canada, the Philippines and Indonesia. 
"Their 2005 goals are tall, but they are up to the challenge," said Kazuya Arame, an auto analyst with Sumitomo Trust and Banking.
Toyota raised its global sales target for 2002 by 3.8 percent, to 5.5 million vehicles, with all of the projected gains overseas. To meet the expected demand, Toyota said that it expected to expand production at home by 7.8 percent and increase exports 18 percent.

HEADLINE: Profound Effect on U.S. Economy Is Seen From a War Against Iraq 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29 

 BODY:
An American attack on Iraq could profoundly affect the American economy, because the United States would have to pay most of the cost and bear the brunt of any oil price shock or other market disruptions, government officials, diplomats and economists say.
 Eleven years ago, the Persian Gulf war, fought to roll back Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, cost the United States and its allies $60 billion and helped set off an economic recession caused in part by a spike in oil prices. 
 For that war, the allies picked up almost 80 percent of the bill. Today, however, as the Bush administration works on plans to overthrow Saddam Hussein, the United States is confronting the likelihood that this time around it would have to pick up the tab largely by itself, diplomats said.
Unless the economic outlook brightens, the government could well find itself spending heavily on the military even as the economy recovers falteringly from last year's recession.
Senior administration officials said Mr. Bush and his top advisers had not begun to consider the cost of a war because they had yet to decide what kind of military operation might be necessary. Whatever choice is made, experts say, the costs are likely to be significant and therefore may ultimately influence the size, scale and tactics of any military operation. 
Already, the federal budget deficit is expanding, meaning that the bill for a war would lead either to more red ink or to cutbacks in domestic programs. 
If consumer and investor confidence remains fragile, military action could have substantial psychological effects on the financial markets, retail spending, business investment, travel and other key elements of the economy, officials and experts said.
If oil supplies are disrupted, as they were during the 1991 gulf war, and prices rise sharply, the economic effects would be felt in the United States and around the world.
All of that could present a complicated political problem for President Bush, both in the Congressional mid-term elections in November and as he manages a war and looks ahead to his re-election campaign in 2004.
"I think a good case can be made that voters will want to understand the case for a war or any kind of extended military action better than they do now because the economic considerations are considerable," said Kim N. Wallace, a political analyst for Lehman Brothers in Washington. 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Japan divided the cost of the 1991 war with the United States, but today none has offered to assist with financing a new military campaign. In fact, each has signaled that it is not eager to be asked, diplomats say. 
"Just open a map," said a member of the Kuwaiti royal family in close consultation with Washington. "Afghanistan is in turmoil, the Middle East is in flames, and you want to open a third front in the region?"
"That would truly turn into a war of civilizations," he added.
If Mr. Bush decides on a large-scale invasion plan for Iraq involving as many as 250,000 troops, as some commanders advocate, the country would face a significant military mobilization and call-up of reserves as early as this fall to be ready for a military campaign early next year. 
James R. Schlesinger, a member of the Defense Policy Board that advises the Pentagon who held senior cabinet posts in Republican and Democratic administrations, said he believed that the president would opt for a significant ground presence in Iraq. He said he did not think that fear of economic instability by itself would cause the United States to refrain from trying to unseat the Iraqi leader.
"My view is that given all we have said as a leading world power about the necessity of regime change in Iraq," Mr. Schlesinger said, "means that our credibility would be badly damaged if that regime change did not take place."
The Persian Gulf war cost $61.1 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service, of which $48.4 billion was paid by other nations. 
The House Budget Committee's Democratic staff said that in 2002 dollars, the cost of the war was $79.9 billion, providing a very rough benchmark for what a conflict of similar dimensions might cost today.
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said the United States would come up with whatever money was necessary. But he said planning for a war now would have to recognize the nation's deteriorating fiscal condition and the need to address other priorities.
"While it's not beyond our means, we can't have it all," Mr. Spratt said. "Since there is no surplus in the budget from which the cost could be paid, there will be trade-offs, making initiatives like Medicare drug coverage harder to do, and there almost certainly will be deeper deficits and more debt."
James A. Placke, a former senior diplomat specializing in the Persian Gulf and now a senior associate of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the market reaction to any invasion of Iraq was at best uncertain. "Given the marked lack of enthusiasm for this venture, I wouldn't think the market reaction would be very good," he said.
"When weapons start going off in the Middle East, markets generally go down, gold prices go up, and oil prices shoot to the moon," he added, "and I expect that this is the short-run pattern that we can reasonably anticipate." 
The United States is best prepared among the Western powers to withstand fluctuations in oil markets through drawdowns from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which today holds about 580 million barrels of oil. But Richard N. Cooper, a Harvard economist who headed the Central Intelligence Agency's top analytical body during the 1990's, cautioned that "psychological factors come into play" even in the face of prudent preparation.
He pointed out that after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990, oil prices climbed rapidly from a low of $15 a barrel and peaked at $40 in October 1990, although it was well known that the United States would release oil from the strategic reserve. Prices remained high for more than a year in what many experts saw as a tax on worldwide consumers that allowed Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to pay down the American and allied bill for the war.
"I am firmly of the school that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait precipitated the American recession in 1991," Professor Cooper said, adding that while he generally praised the first President Bush's handling of the war, "the one area of fault was that they dallied on their commitment to release oil supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve."
Last Nov. 13, a month after the United States began bombing Afghanistan to dislodge the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the president's advisers debated whether Iraq should be the focus of phase two of the campaign against terrorism. Mr. Bush directed Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to add more than 100 million barrels to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Since Jan. 1, oil shipments into the reserve have reached record levels, about 150,000 barrels a day. One oil strategist in London noted that United States government acquisitions for the reserve were accounting for more than half of the growth in demand for oil this year.
With a capacity of 700 million barrels, the reserve could be used to disperse 4.2 million barrels of oil a day to jittery markets -- more than enough to make up for the 1 million barrels a day of Iraqi crude lost because of military operations.
"What I am hearing from Washington," said Adam Sieminski, an oil markets analyst for Deutsche Bank in London, "is that serious consideration is being given to a coordinated Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawdown by the United States, Germany and Japan if military action takes place because this Bush does not want to make the mistake his father did."
Still, the fear is that Mr. Hussein, who set afire oil fields in Kuwait a decade ago, might strike out with chemical, biological or radiological weapons at Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer with the largest capacity to expand its oil production to stabilize oil supplies.
"Everybody's nightmare is Saudi Arabia," said an Energy Department oil analyst. "People are deathly afraid of any military campaign spreading to Saudi Arabia." That country contains one half of the spare production capacity in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

HEADLINE: THE NEW SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR: OTHER CITIES; 
Trend of Noneducators Leading Schools

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Perhaps the most remarked-upon characteristic of the new New York schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, is that his career was built not on running a classroom or a school but on running a corporation and setting antitrust policy. In choosing a noneducator for the post, however, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg puts New York among a growing number of cities that have looked outside education for their top education job -- and won good results. 
 Seattle turned to a general. Chicago picked a budget chief. Los Angeles tapped Colorado's former governor. And San Diego selected a former federal prosecutor who served as President Clinton's border czar on drug and immigration issues. Their reasoning was similar: an urban school system with a multibillion-dollar budget is larger and more complex than most corporations and needs the same kind of experienced manager at the helm. 
 "The skills necessary to run a huge urban school district have changed dramatically in recent years," said Eli Broad, a financial executive. Mr. Broad's foundation, which bears his name, is giving educational administrators more business skills and training noneducators to become school superintendents. "They have to know or be trained in management, problem solving, finance, labor relations, systems operations and so on," he said.
In his view -- and in the view of many others -- the nontraditional schools chiefs, in cities like San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago, have been highly successful. But, Mr. Broad added, "that doesn't mean every one is successful. There was a general in Washington, D.C., who didn't work out well."
Both Seattle and Chicago were pleased enough with their experiences to select a nontraditional schools leader more than once. 
In Chicago, Arne Duncan, a former professional basketball player who headed a foundation to help poor city children, is now chief executive of the Chicago public schools, following Paul G. Vallas, who was Mayor Richard M. Daley's budget chief before the mayor moved him over to run the schools. (Mr. Vallas was recently chosen to take over the struggling Philadelphia school system.)
In Seattle, Joseph Olchefske, a former investment banker, was chosen as superintendent of the city's public schools after the death of John Henry Stanford, a retired Army general who ran the school system before him. Mr. Olchefske worked with General Stanford while the latter battled leukemia. 
Sol Hurwitz, a former president of the Committee for Economic Development, a nonprofit organization of business leaders and educators, who now writes about education, says that bringing in an outsider tends to give that person "greater freedom to shake things up."
But he says that a manager without a deep familiarity with education needs to work closely with someone who has that expertise. He says that worked for Alan D. Bersin, a former United States attorney, who made "important strides in reversing the course of a failing system" in San Diego. "His secret weapon," said Mr. Hurwitz, was Anthony Alvarado, his chancellor for instruction, who had made New York City's District 2 "a national success story."

HEADLINE: Filling In the Blanks on Iraq 

 BODY:
With the Bush administration openly threatening to overthrow Saddam Hussein, a public airing of the pros and cons of intervention is long overdue. Thanks to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has planned hearings about Iraq this week, that national discussion may finally commence.
 The senators will hear from a wide variety of experts on three crucial themes -- the nature and urgency of the threat from Iraq, the range of possible American policy responses, and the consequences and responsibilities that are likely to flow from a potential military victory. 
 War with Baghdad would be a major national effort that should be initiated only with the widest possible understanding and support. Saddam Hussein has spent more than two decades entrenching himself in power, relying for protection on a long campaign of repression and a reliable corps of elite troops that still number more than 100,000. It has been nearly four years since his unconventional-weapons programs have been inspected. He is known to possess the ingredients for making deadly biological and nerve gas weapons and has already demonstrated the will to use such weapons against civilian populations.
Any military attack would aim to shatter his command structures before he could launch an unconventional strike against American troops or on allies like Israel or Kuwait. But a quick victory cannot be guaranteed. Military action against Iraq might have a serious economic impact as well. The 1991 war to liberate Kuwait cost America and its allies $60 billion and set off an oil price spike that helped trigger a global recession. This time no Saudi financial help can be expected. 
Removing Mr. Hussein from power could trigger internal rivalries and possible fragmentation inside an Iraq divided between mutually suspicious Arab Sunnis, Arab Shiites and Kurds. In an effort to bridge these divides, the White House has invited a broad range of Iraqi opposition leaders to meet with State and Defense Department officials in Washington next month. 
Wisely, Senate Republicans have worked closely with the Democratic committee chairman, Joseph Biden, in planning this week's hearings. The White House has been similarly cooperative. Further exploration of these issues will be needed after the Senate returns from its August recess. Before any major decisions are taken, the nation needs to learn as much as it can about the available choices on Iraq and their likely consequences.

HEADLINE: Funeral Begets Funeral in Edgy West Bank 

BYLINE:  By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: HEBRON, West Bank, July 29 

 BODY:
Fourteen-year-old Niveen Jamjoum, shot dead in violence that began during the funeral procession for a Jewish settler on Sunday, was buried here today in a small cemetery behind a school.
 "Farewell, sister," cried Marwan Jamjoum, 25, as the teenager's body was lowered into the ground, shrouded in a bloodstained sheet. "The girl is gone." 
 Ms. Jamjoum, the youngest of nine children, was shot as she sat on a staircase while Jewish settlers hurled stones and opened fire at Arab homes during the funeral for Elazar Leibovich. He was a sergeant in the Israeli Army and among four settlers who were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a roadside ambush on Friday. 
The successive funerals here were stark evidence of the continuing impasse in efforts to end the raging violence, which has taken the lives of nearly 1,500 Palestinians and more than 550 Israelis since the Palestinian uprising erupted 22 months ago.
There were scattered signs today of attempts to break the stalemate. 
The Israeli defense minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, said he expected to start security talks with Palestinian officials this week.
Yasir Arafat said after a meeting with the American civil rights leader Jesse L. Jackson that efforts would continue on arranging a cease-fire by Palestinian factions. Those talks were disrupted by an Israeli bombing in Gaza last week that killed a Hamas leader and 14 other people.
On Sunday the office of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced measures to ease conditions for Palestinians, whose economic crisis is deepening. The steps included shortening curfews, which have kept 700,000 people confined to their homes in seven occupied West Bank cities; removing some checkpoints, and allowing 12,000 Palestinian laborers to come into Israel to work.
There were conflicting reports about whether another conciliatory gesture, the transfer to the Palestinian Authority of more than $15 million in tax revenues frozen during the uprising, had taken place as planned.
In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, residents fed up with 40 days under curfew defied the ban for the second day. Shops, markets and banks opened and people went in the streets to buy supplies, responding to a call by the city's governor, Mahmoud Aloul, who said the action was "a form of civic resistance." The Israeli Army did not intervene, but stayed on the edge of the city.
 Early on Tuesday, a Palestinian stabbed and seriously wounded a Jewish settler and his wife in a house in Itamar, near Nablus, rescue officials and Israel Radio told The Associated Press. Security guards at the settlement reportedly killed the infiltrator. 
The curfew in Nablus has been formally lifted five times, and curfews have been lifted more frequently in other cities. 
In Hebron the curfew was lifted today, and streets were jammed. Mourners gathered at a mosque for the funeral of Ms. Jamjoum, and a few dozen people marched behind her body, briefly chanting slogans.
Marwan Jamjoum said his sister had been killed as she sat on an open landing between the second and third floors of their house. On the street below, the settlers' funeral procession had turned into a rampage.
"They kicked in the door to the house," he said. "I was gathering my brothers to hide them, when the settlers shot my sister on the stairs. She was right next to me, and she was hit in the head. The settlers were about 15 meters away. The soldiers didn't do anything to stop them."
News photos published in Israeli newspapers today showed soldiers and border police officers standing next to settlers as they hurled stones and fired their weapons. In one image, a military policeman holds his ears as a settler standing behind him fires his M-16 rifle. 
Ms. Jamjoum's brothers remembered her today as a lively, bright girl who dreamed of studying abroad. They showed her picture: a short brown-haired girl posing under a tree during a family trip to Jericho.
The brothers said their father had been compelled to earn a meager living selling vegetables from a cart after his market stall, located near a Jewish settlement enclave, was seized by settlers who took over the building.
Mr. Ben-Eliezer, the Israeli defense minister, called the settlers' rampage on Sunday "a Jewish riot."
"It's just as well the army and the Israeli police brought it under control," he said on Israeli Army Radio. "Otherwise, something terrible could have happened."

HEADLINE: Democratic Aspirants Accuse Bush of Economic Blunders 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Setting out potential lines of attack to use against President Bush in the 2004 election, a parade of prospective Democratic presidential candidates yesterday assailed Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, accusing him of squandering a thriving economy left for him by President Bill Clinton to pursue policies that benefited wealthy Americans.
 One potential candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, also explicitly attacked Mr. Bush's handling of the war in Afghanistan, saying that his policies had allowed members of Al Qaeda to escape. 
 The Democratic presidential contenders for 2004 -- along with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who drew a more enthusiastic reception than any of the others with a hard-hitting 45-minute keynote speech -- appeared at a meeting in New York of the Democratic Leadership Council, an influential group of moderate Democrats whose founders include Mr. Clinton.
The prospective candidates mocked efforts by Mr. Bush and Republican leaders to blame Mr. Clinton for the corporate abuses that have recently emerged, denounced Mr. Bush's successful push for tax cuts as fiscally irresponsible and invoked the Clinton era as a far more prosperous and settled time for the nation than today.
The breadth and intensity of the attacks suggested that the political climate had changed in the months since the attack on the World Trade Center, and a growing sense among Democrats that Mr. Bush was, notwithstanding his high favorability rating, viewed as vulnerable for a number of his policies.
"In the months since Dec. 2, the day Enron declared bankruptcy, the president has shown little or none of the moral clarity and strength of purpose he demonstrated in the aftermath of Sept. 11," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. "In fact, when it comes to the economy and the current crisis in confidence, the president and his Republican friends in Congress have responded with timidity instead of toughness, with obsolete ideas and outdated ideologies and with special favors for special interests."
The one Democrat notably missing was Al Gore, a founder of the council. Mr. Gore said he was unable to attend because of a scheduling conflict. Today, for the second day in a row, Mr. Gore was criticized by leaders of the group, including Al From, its executive director, for framing his presidential campaign in 2000 as a fight against "special interests." Mr. From and other Democrats said that appeal ran counter to the group's effort over the past 15 years to erase the image of their party as anti-business.
For the most part, the thrust of the remarks by the potential candidates and other leaders of the council focused on what Democrats viewed as Mr. Bush's most vulnerable points: his handling of the economy and corporate abuses. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, dismissed assurances from the administration that the economy and the stock market were under control. "Clearly everything is not under control," he said. "The economy is in trouble. And there is no economic leadership coming from the White House today."
Mr. Kerry said: "In the span of a year this administration has literally taken a budget that was in surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. And they have done so with an irresponsible and an unfairly structured tax cut."
The event offered most -- though not all -- of the potential Democratic candidates for 2004 (and for 2008, if one accepts the view of many Democrats following Mrs. Clinton's career these days) an opportunity to display their political skills to an influential audience, while testing out themes that they might want to use in the campaign ahead.
Mr. Kerry challenged the idea that Democrats were the party of domestic policy, as he offered a long attack on Mr. Bush's foreign policy, including his decisions in the war in Afghanistan.
He said Mr. Bush, "when given the opportunity to destroy Al Qaeda in the mountains Tora Bora," should not have turned the task over to Afghan warlords, thus allowing many members of the terrorist network to escape. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, brushed off the attacks and noted that the very policy that Democrats were attacking here, Mr. Bush's tax cut, had enjoyed significant Democratic support when it passed Congress. "The closer it gets to the election, the more the Democrats will be tugged to the left and the more divisive they'll become," Mr. Fleischer said. 
For all the presence here of potential Democratic candidates for president, it was a senator, though not an ordinary one, whose speech drew the best response of the day. Mrs. Clinton, to cheers and applause, said that Mr. Bush was engaged in the "blame game," and to much laughter belittled White House efforts to discredit the nation's economic performance in the 1990's.
"Some have called that record a binge," she said. "Young people able to afford college, and they call that a binge? Millions climbing out of welfare and into new jobs and that's some kind of a binge?"
"I'm reminded of what Abraham Lincoln said when his commanders complained about Ulysses S. Grant's binges: Find out, he said, what kind of whiskey Grant drinks, because I want to send a barrel to each of my generals," she said.

HEADLINE: As Currency Sinks, Brazil Seeks Fresh Aid 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 30 

 BODY:
Brazil's battered currency reached a new low today, as concerns grew about the nation's fragile finances.
 The government dispatched a mission to Washington today for talks with the International Monetary Fund in an effort to calm market fears. Finance Minister Pedro Malan said a deal with the fund to extend or increase its current $15 billion program that expires in December could be sealed "in the next days or weeks." 
 And the central bank said late today that it had earmarked another $1.84 billion, or about $50 million a day, to spend in the foreign currency markets to defend the currency, the real, continuing a policy begun earlier this month that has so far failed to halt a slide. Today, the real ended down about 3.8 percent, to nearly 3.3 for every United States dollar -- the weakest the currency has been since its debut in 1994. The real has now lost about 30 percent of its value against the dollar this year. 
Brazil sent the mission, headed by Amaury Bier, a top Finance Ministry official, and Ilan Goldfajn, the central bank's economic policy director, to Washington after a telephone conversation between Mr. Malan and Horst Kohler, the managing director of the I.M.F., on Monday. 
Haunted by the specter of the collapse in neighboring Argentina, Brazil, South America's largest economy, has been pummeled in recent weeks by market fears over its political future, its capacity to meet payments on its burgeoning $250 billion public debt and mixed signals over whether fresh I.M.F. aid would be made available. 
"All eyes are on the success or failure of this mission," said Marcelo Carvalho, chief economist at Bank of America in Sao Paulo. "What the markets want to see is what type of package it will be." 
The mission to Washington comes amid Brazilian anger over comments made by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on Sunday. 
Mr. O'Neill, who is to visit Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina next week, said on "Fox News Sunday" that Washington would oppose any fresh financial aid, unless he could be sure the money would not simply "go out of the country to Swiss bank accounts."
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso requested a retraction of Mr. O'Neill's comments, and Foreign Minister Celso Lafer called in the United States Ambassador Donna J. Hrinak to complain about the remarks that he said had provoked "profound ill will and negative repercussions" for Brazil on the markets. 
In Washington, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, sought to defuse any conflict with Brazil, saying today that the administration has "great confidence in Brazil and its economic team." 
"The United States will continue to support international financial assistance to Brazil," he said. The United States is the biggest contributor to the I.M.F.
Brazil has already been hit hard by investor fears that a market-hostile opposition candidate will win presidential elections to be held Oct. 6.
Brazil's bonds have tumbled, and Brazil's country risk, as measured by the premium it must pay on capital markets over United States Treasury bills, has soared to over 2,100, making Brazil, on paper at least, a riskier bet than Nigeria. 
All those factors have raised fears of a default by Brazil that would dwarf Argentina's moratorium on its $141 billion debt in January. 
Mr. Carvalho, the Bank of America economist, said the fund could provide the central bank with more ammunition against market speculation by allowing Brazil to lower its reserves floor, currently set at $15 billion. The I.M.F. could also extend Brazil's current agreement or could provide additional funds, he said. 
"Whatever the result, it will need to have some projection into the next year to have a calming effect," Mr. Carvalho said. "But that implies some sort of agreement with all the presidential candidates." 
That could pose a problem. Of the four presidential hopefuls, the two front-runners, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party and Ciro Gomes of the Labor Front, have both spoken out against a new deal with the I.M.F. before the elections.

HEADLINE: When Makeovers Go Awry 

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
AT 10:15 on Sunday night, the last order of the Russian Tea Room's famous chicken Kiev was placed before Mike Bornstein, 84, who picked up his fork and knife and began to slice. Butter oozed, cameras flashed, Champagne corks popped, and applause rang out as waiters and diners cheered. 
 The chef, Renaud Le Rasle, looked wistful. "If only it could have been like this every night," he said. 
 The truth is, even a full house at every lunch and dinner might not have saved the venerable Tea Room, once the domain of show business and classical music regulars who treated the first-floor cafe as their private clubhouse. For all the sadness and nostalgia pouring forth after the announcement last Friday that the Tea Room would close, the old place had changed.
Marketing specialists preach that tampering with an identity -- a brand -- whether a restaurant, a cola or any consumer product, is a perilous business. When you lose control of a brand, said George Lois, a Madison Avenue legend and a founder of Lois/USA, it is difficult to recover. "And when a brand begins to go downhill," he said, "it's very hard to turn around."
For every Sirio Maccioni, who triumphantly opened Le Cirque 2000 after shutting down his original place, there's a Lutece, whose owner, Ark Restaurants, has struggled to build a new identity after acquiring it from Andre Soltner. For that matter, for every Tavern on the Green, which Warner LeRoy, who died last year, transformed from a rustic commissary in Central Park to a glittering palace, there is a Russian Tea Room.
"My feeling is, they had a well-known name that had no meaning anymore," said Jack Trout, president of Trout & Partners, a marketing strategy firm.
Mr. LeRoy bought the Tea Room in 1995 and closed the place for almost four years, during which he gutted the building and added ballrooms and banquet floors above the dining rooms. After the renovation, costing $30 million, it was no longer the intimate gathering place to spot stars. When the Tea Room re-opened in the fall of 1999, with a crushing debt to pay on Mr. LeRoy's investment, it was as much a banquet hall as a restaurant, and it needed to do a capacity business in corporate events, weddings and private parties to survive.
On that last night, even as old fans like Judy Collins, Tovah Feldshuh and Hal Linden dropped in, filling the first-floor dining room, and former regulars like Mike Nichols and the theatrical agent Sam Cohn phoned in their regrets, the extravagant banquet floors, where Mr. LeRoy put gold-spangled walls, a stained-glass ceiling and a giant acrylic bear, were tellingly empty.
As far as dramatic reinventions go, Le Cirque is a model for success. In 1996, to the collective gasps of New York food lovers, Le Cirque closed its doors after a real estate dispute. Ten months later, it reopened in a new location as Le Cirque 2000, a flamboyant, some might say garish, contrast to its intimate predecessor. As different as these two restaurants were, Le Cirque's real identity emanated from Mr. Maccioni's formidable personality. He was the constant, and he was able to retain Le Cirque's clientele.
In 1995, La Cote Basque, the French restaurant that had become famous as a setting for Truman Capote's chronicles of high society, lost its lease. But its chef and owner, Jean-Jacques Rachou, managed to keep the spirit of his restaurant at its new site not far from the original on West 55th Street. "He moved it to a smaller place, where it was a distillation of itself, and he did not lose its following," said Michael Batterberry, the editor and publisher of Food Arts magazine.
By contrast, when Mr. Soltner, the chef, owner and guiding spirit of Lutece, retired in 1995, the magic left with him. Its new owner, Ark Restaurants, tried to install another chef and personality, Eberhard Muller, to run the place but the match never worked, and Mr. Muller left in 2000. Lutece is still open, but at a restaurant that was once almost synonymous with its chef, nobody knows who the chef is anymore.
On a far smaller scale, Shopsin's, the little Greenwich Village restaurant whose eccentric owner, Kenny Shopsin, and his impossibly long menu and idiosyncratic rules were recently chronicled in The New Yorker by Calvin Trillin, closed last month after losing its lease. When it reopens soon in slightly larger quarters near its original site, a droopy former general store, some Shopsin's fans, and Mr. Shopsin himself, have expressed concern that it will have lost its flavor. 
But Mr. Trillin feels confident. "I'm sure that his instinct is the opposite of the instinct that caused Warner to spend however many millions of dollars on the Russian Tea Room," he said.
Mr. LeRoy's record included transforming Tavern on the Green into one of the highest-grossing restaurants in the country. Tavern does a great business among tourists, and its various spaces also make it a natural for parties. Mr. LeRoy's error, many say, was to try to reinvent the Russian Tea Room along Tavern's lines, to create, as Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant, put it, "Tavern on Carnegie Hall." 
The decline in the free-spending economy and the chilled atmosphere after Sept. 11, of course, did not help the Tea Room.
"Turning it into a tourist and party site, it just set the stage for two bitter disappointments: the lack of tourism after Sept. 11 and the retreat of party planning," Mr. Batterberry said.
Even Jennifer LeRoy, 23, Mr. LeRoy's daughter, who took over as chief executive of LeRoy Adventures after he died, conceded that the new Tea Room was ill conceived. "The thing that I think was a wrong idea from the beginning was that people didn't think of the Russian Tea Room as a place for parties," she said. "It's known as a place for celebrities, not for having these amazing other floors."
Whether it was an economic miscalculation or a misunderstanding of the Tea Room's character, the issue was compounded by complaints from former regulars that their old haunt, the first-floor dining room, had lost its crucial energy.
"I went back at the very beginning," said Robert Lantz, the agent. "But I dropped out. I found the place cold and garish."
"Too much gilt on the ceiling," Mr. Linden observed as he waited to order on Sunday night. Romance dies hard, and Ms. LeRoy is still holding out hope that the fairy tale of the Tea Room, wearing the baubles of her father, is not over. "I just have this feeling that something magical might happen, but I don't know what it is," she said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Suffers Sharper Fall Than Expected 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the economy fell sharply in July, buffeted by the stock market drop, corporate scandals and the slow increase in available jobs, a private research group reported yesterday.
 The research group, the Conference Board in New York, said its consumer confidence index fell to 97.1 from a revised 106.3 in June. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 101.5. 
 But economists said that consumer confidence was still relatively strong, and the decline was mostly an indicator of the stock market.
"This shows that consumers were definitely shaken by the stock market sell-off," said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. "The rebound probably came too late to help out the confidence numbers."
July's figure is the lowest since February, when the index fell to 95.0 during Congressional hearings on the Enron collapse. It remains well ahead of October's figure of 85.3. The index compares results with those of its base year, 1985, when it stood at 100.
The index is watched as a measure of attitudes toward the economy, but analysts say it is not always a good indicator of trends in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of the economic activity.
"For some time, consumer confidence has been a backward-looking indicator of what the stock market has done," said Brian Jordan, economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
"To this point, there have been very few signs that consumers are pulling back significantly on spending," Mr. Jordan said. "We are far away from a recession."
According to the Conference Board, the number of consumers rating current conditions as "bad" increased to 22.1 percent from 19.5 percent, while the number sizing up the conditions as "good" increased slightly, to 20.1 percent from 19.9 percent.
The number of consumers who said jobs were hard to get increased to 24.0 percent from 23.2 percent, with the number reporting jobs as plentiful falling to 18.8 percent from 20.1 percent.
Consumer expectations for the next six months have also dampened, the board said. The number expecting a deterioration in business conditions rose to 9.2 percent from 7.1 percent, while those who foresee an improvement declined to 20.9 percent from 23.7 percent.
The outlook for jobs also soured, with 17.1 percent saying they expect fewer jobs to open up in the next six months, up from 14.3 percent.
The consumer confidence index is based on a monthly survey of some 5,000 households.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Suitor Is Said to Be Ready to Rejoin Global Crossing Hunt

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong has renewed its interest in Global Crossing, the insolvent communications company, and is expected to submit an offer this week to buy it out of bankruptcy, people involved in the bidding process said yesterday.
 A bid from Hutchison, a conglomerate controlled by the billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing, would bring it back into the fold of companies interested in acquiring Global Crossing after it abruptly dropped out of the bidding in May. 
 Hutchison submitted a preliminary $750 million offer for Global Crossing in late January together with Singapore Technologies Telemedia, a company controlled by Singapore's government. Whether Singapore Technologies would join Hutchison in its bid was not clear last night. A spokesman for Hutchison declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Singapore Technologies could not be reached. 
Hutchison is expected to join one or two other groups that plan to bid on Global Crossing. Each bid is thought to value the company at $1 billion to $2 billion, with Hutchison's bid at the higher end of that range, people involved in the bidding process said.
The other groups thought to be interested in acquiring Global Crossing include One Equity Partners, the private equity unit of the Bank One Corporation, and a venture between two Los Angeles investment firms, the Gores Technology Group and Platinum Equity, these people said.
A winner is to be determined today at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a law firm working for Global Crossing. A hearing to rule on that determination is scheduled for Aug. 7 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
Those dates are flexible, however. They could change if problems arise. One of the main sticking points in negotiations with Global Crossing's bankruptcy advisers yesterday involved compensation packages for Global's top executives, a person close to the bidding process said.
Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy protection in late January, listing debts of $12 billion and assets of more than $22 billion. Since its financial collapse, Global Crossing has come under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.
Hutchison Whampoa dropped out of the bidding in May after it clashed with a group of Global Crossing's large banks. At the time, Hutchison Whampoa said its views on the purchase terms "differed from those of the banks and creditors."
In recent days, however, Hutchison Whampoa "kissed and made up with the banks," a person involved in the bidding process said yesterday. Hutchison Whampoa is thought to be interested in using Global Crossing's 27-country fiber optic network to strengthen its offering of communications services.
Earlier this year, Hutchison Whampoa bought a 50 percent stake in Hutchison Global Crossing, a telecommunications joint venture it had with Global Crossing's Asian unit. It renamed the company Hutchison Global Communications this week.

PERSON: Fabien Cousteau 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Heir to an Undersea World, Swimming With Sharks

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
NOTHING like being a dashing third-generation explorer, and nothing like having Cousteau as an ice-breaking surname: Fabien Cousteau has swum with the fishes, the whales and whatnot since age 4, when his famous grandpa, Jacques, strapped a customized scuba tank to his back, dropped him in the Mediterranean, and let nature take its course. It took. 
 At 7, he tagged along on an expedition to Papua New Guinea, effectively joining what he likes to call "the family business"; his first job was scraping barnacles from grandpa's boat. He is still roving, still looking for the explorer's nirvana: an ecologically correct corporation to anoint him its explorer-in-residence. Meanwhile, he is a product-tester -- who but a Cousteau would get a kick out of testing sphere-shaped submarines so cramped that one's breath condenses and falls like rain -- and a correspondent for MSNBC's National Geographic Explorer, for which he just starred in his first special. 
 His cosmic message? Same as granddad's: save the planet, oceans first. This Americanized Cousteau in the lavender Yves Saint Laurent shirt is no stranger to specialized thinking, either. For the moment, he is worked up about protecting sharks: the ocean's biodiversity pyramid will crumble without them! Next, it's on to whales. He blames the Navy's use of low-frequency sonar systems for a recent epidemic of beaching; he says the sonar deafens the whales and tears their brain tissue. He's accumulating evidence. 
He is writing a children's book, "The Prince of Atlantis," based on a dream. He also has a production company, Fabien Cousteau Productions, and is creating an online conservation organization named Planet Riders. He is, at 34, a diversified dude.
Last week, Mr. Cousteau, who is based in New York and had lengthy apprenticeships under his granddad and his father, Jean-Michel, finally led his own expedition. He mingled underwater in the Bahamas with 50 bull sharks and a couple of video cameras. His dive gear is still damp, piled in the corner of his East Side apartment beneath his notion of wall art, a melange of spears from an Amazon trek. He is energized by the dive, which turned out amicably for both species -- those of anthropomorphic bent might presume the sharks deemed the azure-eyed Mr. Cousteau far too charming to rip into. He assesses things more practically.
"I am absolutely certain they don't include human beings as part of their diet," avers Mr. Cousteau, a shark-booster from boyhood, converted not just by his grandfather, but by the fright film "Jaws," which his parents had forbidden him to view. He was about 6 or 7 and aboard a Princess line cruise ship, where his father was lecturing, when he slipped out of the lecture and into the theater to watch the movie on the sly. He was horrified rather than scared. 
"It went against everything I had ever learned about sharks. It made no sense. Great white sharks don't go around chopping up boats," says Mr. Cousteau. "The gross misconceptions we have about sharks are so entrenched, and so convoluted, that we need to straighten them out before it's too late."
He remained sufficiently miffed by that 1975 smear against great whites to use it as fodder for his own documentary, "Attacks of the Mystery Shark." The National Geographic Explorer program, to be shown on Aug. 4, revisits the bizarre events of July 1916, when a great white was blamed for four deaths in New Jersey, two of them upstream in Matawan Creek. Mr. Cousteau, who contends a rogue bull shark was the culprit in the creek, embarked on a whirlwind investigation, from New Jersey to the Ganges to the Bahamas to the Pacific and back to New Jersey. 
"I'm not trying to advocate cuddling sharks," he says. "I'm not shark-obsessed. I'm just saying we should have the same respect for preserving them that we have for, say, the Royal Bengal tiger, or in 40 or 50 years they'll be gone." 
AFTER three decades of aquatic meandering, with timeouts for a formal education (a Boston University degree in environmental economics) and forays into commerce (marketing ecologically attuned Seventh Generation products), he is one remarkably scratch-and-scar-free explorer. Perhaps it's because he has never once been mistaken for shark bait: the ghost of grandpa seems to watch out for him. 
At the end of an expedition, the explorer comes home to a cozy, incense-scented apartment in a doorman building near Sutton Place. The only aquarium is the spectacular three-dimensional affair that serves as his computer screen saver. Mr. Cousteau doesn't believe in cooping up real fish. But he does have a dog, Heidi. His living room is devoted to Heidi's toys, and books with aquatic themes; the coffee-table tomes tend to have Cousteau on the cover. He says he misses his grandfather and France. 
Frequently he visits the family's place at Sanary-sur-Mer in the south of France, one village away from where Jacques Cousteau unveiled the Aqua-Lung in 1943. Mr. Cousteau is more entrepreneur than inventor, but he thinks his grandfather would approve of the adventure series he is shopping.
"My grandfather was reality TV before reality TV existed," he says of "The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau," a pop culture hit. "My idea is kind of an adventure series with a scientific backbone. I share the urgency of his mission in wanting to save the planet so something's left for future generations."

HEADLINE: Hilton Posts Earnings Drop 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 30 

 BODY:
Hilton Hotels posted a 12 percent decline in earnings today for the second quarter. 
 For the three months ended June 30, Hilton reported a profit of $76 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $86 million, or 23 cents a share, for the period a year ago. Revenue fell nearly 5 percent, to $1.04 billion from $1.09 billion. Hilton's second-quarter results met expectations. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had, on average, forecast earnings of 20 cents a share. 
 But the company, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., cut third-quarter and year-end earnings expectations, acknowledging that the economy was not bouncing back as strongly as it had expected.

HEADLINE: Paging Sam Spade: A Gold Coin Fetches $7.6 Million at Auction 

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The 1933 double eagle, a $20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned last night for a record price for a coin, $7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. 
 The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction-house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. 
 As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price "suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong," said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. 
"This is an astonishing new record for a coin," he said. 
In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the United States Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. 
Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the United States Mint, who witnessed the sale, said that "the moneys we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism." 
Mr. Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on "a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending." 
He added, "I am thrilled with the price." The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 United States silver dollar, which sold for $4.14 million in 1999. 
Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. "I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business," said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. 
"This is the Mona Lisa of coins," said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication, with a circulation of 85,000. "It is unique. Forbidden fruit." 
Collectors' Web sites have seethed with speculation about the sale price, and enthusiasts even organized betting pools. 
Last night, Mr. Redden took the podium for nine minutes before the gavel came down, recognizing bidders in the audience and on the telephone. The tension in the crowd was broken with a burst of applause after the $5 million mark, and a louder explosion at $6 million. 
The rumor in the crowd had been that "anything under $6 million would be a bargain," said Ute Wartenberg, executive director of the American Numismatic Society in Manhattan. Most bidders dropped out after that price. The gavel sounded at $6.6 million after a Sotheby's senior vice president, Selby Kiffer, made the final bid for the anonymous buyer on the telephone. The sale price of $6.6 million, when added to the commission, totaled $7.59 million. 
The auction attendance was swelled by coin collectors who had gathered on the eve of the American Numismatic Association Convention, the largest coin show of the year, expected to draw more than 10,000 people to the Marriott Marquis Hotel today. "So the auction was almost like the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the convention," Mr. Stack said. 
Ms. Forer of the mint said the high price for the coin was reached "because it is one of a kind, it is beautiful and it has a great story." 
The coin was the only 1933 double eagle that has ever been legally offered for sale, and its Maltese Falconesque history only recently came to light, thanks to documents unearthed during the five-year legal battle over its ownership. 
In 1792, it was deemed that all gold and silver United States coins would bear the depiction of an eagle, but gold pieces were issued only after the Gold Rush boom, in 1850. They were called double eagles because their face value was twice that of the original $10 gold piece. 
Following the suggestion of President Theodore Roosevelt, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens redesigned the coin in 1907 in high-relief, forever after giving the coins the designation "saints." 
But in 1933 President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard, and ordered all the 1933 saints already manufactured destroyed, save for two reserved for the Smithsonian Institution. They were never declared legal currency. 
But presumably after being stolen by a mint employee, nine double eagles surfaced during the mid-1940's and 1950's. They were seized by the Secret Service and melted down. But before these coins came to light, the royal legation of Egypt turned up with one at the Department of the Treasury, and somehow got an official to issue an export license for the coin to enhance the collection of King Farouk. By the time that blunder was discovered, the coin had left the United States. 
In 1954, after the king was deposed, his coins were sold at auction and the double eagle vanished. It went underground until it came to Mr. Fenton in 1995. His arrest in Manhattan, after attempting to sell the coin for $1.5 million, led to a court battle over whether -- thanks to the Treasury's mistaken export permission in 1944 -- the coin could be legally owned. 
The double eagle came close to being melted down many times. The coin once again escaped destruction when it was moved from the Treasury Department vault in 7 World Trade Center eight months before the building collapsed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Ms. Deisher said the only comparable episode of coin frenzy in recent memory was the 1999 auction, for $4.14 million, of an 1804 silver dollar, the finest of only 15 known to exist. "But the double eagle is fascinating because of all the history and the intrigue," Ms. Deisher said. "And it is unprecedented that the United States government is vouching for its authenticity." 
The mint studied the coin microscopically and matched it with one of the original dies used to strike it, and certified its genuineness. 
The record price was seen as a gift by coin collectors. "Many people believe that our great coin rarities are vastly undervalued in comparison to old master paintings," Ms. Deisher said. 
In a ceremony after the sale, Ms. Forer of the mint declared the coin the only 1933 double eagle ever to be legally issued by the United States Government. This "monetized" the coin, making it legal tender. The buyer will receive a certificate of transfer stating just that, but only after paying the auction price and a fee of $20 for the face value of the coin. 
That made the sale price actually $7,590,020.

Message To Players: Strike Isn't Sole Choice

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
With the possibility of a strike looming closer on the horizon, Major League Baseball's chief labor lawyer sent this message to the players yesterday: You don't have to strike; you have other options available in these negotiations.
 To support his suggestion, which was unsolicited, the lawyer, Rob Manfred, recalled the events of the winter of 1994-95. 
 "There's been only one off-season dispute in this industry and that was '94-'95," Manfred told reporters on a conference call. "The union prevailed in that dispute." 
Gene Orza, the union's No. 2 official, did not dispute Manfred's characterization of those collective bargaining developments, but he pointed out that the players struck during the 1994 season and had the off-season benefit of the owners' miscalculation.
"If he wants to guarantee that they will once again violate the National Labor Relations Act in the off-season, then obviously that's something we'll consider," Orza said. "But we were on strike before the end of the season, and going back to work was the result of their violating the law in the off-season."
Hearing about Manfred's idea after he landed in Dallas, Donald Fehr, the union leader, said by telephone: "Some of management's fondest dreams are just that. We watched what happened in basketball. They got to the end of the season, and management locked them out and instituted a salary freeze. That's the world we live in."
Manfred's comments about a possible strike came after two bargaining sessions in New York that produced no apparent movement. The negotiators discussed revenue sharing, minimum payroll, minimum salary, contraction and debt regulation, and they plan to meet again today.
Time is drawing nearer when the union's executive board is expected to set a strike date, and the date most widely mentioned is on or about Aug. 16.
Speaking to reporters, Manfred was asked if the negotiators had discussed the idea of a no-strike pledge from the players in exchange for a pledge from the owners not to try to declare an impasse in the talks and implement a new economic system. It is the expectation of implementation that is prompting the players to consider walking out.
Manfred said the dual pledge possibility had not been discussed at the table. "One reason there hasn't been a discussion at the table," he said, "is I don't buy the theory that 'I have no choice but to go on strike.' "
The players have the right to strike, Manfred said. But he added: "There are other choices. Everybody has weapons available to them regardless of whether it's in season or the off-season."
A management tactic, if no agreement is reached by the end of the World Series, would be impasse and implementation, but Manfred said: "Impasse is a tricky legal issue as they demonstrated in '94-'95. Nobody signed, and it was a nonevent."
In the last work stoppage, though, the players had one thing going for them that they would not have during the coming off-season. 
When the owners tried to implement a new system in December 1994, the players took their case to the National Labor Relations Board. The board was then dominated by Democrats during the Clinton administration, and it obtained an injunction in federal court that blocked the owners' plan and prompted the players to go back to work.
"If they hadn't violated the law," Orza said, speaking of 1994-95, "the parties would have been left to their choices. We appreciate the suggestion, but I think he's leaving out some details of what happened in 1994, some pretty profound details."
Eight years later, a Republican administration is in the White House, and the board has a different makeup and would most likely back the owners' position.
Before this season, Commissioner Bud Selig pledged not to lock out the players or put new work rules in place during the season or the playoffs and World Series.
"We've decided we're not going to lock out," Manfred said. "That's our biggest gun. We decided it was in the best interests of the game to put that gun away. Don hasn't made that decision yet."
Fehr went to Dallas after meeting with the Houston players in New York. He was scheduled to meet with the Yankees and the Texas Rangers today and the Chicago Cubs tomorrow. He will then have only the Boston Red Sox to update on the talks.
Fehr said the union's executive board would very likely have a conference call next week and could meet in person the following week.

HEADLINE: For More Japanese, Love Is a Multiethnic Thing 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: OTSU CITY, Japan 

 BODY:
With his 50th birthday just around the corner, Masakazu Takagi faced a problem shared by legions of Japanese men in their late 30's and 40's: he had still not found a bride.
 In a culture that celebrates youth like few others, where divorces were uncommon until quite recently and mid-life marriages even rarer, Mr. Takagi's bachelor status might once have been permanent. But, determined to preserve his family line, he scoured virtually all of East Asia on the Internet and settled on a bride in distant northern China. 
 They shared no language. They came from vastly different backgrounds, she being of modest social origin in a remote provincial city, Wuchang, and he of solid Japanese middle-class roots from this town near Kyoto. But after an intricate, long-distance courtship, they married last October, and if the "ever after" has not been so long yet, they both still enthusiastically proclaim themselves happy. 
If America's national ideal involves a melting pot, Japan's has long revolved around a near-classless mono-ethnicity. 
But with its population shrinking, more people are concluding that marriage with a foreigner is the best answer for their loneliness -- and, in consequence, they are a new force for the opening of this quintessentially insular country.
What is more surprising still is that China, which traditionally aroused more prejudices and suspicions here than any other nation, has become the country of choice for foreign spouses. 
"By the time a man reaches his 40's, it is almost impossible to find a Japanese bride in her 20's or early 30's," said Mr. Takagi, a groundskeeper for an industrial company in Otsu, explaining why he settled on a Chinese wife. "Besides, to attract a Japanese woman these days requires a high standard of living.
"What I discovered is that Chinese actually resemble Japanese quite a bit: the food is somewhat similar, they use chopsticks, the languages use many of the same characters."
Mr. Takagi's courtship was conducted through an Internet marriage agency and cost him nearly $20,000, including several visits to her. He said his only reservations involved Japan's imperial conquest of Manchuria, including his wife's hometown, in the 1930's, which he feared might make her family hate him.
Blushing throughout a lengthy interview in which she spoke through a Chinese interpreter, the bride, Yang Takagi, said the only prejudice she held toward Japanese people before coming here was that "they all think alike." The couple communicate through fragmentary sentences and written phrases using the Chinese characters their languages share.
Such entente is a far cry from the xenophobic bile of one of Japan's most popular politicians, Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara, who calls Chinese immigration a source of "genetic pollution." 
Every day news reports blame Chinese people for crime in Japan, often without substantiation. International marriages get copious bad press. The reports often focus on the duping of unsuspecting husbands through Chinese visa scams, on the violations of student visas (the biggest source of Chinese newcomers) and on the divorces and broken homes in mixed marriages.
But such negativism has done nothing to discourage the trend. In 2000, there were 36,263 international marriages in Japan, or 4.5 percent of the total registered, according to official data. The number might strike an American or Western European as modest, but it is six and a half times the figure just 30 years ago. In the last decade, the number of Chinese spouses rose about tenfold.
According to Kimiaki Kogure, the owner of the Internet agency that Mr. Takagi used, the international marriage boom is just beginning. 
"Already there are over 200 international marriage agencies in Japan, and at least 107 of those specialize in Chinese introductions," said Mr. Kogure, who has brought together 10 couples in the last 18 months. "Ten years ago, Korean women were very popular here, but Korea has become much stronger economically, so they aren't so interested in Japanese men anymore. These days it is Chinese people who cause Japanese to dream." 
International marriage began to grow in the 80's in response to the emptying of the countryside as Japan became increasingly affluent. Rice farmers, unable to find Japanese brides, started marrying women from poorer Asian countries, particularly the Philippines. 
Today's growth in international marriage, however, is mostly urban, with exchange-student liaisons accounting for many romances.
Many Japanese women marry outside of the country, typically when studying or working in the United States or Europe. Although no official statistics are kept on such marriages, many of those women are thought to live permanently outside Japan. 
Japan has 1.5 million foreigners, a tiny figure for a country of 126 million. Almost a million are Koreans and Chinese, most of whose families have lived here for generations, but because of Japan's exclusive cultural practices and arduous naturalization laws, they are still considered outsiders.
"If you look at it from the national bureaucrat's point of view, China is a big problem, a major challenge to Japan," said J. Sean Curtin, an expert in family studies at the Japan Red Cross University, in Hokkaido. "If you look at it from the point of view of most young people, though, China has become an interesting place, with a fairly positive image. What we are seeing with these marriages looks like the beginning of a more multi-ethnic Japan, and that is the only way Japan will get over its isolationism." 
For a country whose population is expected to decline by 20 percent over the next 50 years, many experts say, overcoming prejudices against foreigners and opening the doors to immigration are rapidly becoming matters of national survival. Already, 1 in 10 Japanese marriages in Tokyo involves a foreigner.
Masazaku Tada, a 32-year-old software company executive from a conservative family background, keenly remembers his expectations when he first met the Chinese colleague, Hairong Lu, who became his wife.
"At first I thought it would be difficult for us even to be friends," he said. "But when she joined my project, I could soon feel the commonalities between us. She had a real sense of determination, which seemed very Japanese."
Both families opposed marriage, each holding up deeply held stereotypes or cultural resentments and expressing fears of loss. Ms. Lu, who is 30, overcame her in-laws' resistance with her speech and manner, which can be impeccably Japanese.
"I haven't felt any special treatment from Japanese colleagues or friends," she said. "Maybe it is because I have spent 10 years here already. I wouldn't say I have never faced prejudice, but it has been a while."
Her husband says the only reaction he senses from acquaintances is jealousy: "She is very cute, and she had a lot of secret fans."
For many mixed couples in Japan, the worst discrimination is visited on their children, who are often mercilessly teased. Here again, many say Chinese-Japanese marriages hold a special attraction because the children at least look like other Japanese children.
Indeed, for many Chinese parents, helping their children keep a sense of Chinese identity in a society that tends to enforce conformity is the biggest challenge.
"I want my children to cling to something Chinese, but my husband doesn't speak the language at all," said Lily Wang, a 41-year-old architectural designer and mother of two, who came here as a student in 1980 and later married. "I speak to them in Chinese and they understand, but they answer in Japanese. My husband really wants them to be Japanese, but at least he doesn't interfere."

HEADLINE: Urgent Task For Rumsfeld 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's remarks today about what would be required to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction signaled an advanced state of debate inside the Bush administration -- perhaps a reflection that time is getting short for decisions that have to be made if the goal is to take action early next year, before the presidential election cycle intrudes. 
 The defense secretary conceded in comments at the Pentagon that other means of dislodging Saddam Hussein were under consideration, among them diplomatic pressure to open his borders to United Nations inspectors and economic pressure aimed at turning his army commanders against him. 
 But in surveying the options in remarks Monday at a Suffolk, Va., military show and at the Pentagon today, Mr. Rumsfeld suggested that those other options were likely to be inadequate, and he emphasized the urgency of the threat and the futility of nonmilitary means for addressing it. 
"A biological laboratory can be on wheels in a trailer and make a lot of bad stuff," he said. He added that any implication that the task of removing such weapons could be "done from the air" with bombers alone "is a misunderstanding of the situation."
In taking a more forward-leaning stance, the defense secretary appeared somewhat dismissive of the United Nations mission in Iraq, saying that its inspectors spent years "milling around the country" and only knew where to look for secret weapons caches "when prompted by defectors." United Nation's officials are likely to take issue with those remarks.
Mr. Rumsfeld's statements appeared to be calculated to press the case for a decision to undertake a large military operation in the Middle East at a time when most American allies and some members of Congress are nervous about instability there. Some American military commanders, under pressure to produce a workable war plan, also have expressed serious concerns about the risks of an all-out assault on Iraq.
The comments may irritate some allies in Europe, who argue that the American "obsession" with war planning, as one French official put it, was undermining the diplomacy being carried out by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan. The United Nations is trying to force Iraq to open its border to a new legion of inspectors called for by the terms of Iraq's surrender at the end of the Persian Gulf war.
The defense secretary pressed his points in favor of ground action in Iraq a day in advance of Senate hearings on Iraq policy and the arrival of King Abdullah II of Jordan. By some accounts, Abdullah is still reeling from the jolt he received when he learned that the Pentagon's war planners were already looking at Jordan as a base of attack against Iraq. 
Stopping in London on Monday on his way to Washington, Abdullah made it clear that he thought that would be a terrible idea and would not allow it, given that two-thirds of his population are Palestinians, already agitated over the crisis with Israel. 
Yet Mr. Rumsfeld will be the administration's point man in guaranteeing that American military forces are ready should President Bush decide on the military option in coming months. War by its nature is a large industrial enterprise for which divisions and air wings have to be activated and millions of tons of weapons, munitions and supplies shipped half-way round the world. Therefore, Mr. Rumsfeld might be expected to be showing an elevated level of concern as a secretary of war who will be judged on whether he can accomplish his mission. 
Top civilians in the Pentagon and State Department have encouraged Iraqi opposition groups to meet in a congress of sorts and to declare their unity and a common political program to replace the government in Baghdad with a democratic and pluralistic one allied with the West.
The Central Intelligence Agency also held high-level consultations with the leaders of the Kurdish minority that now rules in northern Iraq. Those leaders have told the United States privately that they would cooperate in a war to overthrow Mr. Hussein, but only if they see a major American military commitment to finish the job and to establish a new state in which the Kurds would have autonomy on their lands, full political representation in Baghdad, and a major share of the oil produced in northern Iraq. 
Mr. Rumsfeld's deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, reported to Turkish leaders this month that America would protect the territorial integrity of Iraq if an invasion went forward. It was another sign that the Bush administration, while it has yet to make its case to the American public that it is necessary to invade Iraq -- sooner rather than later -- is making quiet diplomatic rounds laying the predicate for military action when Mr. Bush is ready to make a decision.
Changing the government in Iraq has broad support in Congress and among many Americans. That support has not been tested, though, by the unveiling of plans for a reserve call-up, the economic disruption of war mobilization and the impact war planning might have on economic recovery -- as well as the prospect of American casualties. 
At this stage, only Britain among America's allies appears willing to contribute forces or financing for what experts say could be an open-ended occupation of a country riven by ethnic and religious tensions.
Mr. Rumsfeld knows that most of America's allies want it to focus first on making progress to stabilize Afghanistan and to reduce the violence between Israelis and the Palestinians, whose images have inflamed the Middle East against American and Israeli policies. So he pushed back against the doubters, and even invoked the support of the Clinton administration by saying that the policy of government change in Iraq had been around a good many years and that both the Congress and "the prior administration opined on it."

Hindery and Art of the Deal: Little Art, No Deal for YES

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
For Leo J. Hindery Jr., the chairman of the YES Network, not getting a deal done is a vexing, alien experience. By his count, he has done hundreds of deals, but his inability to conclude one particular negotiation has turned into a sports soap opera.
 Four months into the baseball season, Hindery has not persuaded Cablevision to carry YES, depriving Cablevision's 2.9 million subscribers in the New York metropolitan area so far of 81 Yankees games on cable. 
 Much of Hindery's identity is invested in his deal-making skills, including the $59.4 billion sale in 1998 of Tele-Communications Inc., which he served as president, to AT&T.
He is stunned to find himself unable to close a deal with tough-minded Cablevision (he did not know it would be this difficult) and amazed that this has made him an outcast in the cable television industry. 
"I have never had a difficulty like this," he said during an interview in his office in the Chrysler Building in Manhattan. He shook his head of precisely styled silver hair. He wiggled his left foot. "There's been nothing remotely like this. I've fulfilled my goals. It's a lucky record."
"I feel like a failure because YES isn't on Cablevision," he added. "I feel like I've failed the fans. But I didn't fail them for lack of trying."
David Krone, who left as an executive vice president of YES in June, said: "This is out of Leo's control. That's frustrating for him. But he can't make Cablevision do anything it doesn't want to do."
Some senior cable industry executives, formerly allies of Hindery's, blame him for the standoff, saying he is asking far too much for YES.
"In the cable industry, Leo used to lecture us about being reasonable," said Steve Effros, a columnist for Cablefax, an industry publication. "His favorite term was to call things rude. Well, his rude gene came to the surface here."
As YES's chief defender and cheerleader (he owns a 7 percent stake in it) Hindery cannot fathom why anyone, including Cablevision, would not recognize its value, which he said is comparable to ESPN's.
"Take a look at the TV grid in USA Today," he said. "Tell me what you'll watch tonight that is better than a Yankee game on YES?"
Hindery's combination of fast-twitch intelligence, bonhomie and self-assurance can bubble over into grandiosity. He refers to the fight with Cablevision as "more noble than I ever thought it was."
Hindery believes in the inherent power of YES's programming, which is anchored heavily by the 26-time World Series champion Yankees (the Nets are expected to be added in the fall), and he thinks a deal has been unattainable because Cablevision fears that its MSG Network, the former home of Yankees games, and Fox Sports New York, have potent competition in YES.
Cablevision, which refused to comment for this article, has described YES as priced too high to be carried on the expanded basic cable tier, as Hindery has demanded.
The stalemate took Hindery to the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse last week for a public hearing. For the fifth time over several months, he pleaded his case in a public forum; for the fifth time, he did so without the presence of a Cablevision representative.
Hindery delivered a familiar pitch about what he views as Cablevision's abuse of power in keeping YES off its systems.
"Cablevision needs to stop holding its customers hostage," he said. "Let's negotiate today. Let's give Yankees fans their Yankees."
For having preached to the converted, fans applauded him. Of course, they had no one to boo.
Two weeks before the hearing, he had offered to discount the first two years of a contract with Cablevision, but James L. Dolan, the president of Cablevision, rejected the offer.
Cablevision has spurned the terms agreed to by every other cable operator in the region and DirecTV: a monthly fee of $2 a subscriber to carry YES on basic cable. Cablevision has said it would be willing to carry YES as a premium channel. 
Hindery arrived at YES last summer, bringing his reputation for rapid-fire deal-making and his friendship with Cablevision's ruling family, the Dolans. He also imported a cadre of executives who have followed him from TCI, AT&T and Global Center, the Internet subsidiary of Global Crossing. 
Hindery served as the chief executive of Global Crossing for seven months in 2000, nearly two years before the telecommunications company began to be investigated for accounting irregularities by the Securities and Exchange Commission and declared bankruptcy.
"There's no inference any of that related to me," he said.
Hindery has operated as the sole public face of YES; George Steinbrenner and his partners in YankeeNets, which owns 60 percent of YES, have been silent about the feud with Cablevision.
"We're not frustrated with Leo," Lonn Trost, the Yankees' chief operating officer, said. "We're frustrated with Cablevision."
Hindery exudes confidence the way Roger Clemens does. "I'm paid to be confident," he said. "I'm the C.E.O. If I'm not confident, people around me wouldn't be confident."
On weekends, Hindery has the swagger to drive a Porsche GT3 RS at grueling road races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where his car died last month in the 15th hour with a broken half-shaft.
"He's very focused before he races," Peter Baron, one of Hindery's racing teammates, said. "It's like he's in a trance." Recently, Hindery and group of private investors talked to Daniel Doctoroff, New York City's deputy mayor for economic development, about building a Nascar track at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. The city has made no commitment.
There is an air of mystery about Hindery. Four years ago, in an interview with The New York Times, he offered a narrative about his early life -- saying that he left home at age 13 and joined the merchant marine at 16 -- that was at odds with the recollections of his mother and brother. Hindery declined recently to discuss his youth.
Now, when he talks about personal endeavors, he discusses his race-car driving and his political contributions, nearly all to the Democratic Party and its candidates, which have totaled $924,610 since 1999.
Earlier this month, Hindery's $2,000 donation to the re-election campaign of Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota, was criticized by Wellstone's Republican opponent, Norm Coleman, the former mayor of St. Paul.
Coleman's campaign tied the donation to Global Crossing's problems, but Wellstone did not return the money because Hindery made the contribution long after leaving the company, a campaign spokesman said.
Hindery's fight with Cablevision is taking place against a backdrop of his friendship with James Dolan, which grew out of TCI's sale of cable systems to Cablevision in 1997. Although some people who know them say Hindery has overstated their relationship, Hindery said he still views Dolan as a "little brother."
In January, Hindery gave Dolan an expensive toaster as a wedding present. Shortly after YES filed its lawsuit against Cablevision in late April, Dolan sent back a new, unused toaster, with a note saying, "Thanks for your so-called friendship."
The YES-Cablevision war has not endeared Hindery to some top executives in the cable industry -- colleagues and friends, he believed. They scorned him at an industry convention in May and sided with Cablevision.
Paradoxically, some of his critics run companies that carry YES, like AOL Time Warner's local cable systems and Cox Communications.
"Good partners don't say, 'Here's the contract, here are the terms, do it or we'll sue you,' " William Schleyer, the chairman of AT&T Broadband, which is carrying YES, said at the convention.
Glenn Britt, the chairman of Time Warner Cable, also said at the time: "We support the Dolans 100 percent. They're doing the right thing."
Fred Dressler, executive vice president of Time Warner Cable, said recently that $2 a subscriber is "the most egregious of a lot of egregious things in the sports area." He said that a fair price was 50 to 75 cents a subscriber -- a range that Cablevision finds appropriate. 
Yet Time Warner elected to carry YES, Dressler said, because it did not want a consumer revolt so soon after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The contracts signed by all of the cable operators and DirecTV allow their rates for YES to be reduced if Cablevision gets a lower price from YES.
To those cable operators who publicly excoriated him, Hindery wrote letters regretting the incivility of the criticism and questioning why he was singled out. He reminded some executives of networks like MTV and Discovery of his support when he was at TCI.
"I cannot tell you how many times I defended the rate structures of TNT and TBS" and "their right to be in basic," he wrote to Jamie Kellner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting.
The opposition stings Hindery, who is usually praised for how he reformed the byzantine way in which TCI once did business and for being supportive of industrywide efforts regarding AIDS, workplace diversity, and gay and lesbian partnership benefits.
David Mixner, a gay Democratic Party activist and fund-raiser, said: "One day, he had me, openly gay, talk to about 400 TCI lineman, at 7:30 in the morning in Denver, about diversity. I said, 'Are you nuts?' And he said, 'Don't worry.' And he stood right by me."
Hindery feels as if the industry he loves has betrayed him. "I feel like a pariah," he said. "One of the saddest consequences of this is that it has become a personal thing."
Two friends said that Hindery is too thin-skinned and, because his YES duties are not onerous, he has too much time to react to criticism.
"I'm saddened that he's taken this personally," said Michael Willner, a friend who runs Insight Communications, a cable TV company. "But this isn't about love. It's about business."

People around here can recite the names as though they were family. There was the Dellwood, down in Roundtop. The Mohican House, over in Acra. The Pleasant View, not to be confused with the Pleasant Acres, and the Pine Crest, not to be confused with the Pine Springs. There was the Breezy Knoll and the Alberta Lodge and, of course, the Jolly House.
 With brochures featuring swimming pools that looked larger than Lake George, these resorts lured the sweat-glistened of downstate to the cool mountains of Greene County: the less-familiar Catskills. While Jewish vacationers flocked to the borscht belt to the southwest, the Italians and Germans and Irish created their own enclaves here, where the staples were ziti and sauerbraten, not borscht. They offered cheap escape -- hayrides and boccie, shuffleboard and step dances -- and, as the people here say, they did some business in their day. 
 But dusk has fallen on their day. Now, a meandering drive through the Greene County hills in midsummer, once the height of the resort season, becomes a kind of archaeological expedition into the recreational habits of a distant civilization. In deserted, weed-strewn lots, rusted neon signs promise nightly entertainment, as wildflowers sprout from the cracks of bone-dry pools. Some resorts have been converted into cheap apartments; others have become retreat centers for religious organizations. 
Then there are the ones that have simply vanished, leaving former guests to wonder whether the good times they remember were real or imagined.
Some family-run ethnic resorts continue to operate. German-Americans gather in Roundtop, Irish-Americans frequent East Durham, and here and there are resorts catering to Italian-Americans. The most successful have learned to provide nonstop activities to a generation of guests not content with a book, an Adirondack chair and the croaking lullaby of tree frogs.
But for every resort still ringing a dinner bell, there is a Pleasant Acres. In 1927, the Sausto family opened a modest boarding house in Leeds that by the early 1970's had become a 160-room resort, with a loyal clientele of working-class families from Long Island, New Jersey and the five boroughs. Many Italian-American families passed on the Pleasant Acres experience -- a week in July, two in August -- like some cherished heirloom.
Last summer, though, was the last for Pleasant Acres. Joseph Sausto, the founders' grandson, said that factors known in the resort industry as the three A's -- air-conditioning, airlines, and assimilation -- mortally wounded his business. Air-conditioners replicated the cool of the mountains, airline deregulation made trips to Disney World more affordable, and time blurred ethnic distinctions.
There is also the setting, he said. Greene County, two hours north of New York City (with no traffic), offers verdant mountains, bracing creeks and the Rip Van Winkle legend; the thunderclaps actually do sound like celestial bowling. But beyond the tired look of its villages, it has no ocean, no major tourist attraction -- other than a 69-year-old game farm -- and no viable plans for a casino. The Pataki administration and the State Legislature hopscotched the county last year when they announced plans for casinos in western New York and the Catskill counties of Sullivan and Ulster.
So, Mr. Sausto said, he sold the 90-acre property -- everything from its Boccie Tavern to the map of Italy hanging on its main building's wall -- to the operator of a Jewish boys' camp. And for the first time in his 41 years, his summer nights do not ring with the sounds of others on vacation.
"We talk about it all the time," he said. "But tastes change."
The stories behind many of Greene County's blue-collar resorts follow the Sausto paradigm: immigrant grandparents moved to the country, built a cabin or two, invited acquaintances to escape the sweltering city -- and a family business was born. The Italians gravitated toward Cairo, the Scandinavians gathered in Greenville and the Jews who didn't go to the borscht belt headed to Tannersville. 
The resorts advertised in the ethnic newspapers of New York City and churned out postcards by the thousands. Raymond Beecher, the 86-year-old county historian, flipped through old postcards kept in the county archives the other day, pausing occasionally to ponder some long-gone resort's attempt at distinction. The Mountain Spring Farm boasted that it was "The nearest thing to Ireland," while Mannell Acres bragged that "Our German-American table is well supplied."
Although there were certain constants, like swimming pools, the resorts had distinct personalities. The Pine Springs in Freehold had a kind of finger-snapping swagger, with nightclub acts and house bands. The Shepard Farm in Greenville, though, frowned on alcohol consumption. ("Those depending on stimulants for their fun should select a hotel where beer and liquors are sold," advised one of its brochures. "We do not have a bar and cater only to guests who do not require it.")
These personalities were not always pleasant. Up until the 1930's, a few resorts circulated brochures expressing a preference for gentiles.
Who knows when the decline began? Maybe it was when the Rose Haven in Acra burned down three decades ago, never to be rebuilt; all that remains is a weed-tangled sign, "Orchestra -- Cocktail Lounge," and the ghost of a pool. Or maybe it was when the Sugar Maples in Maplecrest closed its doors, leaving a complex of shuttered buildings that still dominates the hamlet. The expectations of customers changed. ("They wanted drastic things," said Donald Teator, the Greenville historian and a former resort bartender. "Like their own showers.") Longtime customers began coming for just the weekend, and then not at all. The magic evaporated somehow from the come-hither neon signs along Routes 23 and 32.
"Greene County sort of slipped back," said Gunther C. Ohm, a county legislator. "It is what it is. You see the people passing through, slipping up toward Saratoga or Lake George."
Nonprofit religious organizations from New York City and New Jersey have bought a few resorts, stirring some local resentment, because a few places seem to continue to operate as resorts even after they are bought by tax-exempt groups. "That's a problem," acknowledged Peter Markou, the county's director of economic development. "But if somebody's not making it, they have every right to sell."
The trend is jarring for those with long memories. The finger-snapping place called Pine Springs is now the Miracle Mountain Christian Resort, owned by the Salvation and Deliverance Church of Harlem. Its brochure says that the resort is open to Christians of all denominations and offers the standard getaway accommodations -- from a fitness center to V.I.P. suites with Jacuzzis.
But focusing on a niche market does not guarantee success, said Cam Mills, the on-site manager. "Nobody does mom-and-pop stuff anymore," he said, standing at the edge of the quiet, deserted resort. "No one does picnics anymore. We've got a pool, but Disney has a pool."
There are still resorts that are generations old sprinkled throughout the mountains, including here in Greenville. The Sunny Hill resort has a golf course now, and arranges trips to tourist attractions well outside Greene County. Baumann's Brookside offers Sunday morning table tennis, Wednesday evening marshmallow roasts and Friday night costume parties.
And the Balsam Shade is in mid-blur of yet another summer. There, in a sun room, Jyl and Len DeGiovine paused to consider the odd nature of their business, which is to create excitement daily in a slumbering Catskills county.
"I'll run the climbing wall for the guests, and she'll run the boccie tournament," said Mr. DeGiovine. "I'll take them white-water rafting, and she'll take them to Saratoga."
This is the life that Mrs. DeGiovine, 48, has always known; her grandfather, Burdette Griffin, opened the Balsam Shade in 1935. But maintaining the business has become harder in recent years. She and her husband have expanded their season to nearly six months from four, she said, and are always hunting for new ideas. A few years ago, for example, they started an August balloon festival.
"We're making it," she said. "But we worry."
Outside, thunder rolled through the foothills and rain slashed against the windows. Inside, children dashed about the lobby, waitresses set out silverware for a spaghetti dinner, and the DeGiovines reminisced about how the nightclub at Pine Springs used to rock. How the guests at the Shepard used to hide their beer in the toilet tanks. How the Colonial Manor became The Love of Jesus Family Center. How one very popular resort never recovered from a fire.
"That poor place," Mrs. DeGiovine said.
