Stocks Post Modest Gains In Advance to New Records
Stocks drove farther into record territory, again bolstered by second-quarter earnings reports that were strong or better than expected. The gains, however, were modest: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.79 points, to 9,337.98; the Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 2.70, to 1,186.69, while the Nasdaq composite climbed 8.20, to 2,008.76.
Still, yesterday was the third time this week that the Dow, S.& P. and Nasdaq set records on the same day; before this week, the last time the three measures reached highs together was on April 21. For the week, the Dow rose 2.6 percent; the S.& P. 500, 1.9 percent, and the Nasdaq, 3.4 percent. Page D4. 

Treasury prices slipped in quiet trading, hurt in part by a weaker dollar. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.74 percent, from 5.72 percent on Thursday and from 5.62 percent a week ago. D4.
 
Arbitrator Set for G.M. and Union
General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union agreed to meet with an arbitrator on Wednesday over the legality of the union's strikes in Flint, Mich.

HEADLINE: Passenger Service Workers Unionize at United Airlines

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In the biggest unionization victory in the private sector in two decades, about 19,000 reservations takers, gate agents and ticket sellers at United Airlines will become members of the International Association of Machinists, Federal officials announced yesterday.
Federal labor officials said a majority of United's passenger service workers had voted to unionize, following a yearlong campaign in which the machinists emphasized that United's profits had rebounded while the country's largest airlinehad maintained a wage system in which thousands of its 93,000 workers earned less than $15,000 a year. 
 The organizing drive was unusual in its scope and logistics because it involved campaigning in 16 reservations centers and 113 cities.
Union leaders said the triumph demonstrated that labor's stepped-up recruiting efforts were paying off and that service sector workers and white-collar workers were fertile territory for organizing.
Martin Malin, a labor relations specialist at Chicago-Kent Law School, said, "Obviously, it's a tremendous boost to organized labor particularly in light of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s big emphasis on organizing more employees."
The unionization vote was also unusual because it came at a company that is often described as the nation's largest employee-owned corporation -- employees own slightly more than half the shares.
The employee stock ownership plan was set up in 1994 by management with the cooperation of the pilots and machinists unions, with the goal of solidifying United's finances and increasing job security. But the plan left many nonunion passenger service workers fuming because they received fewer shares than the unionized workers and because the plan created a three-tier wage system, with the lowest tier, more than 40 percent of employees, receiving fewer vacation and sick days and a less generous health plan than other workers.
"The most interesting thing about this story is that the ESOP created an appetite for union representation," said Christopher Mackin, president of Ownership Associates, a business in Cambridge, Mass., that advises companies on employee stock ownership plans. "This is a lousy deal that was cut. These passenger-service workers had a sense that we own a substantial amount of this place, and everybody else is represented, and we're not."
Officials at United, a company based in Chicago that is a subsidiary of the UAL Corporation, insisted that they did not oppose the drive. Nonetheless, many United workers said their supervisors argued against the union, although these workers acknowledged that United, perhaps because it is largely employee-owned, did not fight the union with nearly as much vigor as most employers.
"We applaud the I.A.M. for an effective campaign," said John Edwardson, the president of United. "We will work with the I.A.M. closely and cooperatively to negotiate a fair and equitable contract."
The Railway Labor Act governed the unionization effort and required that for the union to win, more than half of all the passenger-service workers mail in ballots supporting unionization. There were 17,938 eligible voters and 9,485 cast their ballots for the machinists and 34 for other unions. Union officials said 1,000 other workers hired since March 21 will be part of the bargaining unit.
According to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the National Labor Relations Board, the victory is labor's biggest private-sector victory since 19,000 workers at the Newport News shipyard voted to unionize in 1978.
"This win is a great harbinger of labor's new vitality and appeal," said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "It shows that even in an employee-owned company, workers need unions to ensure they have an effective voice."
The most enthusiastic voices for unionizing were workers in the lowest-paid tier, who usually start at around $6.50 an hour and can climb to a maximum of $8.60, without ever being able to reach the $18 an hour earned by experienced first-tier reservations takers and gate agents. The third tier applies to workers hired after the stock plan went into effect.
"The union will mean better wages and better health insurance," said Marie Scott, a reservations agent in Denver. "The pay scale is ridiculous. In June, I was the highest generating-revenue person in my department. I made $685 in sales in hour, and I was making just $6.65 an hour."
Many experienced first-tier workers also backed the union, often saying they feared that without a union contract, United might cut the pensions and health insurance promised them after retirement. Many first-tier workers also complained that their job was made harder by the high employee turnover generated by the low pay in the third-tier.
As Mr. Sweeney has prodded the nation's unions to do more organizing, they have looked for large pools of workers who would respond to their message, and, not surprisingly, many unions have focused on the passenger-service workers. They are the only part of the airline industry that is not already unionized. In addition, the passenger-service workers have often lost their jobs or seen their benefits reduced as a result of downsizing, mergers or economics.
"These workers are so concerned about the volatility of this industry that it made unionization extremely possible," said Tom Juravich, a professor of labor relations at the University of Massachusetts. "It's a real victory to succeed in a multi-site organizing drive like this. It's very difficult to do, even if the employer isn't fighting you all out."
The machinists sought to unionize the passenger-service workers in 1991, but failed. Labor leaders and experts said the machinists won this time because they threw more organizers and money into the effort, because workers have warmed up to unions and because nonunion workers have grown more disenchanted.
"For a while, unions had a bad rap but it's starting to change," said Eileen Oberg, a reservations agent in Suisun, Calif., who makes $8.02 an hour. "The union will even the playing field and give everybody a chance to make decent wages. It's not fair that I sit next to a person who makes $17 an hour and we do the same job and I have the same work ethic and I have no chance of reaching that salary range."
Last year, Communications Workers of America succeeded in unionizing 10,000 workers at U.S. Airways, and they are confident they will soon unionize 15,000 such workers at American Airlines. The communications workers began trying to organize the United workers last year, but the machinists outhustled them.

HEADLINE: At a Hearing, Nuclear Regulators Are Criticized on 2 Fronts

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE, Md., July 17

 BODY:
In a rare show of agreement, officials of the nuclear power industry and one longtime critic of the industry spent four hours today telling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that some of its rules contributed little or nothing to safety.
Top officials of the commission agreed with some of the criticism. 
 The commission scheduled the discussion with the five executives and a reactor analyst from the Union of Concerned Scientists because it was facing a crisis.
Six weeks ago, the utilities led a move in Congress to cut the commission's staff by 700 people and to restrict its inspection and enforcement activities. That cut was approved by a Senate appropriations subcommittee but eliminated by the full committee. But Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said he planned to hold hearings on the commission's performance.
Shirley A. Jackson, the chairwoman of the commission, said it needed to move away from a system of strict adherence to extensive regulations to a system focused on what was important to safety. Another member of the commission, Edward McCaffican Jr., said, "We have this old, prescriptive, deterministic framework hanging around, driving us to do things that are trivial."
Zack T. Pate, a founder of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, told, for example, how one utility had changed an executive's title from site manager to site vice president. "That took 100 pages of documentation," Mr. Pate said.
David A. Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the system sometimes missed important problems. For example, Mr. Lochbaum said, workers in Michigan dismantling Big Rock Point discovered that the reactor had operated for more than 10 years with a key pipe in the emergency system disconnected.
The industry is pressing for streamlined regulation partly because of economic pressures. Traditionally, utilities have added up what it costs to run a generating station, and asked state utility commissions to set rates to cover the cost. But with deregulation, many states are telling the utilities to split themselves into companies that generate power and companies that deliver it. The generators would sell power at whatever the market will bear.
California is one such state, and one participant at the meeting today, Harold B. Ray, executive vice president of the Southern California Edison Company, a unit of Edison International, predicted that within five years, half the reactors nationwide would be competing in open markets.
A second trend began today, predicted another participant, Corbin A. McNeill Jr., president and chief executive of the PECO Energy Company of Philadelphia.
Mr. McNeill's company announced today that it had agreed, in partnership with British Energy, to buy the Three Mile Island 1 reactor. The partnership plans to ask permission from the commission in about 90 days, he said.
If the deal goes through, it would be the first time an operating reactor has been sold, but Mr. McNeill and others predicted rapid consolidation in the nuclear-generating industry.
In another sign of how nuclear power has fallen on hard times, Northeast Utilities announced today that it would not restart Millstone 1, the oldest of its three reactors at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford, Conn. It had been shut since November 1995.
The commission has been worried for years about the safety effect of deregulation and economic pressures. But it scheduled today's session after Senator Domenici tried to cut 500 of about 1,400 inspectors and 200 of its 1,600 other employees.
"It is a commission that clearly, desperately needs some oversight," Mr. Domenici told the Appropriations Committee on June 3.
The Union of Concerned Scientists, which is the oldest and most powerful critic of nuclear power, defended the commission and said the cuts would cause "drive-by regulation."
But commission officials freely acknowledge they have problems. Leonard J. Callan, the executive director for operations of the commission, said plant managers often had well-thought-out priority lists for their plants. But if an inspector found a procedural violation and notified the plant, "that trumps everything; they have to drop what they're doing" to address the violation, he said.
The commission's "resident inspectors," who are based at the plants, have been writing more low-level violations in the last few years, officials said. They attribute this to defensiveness among the inspectors since the Millstone 3 plant was shut in 1996. In that case, Northeast Utilities had been committing major violations for years, in direct view of the resident inspectors, who never complained.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL BRIEFING;
Few Seem to Rally To Perot Party's Flag

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Back in 1992, when he first ran for President and his face and ideas were still fresh, Ross Perot finished a surprisingly strong third. Proponents of the notion that the country badly needed a third national party took heart, seeing promise in the billionaire Texan's capturing a quarter of the vote in each of almost a dozen states. In his best state, Maine, he snared more than 30 percent.
But it has been mostly downhill since then for Mr. Perot, his Perotistas and their Reform Party. Much of his reformist agenda has been stolen away by the Democrats and the Republicans, and the nation otherwise is no longer much in a mood to reform, basking as it is in post-cold-war peace and good economic times. 
 Mr. Perot's 1996 Presidential showing was disappointingly weak, and efforts by his supporters since then to expand the Reform Party and field strong Reform candidates in state and local elections have fared little better.
A few weeks ago the Reform Party in Texas, of all places, failed to gather enough petition signatures to win a line on the 1998 fall ballot. And last weekend, when the Reform Party of Maine held its annual convention, a grand total of 13 people showed up for the gathering, in the basement of an Augusta hotel.
"We've been a long way from the highs of 1992," conceded Wendall Kinney, the state party chairman. "But we mustn't lose faith."

HEADLINE: How Good Are These Yankees

 BODY:
MARVIN J. MILLER is the former executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association.
 The New York Yankees' won-lost record to date puts the team on a pace to break all records for major league games won in a season in the 20th century. If the team goes on to win the league championship and the World Series, it will rightfully be hailed as one of the best ever, if not the very best.
 
 The factors involved in such success are generally well known, but some elements are not often discussed or credited in comparing, for example, a team like the 1927 Yankees of Murderers Row fame with the 1998 club. Today's major league baseball had benefited from the breaking down of numerous barriers, giving teams advantages that those of the past never had. A great strength of the 1998 Yankee team is that it has used these new opportunities magnificently.
 The Yankees today are an organization unhampered by a discriminatory color line. They are uninhibited from selecting and medling the talents of players from numerous countries, inluding Cuba and other Latin nations, as well as Japan. And they have made the most of access to talented free agents resulting from the players' union's successful battles to end the reserve clause and to preserve that victory.
 One other thing: The current Yankee ball club, unlike those of an earlier time, had the opportunity to select a manager whose leadership ability and constructive relationship with players had been honed by his experience as an elected leader in the players' union. Joe Torre earned the respect of his peers when he was a player; that made him a brilliant choice to lead this talented club today.

TERRY CASHMAN is a singer/songwriter whose songs include "Talkin' Baseball." His latest CD is "Passin' It On (America's Baseball Heritage in Song)."
 This is one of those good news/bad news deals. The good news is that this circumstance reminds me of my childhood. The bad news is that it's part of my youth that I'd like to forget.
 Growing up as a New York Giants fan in the late 40's, early 50's, I had a hard time enduring the superiority rightfully displayed by Yankee fans of that era. It was bad enough that the Dogers dominated the National League, where my Giants resided, but to have the Yanks in turn beat the "Bums" every fall was certainly a cross to bear.
 What could you say? What feeble argument could one come up with? Even when we beat the Dodgers in '51, the Bronx Bombers took us out in six. From '49 through '53 all they did was win.
 The Polo Grounders and their fans did have a day in the sun in 1954 when Willie, Dusty and "The Lip" beat the Cleveland Indians, one of the best teams (for one season) in baseball history. Things improved somewhat when the Dodgers finally defeated the Yanks in the 1955 Series and the Milwaukee Braves beat them in '57. But in '56 and '58 the Yankees came back to avenge those defeats. From 1949 through 1958 the Yankees appeared in the Fall Classic nine times, winning seven. Talk about bragging rights! Give me a break!
 Well, here we are once again with the Yanks beating everyone in sight. But are they the best team ever? Not yet. Let's wait at least until the end of the season. At the moment my vote for the best team of all time is a Yankee team. But it's not the current incarnation or the '61 club or the Yankees of my teens or Murderers Row.
From 1936 to 1939, the Yankees dominated baseball like no other club ever has. Joe McCarthy's troops, including the Hall of Famers DiMaggio, Gehrig, Dickey, Lazzeri, Gomez and Ruffing, won the pennant four consecutive years by no less than nine games. In 1936 they won by 19 1/2. Their record in their four World Series victories during that period was 16-3!
 Now that was a team. The bad news: they slaughtered the "Gints" in '36 and '37. The good news: I wasn't born yet.

DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN is the author of "Wait Till Next Year," a memoir of growing up as a Brooklyn Dodger fan.
 While historians may rightly claim that this Yankee team is the best ever, no Yankee team will ever loom larger in my heart and mind than the dynasty that won five World Series in a row from 1949 to 1953 to beat my-beloved Brooklyn Dodgers year after year.
 Indeed, so awesome were the Yankees when I was a child that I confided to the priest during my first confession that when I said my prayers each night, I "wished harm" to various Yankee players - wishing that Allie Reynolds would break his arm, Yogi Berra sprain his ankle.
 It was the only way, I figured, that I could help the Brooklyn Dodgers win their first World Series. Lest I seem totally beyond redemption, however, I hastened to tell the priest that each wish for harm was accompanied by a wish that God instantly heal each injured player once the October classic was completed and the Brooklyn Dodgers were champions of the world.
 The wise priest gently suggested that to win in this manner wouldn't feel nearly as good as winning fairly and squarely, which he, a passionate Dodger fan himself, fully believe they would do someday. "You don't need to wish harm on others to make it happen. Do you understand?" "Yes, Father," I said, trying as hard as I could to believe in his words.

ALLEN ST. JOHN is the author of the CD-ROM "The Way Baseball Works."
 Sometimes, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The 1998 Yankees are on a pace to win 123 games, more than any of the legendary teams that make baseball purists genuflect - the 1927 Yankees, the 1931 Philadelphia A's, the 1976 Cincinnati Reds.
 The Yankees may not have a single Hall of Famer - a Babe Ruth, a Jimmy Foxx or a Johnny Bench - but they don't have any weaknesses. Home-road, grass-turf, lefty-righty - any way you slice the stats, these Yankees have no Achilles' heel.
 Their Secret? Synergy. Man for man, they're among the best ever at working the count, waiting for hittable pitches, drawing walks, making the opposing starter endure 30-pitch innings until his arm is ready to fall off. Then the Yankees tee off on the bullpen. That's why they're scoring six runs a game, a figure up there with the Murderers Row Yankees of Ruth, Gehrig and the rest.
 This run support allows the team's starting pitchers to go after opposing hitters, knowing that if trouble arises, a bullpen that's deeper than Kierkegaard is waiting in the wings. No wonder these Yankees have the league's best earned-run average.
 This combination of subtle strengths - patient hitters, crafty starters and unflappable relievers - makes the Yankees virtually slump proof. No, there won't be a candy bar named after anyone playing in the Bronx this summer. But 50 years from now, students fo the game might call the 1998 New York Yankees the greatest ordinary team in baseball history. Or the most ordinary great team. Or just plain great.

FRANK ROBINSON is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and a former manager of the Orioles, Indians and Giants.
 Are the Yankees the greatest team ever? No. I don't think anyone will say so except maybe members of the current Yankee team. They are an outstanding ball club, but they are playing at a time when the competition is weak. Expansion is one reason. Economics is another.
 Nowadays everybody has to watch the budget: most clubs, anyway. This has stretched the talent really thin and weakened rosters on many teams.
 You see a lot fo young players who don't belong in the major leagues and older players who are long past their prime. Toronto has been hurt; so have Oakland, Milwaukee, Kansas city and Minnesota.
 I don't mean to say the Yankees aren't a solid ball club. They have outstanding starting pitching and a good bullpen- not outstanding but good. They also play great defense. They are a veteran team and don't depend on one or two individual stars. And the real key to their success is the depth of the bench.
 Still, I don't think they compare to the great teams of the past. The Yankees have holes. They have a hole at catcher, and another in left field. They lack power at third base - throughout their lineup, in fact. compare them with the great ball clubs of the past - not just the 1927 Yankees, who had Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, but more recent teams, like the Cincinnati Reds and Oakland A's in the 1970's.
 The Reds had Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Tony Perez, Lee May - all power hitters. The A's had Reggie Jackson, Joe Rudi, Sal Bando. The great Orioles team I played on the 1960's and 70's had Boog Powell and Don Baylor. Those teams all had an abundance of power, and that is the most important ingredients this Yankee team is missing.

MARGARET WHITTON is an actress and writer whose film credits include "Major League" and "Major League II."
 Perhaps the question isn't, Is this Yankee team the greatest ever? Perhaps the question is, Do the Cleveland Indians think so?
 I never saw the 1927 Murderers Row, and I was still in my Mickey confusion (Mantle or Mouse?) in the early 1960's. But I was thrilled by the antics of the 1977-78 Yankees and, like the rest of New York, fell head over heels for the "destiny" team of 1996. Unlike most hard-core Yanks fans, thought, I at least admit to having found a back-up team.
The cliche that you always live the movies you make is true; it just never quite happens the way you expect. While researching my character, Rachel Phelps, in the 1989 film "Major League," I found it hard to transform myself into the rabid owner of the Cleveland Indians - until I discovered the 1954 Indians. That season the Tribe set the modern record of 111 wins, helped by an E.R.A. of 2.78. Then (a cautionary tale for this year's Yanks) they gave up 21 runs and dumped four straight in the World Series.
 I got what being an Indians fan was all about - one small step above a Cubs fan. After 1954, of course, it was downhill for decades, and by 1989 the Tribe was awful - the awfulness, in fact, being the premise of the movie.
 But a few years after that film opened, the oddest thing happened: the nucleus of the present team began to rewrite Indians history. And much as it shamed an astonished my Yankee blue heart, I had to admit to a sneaker of affection for the Tribe as well.
 So are these Yankees the greatest? I'm way too suspicious to say yes and ruin things. But if they all stay healthy, and if that United Nations of a pitching staff keeps it up, and if they play team baseball ... oh, yeah, and if they get by the Indians in a short series ... maybe.

The Accidental Office Lady
 By Laura Kriska.
 303 pp. Rutland, Vt.:
 Charles E. Tuttle Company.
 Paper, $10.95. 
 When Laura Kriska was heading to Japan as the first American woman trainee at the Honda Motor Company headquarters, she thought she had landed what she calls her "dream job" -- important, glamorous work. The local newspapers in Ohio put her on the front pages; she bought new suits. Once in Tokyo, this 22-year-old graduate of Denison University discovered the predictable but appalling reality for most Japanese women. She had to wear a uniform, clean the desktops, serve tea to the men and, literally, keep her head down. "What would the dean of my college say now if she saw me dressed like a Girl Scout and using my language skills to apologize for entering the room?" Kriska writes.
"The Accidental Office Lady" is Kriska's account of her two years at Honda, from her initial job as a secretary, or "office lady," in Tokyo through her more satisfying work at the Honda factory in Sayama, two hours northeast. Although the book is another in the plentiful rite-of-passage genre set in Japan (young American attempts to discover country and self), it is a good one -- funny and insightful about the Japanese nanny state.
Kriska comes off as a determined, irreverent and very human American trying to grow up professionally in a foreign country that doesn't want her to. She was born in Japan of American missionary parents, but her family returned to Ohio when she was a small child. She has wanted to understand the nation of her birth ever since. She is likably honest about the inevitable disappointments in her search. Eventually, she starts a campaign to make the uniforms for women at Honda optional, but it stalls.
Kriska is at her best when she compiles little details to describe a nation of anxious conformists. Honda secretaries must completely clear their desks at night, and at no time do they dare display family pictures. Later, when Kriska is working in the Honda public relations department, she amusingly captures Japan's culture of over-
employment by describing a man she calls "Mr. Dan," who works with her for weeks solely on the name tags for a Honda promotion event. Soon she is one of three Honda employees readying the chairs and charts in a conference room -- preparations that consume an entire day. "At least one hour was spent discussing how and where to hang four framed posters of the four generations of the Accord," she writes, "and another hour trying to figure out a way to display the model year on the posters."
The main problem with her book is the fuzzy time frame. The events seem recent, but readers don't learn until page 206, when Kriska describes Honda's corporate reaction to Emperor Hirohito's death, that it is January 1989. Japan has changed drastically in the decade since, tumbling from what was the world's fastest-rising economy through a seven-year recession into the financial crisis of today. Clearly Kriska was after timelessness -- and corporate culture in Japan changes at glacial speed -- but her book would have been more informative if readers could have seen Honda in the context of a booming era, when it was considered the most innovative carmaker in the world.
Kriska ultimately became deadened as an office lady. "The daily routine weighed on my limbs and slowed me down, making the days so monotonous that time seemed to move backward," she writes. But she revives when she is transferred to the Honda factory town of Sayama, and is able to create a meaningful job for herself as a liaison between the Japanese workers and the confused American trainees. When she returns to Honda headquarters in Tokyo, she gets another boost: her uniform campaign has succeeded.
Kriska rightfully sees the uniform change as her biggest triumph in Japan, and in her last paragraph concludes that her native land has deeply changed her. Unfortunately, she doesn't really say how. Still, her book is a revealing portrait of the corporate culture that reflects, and defines, Japan.

HEADLINE: Murdoch

BYLINE: By Geraldine Brooks; Geraldine Brooks, a regular contributor to the magazine, wrote about an Islamic family in December.

 BODY:
Some sons bond with their fathers through baseball, some through fishing. But for Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert, there has only ever been the Business. As a child in London, Lachlan remembers his mother waking him for predawn breakfasts before his father jetted off. As a schoolboy in Manhattan, he recalls nights up late, listening to his father at the dinner table hashing out strategies with famous guests.
In 1990, when he was 19 and a student at Princeton, his father summoned him to London to stand at his side as scores of lawyers haggled over the merger that created British Sky Broadcasting. Walking home afterward at 1 A.M. on a deserted Fleet Street, Lachlan wondered why his father seemed so stressed and dispirited. He didn't know that The News Corporation Ltd. -- the global giant Rupert created out of an Australian newspaper -- had nearly disintegrated under a crushing debt load. 
 "I wanted to put my arms around him and hold him up," says Lachlan Murdoch, running a long-fingered hand through gel-spiked hair. In the weeks that followed, News Corp. successfully rolled over its loans and went on growing, and Lachlan never again spoke to his father of that moment. "We are a family that doesn't look back, always ahead," he says, forming the long hands into an arrow-shaped probe and almost lunging off the sofa of his Sydney office.
Ahead, for him, may be the job of running his father's empire -- if the decisions he makes as chief of News Ltd., the company's Australian arm, are the right ones. A year ago, Rupert Murdoch, 67, called his children together in New York to put an end to the speculation over who would succeed him. He said Lachlan, 26, the third of his four children and his eldest son, would be the one to eventually run a business that includes the 20th Century Fox film studio, HarperCollins Publishers, The Times of London, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Star TV, Asia's leading satellite broadcaster.
Public companies with revenues of $13 billion don't usually operate like
feudal fiefs, but the Murdochs, by keeping more than 30 percent of News Corp. stock under tight family control, have tried to insure that theirs can. Neither the recent, sudden separation of Rupert and his wife, Anna, after 31 years of marriage nor a coming public stock offering is likely to affect the succession.
For now, Lachlan runs the company's Australian outpost from a drab office building at the shabby edge of Sydney's garment district. When he enters the windowless conference room for a meeting on a new printing plant, he is the youngest person at the table by about two decades. The new plant gives the company a long-awaited chance to break the grip of the printers' union. The assembled executives, crusty newspapermen with years of labor battles behind them, are gleeful at the prospect of a final showdown.
But Lachlan is wary. Like his father, he is no fan of unions. But unlike his father, who waged legendary wars with British printers, he recoils from confrontation. "Roll up our sleeves and crash through -- that was the way we used to do it," he tells the executives. "But now we're talking about a change of culture for both sides. You've got to convince them they don't need the protection of the union. And the only way you can convince them is if it's true. I don't want any more bully boys and gorillas on the gates."
When Rupert Murdoch stalked these Sydney headquarters back in the 1960's, rolled-up shirt sleeves were his trademark. He was just 21 when he inherited his father's Adelaide newspaper; employees called him the Boy Publisher.
When the new Boy Publisher arrived in 1995 after a brief stint running the company's Queensland newspapers, he, too, wore his sleeves pushed up. But his rolled sleeves expose a serpentine tattoo -- a chic circlet of blue-black swirls encompassing a muscular forearm.
One Sydney executive remembers an early public unveiling of the tattoo, at a corporate dinner just after Lachlan took over. "It was black tie, average age of guests around 50, and Lachlan took off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves. I thought it was quite odd -- a young thing to do, as if he was with a bunch of 20-year-old blokes at the pub."
The executive, whose company is aligned with News Ltd., has since had a chance to observe Lachlan closely. "His business instincts are terrifically honed. Here's this person who looks like the copy boy -- when you first walk into a room you wouldn't pick him as dominant. But within three minutes you're in no doubt who's the boss."
That dominance was too much for some of the company's most senior managers. "The first thing Lachlan did was knock the empire down around him," says the executive, who watched with alarm as the body count mounted. The chairman, a lifelong Murdoch loyalist, unexpectedly took early retirement. The chief operating officer defected to News's Australian rival, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. Marketing executives, the corporate spokeswoman and a number of senior editors also either jumped or were pushed overboard. "It's hard when proprietors' sons turn up, clomping around in size-11 shoes and breaking all the porcelain," says one former executive.
But unlike his father, Lachlan has a light touch. "He chatted about the football for 20 minutes before he got around to telling me I'd been replaced -- I probably finished the sentence for him," says Malcolm Schmidtke, former editor of The Australian, the only general-interest national daily. Now an editor at Fairfax, Schmidtke, 49, praises Lachlan's conduct in editorial meetings and thinks he's unlikely to play politics with the papers the way his father has.
Lachlan has only tactful praise for the departed executives. But he says the younger people now filling those positions are more willing to experiment and try new things. One, Peter Macourt, the chief financial officer, worked with Rupert Murdoch as part of the company's debt-restructuring team. "You can sit with Lachlan for hours in meetings and think, well, he's nothing like his father. Completely different style, manner. And then suddenly he'll say or do something and, my God, it could be Rupert."
In social settings, Lachlan has a graceful manner that friends say he inherits from his mother. Lachlan is famous for paying attention to the least prominent person in the room, sitting with employees' spouses and making polite chat about their children. "He has the lovely manners that Australian men don't have -- you think of him as the young prince," says Caroline Morgan, whose husband, Ian Frykberg, is more familiar with the prince's Machiavellian side.
Frykberg quit News Corp. in London after a conflict over the tabloidization of TV news. Lachlan rehired him to stanch losses from the company's move into Super League, a rival to the more established Australian Rugby League. "The first time he demonstrates his toughness it's a surprise to most people," says Frykberg. "But he only has to do it once."
Lachlan Murdoch's office is spare, cavernous and unrevealing. Its only personal touch is a desktop picture frame crammed with snapshots of his nieces and a collection of photographs by Edward Curtis, the great romanticizer of American Indians at the turn of the century.
As a steward serves coffee on a Monday morning, Lachlan thanks him by name and apologizes for raiding the pasta supply over the weekend. Like his father, he is learning to live in perpetual motion. He had flown home from corporate meetings in Europe on Friday, attended the inaugural game of the National Rugby League -- the successor to the merged Super League and Australian Rugby League -- that night in Brisbane, returned to his Sydney office on Saturday and spent most of Sunday working on a speech he would give that night at a dinner honoring Asia's young leaders. After the dinner, he slipped away for an 11 P.M. meeting with Australia's Minister of Communications.
Finally, at home, he set about the family networking that can make News Corp. seem like a mom-and-pop business. "We're a private family," Lachlan says. "We don't talk about our personal affairs. But we can talk about business forever." It was 2 A.M. before he reached his father. In between, he called his other consigliere, his sister Elisabeth, 29, the general manager of the company's satellite-broadcast business in Britain. His brother, James, 25, recently appointed deputy publisher of The New York Post, is a further sounding board.
"Most of our interaction is business-related," says James, who describes News Corp. as "intertwined with our lives, inescapable." Like Lachlan, he also remembers the early breakfasts with their father: "Pop had precious little time to spend with us, so the breakfasts were crucial. Of course," he adds, "when we'd get to breakfast, everybody would read the papers. There's still this incredible jockeying for the papers whenever we get together."
James dismisses talk of tension in the family over Lachlan's ascendance, adding that none of them see the succession as a done deal. (Elisabeth Murdoch didn't respond to a request for comment.) "Pop's going to be around a long time and we're all very young," he says. "News Corp. is a big public company with big shareholders who'll ultimately decide."
In recent months, as News Corp.'s stock has lagged behind that of rivals like Time-Warner and Disney, some of those shareholders have become impatient, and have expressed unease at the young man's ascension. The stock offering, in which News Corp. will offer investors a chance to buy into the company's attractive assets, like Fox Television and 20th Century Fox, while avoiding money-losers like Star TV and HarperCollins, has eased some of the pressure. Lachlan acknowledges that he will have to earn the confidence of investors, and agrees that his father's decision is "always open for review."
In Sydney, Lachlan lives alone in the bohemian harborside neighborhood of Elizabeth Bay, where the tiny old apartments of artists and writers rub up against gracious mansions. His $5 million house is shaded by palms, its veranda looking down on his swimming pool and the glistening harbor beyond. In his spacious garage, he has built a fiberglass climbing structure over the walls so that he can stay in shape for one of his favorite pastimes, rock climbing.
At any public gathering in Sydney, you can always find Lachlan Murdoch by following the flashes of photographers. His youth, good looks and extreme eligibility make him paparazzi fodder, as does his propensity for adding tattoos and subtracting hair. "He is media grist," says the director Baz Luhrmann, who became a close friend after making "William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet" for Fox. "He's in the press every day, like J.F.K. Jr." His dates, also, tend to be exceptionally photogenic. The latest, the Wonderbra model Sarah O'Hare, was his escort at the Oscars -- a big night for News Corp., given the triumph of "Titanic," in which Fox had a major stake. But O'Hare is based in New York, and when Lachlan is at home his one constant companion is Grace, his Rhodesian ridgeback.
Australia wasn't an obvious choice for Lachlan. Born in London, educated at Trinity School in Manhattan, Aspen Country Day School and Princeton, he had been to Australia only on vacations, taking summer jobs cleaning presses in Sydney or mustering sheep on the company's spread in outback New South Wales.
"Australia is the home of this company," he says. "Not only is all my family Australian," (news, perhaps, to Washington, which made citizens of his father in 1985, his mother in 1989 and Lachlan himself in 1993) "but so are many of the executives in the company. It's understood that there's a sort of egalitarian Australian culture we've managed to keep."
Lachlan is well advised to stress this Aussie-ness: News Corp., which dominates the Australian newspaper market, doesn't want to be perceived as an alien force. The strategy, writes a Sydney media critic, David Bowman, is to establish Lachlan "as a sort of honorary Australian." Lachlan, says his friend Baz Luhrmann, finds this argument disturbing. "The idea that he's not dealt with as part of Australian culture is upsetting to him. He chose where he wanted to be, and he chose Australia."
But Lachlan also must impress a wider audience of News Corp. shareholders, which he can do only through bottom-line results. News Corp.'s Australian operations are diverse -- a new, state-of-the-art film studio, cable TV, rugby teams and an airline interest. But many of the units are troubled, while the newspaper business is a waning sector of the global company. Australia accounts for 12 percent of News Corp.'s revenues but only 5 percent of its operating income. Thus, Rupert may have handed his son "a poisoned chalice," a columnist from a rival newspaper pointed out.
"It's a poisoned chalice only if there's no way out," responds Lachlan, who says he sees opportunities in turning around the underperformers. He told his father that he wanted to attack the newspaper side of the business first, and in Australia News Corp. has 120 newspapers reaching 70 percent of the market.
It is at The Australian that Lachlan has most clearly demonstrated both his editorial bent (tabloid) and his management style (interventionist). Under Paul Kelly, an eminent political reporter, the paper had given unprecedented space to book reviews, long analytical articles and special sections on subjects like Asian business. Says one senior journalist who joined the paper because of Kelly: "It was becoming the one paper in this country of real intellectual weight."
Although Lachlan studied philosophy at Princeton, he has little time for intellectual newspapers. He demoted Kelly from editor in chief, then fired Schmidtke and brought in a tabloid man. Journalists at The Australian say they're now encouraged to write for a market-researched composite of the advertisers' ideal reader -- an affluent young mother from a gentrified inner-city neighborhood.
Lachlan Murdoch, who refers to newspapers as "brands," makes no apologies for the changes. "I wanted to broaden the readership of The Australian to include young people who are not purely interested in politics, academics and business," he says. "Papers have to be read to be respected."
Unlike most of his Princeton peers, Lachlan read three newspapers a day in college: The Wall Street Journal ("a great brand for its readership"), The New York Times ("a chore") and his father's New York Post ("a great sense of the energy of New York"). He has a simple explanation for the low numbers of young newspaper readers in the United States: "I don't think papers in the United States are very good."
He prefers the British press, where he worked as a copy editor on the racy and often reckless tabloid, The Sun. At a meeting to discuss beefing up The Sydney Telegraph's new Sunday magazine, he refers almost exclusively to the British press. "Look at this," he says, standing at the conference table, flicking through a stack of British supplements. "They're full of ads -- cars, housewares. They have a very clean layout, and the interviews have a spin to them -- 'Why Daniel Day Lewis is getting into boxing.' And here's an interesting picture of him with a towel over his head, working out. It's not just Daniel Day Lewis in his latest movie or what's growing in his garden. It's what's going to pull people in, what's the hook?"
So, what is the hook to a story about Lachlan Murdoch? Certainly not a picture of him with a towel on his head: despite the charming manners that everyone remarks upon, he deflects curiosity about his private life.
His diction is strikingly formal. He embroiders sentences with elaborate locutions: "I expressed to him"; "the dizzying experience of intellectual stimulation." And yet, every time he refers to his father, it is simply as "my dad." He ends their frequent phone calls with "Love you, Dad," no matter who is in the room.
When I ask him what it is like to love someone who is so widely hated, he leans forward on the sofa and clenches his rock-climber's hands into tight fists. "When you know someone, when you know the truth about them -- what's good and right and true versus what's misrepresented -- you quickly learn to ignore it or shut it out. What the criticism in Britain is about is an upper-class elite being scared of the masses. In our papers they see a reflection of society that's not Oxford or Cambridge and they don't like it. There's a fear of democracy. My dad's Australian and that's where they sent everyone they didn't want."
Lachlan describes his own political leanings as "economically conservative but libertarian on people's individual rights." Asked for an illustration of his libertarianism, he talks about cigarettes. "I don't smoke," he says. "But I think taxes on cigarettes are the most outrageous example of the Nanny State. It would be one thing if every penny went to researching lung cancer, but in fact it's greedy politicians using the money to pork-barrel roads or put into the welfare state. People who want to smoke shouldn't be burdened because of the political correctness of our times."
Lachlan wasn't in charge of News Ltd. during Australia's last round of Parliamentary elections. The next, expected later this year, is likely to be one of the most divisive in history, with racial issues like Aboriginal land rights at the forefront. While the temptation to meddle will be strong -- a friendly Government could do a lot for News Ltd. -- Lachlan insists it will be up to his editors to report the election as they see it. In fact, two of his papers are already at odds on Aboriginal legislation. "It's flattering to say I have a lot of power. But the reality is, I don't."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Jewish Daily Forward Building, 175 East Broadway;
A Capitalist Venture With a Socialist Base

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE JEWISH DAILY FORWARD BUILDING, at 175 East Broadway, was built in 1912 as the Socialist paper reached new highs in circulation among its audience of Yiddish-speaking immigrants. The Forward moved out 24 years ago, succeeded by a Chinese church, but now a condominium conversion is under way.
First published in 1897, the Yiddish-language Forward was born as Jewish immigration swelled the New York sweatshops and labor unions. It had close ties to the Socialist Party, taking the name of the successful Socialist paper in Berlin. The first editor, Abraham Cahan, had to leave Russia after revolutionary activities, and it was he who molded the paper into more than just a broadside of ideology. 
 Cahan was convinced that to reach the working-class immigrant, he had to write of daily life, so The Forward included not just world politics but also local news, short stories and a free-for-all advice column, the Bintel Brief ("packet of letters"), with responses from both editors and readers on love, money, ethics and getting along in America.
The Forward Association, which controlled the paper, was incorporated in 1901 "for the purpose of distributing literature, social and economic science." In 1906 the association bought the building at 175 East Broadway, between Rutgers and Jefferson Streets, across from the new Seward Park. Circulation continued to grow, and in 1910 the association bought the building at 173 East Broadway and filed a permit for a new 10-story structure on the two-lot site.
Shortly after that the directors of the association amended their corporate certificate to include operating a building but still "to adhere to and propagate the principles of International Socialism."
Designed by George Boehm, the midblock Forward Building still towers over the three- to five-story houses and tenements in the area. A common story is that it was built in reaction to the capitalist symbolism of the 12-story Jarmulowsky Bank building, two blocks away at the southwest corner of Orchard and Canal Streets, but that building was begun a year after The Forward's.
The cream-and-tan exterior has the same light tones and delicate terra cotta that Boehm used a few years later on the Chalif Dancing School, still standing at 163 West 57th Street. Above the second floor of The Forward Building, a series of relief busts depict four famous socialists, including Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Above them two oversize reclining figures in classical dress against a blue background flank a torch, an image that runs through the building's decoration.
The Forward Building was completed in 1912 -- the same year the Socialist Eugene V. Debs polled 901,000 votes in the Presidential election. In that year The Evening Post reported that Cahan's paper generated thousands of dollars of profit, all used to support working-class causes like organizing consumer strikes. Circulation was 120,000.
In 1922, Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of The Nation, called The Forward "America's most interesting daily," noting that the eight-page newspaper had generated assets of $1 million and given about $35,000 a year to labor and charity organizations.
Telephone directories list among the building's other tenants the Butchers' Union Local 509, the Jewish Socialist Verband (Organization), the Naturalization Aid League and the offices of the Workmen's Circle Cemetery.
The 1920's were the peak years for circulation, which reached 275,000, as the paper served both recent immigrants and those who had moved up and out of the Lower East Side. Shirley Zavin, who researched the building for the Landmarks Preservation Commission -- which designated it a landmark in 1986 -- called the paper "the giant" among New York's Yiddish dailies.
New laws in 1924 and 1929 tended to restrict Jewish immigration, and by 1939 the circulation was down to 170,000.
THE FORWARD has always retained a reputation as a literary paper, and its contributors have included the writers Isaac Bashevis Singer and Elie Wiesel and the artist and writer Art Spiegelman.
In 1963 The Forward began an English supplement, and in 1974 it sold 175 East Broadway and moved to 49 East 33d Street, where it remains. The building was purchased by the Lau family, and for many years a Chinese church has occupied part of the space. The building was designated a landmark just as the owners proposed converting it to a hotel, but the conversion did not go ahead.
Now the building is covered with scaffolding, and the conversion will be to 39 loft-style condominiums, in an alteration designed by Alfred Wen that will include a restoration of the facade. Stephen Lau, acting as agent for his family's company, Chinese Center L.L.C., said that work would take about a year. "We thought now is the right time," he said. "We hope to have people from SoHo or Wall Street, not just Asians -- it's a bit out of Chinatown."
Things have changed for The Forward, too. It prospers now as a weekly, with editions in English, Yiddish and Russian and a total circulation of about 45,000. Samuel Norwich, the general manager of the Forward Association, said the organization completely controlled the Yiddish and Russian editions but had 50-50 ownership of the English edition with private investors.
The bylaws of the association were changed in the 1960's, Mr. Norwich said, and "nobody's accused us of being Socialist in a long time."

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
Thousands May Have Cheered Then, but Now?

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland 

 BODY:
ONE of the better ways to understand your chosen field is through the eyes and ears of those outside it. "As Thousands Cheer," the musical by Moss Hart and Irving Berlin that just closed after a successful resuscitation by the Drama Dept., had something to tell us about the early-music movement. The audience I shared it with not long ago helped explain why the operatic voice is such a hard sell to so many smart young listeners.
Well received on Broadway in 1933 and reborn this summer at the Greenwich House Theater, the new "As Thousands Cheer" was brightly cast in this revival, rehearsed to a fine point and as clear as it could have been. The house was small and welcoming to Hart's texts: no amplification needed. This was a cut-down version of a show that originally had more dancing and more things to look at; several numbers were inserted and taken out as well. Yet a dogged spirit of fidelity to Berlin's music and Hart's words prevailed. 
 The joys were archeological, a kind of Egyptology transferred to Manhattan. If you had studied the age and the musical culture, you would have been pleased by it. But for a bright young American who goes to the theater expecting relevance to a life currently being led, it was a beautiful job of embalming.
"As Thousands Cheer" reminded me of a Baroque opera revival, one so faithful to period singing styles and dramatic conventions (excepting the piano that replaced Berlin's pit band) that new and inquiring audiences were at a disadvantage. There is nothing wrong with this kind of clubbiness. Indeed, the Drama Dept. seemed to be aiming at a special listener, either old enough to remember or deep into the history of American musical theater and Depression-era history. The restricted seating capacity made this tiny theater the perfect clubhouse.
"As Thousands Cheer" and I are the same age, so I was reasonably aware of the news events it commented on. But even for older people the bite of immediacy disappears. My companion that night was smart and well-read, but skits about the Rockefellers, Hoover, Gandhi and vast unemployment -- humor that, to judge by reviews, amused audiences back then -- left this person largely baffled. Think of David Letterman opening his show with one-liners about a W.P.A. project or Henry Wallace.
With the voices of cabaret performers from a Mabel Mercer Foundation concert at Town Hall fresh in my ears, it was also fascinating to hear how different all these singers sounded from one another. Opera singers sound different, too. If they didn't, record companies would go out of business and a fervent army of voice lovers would have to surrender their contentious evenings of debate and take up bowling.
But in opera there are standards of beauty, a general target that moves glacially if at all. Although teachers have a thousand methods for breath support, there is still in opera's collective unconscious a good idea of what the perfect tenor sounds like. Discounting the occasional quasi-operatic sound, my cabaret and theater voices each had a private agenda. Every technique seemed to constitute its own school of singing.
The great opera sound is triumphant; it advertises victory over all the glitches that can do the run-of-the-mill singer in. Popular voices exploit their imperfections. Faintness of tone, rasping color and strained breathiness evoke vulnerability. The listener -- not threatened by overpowering mastery, longing for human contact and recalling that the meek shall inherit the earth -- buys into their weaknesses. It is a device opera uses sparingly, in the tenorial sob or the casting of ravaged voices in appropriate character roles.
The operatic voice is a collection of conventions arrived at in the past, and its fans become amateur historians by necessity. History becomes a kind of middleman, an intermediary to be laboriously dickered with. Anyone who loves "Parsifal" or "Carmen" knows that the labor is worth it, but all must acknowledge that things are lost: art at the speed of light, the suddenness of experience unimpeded by the passage of time.
We may be wrong when we call bright young listeners who refuse to have a long-dead set of musical values imposed on them uncultured and ignorant. Indeed, we might pay more attention to their world. You cannot, of course, appreciate the play "Art" without knowing, at the least, that esthetic squabbles over modern painting exist. But understanding opera voices or an Irving Berlin musical requires more: namely, a hard-working desire to absorb and accept the long-past worlds that created them.
 SO if a younger generation says that it has better things to do with its mind and heart, a lot of us are sorry, but how can we argue? And if this generation is short on tradition, remember that tradition has not fared well in our century.
Take geopolitics, where young countries with brief pasts benefit from traveling light, and old countries previously empowered by their histories feel the burdens of old habits in a quick-change world. On one hand, there is the United States, suffering from a lack of inherited culture but accomplishing wonders through flexibility. Then there are the people of the Balkans, whose spirit is paralyzed to this day by a battle fought with the Turks at Kosovo in 1389.
There is no use asking which direction is better: the direct artistic experience or the negotiated one, current events or dead ones. You can love the operatic voice while understanding why lots of intelligent people do not. I hope you enjoyed "As Thousands Cheer" for its archeological revelations. They were many. Still, I don't advise calling this living theater. It's as dead as a doornail.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Office Market;
The Vacancy Rate Dips Down Into the Single Digits

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
NOBODY can agree on the exact numbers, of course, but just about everyone involved in commercial real estate is saying that the office market in Manhattan is as tight as it has been for a long time, with the overall vacancy rate in the single digits for the first time in this decade.
According to a report prepared by Newmark & Company, the vacancy rate for Manhattan declined from 10.2 percent to 9.4 percent during the quarter that ended in June. A similar study by Insignia/ESG puts the vacancy rate at 8.7 percent, while one from the recently renamed CB Richard Ellis (it had been CB Commercial until it acquired the Richard Ellis company in Europe) calculates that it is 6.4 percent. 
 The numbers vary because every organization measuring the market defines it somewhat differently. Indeed, for all the use of the terms, there is no hard and fast definition of what constitutes a Class A and a Class B building, the former referring to the newest buildings with the latest technology, the latter to older office buildings with less developed technology.
Nevertheless, there is a consensus that large blocks of space are scarce in what are normally considered the central business districts of the city, midtown, midtown south and downtown. According to a report by LaSalle Partners, there are three blocks of over 500,000 square feet available in midtown, at 622 Third Avenue at 41st Street, , 666 Third Avenue, at 42d Street, and 405 Lexington Avenue, at 42d Street, and nine of over 300,000 square feet.
Availability of space in the most desirable buildings is even more difficult, said Steven A. Swerdlow, executive vice president in charge of the New York office of CB Richard Ellis. "In the top 65 buildings, the vacancy rate is about 2 percent," he said. "That sector of the market is as tight as it has ever been. It's like the great bull market of 1980 and 1981, with rents rising daily."
He said that during the crunch of the early 1980's office tenants took over old manufacturing space in midtown south as a way of escaping the escalating cost of midtown rentals.. "A lot of engineers, architects and publishing companies went to midtown south in that period," Mr. Swerdlow said.
Many of those tenants are still there, and the result is that midtown south no longer offers a relief valve for midtown.
Scarcity is driving annual rents higher, to an average of $45.78 a square foot in better buildings in midtown, according to a report by the Julien J. Studley Company, compared to an average of $41.49 a year ago. And those are just averages. "We are seeing asking rents of $70 a foot at the G. M. Building and 9 West 57th, and $50 a foot asking rentals are routine in some parts of the city," said Raymond T. O'Keefe, manager of the New York office of Grubb & Ellis.
STEADY rent increases will drive tenants downtown and to places like Jersey City and Brooklyn, brokers predict. And it is likely to spur something little seen in Manhattan in this decade: new construction.
"I never thought I'd ever say this again, but we have a real need for new construction," said Michael T. Cohen, the president of Williams Real Estate Company, referring to the overbuilding of the 1980's that led to a prolonged real estate slump in the 1990's.
But those days are past, he said: "Anyone who has a good site will build on it."
Part of the problem, though, is that there are not a lot of sites available for building in traditional parts of Manhattan. That may lead to development in areas not previously considered part of the business districts.
"The completion of Times Square and the movement of Penn Station into the Post Office building will drive development to the area around Penn Station," said Mark Jaccom, an executive managing director of the Studley firm.
The area is currently nondescript, consisting of generally smaller buildings with mixed uses. But Mr. Jaccom said developers had been quietly buying property nearby in anticipation of increased demand for midtown office space. "Developers are not dumb, and they have invested heavily in that area," he said.
Farther south, office tenants, particularly new and traditional media companies, are replacing printing companies in converted industrial buildings in the Hudson Square area on the West Side. Newmark noted that the publisher Reed Elsevier signed leases for 46,351 square feet at 345 Hudson Street and for 33,765 square feet at 350 Hudson Street.
Steadily rising rental rates will push some companies out of Manhattan, both to other boroughs of the city and to the New Jersey waterfront, real estate executives said. Two office projects totaling almost 1 million square feet of space are under way in Jersey City, by Hartz Mountain and the Lefrak Organization. SJP Properties has been designated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to develop a 1.1 million-square-foot office building in Hoboken, although it does not yet have an anchor tenant.
In Brooklyn, Forest City Ratner Companies is prepared to add another 415,000-square-foot building to its Metrotech complex in the downtown area if an anchor tenant can be found and has plans for a 1.2million-square-foot structure nearby at 330 Jay Street.
While the downtown market is dominated by the financial services and insurance industries, the tenant mix in midtown is far more varied, said John Powers, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG. Mr. Powers pays careful attention to the nature of the midtown market because he has the assignment to market the two office buildings to be built in Times Square on the south side of 42d Street.
"In midtown you have many smaller tenants looking for more space," he said. "The company with 10,000 square feet wants 15,000. The software company that started with 1,500 square feet now wants 5,000."
He said new development was likely in two areas of the city over the next few years, in Times Square and near Penn Station.
"Transportation is the key to everything in New York, and Times Square has the best transportation," he said. "After that is Grand Central and Penn Station."
He noted that Vornado, a large real estate investment trust, has invested heavily in the Penn Station area, buying most of the properties along Seventh Avenue between 34th and 31st Streets. "They have an economic incentive to do things to improve the area," he said. "They can make a neighborhood decision and amortize the cost over millions of square feet."
Part of the demand for space is a newly expansive attitude by companies that scrimped on space during the downsizing years of the early 1990's, said Frank Doyle, a senior vice president with LaSalle Partners. "For a long time people did not reserve space for future growth because they had to sublease it at huge discounts," he said. "They called it rightsizing." Now, he said, companies are trying to prepare for growth by taking more space than they need at the moment.
BUT with the market so tight, landlords are not interested in spending money remodeling their buildings except for the most financially strong tenants. "In midtown there is demand for built space," said David A. Falk, a senior managing director of Newmark, referring to locations where offices have already been subdivided. For landlords to make major renovations, Mr. Falk said, only tenants with the strongest financial standing will be considered.
Awash in good news, real estate executives say they know the market is cyclical but find it difficult to detect any bad news on the horizon. "It's hard to be a fortune teller, but with the overall strong economy and limited additions to supply, the market should continue to be strong for at least the next 12 to 24 months," said Paul N. Glickman, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield.
With the limited number of sites as a built-in protection against overbuilding, some real estate executives say the cycle is likely to be influenced by outside factors, notably the stock market. With the stock market climbing to ever loftier levels, a sharp correction could change the industry's attitude.
"When the stock market exhales, and the Dow drops from 10,000 to 6,000, that will mark the end of the cycle," said Mr. Cohen of Williams Real Estate, who noted that it took over a year after the stock market's sharp drop in in 1987 for the effects to be fully felt in real estate.

HEADLINE: Do Workers Really Have More Purchasing Power?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Every Second Counts Even More" (Spending It, June 28), in which W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, asserted that Americans were working fewer hours than they did in the past in order to buy various goods and services: 
 The article did not mention, however, that some workers are spending more time commuting to their jobs today than they did 25 years ago, when the workplace was often much closer to home.
It is not uncommon today to have travel time of four hours a day, or the equivalent of half the 40-hour week. (This is egregious for low-paid service workers who depend on public transportation to jobs outside the city.)
So if it now takes 40 hours of actual work to buy a $525 men's suit, as the article says, it may actually take a worker 60 hours of his total time, plus the travel expenses.

Beyond the Fuss Over Bank Mergers and the New I.R.S.

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
AT least two personal-finance magazines for August are providing a reality check on a couple of the summer's news stories: bank mergers and legislation to tame the Internal Revenue Service.
The much-ballyhooed bank combinations are supposed to produce "synergy" and lower costs, which sounds great. The average consumer might be forgiven for thinking that all this could mean lower fees and charges for checking accounts and other bank services. 
 Well, think again. Like other publications before them, Smart Money and the August-September issue of Your Money discuss what many people are learning the hard way: Megabanks are using their market heft to impose megafees. The magazines note that studies by the Federal Reserve Board and Bank Rate Monitor, a company that tracks the industry, show that big multistate banks charge more for their services -- often a lot more -- than smaller banks do. And many of these banking giants are also streamlining, a fancy term that often means closing or consolidating neighborhood branches.
Your Money, published by Consumers Digest, cites the case of a retired widow in Florida who had been paying $12 a month for a Great Western checking account that came with a $500 overdraft line of credit: When Great Western and Washington Mutual agreed to merge earlier this year, her free $500 line of credit dropped to $100. This meant that she would face a $28.50 fee for every overdraft of more than $71.50, because the fee would count toward the $100.
According to Smart Money, a Citibank account in San Francisco tops Bank Rate Monitor's most-expensive list. With a balance of $1,500 in a no-interest account, and assuming 12 transactions a month and one bounced check a year, a customer would pay $315 annually. That same $1,500 in an account at the Mutual Savings Association in Kansas City, Mo. -- the survey's least-expensive account -- would earn $30.75 a year in interest. Bank Rate Monitor operates a World Wide Web site (www.bankrate.com) that reviews accounts in 30 large cities.
Not surprisingly, Your Money says that all this is great for people who own stock in the big banks -- at least as long as the economy keeps booming.
As for legislation to make the I.R.S. more user-friendly and to halt abuses, Albert R. Hunt and Alan Murray of Smart Money contend that changes for the average taxpayer will be less than indicated by the talk coming from Congress.
Mr. Hunt and Mr. Murray point out in their Capitol Gains column that most of the benefits -- except for a reduction in the time an asset must be held to qualify for the lowest capital-gains tax rate -- will go to those taxpayers who are audited by the I.R.S. These benefits include shifting the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the I.R.S. when tax cases go to court and making it harder for the agency to seize property. But only a tiny fraction of Americans face audits each year.
"Indeed," the columnists write, "most of the benefits of the new law will most likely fall to small-business owners and independent contractors -- which is the main reason Republicans, heavily dependent on small business for support, started pushing for I.R.S. reform in the first place."
In other words, wage slaves won't notice much difference. Anyway, the article says, I.R.S. studies show that they're not the source of much tax cheating because all of their income is reported automatically.
The article continues: "Far more significant, according to internal I.R.S. estimates, is the failure of independent business people to report all their income. Roughly two-fifths, or $40 billion, of the estimated 'tax gap' comes from underreported business income, and some 40 percent of that is attributed to small-business owners. Most of the I.R.S. enforcement efforts are aimed at them, and most of the relief in the new law will fall their way as well."
WELL, WHICH IS IT? -- Your Money says credit card costs continue to travel north, citing interest rates that run 17 percent and higher. But Money magazine advises readers to "watch for falling card rates." Money lists two credit card issuers, Capital One and First USA, that are offering no-fee cards with fixed rates of slightly less than 10 percent. The lesson in this mixed message, of course, is to shop around.
STAKE A CLAIM -- Kiplinger's reports that, all told, the 50 states are holding $300 billion in unclaimed money waiting to be reunited with its owners.
This stash has many causes: Some people change addresses and fail to notify previous employers, banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms, often causing their money to land in state coffers. Others abandon property, lose records, fail to keep paperwork or are simply unaware of some benefit that is due to them.
The various state treasuries maintain lists of people they can't find. There is also a World Wide Web site (www.unclaimed.org) where 25 states post names of people who have money coming, though Kiplinger's says the data bases are not equally comprehensive. The magazine discovered that Steve Forbes, the publisher of Forbes magazine and a former, and perhaps future, Presidential candidate, has three bank accounts languishing on New York State's list of unclaimed property.
Kiplinger's notes that the I.R.S. has some unclaimed money, too: Last year alone, nearly 100,000 tax refund checks were returned as undeliverable.
STOCKING UP -- Money asked 10 Wall Street money managers for their favorite stocks to buy now. The picks were Aetna, Altron, American Express, BankAmerica, Cox Communications, Dell Computer, Health Management Associates, Laidlaw Environmental Services, Men's Warehouse and Ocean Energy.
BITS AND PIECES -- Smart Money has a concise rundown of changes in the bankruptcy laws that Congress is considering . . . In Kiplinger's, the market guru Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs remains bullish on stocks despite further weakening in Asian economies . . . Money looks at home security systems; an expert says one of the best deterrents to burglaries remains a big dog.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
With Favorable Loans, a Generation Rediscovers Second Homes

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
AFTER losing out on one seashore property despite an above-market bid, Donna and Michael Davis plunked down $300,000 this spring for a bay-front vacation home in Sea Isle City, N.J., to which the middle-aged couple intend to retire someday.
"This is what we always wanted," Mrs. Davis said of the four-bedroom house. And considering the availability of 7 percent mortgage money, with stock-market profits in reserve, she said the time was right. 
 The Davises -- he's a 55-year-old construction equipment salesman, she's a former secretary -- are part of a surge in the vacation-home market that seems fueled by low interest rates, soaring stock prices and a tide of buyers reaching prime earnings years. In a sharp break from the norm, interest rates for vacation homes are now generally no higher than for primary residences. At current levels, they are a significant factor in what has become an explosive convergence of demographics and finance.
Others who find the vacation-home stars in alignment include Douglas and Joanne Johnston of Wilmington, Del., who closed last week on a $580,000 property -- the second floor of a beach-front duplex -- in Ocean City, N.J. It is a major step up from the $285,000 duplex unit they sold on the other side of the same street and the culmination of a steady, 24-year effort, involving four houses, to creep to the water's edge.
Besides using the proceeds from selling their previous home, the Johnstons financed the purchase with the sale of shares of DuPont -- where Mr. Johnston, 47, is director of marketing -- and a jumbo bank loan at 7.625 percent interest with no points.
"It was the right time," said Mr. Johnston, noting the favorable rate and hefty profits in DuPont. "The strength of the stock market is something that helped us make the decision."
Julie Mealo, manager of the Norwest Mortgage branch serving the New Jersey shore communities, said she had "never seen anything like" the current hectic pace of business. "It's absolutely incredible," she added. "All the baby boomers are buying their vacation homes."
AFTER showing virtually no growth during the first half of the decade, the nation's stock of second homes jumped more than 200,000 in both 1996 and 1997 to reach six million, according to the Census Bureau. Real estate specialists foresee no letup.
"Everything has fallen into place," said Nancy Cox, an agent with Island Homes Realty in Emerald Isle, N.C., where prices for property on the Atlantic Ocean side of the main highway are up 20 percent this year after a similar increase in 1997.
In South Jersey, prices have nearly regained or surpassed their 1986-88 peaks, according to Jim Bourgeois, a partner at Hager Real Estate in Ocean City.
A chief contributor to the surge is low-cost mortgages, a result of lender competition that in the last 18 to 24 months has almost wiped out traditional distinctions between mortgages for first and second homes.
Historically, buyers have had to pay one-eighth to as much as one-half a point more to finance a vacation home than a primary, or year-round one. Not only might a borrower in financial trouble be more inclined to walk away from a second home, but such properties are often vacant and remote and thus subject to vandalism.
Now, "we have no pricing difference for second homes," said Thomas Smith, vice president for product development at Nationsbanc Mortgage in Charlotte, N.C. Nationsbanc requires that the property be a true, owner-used second home; it has to be at least 100 miles away from the primary residence and cannot be an investment property rented to others. Mortgage lenders still charge extra for financing on rental properties, typically one-eighth to three-eighths of a point.
Personal use is preferred on the assumption that property will be better cared for, though rental income could make the borrower a better financial risk.
While lenders tend to seek higher down payments on vacation homes -- 30 percent is common, versus 20 percent for first homes -- much depends on the particular transaction. "We can get people in with as little as 10 percent," said Michael E. Ternosky, the owner of First Eastern Realty in Sea Isle City and the broker for the Davises.
Indeed, the increasingly creative financing being used these days includes "piggyback" transactions, involving two separate loans. In some cases, these allow a buyer who also has a home for sale to avoid mortgage insurance; in others, they help a buyer avoid a "jumbo" loan of more than $227,150 that carries a slightly higher rate.
Economists contend that consumers spend less than a nickel of each dollar of new wealth. But real estate people almost invariably cite soaring stock prices in explaining the boom in vacation property.
"Some of the stock market gains have undoubtedly translated into demand for second homes," said Michael S. Carliner, economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
Second homes remain one of the few remaining legal tax shelters; periodic attempts to restrict or eliminate the mortgage interest deduction for them have fizzled.
Still, most vacation properties are not pricey coastal retreats. In fact, the median price of vacation homes that changed hands in the late 1980's was just $19,000, the Commerce Department's consumer expenditure survey says, using data from the latest census. But this may be an understatement because of the common practice of sharing ownership.
According to a study for the American Resort Development Association, which mainly represents the time-share industry, the chief concentrations of vacation homes, apart from the Eastern Seaboard, are in the Rocky Mountains and the Upper Midwest. Indeed, the study showed, the Congressional district for northern Michigan has more second homes than any other.
Even the insurance industry has begun to contribute to the increased appeal of vacation homes. Traditionally, premiums for homeowners policies have been at least as high as for primary residences because a water leak or other problem in a vacant house can go undetected.
But in recent years Chubb Group has offered a policy tailored for vacation homes that cuts premiums to 10 to 40 percent less than those for primary homes.
This is possible because the vacation policy limits payouts for temporary living expenses, which are less essential for a second home. It also allows contents to be insured for as little as 10 percent of the value of the house instead of the typical 50 percent -- because vacation clothes and furniture are often castoffs -- and reduces coverage for garages or other structures.
This policy is now offered in 20 states, according to Scott Garfield, national sales manager for Chubb's personal lines division, including New York and Pennsylvania but not New Jersey or Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Daewoo, of Korea, Gives America the Old College Try

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
THE newest car company in the United States, Daewoo Motor America, has been recruiting college students across the United States in recent months to help sell its line of economy cars. The company, a unit of a South Korean conglomerate, offers prospective campus representatives free trips to Korea with no obligation.
With commissions of $300 to $500 a car, some parents may respond to their children's next "send money" plea by sending them to Seoul. One potential pitfall, though, is that Daewoo (pronounced DAY-woo) is aiming much of its sales pitch at those same college students, a demographic group without steady incomes, big savings accounts or long credit histories. 
 In Britain, where it has sold cars since 1995, Daewoo has won a loyal following by spurning independent dealerships and selling directly to consumers. It is trying the same approach here, with a campus twist.
"We like the college market for a couple of reasons," said Bill Tucker, vice president for marketing and customer relations at Daewoo. "We think the car will have appeal because of the price point. And we also feel college students are open-minded."
Value will be the company's main selling point for its three models -- the subcompact Lanos, the compact Nubira and the midsize Leganza sedan. Prices, which have not been officially set, will range from $9,000 to $20,000. Customers will get three years' free maintenance, including oil changes; a three-year, 36,000-mile warranty and free roadside assistance. Like Saturn, Daewoo will use a set-price, no-haggle approach.
Maryann Keller, the auto industry analyst for ING Baring Furman Selz in New York, said: "I think that while Daewoo's strategy is different, I'm hard-pressed to see how it's going to make money for them. The college-student market is a very difficult market. They don't have a lot of money, they are first-time buyers, and they have no credit rating." So, Ms. Keller noted, Daewoo actually has to win over the students' parents.
Mr. Tucker said Daewoo was aware of the need for financing. "We're looking at things that help get payments in the realm that students can afford," he said.
Daewoo's venture in the American market, after it missed previously announced debuts, comes at a time of crisis for Korean companies. The economy has been in a free-fall since the currency collapsed last fall, consumer demand has dried up and some big banks are on the verge of ruin because of huge loans that are unlikely to be repaid. Daewoo itself is deeply in debt.
With car sales plunging in Korea and throughout much of Asia, the Korean auto industry is operating at about 40 percent of capacity. Kia, the country's third-largest car maker (Daewoo is second, behind Hyundai), went up for auction on Wednesday. Daewoo has been trying to sell a piece of itself to General Motors.
Until this month, Kia and Hyundai were offering rebates of up to $1,500 on 1998 models, and up to $2,500 on leftover '97 cars. Because Korea's currency, the won, is so cheap relative to the dollar, it is theoretically possible for Korean companies to make money by ramping up exports, slashing prices and offering big sales incentives.
For about eight years starting in the mid-1980's, G.M. and Daewoo did get together, and the product was an ill-conceived car sold by Pontiac as the LeMans. It suffered from poor quality and disappointing sales.
Mr. Tucker said that Daewoo planned to have 14 factory-owned dealerships open when it officially begins sales in the United States in early September, and is considering independent dealerships in the handful of states (including New Jersey) that do not allow auto makers to sell directly to the public. By the end of the year, the goal is 20 to 25 factory-owned stores, he said. Most will be in metropolitan areas where there are several colleges. Cars have arrived in the United States, and could be available for sale before September (although the Daewoo outlet in Fairfield, Conn., which is to open on Aug. 28, was empty last week except for some office furniture). Mr. Tucker said sales of any number from 10,000 to 30,000 in the first 12 months would be considered respectable.
The British have given Daewoo products a warm reception since the company began factory-direct sales there. In the British customer-satisfaction survey by J. D. Power & Associates for 1997, the first in which Daewoo appeared, it finished fourth, behind Subaru, Honda and Kia. Nearly half of each manufacturer's overall score was based on dealer service. "Daewoo customers are extremely satisfied with the way they are treated," J. D. Power said in a statement.
This year, Daewoo dropped to ninth, but its rating was still above the average.
Ms. Keller, the analyst, said Daewoo might have underestimated the choices available to Americans who want to avoid car dealers. "We can get on the Web and arm ourselves with all sorts of information, including what the car actually costs the dealer," she said. "There are lots of car-buying services on the Web in which a consumer will ask for a certain car and a dealer will come back with a price." And students would seem to be among the people most connected to the Internet.
If Daewoo's approach succeeds, the company can thank people like Deborah Archer, who is among the first Daewoo campus advisers, as the college representatives are called. Ms. Archer, 36, of Fort Lee, N.J., can appreciate the financial possibilities of working for Daewoo on campus from the perspective of both parent and student.
"Originally, it was the economic factor that attracted me to it," she said, when asked why she signed up for the program after seeing a poster on campus. A single parent who has been studying for a Masters of Science in education at Herbert H. Lehman College, Ms. Archer has a daughter in a private grammar school and a 16-year-old son. "I felt this is an excellent opportunity," she said. "The hours are flexible, and they said it wouldn't interfere with my classes."
But after completing a screening process and flying to South Korea with about 125 other American students, she also came to admire the South Korean way of life and business. "The dedication of the employees was outstanding," Ms. Archer said.
"Primarily, the other members of my group were in the 18- to 22-year-old range," she said. "Out of 125, I would guess that 100 were men, and many of the students who responded were marketing and business majors." During their 14-to-15-hour days (the one-week trip "was all very well organized," she said), the Americans were introduced to the company's history, instructed on public relations and marketing strategies and given a tour of the conglomerate's auto, shipbuilding and electronics plants. "We were told that our goal was not to sell the car, but to spread the Daewoo name by word of mouth," Ms. Archer said. One way they'll do this is through on-campus activities sponsored by Daewoo.
After one more training session in the United States, Ms. Archer will be ready to round up prospects. To help, there's one more perk: use of a Daewoo for 90 days.
The approach left Ms. Keller wondering about the turnover rate on campus. "They're going to spend a tremendous amount of money training students in Korea, and what's going to happen when they graduate?" she asked. She also wondered whether students have enough free time to be an effective sales force -- "or maybe college is different from when I attended."
Paul Holloway, who owns five traditional dealerships in New Hampshire and is chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association, is also a skeptic. "Last year in the United States, the average new-car dealer realized a 1.4 percent profit," he said. "And I think dealers bring a heck of a lot more value to the equation than that 1.4 percent.
"This is a very competitive business, and I don't see what kind of costs Daewoo thinks they can take out of this."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Leader Exits, but It May Be Too Soon to Invest in Japan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
THE day after Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned, adding politics to the list of Japan's financial and economic woes, one of the country's leading financial newspapers topped its front page with this headline: "The Time Has Come to Buy Japan!"
The newspaper, Nikkan Toshi Shimbun, put that optimistic spin Tuesday on what has been an almost unrelenting barrage of negative news about Japan, the world's second-largest economy. At last, the paper and others are saying, Japanese voters have demanded more decisive leadership that will dare to cut taxes, clean up the banks and stimulate an economy that has fallen into its deepest slump since World War II. 
 The hope is that change at the top will enliven Japan's stock market, which has failed to sustain a rally since the country's sky-high stock prices collapsed nine years ago. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose sharply last week, partly on expectations that any new Prime Minister would have to respond to calls to tackle the country's most pressing problems.
Still, many economists, fund managers and stock pickers speak with one voice when it comes to investing in Japan. In a word, they say, don't. At least not now.
"Why people would be even remotely bullish in this environment is beyond me," says Martin Armstrong, an economist at Princeton Economics International, an advisory firm in Princeton, N.J., that specializes in global economics issues.
"Long-term, I am very optimistic that Japan will come back and be the real powerhouse of Asia. But until things get worse, politicians there are not really going to budge" on fundamental reform, Mr. Armstrong said.
Like a tire riddled with holes, Japan's economy defies every attempt to pump it up. Government stimulus packages, political and corporate changes and bank-overhaul plans have all fallen short. The stock market does not stay inflated for long, either. Five times in as many years the Nikkei has staged mini-rallies, cresting around 20,000, only to slump back toward its lows of just above 14,000. It closed on Friday at 16,570.78.
Whether the latest setback at the polls for the dominant Liberal Democratic Party represents a turning point is an open question. But many analysts doubt that a new Prime Minister -- the front-runner is Keizo Obuchi, the Foreign Minister, a conservative with backing from powerful elders -- will take office with an agenda to shake things up.
"I do not see anything in the vote that makes real change more likely," says David Malpass, chief international strategist for Bear, Stearns in New York. "My reading of the voters is that they want less conflict and lower taxes. But this is not the start of fundamental reform."
In fact, the cautionary factors that any stock investor would need to consider before betting on a Japanese recovery are so numerous that they overwhelm potential gains, analysts say. Following are just a few:
THE YEN -- In the early 1990's, the yen worked in favor of foreign investment in Japanese stocks. It consistently rose in value against the dollar and produced solid dollar-based portfolio returns even when stock prices meandered. Now, the reverse is true: the yen has sunk from a high of 80 to the dollar four years ago to about 140 to the dollar now, with no signs of strengthening.
Some analysts are so bearish on the yen that they regard any Japanese stock as highly risky. Mr. Armstrong of Princeton Economics, for example, says the yen could tumble as low as 278 to the dollar by 2002, a decline so sharp it would destroy any dollar gains from even a roaring stock market rally. Many other economists see more modest declines in the yen, at least in the short term, but few expect a climb.
BANK TROUBLES -- Bad loans threaten to overwhelm the Japanese banking system. Official estimates put unrecoverable bank debt at $500 billion; unofficial estimates range up to $1.2 trillion. In either case, the crisis has weighed much heavier on the Japanese economy than any banking crisis has in the United States since the Great Depression, and the Government has so far made only initial progress in solving it.
Elizabeth J. Allan, an Asian equities fund manager for Scudder Kemper Investments, said she saw few signs that the election heralded a faster approach to financial changes. Before Mr. Hashimoto's resignation, the Government laid out a plan for new "bridge banks" to help speed the closure of troubled banks. And Mr. Hashimoto has pushed a "big bang" approach to changing financial markets. But the election did not turn on such issues, Ms. Allan said.
"There may be a disconnect in what U.S. people are seeing and what they in Japan are thinking," she said.
Though it is still early, she said, "my impression is that tackling the financial system is not on the agenda," even under a new Government.
TAX ISSUES -- Some analysts see changes in the Japanese tax system as the key to turning around the economy. Taxes were an issue in the recent elections -- but only in terms of reducing the tax burden on consumers, not in overhauling the tax code.
Mr. Malpass of Bear, Stearns argues that Japan needs to start anew, scrapping the high tax on real estate capital gains, lowering the value-added tax and making loan-loss provisions tax deductible to speed changes in banking. "It is still very unclear how or whether these kinds of things will be carried out," Mr. Malpass said.
THE ECONOMY -- Japan has slipped into a recession and shows few signs of turning around quickly. Salomon Smith Barney projects that the economy will contract by 0.8 percent this year and then grow hardly at all in 1999.
The Japanese Government has promoted its latest stimulus package, which would include 3.6 trillion yen for construction projects, in theory creating ripple effects that would benefit the economy widely. But Salomon says the stimulus would merely reverse a contractional fiscal policy and do little to offset a sharp decline in private business investment.
For investors determined to place a bet on a Japanese turnaround despite these many cautions, stock pickers tend to favor only the largest and most international Japanese companies, especially those that have already adopted Western management methods.
Among the perennial favorites of mutual fund managers are Sony and Canon, both consumer electronics makers with a bias toward overseas sales and a proven track record in navigating Japan's stormy market. Mr. Armstrong also likes a few less well-known Japanese companies that he says have become true multinationals, including Alpine Electronics, a car radio maker, and Amada, a machine tool manufacturer.
Ms. Allan of Scudder has two long-term holdings in her closed-end Scudder New Asia fund, both of which are leading consumer products companies with extended foreign operations: Uni-Charm, a manufacturer of sanitary napkins, and Nintendo, the game maker.
"We are looking for companies that will prosper whatever the outcome is domestically, and that means the most international ones," she said.

Does Amazon = 2 Barnes & Nobles?

BYLINE: By CYNTHIA MAYER 

 BODY:
IMAGINE two companies in the same business. The sales of Company A are one-nineteenth those of Company B. Company A has never shown a profit and is expected to report on Wednesday even bigger losses than had been forecast, while Company B is enjoying a strong quarter and figures to be solidly profitable for the third consecutive year.
Company B's market capitalization ought to dwarf Company A's, yes? And investors ought to be piling into Company B and watching Company A nervously, right? 
 Wrong. The market value of A (Amazon.com, the on-line bookseller) has rocketed past that of B (Barnes & Noble, king of brick-and-mortar bookstores) over the last six weeks. While shares of Barnes & Noble have gained a respectable 34.3 percent since June 1, Amazon is up a spectacular 179.9 percent, even after a decline from its July 6 peak.
It all may sound like speculative mania. But there may be a more rational explanation for why investors are willing to pay more for little Amazon than for its giant counterpart.
"They have the better business model," says Paul Sonkin, an adjunct professor of securities analysis at Columbia University who also is a money manager.
Mr. Sonkin does not own Amazon because, at $119.8125 a share, the current valuations scare him, but he has become a recent convert to the Amazon game plan after hearing Joy Covey, Amazon's chief financial officer, and other Amazon executives make their case last month at a conference at BT Alex. Brown in New York. Like Dell Computer and other direct sellers, Amazon enjoys some advantages over traditional retailers.
The most obvious is minimal inventory. Retailers like Wal-Mart have been shaving inventory levels for years, but Amazon has carried the idea further. Though it recently added a second warehouse, it still carries in inventory only a small fraction of the books it sells. Most titles are not ordered from the distributor until a customer has placed an order. So Amazon turns over its inventory about 26 times a year, 10 times as fast as Barnes & Noble, and avoids immense carrying costs.
But behind the spare inventory is an advantage that excites Mr. Sonkin and other analysts: a negative operating cycle. Most retailers -- most businesses, in fact -- must buy goods and supplies before selling them. Cash goes out to suppliers before it can come in from customers, obliging the company to continually finance the gap, often equal to a month or two's worth of sales.
Not Amazon. It charges a customer's credit card account as soon as it ships a book, and the credit card company usually pays Amazon within a day. Amazon, meanwhile, takes an average of 46 days to pay its suppliers, the book distributors. Instead of having to pay to finance sales, Amazon profits from having the use of its customers' money for a month and a half.
And Amazon plans to stretch that float even longer as it uses its growing buying power to repay publishers even more slowly, Ms. Covey said in an interview.
Such an advantage, of course, is not unique to Amazon. It is shared by other Internet sellers like CD Now, which sells music, and Cyberian Outpost, which sells computer equipment, and by build-to-order manufacturers like Dell. Even Barnes & Noble has it on a small scale through its Internet arm, Barnesandnoble.com, which sold $14.6 million in books last year.
BARNES & NOBLE contends that the advantages of Internet selling are overemphasized. The company's vice president and treasurer, Elizabeth Babin, says the money saved by direct sellers on stores and inventory is only part of the picture. Amazon does not have to carry the $1.5 billion of hard assets that Barnes & Noble does, Ms. Babin said, but it does have to pay to generate "virtual foot traffic" in its virtual marketplace. Last year, Amazon spent $39 million, more than a quarter of total revenue, on marketing and selling, $21 million of it for advertising, including banners on popular Web sites like Yahoo and Excite, to attract customers.
"This is the same as paying for location to increase foot traffic," Ms. Babin said.
Going forward, those traffic-creation costs are much harder to forecast for Amazon than for Barnes & Noble. Amazon's Ms. Covey said she had little idea how much the company would have to spend on its relationships with Yahoo and others. The players' bargaining power is evolving from day to day: Next year it could be Amazon calling the shots, or it could be Yahoo, or America Online, dictating prices and terms.
"This is the biggest wild card in our business model," Ms. Covey acknowledged. It is also one of the reasons that analysts recently increased their estimates for Amazon's 1998 losses: The company announced that it would be spending much more than previously expected on advertising.
Amazon must spend whatever it takes to establish a global brand name quickly, before other competitors can mount a serious challenge, Ms. Covey said. "We see a very critical window of opportunity here," she said. "We're behind on overall global branding." Once established, Amazon expects to be able to spend less maintaining its customer base.
Ordinarily, a company with such an uncertain future would be punished by the stock market. But in Amazon's case, the excitement over its business model -- and over the Internet in general -- is prevailing.
Amazon's stock also jumped recently on an apparent short squeeze, according to Ms. Covey. Speculators who had sold borrowed shares, betting that the price would fall, were caught off guard in June by positive market reaction to an announced expansion into music and had to buy shares in a hurry to cover their positions and cut their losses, bidding the price far higher for a few days, she said.
But is a great business model worth buying at any price? To a value investor, Amazon may make no sense: It is losing money -- $9.3 million in the first quarter -- and has few hard assets. To a growth investor, who expects a stock's price-to-earnings multiple to match its earnings growth rate, there may be a case for buying, even at Amazon's current levels -- if earnings can be predicted. But estimates for the future are scattered widely.
Most analysts predict that Amazon will become profitable by the end of 2000. Keith E. Benjamin, an analyst at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, is predicting a profit of 88 cents a share for 2001 and a sustainable growth rate of 50 percent a year thereafter, based on sales assumptions that he calls conservative.
With Internet stocks generally bringing 50 times earnings forecast two years ahead, his figures suggest that Amazon should be trading at about $44 a share -- and thus is incredibly overpriced. "Short term, I think the stock has gotten a little ahead of itself," Mr. Benjamin said.
He said the stock could fall 10 percent to 20 percent this week, after the company reports quarterly results on Wednesday. After that, it will be back to the guessing games about future earnings. "Amazon stock challenges us," Mr. Benjamin said. "There's a wide range of what they can earn."

CHart: "Two Ways to Sell Books"
The goods are the same, but the business models are so different that the finances of Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble have almost nothing in common. Amazon sells books over the Internet; Barnes & Noble mostly uses brick-and-mortar bookstores, though it, too, has an Internet presence.

Topless Club's Good-Neighbor Policy

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
HAVE you ever been to a club like ours before?" Jon Vargo asked. He noticed that I seemed torn between the ball game on the big-screen TV over the bar and the woman dancing on the stage, topless.
"Not in a very long time," I said, a tad archly, I'm afraid. "But not so long that baseball or breasts have basically changed." 
 He smiled. "A lot has changed in adult entertainment, especially on the high end where men pay $13 for a Budweiser. These days, they aren't embarrassed to bring customers here. After you've closed the deal, the last thing you want to do is keep talking and blow it. That's basic salesmanship."
Steve Aslan, his partner, said, "I don't think the Mayor had a club like ours in mind, Wall Street businessmen relaxing in a safe environment, when he went after the sex industry. We're not neon, we're not 'Hey, come see Judy with a 77D chest.' "
"We think the Mayor has done a fantastic job," Mr. Vargo said. "By making the city safer, he's increased our business. We agree that we shouldn't be near schools, churches and other adult entertainments. And we're not. The problem is, this street is zoned for manufacturing with a provision for residential. We need a variance so we won't have to leave. And the street does not want us to leave."
True. If the quiet, publicity-shy V.I.P. Club on West 20th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, which rarely has more than a 100 customers at a time, leases its cabaret license and its space, which is large enough to pack in 800, it will probably lease it to a high-volume music club where drugs will be sold to gun-packing slobs who will yell, honk their horns, urinate and vomit under bedroom windows at 4 A.M.
"We've got Limelight down the block, we've got Lava, whose customers are noisy and disrespectful, that's more than enough," said Laura Michaels, a graphic designer who lives and works on the block. She is president of the Flatiron Alliance, an umbrella group of block associations, and a member of Community Board 5. Both groups have asked the city to give the V.I.P. Club permission to stay when the law pushing the sex industry out of residential areas survives court challenges.
"I went to the clubs when I was in school," said Ms. Michaels, 34, who attended the Fashion Institute of Technology. "I've seen them selling ecstasy in the bathrooms, I've seen the guns and knives and violence. I'm raising a 4-year-old now and I want her to be able to sleep at night. And I don't want a random shot fired through her window."
Mr. Vargo describes the V.I.P. Club as a positive influence on the block; his security detail has called the police, put out fires and discouraged burglars and muggers just by their presence. He says it's also a positive economic influence on the city; he says he employs 250 full-time workers, as well as 200 dancers, mostly out-of-towners who stay in local hotels and eat in local restaurants. The women pay the club $80 a night to dance. Mr. Vargo claims that they get back as much as $2,000 a week in tips.
Ms. Michaels takes a pragmatic approach. The big issue -- what she sees as a contempt for good city planning in the current administration -- will have to wait. And she is not interested in allegations that the strip club industry is mobbed up or that prostitution occurs.
"What happens inside the club is not my business," she said. "I'm interested in what happens on the street, to the neighbors. We're on our own. The 13th Precinct has not been responsive. When residents who couldn't sleep dumped water on the heads of noisy customers on line outside Lava, the police threatened to arrest the residents."
Mr. Vargo and Ms. Michaels agree that watching nearly naked women dance up close has become a chic date. Couples can relax in a low-pressure, secure, mildly erotic environment in which they can be voyeurs, culture critics, sports fans.
Mr. Vargo charts the strip club's social acceptance by the number of charities, including those for cops, dogs and the public schools, which have begun accepting and publicly acknowledging V.I.P.'s donations. Whoever actually owns the club -- there are several corporations involved and layers of management -- seems to have plenty of ways to make money. The average customer spends more than $153, Mr. Vargo said, and much more if he rents a $250-an-hour "champagne room" cubicle (a bottle of bubbly comes with it) and one or more $20-a-dance private dancers. Of course, he can always just watch the game.
"ESPN and breasts," I mused aloud. "You ever get any anthropologists in here? How come men never get tired of looking?"
"I really don't know," said Mr. Aslan, a former investment banker, "but I'm very glad it is that way."

Tenants Say a Garage Lease Drives Too Hard a Bargain

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
The contract could have been bought in a stationery store, residents of a luxury building said in jest about their new lease for parking spaces. But worries prompted 20 co-op owners and tenants of rent-stabilized apartments to huddle outside the building, the Versailles, Wednesday night and ponder their next move.
This month, they received a garage license agreement stating their monthly fee for a parking space in the complex, at 110-45 71st Road. But it said the lease would be only month to month, and the landlord, Rosefan Owners, might increase the fee "as it sees fit at any time." If the renter objects, the "only recourse will be to surrender the assigned space." 
 "It's not an agreement, it's more like a trap," said Sylvia Fenmore, 66, who has leased a space ever since renting an apartment 25 years ago, who now pays $71.13 a month for the spot. "They could increase your garage rent to $1,000 a month. If you don't like it, they could throw you out." While Ms. Fenmore has not had a parking lease for a few years, under her most recent one she paid a fixed rate for a two-year period.
Residents found other terms onerous. For example, the agreement gives the owner "absolute discretion" to terminate the lease if a person engages in "abusive conduct" toward other residents or building employees, "in or out of the garage."
Tenants of rent-stabilized apartments feel the lease will leave them particularly vulnerable to losing their spaces, in part because they pay much less than the market rate of $180 a month that a sign in the garage advertises. If she argued with the superintendent over fixing a toilet, asked Linda Reisenman, 57, could that be construed as "abusive conduct"?
Harry Richter Jr., the garage manager, said the lease had mistakenly gone out to some rent-stabilized tenants, although it was meant solely for co-op owners and other renters.
The corrected version, which retains the "abusive conduct" language and other provisions but sets a fixed yearly period rather than a month-to-month one, had been sent to some rent-stabilized tenants and would soon be sent to the others.
The month-to-month lease is reasonable for co-op owners, Mr. Richter said, as is the revised one for rent-stabilized tenants.
Harry Ryttenberg, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said tenants ofrent-stabilized apartments who have rented garage spaces as part of their original apartment lease usually can be charged only the state-authorized increases. If tenants feel they have a grievance, he said, they could file a claim of reduction in services, which Ms. Fenmore and three other tenants say they have done.
Several co-op owners, feeling the agreement is no better for them, planned a separate meeting. "It's a nonlease," said a worried Anita Schwartz, 71. "I don't know what to do."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Powerboats, Picket Lines: Strikers Are Getting By

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich.

 BODY:
THE auto workers who have been walking picket lines outside two General Motors parts factories here for the last six weeks receive just $150 a week in strike benefits from their union, a paltry sum that conjures up images of workers living on bologna sandwiches and worrying that their houses and cars might soon be repossessed.
But for most of the workers, the reality could not be more different -- a fact that helps to explain both why they are striking and why the United Automobile Workers union is in no hurry to settle with the world's biggest auto maker. 
 Suzanne M. Champion, a forklift operator, has been shopping for antiques during the strike; a week ago, she bought an oak cupboard for $650. Rod Mosher, a factory equipment repairman, has been sailing his 36-foot cabin cruiser on Lake Michigan, returning briefly on Tuesday nights to serve his weekly two-hour stint on the picket line. Jennifer Lenoir, who sets up production lines for auto parts, has been eating out regularly -- although she and her husband have made the sacrifice of keeping their 26-foot powerboat at the dock to save gas.
The extent to which these and other G.M. workers can keep living well a month and a half into their strike reflects the auto workers' high pay and diligence about saving money, as well as the very low cost of living in this industrial city. The average auto worker here -- 48 years old, with 21 years of service at G.M. -- earned $69,000 last year in a metropolitan area where the median price of a house is just $93,500.
The issues in the strike reflect the workers' financial success. The U.A.W. has not been asking for higher pay or better benefits. Instead, the union has demanded that G.M. buy new equipment for the factories here and start replacing some workers as they retire, so that another generation of Flint residents can enjoy high-paying jobs (and continue supporting the union with their membership dues). G.M. has resisted these demands, contending that global competition is too fierce for it to retain so many well-paid workers indefinitely.
To be sure, some workers and their families have tightened their belts considerably during the strike. Nihla M. Hall, an auto worker's wife who has raised five daughters, said she planned to eat only baked beans and salads until the strike ended. Janet A. Manley, who assembles auto hood latches and is the single mother of a 13-year-old boy, has already fallen behind on many bills.
But both women's grown daughters are buying them groceries. In a city that has lost a third of its population over the last two decades and has had few new arrivals, the remaining auto workers tend to be lifetime residents with many sources of support. Local financial institutions, owned in some cases by the auto workers themselves, have been eager to lend money to strikers on the assumption that their big paychecks will resume eventually.
A result is that while G.M. loses $75 million a day, Flint workers and their families talk in terms of how many more months, not weeks, they can last. "If it goes on a couple more months, we may be hurting," Mrs. Hall said.
ELSEWHERE in unionized American companies, employers have gained the upper hand. Even the U.A.W. suffered a setback when Caterpillar Inc. was able to keep its main factory open in Peoria, Ill., with replacement workers despite a 17-month strike that ended in December 1995. The current strikes here have also brought pain to lower-paid, nonunion workers laid off by outside parts suppliers and other businesses across the country.
But the U.A.W. is still in a fairly strong position vis-a-vis G.M. Replacing the auto maker's 200,000 U.A.W. members at dozens of assembly plants and parts factories is simply not feasible, especially with the nation's unemployment rate below 5 percent. And the affluence of auto workers makes long strikes less difficult for their union -- both financially and politically -- than for other industrial unions, although even auto workers resent missing paychecks.
Given the ample financial resources of the strikers in Flint, nobody in the auto industry expects G.M. to try to starve out the workers. Instead, the company has tried to drive a lasting wedge between the 9,200 strikers and their union, and between the strikers and the 180,000 workers that G.M. has been forced to lay off across North America for lack of auto parts from the factories here. G.M. has strongly criticized the competence of union leaders while pointing out that union workers could be earning a lot more if they were back on the job.
"It is a dispute here about a local union leadership's failure to improve some noncompetitive work practices," said Donald Hackworth, G.M.'s group vice president for North American operations.
In a dozen previous G.M. factory strikes over the last five years, workers have consistently backed their leaders during the walkouts, but sometimes criticized them afterward. Workers who endured a three-month strike last summer against a pickup truck assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich., did not elect any of their local union leaders as delegates to a U.A.W. convention last month in Las Vegas. But the local union in Pontiac has long suffered from factional infighting that has been less evident in Flint.
EVEN if the strikes here affect union politics at the local and national levels for years to come, their effects on workers are more muted. In Flint, auto workers' pay ranges from $40,000 for an assembly line worker who shuns overtime to $100,000 for a skilled electrician who works seven-day weeks practically all year, as a surprising number do. In households with two G.M. workers -- also common, because the union has pushed the company to hire employees' relatives -- as much as $150,000 in G.M. paychecks can be cashed in a year.
In Flint, that kind of money goes a long way. Besides having inexpensive housing, practically everyone sends their children to public schools. Many workers spend vacations with relatives in the Midwest and South instead of going on costly overseas trips.
General Motors lays out an average of $29,000 annually on benefits for each union worker, including subsidized child care and one of the most lavish medical plans left in corporate America. With labor costs kept low -- outside the auto plants -- by the highest unemployment rate of any metropolitan area in worker-scarce Michigan, restaurant meals and other services are cheap. A good steak dinner for two with wine and tip can still be had for $50.
While some auto workers have reputations for high living, many are quite frugal. David L. Littmann, the senior economist at Comerica Bank, the largest Michigan bank, said the auto industry's cycle of spectacular booms and wallet-pinching busts had left the state's residents more conservative about taking on debt -- and banks leery of lending too much during good times. Some of the highest average bank balances in Michigan are found in the northern suburbs of Flint, where many residents are auto-worker descendants of frugal German immigrants, he added.
U.A.W. members are eligible to retire with full pensions after 30 years, although some wait longer, and many workers with 20 years' experience already have substantial retirement savings they can tap. "People think we're auto workers, we make the big money and we blow it all," said James M. Parker, 42, a forklift operator with 22 years at G.M. "But what we have to think about is retirement -- will Social Security be there?"
Mr. Parker is reluctant to tap his retirement savings for emergencies. Like many other workers here, he began preparing for a strike in February, when the union first raised the possibility of a showdown. He postponed plans to buy an Oldsmobile Intrigue sedan and made sure that he paid his credit cards and utility bills in full each month. Like many other workers with loans, he has already obtained permission from the West Side Auto Employees Federal Credit Union to postpone one monthly payment -- on his Chevrolet pickup -- and is now filling out the paperwork to postpone another, instead adding to the balance that he will owe at the end of the loan.
OWNED by its depositors, with a board composed entirely of current or retired auto workers, West Side Auto is one of several auto worker credit unions here that are playing an important financial role in the strike. Heavily used by workers for the direct deposit of paychecks and other basic financial services, the credit unions have been cushioning the strike's effects on customers.
Inside the entrance of West Side Auto's postmodern brick-and-glass building is a colorful sign offering $3,000 one-year personal loans for striking and laid-off workers, at an interest rate of 10.5 percent. The credit union is also granting almost automatic postponements of credit card debts and loan payments during the strike, said David A. McGrain, its vice president for marketing.
But while some customers are seeking loan extensions, many, like Mr. Parker, also took steps early this year to prepare for a strike. "We did see a noticeable increase in the savings of our members," Mr. McGrain said, "and it was in the more liquid accounts, like savings accounts and checking accounts." To maintain its liquidity, the credit union has been cashing in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit at major banks as they mature, instead of reinvesting the money.
So far, though, the credit union has not had to liquidate investments or tap its lines of credit, Mr. McGrain added, and it has not noticed any increase in bankruptcies or foreclosures among its depositors.
West Side Auto has discouraged most workers here from deferring mortgage payments, because that can significantly increase the interest that a worker will owe over the following years. But a surprising number of auto workers here do not even have mortgages. Skilled with tools from their factory work, they build their own homes and borrow little money, if any, in the process. Land is cheap and readily available outside the city limits.
James T. Kuzma, 60, who repairs heavy equipment at a factory here that stamps auto body parts from sheets of steel, built his four-bedroom house 33 years ago on eight acres in nearby Clio, Mich. Mr. Kuzma and his wife, Dorothy, erected the garage first and lived in it for five years while they built the house, having the first four of their five children in the meantime.
During the strike, which began on June 5 at the stamping factory, Mr. Kuzma has seldom left home, choosing to stay near his volleyball court, horseshoe pits, three picnic tables, barbecue pit and fish pond, the latter replenished by a 40-foot-tall antique windmill that pumps water from a nearby well.
He sometimes catches dinner at the pond, and Mrs. Kuzma, who has planted her usual large garden and cans her own vegetables, was baking pies last week, using apples from their orchard. So the family feels ready for a very long strike.
"I'll stay out as long as it takes," Mr. Kuzma said as he walked the picket line outside the stamping plant, a block-long building of gray bricks and steel several stories tall. "If it's a year, I'll still be out here."
Quite a few auto workers actually welcomed the strike as a respite from the six- and seven-day workweeks they had been putting in for the last five years. Though most union members jump at chances to earn overtime pay, many are exhausted because it has been so long since the last recession.
Ms. Champion, who is single and has no children, has been eating out often during the strike and buying antique furniture for the century-old farmhouse she purchased last spring. "I was working so much, I didn't have time to spend any money" before the strike, she said.
Of course, not all auto workers are so fortunate. The ones having financial difficulties tend to be single mothers, parents with several young children or the few workers recently hired at the factories.
Ms. Manley said she had been on welfare when G.M. hired her seven years ago and has not been able to build up her savings since. Divorced, Ms. Manley and her 13-year-old son long have lived with her daughter, who works at a window shutter factory and earns much less than her mother normally does at G.M. But the daughter is now paying the family's rent and utility bills and buying the groceries.
"I'm hoping this gets settled," Ms. Manley said, standing outside West Side Auto, where she had just asked for an extension of a car payment.
BUT financially distressed strikers like Ms. Manley are hard to find. Flint's largest charity, the Salvation Army, has noted little, if any, increase in requests for assistance.
Some workers, like Betty McCaw, a janitor who has worked for G.M. for 25 years, say they have not come across any fellow union members in difficulty. "There probably are -- I don't know any," Miss McCaw said as she sat, picket sign in hand, outside the entrance to a spark plug and speedometer factory where workers have been on strike since June 11.
Far more common than financially troubled strikers are prosperous workers like Mr. Kuzma who have comfortable homes but worry that they lead a dying way of life. G.M.'s employment in the Flint area has tumbled from a peak of 76,900 in 1978 to just 33,000 now.
Not one of Mr. Kuzma's five children was able to find a job as a U.A.W. worker in this city's G.M. factories. One daughter, Sharon, graduated from college and is now the acting head of quality control -- a management job -- at the factory where her father has worked for 41 years. That pleases him but does not make him any more confident that there will be blue-collar jobs with high wages available for his friends' children and grandchildren.
"Look at the picket lines and you don't see young people," Mr. Kuzma fretted. "The new opportunities for the young people really aren't there, and that's bad."

HEADLINE: A Hotelier for Jaded Boomers

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH

 BODY:
IAN SCHRAGER sat at the head of a stark white table in a stark white room. Dressed in khaki pants and a collarless white shirt, he was surrounded by men in crisp dark suits talking in the most minute detail about this hotel -- the Delano, his intimate Art Deco property whose room rates are Miami's highest.
Why, Mr. Schrager wanted to know, were housekeepers turning down only 35 rooms a shift, instead of 50 or 55? And how was the mix of fashion, walk-in and group business holding up? 
 Rising to take a fast-paced tour of the hotel, Mr. Schrager turned up a maddening stain on the bottom of the swimming pool -- one of the hottest social scenes in Miami Beach.
Fix it, he said to the hotel's general manager before boarding a Gulfstream jet to return to New York. Over the next week, he would fly to London to inspect two other hotels he was developing, debate acquiring a property in Chicago and reopen the St. Moritz hotel, the frayed dowager on Manhattan's Central Park South that he hopes to turn into superluxury lodging and the flagship for his company.
In the last five months, Mr. Schrager, the former operator of the Studio 54 discotheque -- and, as a result, a convicted felon who had a hard time borrowing the money to buy a fleabag hotel in 1983 -- has multiplied the number of hotels he owns to 16 from 6. He has also found a powerful Wall Street partner, enabling his company to become the largest hotel owner in New York. Last week, he signed contracts to buy the 1,000-room St. Giles Circus hotel in London and the 110-room Hotel la Tremoille in Paris. And within the next three years, he wants to quadruple the size of his billion-dollar company.
But if Mr. Schrager, who turns 52 today, was once a rebel -- defying industry conventions with hotels in bad locations that combined stylized, closet-sized rooms with glamorous patrons and head-turning lobbies, bars and restaurants -- the "boutique" niche he brought to life is now being stalked by every large hotel chain in the country.
Hilton, Sheraton and their ilk are all hurrying to build quirky hotels for baby boomers who are tired of the sameness of their childhood Holiday Inns. And the rush is coming as the industry, notorious for its cycles of boom and bust, appears to be in the midst of another episode of frenzied overbuilding.
Mr. Schrager, who nearly lost his heavily leveraged hotel empire during the last industry downturn, in the early 1990's, says he is better capitalized than in the past -- and more nimble and more hip than his rivals. He, not they, Mr. Schrager says, is best able to replicate the success of hotels like his Royalton, whose lobby and restaurant on Manhattan's West 44th Street remain the places to be seen for the black-clad executives of the advertising, fashion and magazine industries.
"I think every city could use a boutique hotel that takes it up a notch," said Mr. Schrager, looking over his steel-framed reading glasses. "In a place like Indiana you couldn't do a Royalton, but you could do a hotel that's better than the generic cookie-cutter ones that are out there."
MR. SCHRAGER'S hotels can never be described as cookie-cutter. The dark wood lobby that sweeps back to the airy Blue Door restaurant at the 208-room Delano, for example, bears little resemblance to the 2,000 yards of sheer white curtains and 40-foot mahogany doors that dominate the lobby of the 245-room Mondrian in West Los Angeles -- even though the two hotels had the same designer, Philippe Starck. At both, the guest rooms, with their custom furniture, have an elegant simplicity, which may help guests forget the close quarters. But the emphasis is on the public areas -- the lobbies, restaurants and bars.
"I didn't think he could be successful at the Mondrian," said David Geffen, the Los Angeles media billionaire who is an old friend of Mr. Schrager. "But he turned it into a major addition to L.A. He knows how to make people feel that they're staying at an exciting place."
Mr. Schrager's office at the Paramount, his 591-room hotel on West 46th Street in Manhattan, is characteristically black and white, with family photographs scattered amongst magazine and newspaper articles that testify to his obsession with the elusive intersection of pop culture, fashion and commerce: "How Cars Lost Their Character," "Fantasy Decor Isn't Just for Amusement Parks Anymore" and "How the Gap Inc. Spells Revenge." Indeed, the Gap, along with Nike, serves as a corporate model for him; both companies have stayed ahead of the fashion curve while appealing to audiences that cross class lines.
"We grew up in a mass-market economy," Mr. Schrager said. "Sameness was a virtue. Holiday Inn used to say the best surprise is no surprise. But I think my generation wants to see something new and innovative, stylish. We brought an entertainment approach to hotels that makes it more than just a place to sleep."
Mr. Schrager, who lives with his wife, Rita Narona, and two young daughters in a $9 million apartment on Central Park West, has gone to great lengths to assure that sleeping is the last thing his guests think about. Before settling on a design for the "water salon" at the Delano, he papered his entire office with photographs of swimming pools torn from magazines. Before choosing the appropriate uniform for workers at the Whiskey Bar in the Paramount, he had models don 100 different outfits.
"At the end of the day, Ian is selling a certain amount of sex appeal, which is probably the same notion he was selling 20 years ago at Studio 54," said Jonathan Tisch, president of Loews Hotels. "Ian has really changed the hotel industry by showing us what design, excitement and hype can do for what has been a very staid business."
These days, ever conscious of his image, Mr. Schrager emphasizes the profitability of his enterprise. Last year, he said, the six of his hotels that were open for guests turned $59.5 million in operating income on $148.7 million in revenue from rooms -- a 40 percent profit margin that analysts say puts Mr. Schrager in the top tier of hoteliers. Revenue per available room, a standard measure of financial health, runs about 6.6 percent above the industry average for the Paramount and a whopping 40 percent at the smaller Royalton.
Setting the stage for the rapid expansion he plans, Mr. Schrager formed a partnership in March with the Northstar Capital Investment Corporation, a real estate investment firm in New York, and consolidated his hotel properties into a single company, Ian Schrager Hotels. Northstar, which is becoming a publicly traded real estate investment trust, has an 84 percent stake in the company, but Mr. Schrager runs the hotels with little interference. He is chasing more deals in Paris and Berlin and plans to sell shares overseas this fall in his company's hotel venture in Europe with Burford Ltd., a real estate company based in London.
"He gets more rate for his product than other hoteliers because of his style, clientele and the image thing," said Arthur Adler, lodging director at Sonnenblick Goldman, a real estate investment bank in New York. "With Starck and the custom-made furniture, he has higher development costs, but he makes up for it with higher occupancy. Over all, he's extremely cost efficient."
Mr. Schrager said his current strategy had three prongs: to buy up to five hotels a year, to roll out one of his New York hotels as a brand in other cities and to develop a line of boutique hotels for one of the lodging giants. According to hotel executives, Mr. Schrager has had talks with Bass Hotels and Resorts, which operates or franchises the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn chains. More recently, industry analysts say, he resumed negotiations with Barry S. Sternlicht, chairman of Starwood Hotels and Resorts -- which, as the owner of such brands as Sheraton and Westin, is the largest hotel company in the world -- about creating a hotel brand for Starwood. Starwood officials did not return calls seeking comment.
"This is not something that's just a specialized niche," Mr. Schrager said of his style of hotel development. "It's got mainstream appeal that people respond to."
Some industry experts disagree. "He's still playing the margins," said Stephen Rushmore, president of H.V.S. International, a hotel consulting firm in Minneola, N.Y. "He's going after the entertainment set, actors, models, designers. I'm not sure that market is deep enough to fill all those rooms."
One hotelier who says he does not see the appeal of Mr. Schrager's approach is Donald J. Trump.
"He puts linoleum in the bathrooms and gets people to pay a high price," Mr. Trump said. "I've always liked using marble." For Mr. Schrager's sake, he added, "I hope the public never tires of linoleum."
MR. SCHRAGER'S bid to become an international hotelier comes as the specter of overbuilding is again haunting the hotel industry.
Across the country, up to almost 165,000 new rooms are expected to open this year, one of the highest volumes ever, according to Paine Webber Lodging Research. It is as if many hoteliers have forgotten the lessons from the great hotel bust of the early 1990's, when the industry teetered under the weight of empty rooms and hefty debts. Even the mighty Marriott Corporation had to reorganize into two separate companies; Marriott International now expects to add 150,000 new rooms by 2002.
But hotel occupancy rates are already dropping in cities like Atlanta, Dallas and Phoenix -- places that only a few years ago were described as hot real estate markets. Analysts take some solace in the fact that fewer new rooms are planned at the high end of the market. Investors, however, have found no such comfort, sending hotel stocks down about 10 percent this year, on average, even as the overall stock market has continued to climb.
Nonetheless, it seems as if every hotel company wants a line of boutique hotels, a field that Mr. Schrager once had to himself.
Paul A. Nussbaum, chairman of Patriot American Hospitality, which owns Interstate Hotels and Wyndham, has said he plans to bring his recently acquired Malmaison boutique chain to New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles from Britain. William Kimpton, whose boutique hotels feature the restaurants of Wolfgang Puck and other celebrity chefs, is pushing his collection of trendy hotels eastward from San Francisco and wants to double it in size by 2002. In April, Starwood -- which had tried to buy Mr. Schrager's company last year -- converted the old Doral on Park Avenue into the W New York.
Analysts say a smaller company like Mr. Schrager's will find it difficult to compete with the huge advertising budgets and reservations systems of a giant like Starwood. But, they add, Mr. Schrager retains an entrepreneurial edge.
"The big corporations will find it more difficult to duplicate the creativity of small, boutique properties," said Jason N. Ader, a lodging analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company.
Still, Mr. Schrager is spreading his entrepreneurship well beyond his three original hotels in New York. He is now operating eight hotels, including the Clift in San Francisco and the recently acquired Barbizon and Empire in Manhattan. At the same time, he is developing eight others: three in London, one in Paris, the Miramar in Montecito, Calif., and three others in New York, including the St. Moritz, which he snatched away from Mr. Trump.
For Mr. Schrager, of course, the risk is that he may become the kind of cookie-cutter hotelier he once abhorred.
"His challenge is to maintain the unique qualities of the Royalton or the Delano and be able to do it at more than one hotel at a time," said Thomas McConnell, a hotel consultant with Arthur Andersen & Company. "The downside could be that there isn't enough time in the day to spend on three projects, let alone six."
MR. SCHRAGER'S plunge into the hotel business with his late partner, Steve Rubell, came in the mid-1980's after a wild ride atop New York night life.
For just under three years, the men -- Mr. Rubell a restaurateur, Mr. Schrager a one-time real estate lawyer -- ran Studio 54, gaining a lifetime of experience in merchandising but, Mr. Schrager acknowledges, being nearly destroyed by "greed and power."
The enormously popular club captured a cultural moment in time for a generation of celebrities who now patronize his hotels -- people like Norma Kamali, Calvin Klein, Cher, Bianca Jagger and Mr. Geffen. Rande Gerber, who as a college student danced at the discotheque, now owns the Whiskey Bar at the Paramount and the Sky Bar at the Mondrian; at Starwood's W New York, he will operate the bar, as well.
But at Studio 54, the party ended in late 1979, 11 months after a raid by Federal agents uncovered $600,000 in unreported cash. "We never thought we were losing our way," Mr. Schrager said. "But we broke the law and it took 10 years away from me," he added, describing his fight to regain his credibility.
After pleading guilty to tax evasion and spending 13 months in Federal prison, Mr. Schrager and Mr. Rubell returned to New York, where they bought a rundown hotel at Madison and 38th Street and turned it into Morgans, a boutique that still caters to the entertainment industry. Unable to obtain financing from conventional sources, they turned to Philip Pilevsky and Arthur Cohen, financiers willing to accept ownership stakes in exchange for their contacts with foreign banks and investors.
As in their disco days, Mr. Rubell was the promoter while Mr. Schrager, a less ebullient personality who has a speech impediment, buried himself in the details. The Royalton followed in 1988; Mr. Rubell died of hepatitis in 1989, a year before the opening of the Paramount, a less pricey take on the Royalton's formula.
Many people thought the hotels would collapse without Mr. Rubell's promotional genius. Instead, "Ian seems to have taken to that role," Mr. McConnell said. "Their ability to promote is as strong as ever." And as inexpensive. Mr. Schrager sells the hotels through a shrewd use of free advertising -- a perpetual round of articles and gossip-column items about his glamorous patrons, his stylish restaurants and his hotels' startling designs.
Mr. Schrager has never had trouble filling rooms. But during the recession in the early 1990's, Morgans and the Royalton -- both saddled with enormous debts -- staggered into bankruptcy court.
Was Mr. Schrager a great hotel operator but a financial disaster? "The bank troubles that the Schrager group had were no different than anyone else," Mr. McConnell said. "I would say virtually every hotel owner in Manhattan lost their equity between 1989 and 1994."
Mr. Schrager acknowledged that his heavy borrowing during those years was a mistake. "The financing of the hotels was not my area," he said, "But, I didn't say no. So, I share the blame."
Lining up a new, more disciplined set of financial backers, he managed to hold on to his hotels. And with backing from the Apollo Group, led by the financier Leon Black, Mr. Schrager developed the Delano in Miami Beach, re-establishing his fiscal credibility and burnishing his cachet.
HE is now more determined than ever to build a major hotel company that would wipe out the ignominy of the past. His company, he said, has about 30 percent equity in each of its hotels, so while Mr. Schrager might feel the pain of a future downturn, bankers won't be immediately at his door.
To manage the company, Mr. Schrager has hired hotel veterans from companies like Euro Disney S.C.A. and Westin. Some longtime Schrager executives remain, but there have also been painful breakups, many of them well-chronicled in the tabloids.
Jerry Inzerillo, who was in charge of operations, has quit twice to work instead for a South African casino resort company. And Mr. Schrager has had a very public spat with Mr. Pilevsky, his one-time backer, and Brian McNally, the restaurateur who runs the 44 restaurant at the Royalton, who are partners in developing two boutique hotels in New York and another in Miami Beach that will compete directly with Mr. Schrager's properties.
For his part, Mr. Schrager says he regrets the harsh words and the squabbles over loyalty and credit for the success of the hotels. He likens himself to a chef. "Our success was attributed to Steve, then to McNally and then to Gerber," Mr. Schrager said. "We put them together in a package, like a soup or a salad, that got people excited. It was instinct. You're not going to get that out of focus groups."
HIS next package is the St. Moritz, the Manhattan hotel that he plans to freshen with lots of glass in its masonry walls on Central Park South. The transformation will bring "the energy and excitement of the street" into a lobby that will "be a beehive of activity," he said. He expects to add a major spa and to make the rooms overlooking Central Park bigger, reducing the total from 700 to 500.
"I never did superluxury before, because I am middle class and didn't understand it," Mr. Schrager said. "But now I'm getting older and evolving with my customers. I'd like to do a hotel like that."
 
Yes, There's Life After the Last Days of Disco
The mirrored ball at Studio 54 finally stopped spinning last week, when Miramax finished filming "54," its paean to the discotheque that attracted the hip and famous.
In keeping with the new family-safe Times Square district, the current owner of the building -- on West 54th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue -- wants it to become "anything but a nightclub." The owner, Eric Hadar of Allied Partners, said he had been renting out the club for private parties.
Built in 1927 as the Fortune Gallo Opera House, the building was later the Casino de Paree and the Federal Music Theater. CBS converted it to a sound stage in 1943, broadcasting performances by Jack Benny and Johnny Carson and the "$64,000 Question" quiz show. More recently, it had been home to a rock club and a topless bar.

The Cure That Can Sometimes Kill the Patient

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
BACK in the 1970's, it was considered a fairly benign cure for recessions and export slumps. As recently as a year ago, it was the prescription for economic excesses that plagued Thailand and others in the Pacific Rim. Today it is regarded as about as safe as bloodletting, and economies as disparate as Russia and China are advised to just say no. The "it" is devaluation, that mysterious force of international finance that talking heads on television never bother to explain or distinguish from depreciation.
Russia, in particular, was fending off devaluation last week, hoping that a massive bailout from the West would save the ruble and the economy.
 
Broken Promise
Devaluation and depreciation refer to a decline in the value of a currency. The distinction is this: When a government has declared that it is pegging its currency to another and will defend it by any means necessary but lets it fall anyway, that's devaluation. When the falling currency is that of a country that allows the global marketplace to set the value and its currency falls, that's depreciation. One involves a broken promise, the other doesn't. 
 Most major economies -- the United States, Japan, the European Community -- let their currencies fluctuate with supply and demand. Smaller or newer members of the world financial system, like Russia and China, often fix their currencies but have the option of periodic devaluation. Some countries like Argentina have embraced systems that virtually rule out devaluation by putting foreign exchange policy in the hands of a currency board.
The upside of a country's promising to defend its exchange rate is that doing so makes life fairly predictable for exporters and importers, lenders and borrowers, investors and consumers. But keeping that promise is harder than it sounds. If inflation rises, a government's currency will suddenly be out of line with domestic prices. If a country is a big producer of copper and the copper market collapses, the currency will be too strong and a trade deficit will result.
Devaluation can stimulate exports. Equally important, the central bank no longer has to keep interest rates high in order to prop up the currency. But there is also some pain. Import prices go up and the standard of living goes down.
In the 1990's, as economies around the world become more closely intertwined, a broken promise carries much bigger risks than it did in the 1970's. What happens to a particular country's currency has a bigger impact on its economy and the confidence of investors, who can pull out with a few strokes of the computer keyboard.
The current crisis in Asia, where exchange rates plunged, shows that devaluation can lead to financial chaos and recessions. Governments often think they can devalue just a little, but such a move can convince investors that those governments' promises aren't worth much. The governments must then push interest rates through the roof to stop capital flight. The high rates also trigger bank failures and corporate bankruptcies.
Asian banks and corporations acted a lot like people who built homes on flood plains after the county put up a dam. Many happily borrowed in foreign currency and lent in local currency, but few hedged against a collapse. "They hadn't bought insurance, so they got slammed," said Barry Eichengreen, an international economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
Because the governments backed the banks, their treasuries lost money. The crisis quickly wiped out any benefits of the cheaper currency as failing banks stopped lending and corporations couldn't get funding for exports. Devaluation can also fatally damage a government's credibility. In recent years, many countries, especially those trying to overcome a history of inflation, have forsworn the commercial advantages of floating exchange rates and embraced fixed rates to gain credibility with global investors. "Clearly the exchange rate is now a much more important indicator of the stability of domestic policy," said Albert Fishlow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
The problem with this strategy is that once the commitment to a fixed rate is made, it's hard to back away. The Yeltsin Government has managed to stabilize the exchange rate and inflation. If the ruble falls, the real fear is not just a run on the currency and another inflationary spiral but political meltdown. "It's not just the credibility of the exchange rate," said Peter Kenan, an economist at Princeton. "It's the credibility of the reformers."
Devaluation can lead to successive rounds by trading partners trying to offset the damage from a competitor's devaluation. That's the fear with China, which has been under growing pressure to devalue. Not only is its economic growth slowing, its exporters are hurting because competitors like Thailand and Indonesia have let their currencies plummet, leaving the Chinese yuan high and dry. But that round-robin of devaluations would wipe out any stimulus to China's neighbors mired in deep recessions. So far, China's reform leaders have promised to hang tough.

There are both benefits and costs when a government devalues its currency. (Depreciation occurs through market forces.)
 
Benefits
Makes exports more competitive.
Creates new jobs.
Allows central bank to ease monetary policy and permit lower interest rates.
 
Costs
Makes imports more expensive, thus lowering the standard of living.
Can lead to further attacks on the currency by investors; astronomical interest rates; bank failures; corporate bankrupties, and recession.
Can prompt trading partners to devalue as well, thus erasing any potential benefits to the export sector.
 
When the Thai Government devalued the baht last year, it fell 20 percent in value overnight. However, over the next six months or so, the market depreciated the currency another 88 percent.

Fighting for Respect in Beleaguered Brooklyn

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
Haute Manhattan still raises a condescending eyebrow when Brooklynites sing of their ethnic enclaves, tree-lined streets and vintage brownstones. This Manhattanite view of Brooklyn as a kind of social purgatory dates back to Colonial times. Its most tedious expression comes in tenants who are forced into Brooklyn by scandalous rents, only to pine away for that matchbox Manhattan apartment with the view of a brick wall.
When I moved to Brooklyn 12 years ago, only Manhattanites who were driven out surrendered to the brownstone embrace. But over the last few years, those of us who are Brooklynites by choice have noticed an increasing number of emigres who could afford to live anywhere but have cast their lot with us. 
 Centuries in the making, the view of Brooklyn as a province of rubes and lowbrows is giving way to grudging respect for the texture of what would be the third-largest city in America, behind Los Angeles and Chicago. In addition to having its own glossy magazine -- aptly named Brooklyn Bridge -- Brooklyn has been the subject of two recent histories, with a third, "The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn," due out from Yale this fall. Tour buses visit the borough's more established neighborhoods, from Brooklyn Heights to Park Slope and a revitalized downtown. After a flurry of business development, Brooklyn has a Marriott, its first new hotel in almost 70 years.
These might seem petty developments to highbrow Manhattan. But for those of us who live in Brooklyn -- after a half-century of industrial decline and slanderous disrespect from our neighbors across the river -- the development is a sign that the Manhattan-centric view of our town is losing its grip at last.
Staten Island, Queens and the Bronx have suffered slights and discomforts in a city where Manhattan runs the show. But no people have chafed as consistently under Manhattan's rule -- or lost so much because of it -- as Brooklynites, whose city loomed as a large, industrial power when it was merged into New York in 1898.
Manhattan's contempt for Brooklyn dates back at least 200 years, when business and civic leaders worried that the willful upstart across the river might eventually overtake them.
The Brooklyn Bridge was hailed as the engineering miracle of its age. But by connecting the two rival cities, it played into the hands of powerful Manhattanites who favored consolidation. Walt Whitman's old paper, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, fought valiantly for independence, arguing that Brooklyn would become a poor relation of citizens who already despised it. But The New York Times scoffed that Brooklyn had only riches to gain -- and nothing to lose but its poverty.
The Brooklyn Eagle was right. The shift of power to Manhattan demoted Brooklynites to a relatively powerless lot whose needs would be forever secondary. While City Hall dithered over what to do with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles crept in and stole them. The waterfront areas that Manhattanites wanted so badly were allowed to deteriorate -- and today are threatened by trash transfer stations and dismal planning that may squander them again.
Consolidation's worst effect was to ratify the view that Manhattan was the center of the universe and that Brooklyn was a cultural desert. This notion became so popular in the 20th-century press that Brooklynites formed an anti-defamation society that grew to 40,000 members by the mid 1940's. As the writer Alfred Kazin wrote of his childhood in a vibrant, Jewish Brownsville, "We were of the city, but somehow not in it," which meant that one escaped to "The City" as soon as possible.
After centuries of abuse, Brooklyn has been ratified as hip. Watch the Fourth of July fireworks from the little park in post-industrial Greenpoint, and you are apt to be accompanied by Japanese tourists snapping pictures and reading aloud from guidebooks. Along Bedford Avenue in once-dying Williamsburg, beginning galleries, boutiques and arty restaurants may yet do for the petered industrial world what they did for SoHo in the 1950's.
Baby boomers who want out of Manhattan are revitalizing brownstone neighborhoods, many of which are experiencing their first revival in this century. The reverse migration reflects a longing for small, definable city neighborhoods where high-rises do not shut out the sky. In historical terms, it also suggests that Brooklyn, once down for the count, is up and fighting its way back.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Donor Class

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Most Americans realize that to a large extent you get what you pay for in Congress. But I doubt that many people are aware of just how elite and homogenous the donor class is. It's a tiny group -- just one-quarter of 1 percent of the population -- and it is not representative of the rest of the nation. But its money buys plenty of access.
"Congressional donors," according to a national study of individual campaign contributors, "are overwhelmingly drawn from the most powerful and affluent groups in American society." 
 The study, financed by the Joyce Foundation of Chicago, was based on a comprehensive survey of individuals who contributed $200 or more to Congressional candidates in 1996. (Smaller contributions do not have to be reported.)
Ninety-five percent of the contributors were white. Eighty percent were men. Eighty percent were over the age of 45, and nearly half were over 60. And 81 percent had annual family incomes higher than $100,000.
You want elite? Twenty percent of the donors had annual incomes higher than $500,000.
Say hello to the plutocracy.
Most American families earn well under $50,000 a year and are struggling to make ends meet. They may be concerned about such matters as health coverage and financing their children's education, but it's the guy in the knickers strolling off the golf course who gets to go to the clubhouse and ring up his Congressman.
More than half of the campaign donors said they had talked with their member of Congress since the election. More than a third said they had been in touch with both of their senators.
Have you talked with your senator or representative lately?
"People are deeply distrustful of the current campaign finance system," said Lawrence Hansen, vice president of the Joyce Foundation. "Among the mysteries the investigators tried to unravel were the attitudes and feelings of the men and women -- and it's mostly men, as you can see -- who actually fuel this system."
The survey found that the donors were generally conservative economically and moderate to liberal on social issues. For example, more than half favored tax cuts even if they required cuts in public services, but only a quarter wanted to prohibit abortions.
The authors of the study said: "These major donors on balance oppose national health insurance, additional anti-poverty spending and reductions in defense spending, but back gay rights and free trade. They are fairly evenly divided on environmental protection and affirmative action."
If voters with less money had more access to their legislators they might have argued, among other things, that there is still a tremendous amount of poverty in the United States and it might be a good idea in these good economic times to address it. The National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University recently noted that one of every four American children is poor, and that the total number is rising.
But the poor do not have any money to throw at Congress and poverty is not a matter of great concern to the donor class. So it's not at all surprising that this Congress would be voting to kill home heating subsidies for the poor, and summer jobs and other programs for disadvantaged youngsters.
No wonder voters are cynical. Ellen Miller, the executive director of Public Campaign, a Washington-based group that supports campaign finance reform, said: "Congress is consistently more responsive to the economic interests of those who fund election campaigns. It does not have ordinary citizens' interests at heart."
Poll after poll has shown that the majority of Americans are turned off by the way campaigns are financed. Said Ms. Miller:
"The public believes campaigns cost more and more with each election cycle; that those who give the money get something ordinary people don't get -- access and influence over the system; that there is a nonstop fund-raising chase, so that candidates spend more time raising money than they spend doing other business; and that good people can't run for office without becoming enslaved to the system, which is both the money chase and the special-interest influence that ensues."
She paused for a moment, then added, "They're right."

HEADLINE: Do Workers Really Have More Purchasing Power?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As a bookkeeper who has done payrolls for 20 years, my observations differ from those in the article. 
 Did the economists take into consideration the amount of taxes deducted from workers' pay? For example, let's assume that a single person in New York City with no dependents makes $13.18 an hour -- the average wage cited by the economists for production and nonsupervisory workers in manufacturing. That means gross pay of $527 a week. However, the deductions for various taxes -- including Federal, state, city, Social Security and Medicare -- leave net pay of $384 a week. Deduct living expenses (and I am being very conservative) of $84 a week for food and other necessities and $200 for rent, utilities and other costs, and you have a net of $100 a week.
According to this calculation of available money, the worker would have to work at least 180 weeks, or 7,200 hours, to buy a $17,995 Ford Taurus -- not the 1,365 hours cited in a chart accompanying the article. And remember that in 1908, when, the chart says, it took the average worker 4,696 hours to buy a Model T, there wasn't an income tax.
So I ask economists not to lull us into euphoria about how well-off the "little guy" is. Let's face it: The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

HEADLINE: Article on Modular School Missed a Major Element

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your article "Modular School Plan Is a Racial Solution, Opponents Say," June 14) missed the point on a crucial issue: a proposal to convert Middle School 141 from a 6-8 school to a 6-12 school to provide a viable public high school option to parents who have concluded that John F. Kennedy High School won't meet their children's needs. 
J.F.K. is a huge building containing 5,500 students. It has many good programs, but many parents feel it is too big and has too many problems. I have suggested shrinking it to 3,000 students by limiting attendance to students from the Bronx and Marble Hill and dividing it into four smaller schools with themes like the environment, journalism, law and medicine. We must not give up on J.F.K.
Parents who cannot wait for J.F.K. to turn around and want to stay in the community support the 6-12 proposal. Many people with the economic means have chosen to send their children to nonpublic schools or leave our commmunity when it comes time for middle school or high school. The 6-12 proposal is about keeping families from leaving the community. It is about maintaining an integrated school where few exist.
The headline refers to what the small number of opponents say, rather than the support by the vast majority. The article does not quote even one of the 400 parent proponents who attended the recent school board meeting. Instead it quotes an opponent who does not live near the affected area and whose child would not be able to attend M.S. 141.
Some of the opposition seems to be based on a virulent anti-Riversale sentiment that some believe is based on racism and anti-Semitism. At least one school board member now opposes construction of a desperately needed middle school nearby, apparently to deprive the district of the additional middle school seats to make the 6-12 proposal a reality.
The supporters of the 6-12 school at 141 aspire to the best possible public education for their children.

HEADLINE: The New Immigrant Tide: A Shuttle Between Worlds

SERIES: HERE AND THERE: A New Immigrant Identity -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG and CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
Fernando Mateo has been shuttling between New York City and Santo Domingo since he was in utero. His pint-sized immigrant mother, belly swelling, flew back to her homeland so Mr. Mateo, now 40, could be born a Dominican. After that, his childhood was split between here and there, between a cramped Lower East Side apartment and a pink house beneath a mahogany tree in the Dominican capital.
As an adult, Mr. Mateo, a stocky man with a dimpled baby face, continues to lead a double life, with gusto. A dual citizen of the Dominican Republic and the United States, he wears a custom-made lapel pin that entwines the Dominican and American flags. He is fluent in Spanish and English, in the business handshake and the business hug, in yucca and plantains, bagels and lox. But there is nothing fractured about his existence. 
 Every few weeks, Mr. Mateo, who owns a money-transfer company, simply commutes between the Westchester County suburb of Irvington, where he lives, and Santo Domingo. Many a day, he and his wife, Stella, start out in blaring traffic on the Grand Central Parkway and end up on horseback in the verdant Dominican countryside, cantering down to a river to feast on rum and goat.
"I believe people like us have the best of two worlds," Mr. Mateo said. "We have two countries, two homes. It doesn't make any sense for us to be either this or that. We're both. It's not a conflict. It's just a human fact."
For modern immigrants like Mr. Mateo, the homeland is no longer something to be forsaken, released into a mist of memory or nostalgia. As the world has grown smaller, the immigrant experience has inevitably changed. Unlike the Europeans who fled persecution and war in the first half of this century, few modern immigrants abandon their motherlands forever, shutting one door, opening another and never looking back. Instead, they straddle two worlds, in varying degrees, depending on where they came from and what they can afford.
Some immerse themselves in two societies at once -- economically, culturally, politically. Jesus Galvis, a travel agent in New Jersey, ran for a Senate seat in his native Colombia earlier this year; had he won, he would have considered holding office simultaneously in Bogota and Hackensack, where he is a City Councilman.
Most immigrants, however, base themselves more fully here, but maintain ties so vital that their homeland is a part of their American-born children's identity. Mersuda Guichard, 47, leads a hectic New York-centered life as a subway token clerk and single mother of three. But she travels to Trinidad at least once a year, and plans to retire there, which will keep alive her children's connection, already strong from so many summers there.
Either way, this here-there phenomenon, while common to every immigrant center in the world, makes a particularly clear stamp on the psyche of New York, the American city with the largest and most diverse population of immigrants, living side by side in neighborhoods where the very fact of their double identity is a bond. It has evolved during the newest wave of immigration, which began in the late 1960's, eventually driving the city's immigrant population to an all-time high of 2.7 million, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's latest population survey. More than a third of the city's residents are foreign-born, and about 60 percent are either immigrants or their children. Most are black, Latino and Asian, unlike the Europeans of the previous waves of immigration.
To some extent, the new immigrants bear a resemblance to the Ellis Island generation. During that last great migration, which began in 1880 and petered out during the 1920's, some immigrants did revisit their homelands, and many returned for good. But their experience was largely erased from popular consciousness by the mid-century immigrants, most of whom, fleeing war, never looked back.
Still, for the newest immigrants, technological advances and global political and economic changes have revolutionized the relationship with the homeland -- just as the American embrace of multiculturalism allows it to flourish as never before.
Armed with cut-rate phone cards and frequent-flier miles, with modems, fax machines and videocameras, immigrants can participate in the lives of their families back home -- be they in Barbados or Tibet -- with an immediacy unknown to any previous generation. Indeed, this phenomenon has given birth to an entrepreneurial subculture -- the money-transfer houses, phone parlors, barrel shippers and even videophone centers dotting immigrant neighborhoods.
In the last few years, a proliferation of dual nationality laws has allowed many immigrants to formalize their double identities. And, among other worldwide political changes, the break-up of the Soviet Union and liberalizations in China have allowed even refugees to reconnect in commonplace ways they once could not have imagined.
Mei Yung Liew left China 19 years ago, and settled into a garment worker's life in New York, quickly securing her American citizenship. She made a first visit back for her father's funeral. Three years ago, she traveled back for a meeting of labor-union women. Now, she watches with awe as her brother, an artist who sells his work in China, not only conducts business by fax from their Bushwick, Brooklyn, apartment but even returns for long stretches to the land they supposedly fled forever.
So fluid is the exchange between the homeland and New York that it alters both places. People move back and forth, money moves back and forth, ideas move back and forth.
Families and sometimes whole towns bestride borders. The population of Chinantla, Mexico, is evenly divided between that tiny town and New York City, but the Chinantecans still consider themselves one community -- 2,500 people here, 2,500 people there. In New York, the first-generation Chinantecan immigrants are waiters, garment workers and mechanics; back home, they are the big shots whose earnings built the town's schools and rebuilt its church.
The extent to which the newest immigrants have held onto their homeland identities has unsettled many Americans, and this unease underlies current debates about immigration, multiculturalism and bilingualism. Among a growing army of immigration experts, there is a raging debate, too, about the importance of this phenomenon, which the academics call transnationalism.
Many experts believe that modern immigrant families are ultimately shifting their allegiances here, even if their resettlement takes decades. They see transnationalism as a phase on the way to what they imagine will be the eventual assimilation of the immigrants' grandchildren, and pronounce the modern immigrant experience a variation on an old theme.
Others disagree, but only with their conclusion. First, they say, it is significant that the resettlement can span decades in the life of an individual family, especially in a city where more than 100,000 new immigrants arrive yearly. Also, they say, transnationalism seems to transform the life of the first generation's children and sometimes their grandchildren, creating a hybrid identity that is genuinely novel.
"At the same time as they are keeping their old links, many are successfully integrating themselves into the United States," said Robert C. Smith, a sociologist at Barnard College and expert on transnationalism. "They're redefining what it means to be American."
They are also making immigration a much more complex phenomenon than described in policy debates. Immigrants have always had a utilitarian relationship with America. But when the homeland remains alive, every life juncture, from cradle to grave, becomes a time to choose: where to baptize, where to bury?
In 1996, more than half the Dominicans and Mexicans who died in New York City were sent home for burial, as were a third of the Ecuadoreans, a fifth of the Jamaicans and 16 percent of the Greeks, according to an analysis of city death records.
Marriage, too, is a defining moment, especially among Indian immigrant families. Many of the American-born children of, say, gemstone merchants from Jaipur or hoteliers from Gujarat, agree to arranged marriages, often with weddings in India, sometimes followed by new lives based there.
At key points in their lives, many immigrant families separate, some here, some there. Needing day care, some send small children home to grandparents. Fearing drugs, gangs and sexual precociousness, some ship their teen-agers home for high school. And many retire to their birthplaces, which keeps their children and grandchildren ineluctably linked. The familial webs crisscross the globe.
Margarette Lee, 36, is a vivacious Manhattan real-estate lawyer who came to New York as a child and considers herself eternally wedded to its life style. Her parents retired to Korea about 20 years ago, dragging back her older sister because she was getting a little too independent. After marrying a Korean, the older sister settled in Seoul, as did her younger sister, who was mostly reared in Korea anyway.
Then, her parents re-immigrated -- because golfing is so much cheaper in Fort Lee, N.J. Meanwhile, Ms. Lee married a Korean-American artist, Ik-Joong Kang, who is represented by a gallery in Seoul, where his parents live. And they recently had a baby whom they gave two first names, Kevin and Keeho.
"I hope for my son's relationship with Korea to be continuous, just as mine has been," she said.
 
Jets and Wires -- Making the Commute To Santo Domingo
Before daybreak on a recent morning, Mr. and Mrs. Mateo left home for Kennedy International Airport after blowing kisses to their sleeping daughters, Megan, 11 (named after a character in "The Thorn Birds"), and Hennessy, 10 (as in the Cognac). Fernando Jr., 19, was away at college.
Left in their grandfather's care, the girls were soon so busy with their suburban social lives -- baking brownies, swooning over Leonardo DiCaprio and E-mailing their girlfriends -- that they didn't mind their parents' absence. Third-generation New Yorkers, they themselves have spent a good part of their preschool years and many summers in the Dominican Republic. They find the intense connection between here and there so natural as to be unremarkable.
That morning, the Mateos sauntered onto a 7 o'clock nonstop flight to Santo Domingo -- the first of six that day -- as casually as if it were a shuttle. The plane was packed with immigrants returning home for a wedding, a visit with an ailing family member, a business meeting. When the plane bumped down three hours later, they applauded, and someone called out, "De regreso, paisanos!" ("We're back, countrymen!")
In all immigrant groups, it is entrepreneurs like Mr. Mateo who have developed the infrastructure that allows their countrymen to keep in touch with home. "They are the vanguard," said Alejandro Portes, a Princeton University immigration expert, "the ones whose economic or sometimes political interests require them to be simultaneously present in their two countries."
Four years ago, on a flight home, Mr. Mateo sat next to a fellow Dominican who sold discounted phone time to immigrants. The man expounded on the profit potential in the link between here and there, and by the end of the ride, Mr. Mateo had decided to go into the money transfer business.
"I set myself up in this business so I would have an official reason to go back as often as my heart wants to take me there," Mr. Mateo said.
Mr. Mateo's money-wiring business, like some 15 other companies, provides an electronic lifeline between Dominicans in New York and their families on the island. Dominican immigrants send back $500 million a year (including about $100 million that the authorities believe to be proceeds from drug sales). The cash sustains their relatives and their homeland's economy, just as such remittances bolster familial, and sometimes national, economies throughout the world.
While there is no total estimate of immigrants' remittances, New York State Banking Department statistics indicate that the industry has mushroomed here in the last decade. The number of companies licensed to send money has increased 40 percent since 1988, and those companies have as many as 2,000 storefronts and agents.
Among them, Boby Express says it transfers about $1 million a year to Haiti; Habib Exchange sends about $6 million a year to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; Pekao Trading wires about $320 million a year to Poland. Mr. Mateo has 200 agents throughout the city, and transfers $40 million a year.
Dominicans, regardless of class, are probably the most transnational of all New York's immigrants. The city's largest immigrant group, they have transformed their nation while laying claim to whole New York neighborhoods. The Dominican President, Leonel Fernandez Reyna, grew up on the Upper West Side, still holds a green card, and has said he intends to rejoin his family in Manhattan at the end of his term.
In Santo Domingo, the influence of New York-based immigrants is so visible it can be toured. Here is the new residential subdivision built close to the airport for the back-and-forth immigrants; here is a bagel shop, a video store, a pizzeria that delivers; here is a parochial high school whose student body is 20 percent New York-born.
Just before his recent trip to the island, Mr. Mateo traveled by subway to Brooklyn, his pinstriped suit equipped with beeper, cellular phone and computer organizer. He was making a routine visit to one of his 200 agents, Teresa Guzman, who runs Family Travel on Myrtle Avenue.
Behind a glass partition, Ms. Guzman and her employees sat before computers and typed in orders from the immigrants who dribbled in that morning. A home health attendant sent $65 to her elderly father. A garment worker sent $69 to relatives with a succinct message: "THIS IS FOR FOOD." The directions were often quite specific:
"Ten kilometers past Hatos de Yaque, left at the henhouse, climb the hill past two herds of cattle and you can find Mercedes in the small green house."
From Ms. Guzman's agency, the orders traveled electronically to Mateo Express headquarters in midtown Manhattan, then on to Santo Domingo, where the company's war room holds a giant city map divided into sectors. Each sector is assigned to a messenger who packs his pockets with cash-filled envelopes that he delivers by motorbike within four hours of an immigrant's visit to a storefront in New York.
On his recent trip, Mr. Mateo accompanied a messenger to the home of Jose Antonio Ortiz Sanchez in Bani, a small city outside the capital. Mr. Ortiz Sanchez, a skinny, toothless old man who suffers from a nerve disorder, was lying on a cot on his patio when the envelope arrived. He clutched it to his chest -- $70 for a doctor's visit. When Mr. Mateo asked who had sent the money, the man rose from his cot, hoisted his blue boxers, walked inside and pointed to a poster of a St. Louis Cardinals Double-A farm team.
"My son," he said proudly. (The son no longer plays for the team.)
Just as they scratch together enough money to send home, even the poorest Dominican immigrants make at least one trip back a year, travel agents say. Fares run as low as $330 round-trip.
Mr. Mateo does not come from a wealthy family. His father began as a gardener. He is a Seward Park High School dropout whose outsized hands bear decades of calluses from manual labor. Before starting his money wiring company, he built a carpet business from scratch, while his wife, who now runs a small construction company, worked at an accounting firm.
But they and their families have been moving back and forth for decades. Even now, Mr. Mateo's mother, Carmen, 76, hops between the family's modest, airy house in Santo Domingo and a spare apartment in a retirees' building in lower Manhattan.
After a few weeks in Santo Domingo, she begins "kvetching" (Mr. Mateo's word) about the heat, the blackouts, the lack of Haagen-Dazs ice cream. So she flies north.
After a few weeks on the Lower East Side, she starts complaining about how cooped up she feels and about the outrageous price of mangos, which are supposed to be free. She insists on flying back to visit the grave of her husband, who died in Manhattan years ago only to be transported south for burial. There, she sprinkles his grave with his favorite beer and plays him salsa from a boom box, often accompanied by Mr. Mateo's half-brother, Dagoberto Linares.
Mr. Linares, 51, a small man whose jeans hang low and baggy like a teen-ager's, also shuttles, between East New York, Brooklyn, and Yamasa, the Dominican Republic.
In New York, he works as a carpet-layer; in the Dominican Republic, fulfilling a lifelong dream, he lives on a farm -- riding horses, raising chickens and harvesting a cornucopia of fruit trees.
 
Technology -- Breaking Barriers Of Space and Time
When Hamid Ali drives his yellow cab through Manhattan, the images of his family in Pakistan run through his head as if on a loop. They keep him company through 10-hour workdays and lonely nights in a one-bedroom apartment he shares with three other drivers. But they are stale images, four years old and frozen in time.
It pained him, until a friend told him about a cutting-edge solution to old-fashioned immigrant heartache: videophones.
At the end of June, on Ditmas Avenue off Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn, Mr. Ali sat nervously before a large computer screen in the darkened conference room of Satellite Tech Telecommunication. His wire-rim glasses slipped to the very tip of his nose; he pushed them up, and they slipped back down.
Without warning, the screen came to life, and the image of his older sister, draped in a floral head scarf, flickered and died. He gasped softly. Then she reappeared, live from Islamabad, a four-hour drive from their town of Okara. And she had a thing or two on her mind.
For four straight minutes -- at $5 a minute -- his sister, Shamim Kusar, harangued him for not writing. He protested that he phoned weekly, but his sister told him letters were better; they could be fingered and re-read and kept under pillows. No one could fathom why he didn't just come home, she said, or why he was so ambitious. Their father thought he probably no longer cared for them, she reported; now he was American.
When Mr. Ali's eyes brimmed, Mrs. Kusar softened. She told her brother he looked weak and underfed. He told her he was working too hard, that everyone worked too hard in America, which was why it is such a prosperous country. "Is everyone so skinny?" she asked. "I will tell Mother you are fat." She reached out to tickle his face on the screen.
"I will tell everyone in town that I saw my brother on TV," she said, giggling. "They won't believe me. We are simple people."
"Pray to Allah for me, dear sister," he answered, biting back tears, "and I will be home soon -- two years at the most."
This scenario, unimaginable even 10 years ago, shows just how far technology has gone in breaking down the barriers of space and time that used to separate immigrants from the lands they left behind.
Early in the century, it was too difficult and expensive to lead a genuinely double life. Immigrants might return home for good, but they could not hop a steamship to the Old World for a long weekend. Letters were the bond between families, but they took so long that communication was herky-jerky.
Now, Chinese immigrants jet to Hong Kong for meetings with investors in their Queens banks; Bombay movie stars fly in for standing-room-only performances at the Nassau Coliseum, and highland Indians from Ecuador fax home orders for more ponchos to sell on the streets.
The most revolutionary technological change in the lives of immigrants, though, is the inexpensive direct-dial phone call.
It was not even possible to make a trans-Atlantic phone call until 1927, and it was prohibitively expensive -- $200 in current dollars for a three-minute call to London, said Sheldon Hochheiser, the corporate historian for A.T. &T.
In the last 10 years, small communities around the world have obtained direct phone service, fiber-optic cables have drastically improved the quality of long-distance calls, and rates have become dirt cheap: in 1965, it cost $10.59 to call the Dominican Republic for three minutes, and $15 to call India; now those rates are $1.71 and $3.66, respectively, with A.T.&T.'s one-rate international plan.
Many immigrants, however, seek out even cheaper rates at phone parlors, now ubiquitous in the city, or with prepaid phone cards. The phone parlors and card businesses, typically immigrant enterprises, buy telephone minutes in bulk from long distance carriers and sell them at sharply discounted rates.
If the ability to call home cheaply connects immigrants to their families, the ability to click on the homeland's news or soap operas connects them to the society they left behind.
All a Korean immigrant need do is turn on the 24-hour Korean Channel, which is offered in Queens as part of basic cable service, to watch the news from Seoul, as well as Korean soaps, children's programs and Sunday morning religious shows. Similarly, a Russian emigre can turn to WMNB-TV, based in Fort Lee, N.J., for live performances from the Moscow Concert Hall.
For immigrant communities that lack television channels, there are closed-circuit radio stations that operate on side frequencies leased from FM stations. If they get their radios equipped with a special chip or filter, immigrants can listen in on the Ukrainian Parliament, and Haitians can participate in call-in shows that link listeners in Flatbush with those in Port-au-Prince.
Reflecting the dual interests of their audiences, the immigrant radio and television channels have also become electronic settlement houses, offering all manner of advice.
"We're killing a lot of different birds at the same time," said Evgeniy Lvov, president of the Russian-American Broadcasting Company, which owns WMNB. "We're making this world smaller for everybody."
 
The New Breed -- Rebuilding A Burnt Bridge
Before Leonid Slepak left Russia in 1979, he traveled three days over land from Moscow to Siberia to say goodbye to his parents. They were well-known dissidents; he was a draft evader living underground and a poster boy for Soviet Jewry, his photograph marched through the streets of New York, Washington and Los Angeles.
Mr. Slepak was only 19. He had finally won his 10-year-battle to emigrate, and in that moment, sitting opposite his parents in a Siberian prison, he thought he understood with a panic what a permanent rupture it would be. "It would be like dying, I imagined," he said recently.
Two decades later, it has not turned out to be so final after all. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Soviet Jewish refugees ventured back for a visit. They were the last immigrants who had ever expected to lead transnational lives; they had relinquished their passports and possessed little nostalgia. But the years away had taught some that they were more Russian than they thought, and that it made sense -- business sense, family sense -- to re-establish ties.
Like Mr. Slepak, many have reconnected with a vengeance, building businesses that require them to travel back and forth, to E-mail, to adjust their body clocks to the eight-hour time difference. They have bought second homes in Moscow or St. Petersburg.
Mr. Slepak, who puts together business deals that require financing and know-how in both countries, even moved back for a year. He has a family here and a family there: three very Americanized teen-agers in New Jersey (whose mother he divorced in the 80's), and one Russian child, 7-year-old Anastasiya. His parents live in Israel.
Mr. Slepak considers himself more American than Russian, but calls himself "bicontinental." Has he embraced Judaism in exile? He laughed and called this a "very American question." Being Jewish is a matter of blood, not deed, he said. But then, he elaborated, with a very American answer: "If I arrive home on a Friday, and the sun is just setting and the mood is right, I will light the candles, and say a bracha," a blessing. "But it's more in the spirit of T.G.I.F."
 
The Old Breed -- When Goodbye Meant Forever
When the new immigrants began arriving in large numbers, many Americans believed there was a protoypical immigrant experience: immigrants were supposed to shed their old selves and become Americans in language, culture, dress and appetite.
That model was based on the living memory of Morris Adler's generation.
At 103, Mr. Adler is a spry, stoop-shouldered man, happily retired in Jamaica, Queens, with 5 grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and a great-great granddaughter. His eyes are milky with age but his memory is undimmed.
After anti-Semitism drove him from Poland, he said, he arrived at Ellis Island in 1920 with $9 in his pocket. Within days, he found work as a hat maker and enrolled in night-time English classes. He quickly changed his name from Gershon Szmedra, just as he tried hard to lose his accent and Americanize. He didn't want the stigma of being a greenhorn; he wanted to belong in his new land, where no one ever told him to get off the sidewalk because he was a Jew.
In New York, he married the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Poland and built his American family. But he never saw his Polish family again. He corresponded with them until the letters stopped in 1943; nearly everyone perished in the Holocaust.
"I never wanted to see Poland again," he said. "My country where I'm born showed me hate, so I never had love for it. To me the other world is, 'Forget it.' "
But if Mr. Adler's seems to be the prototype of the American immigrant experience, immigration experts say this kind of abrupt break with the homeland was actually a historical anomaly. The current immigrant experience, they say, more directly echoes the mass immigration that stretched from 1880 to 1930.
Then, just as now, millions of immigrants came expecting to go home. Some crisscrossed the Atlantic by steamship, like the Italian migrant workers whom immigration officials called "birds of passage." And many returned for good, carrying back their earnings and buying themselves new prominence and comfort in their homelands.
One historian, Mark Wyman, believes a quarter to a third of the 23 million Europeans who emigrated to America between 1880 and 1930 repatriated. But their story has rarely been told because the history of immigration was written by those who stayed.
With a return home on their minds, many immigrants behaved very differently from Mr. Adler. They were slower to learn English and become citizens. They lived and worked in ethnic enclaves, and belonged to homeland village associations. Homeland politicians courted them; Irish nationalists made fund-raising trips to New York in the early 1900's, just as Dominican candidates -- and Irish nationalists -- do now.
"It's a mistaken idea that everyone always rushed to Americanize," said Roger Waldinger, an immigration expert at the University of California at Los Angeles.
From the late 1920's to the 60's, though, the fluidity of these migration patterns was interrupted by the Depression, World War II and the cold war. In 1929, Congress also imposed severe immigration restrictions that were not lifted until 1965.
For those 35 or so years, the majority of newcomers were refugees fleeing political persecution: first European Jews, then Hungarians, then Cubans. They are the immigrants whose experience has shaped the living memory of New York.
Unlike those who came before, and those who would follow, they knew they would never go home. And since their numbers were relatively small, they could more easily be absorbed into America at a time when it was consciously forging a national identity. At that moment in history, with the concept of Americanization taking an ever-stronger hold, ethnic identity was a leftover, and often an embarrassment.
"There was a zero-sum notion of identity," said Aristide R. Zohlberg, director of the International Center for Migration, Ethnicity and Citizenship at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. "If you became 10 percent more American, you became 10 percent less of what you were."
 
Ethnic Pride -- A New Notion Of Americanization
Philippe Vielot arrived in New York from Haiti in 1969, four years after Congress lifted immigration quotas. He was 12, and he didn't know he was at the vanguard of a new wave of immigration that would bring in black, Latino and Asian immigrants in an era when many Americans were asserting their ethnic and racial pride for the first time.
During Mr. Vielot's American lifetime, the idea of assimilating to a single American norm would come to be seen as a dated, even racist, concept. It would become socially acceptable for immigrants to hold onto their cultures, but then the extent to which they did so would unnerve many Americans.
Mr. Vielot's family arrived intending to return to Haiti, and after 20 years as hospital workers, his parents did retire there, keeping their apartment in East Flatbush for visits north. When Mr. Vielot's daughter was little, she was sent home to her grandparents, the best (and cheapest) day care imaginable.
Mr. Vielot never stopped following the ins and outs of Haitian politics. He never gave up his languages, Creole and French, never stopped listening to zouk and compas, never stopped going home for visits. He still awaits the perfect moment to return for a long stay, maybe for good. He wants to be a farmer.
But Mr. Vielot long ago became an American citizen. He is fluent in English; he peppers his speech with exclamations like "oh, gosh." He works for a New York City agency as a mechanical engineer. His wife is a kindergarten teacher, his children are American, and they all live in Bridgeport, Conn.
He is the very model of the modern immigrant, part of the mix of cultures that has been called everything from a salad bowl to a gorgeous mosaic. But has he Americanized? Mr. Vielot was at first stumped by the question, then said, "By my estimate, maybe not by yours."
Sociologists say that to many modern immigrants, the issue of becoming American is pretty much beside the point, the kind of question best left to the sociologists. To many immigrants, assimilating means sinking into the dead-end universe of the inner cities where they live; holding onto their culture and values, then, is a way of inoculating their children against all those American ills.
Experts prefer to ask if immigrants are integrating themselves into American life even as they hold onto their language, culture and ties. The test, they say, lies with the immigrants' children, and that is whom they have been studying, although the studies, and the children, are too young for definitive answers.
Still, families like Mersuda Guichard's offer some tentative answers. For Ms. Guichard, Trinidad is the past, the island that felt too small when she left in 1971. It is the present, the place she goes to restore herself when the pressures of bringing up three children alone are too much. And it is the future, the "paradise" where she will retire, using the nest egg -- $6,000 so far -- squirreled away in a Trinidadian bank.
But it is not the past, present or future for her teen-age children. When they were younger, Ms. Guichard sent them home every summer -- because she was working, and because she wanted them to absorb her love for Trinidad. Her daughter, Starr, 16, still goes, and she describes it as a glorious vacation: walking barefoot on the beach, tending rabbits and ducks, learning to cook callaloo. But, every fall, Starr balks when her mother, who thinks a little Caribbean discipline would do her good, asks her to stay and attend school in Trinidad. Starr has no desire to wear a uniform or get her knuckles rapped for tardiness.
"There, you can't wear make-up or nail polish," she said. "You have to wear plaid pleated skirts and white shirts and little socks that fold at the bottom."
Ms. Guichard now wishes she had sent all her children home to school when they were small, but, she says, it is too late for regrets. She herself is Trinidadian through and through. Her children are a hybrid: part West Indian, part American -- and all New Yorker. "They were born here," she said, "and they will die here."
Overwhelmingly, the experts say, American-born children of immigrants seem to have their feet planted in this country, no matter how many trips they make to their parents' homeland. While bilingual, they express themselves better in English than in their parents' tongues. And they feel more at home in the hyperdeveloped United States than in the developing world.
Still, their parents' dual identity affects them, sometimes profoundly. In many cases, they have relationships with their parents' hometowns that help shape a newfangled identity. They are not going to move back, but they often consider their parents' birthplaces second homes.
The back and forth can be confusing, and some feel they fit in neither here nor there. "Here they say, 'You're from the islands,' " Starr said. "In Trinidad, they call me a Yankee, and that's considered an insult."
At the same time, however, these ties to home are often a source of strength -- an escape from a city where many live in a social underclass to another, freer world, where their families' social status has been elevated by emigration. It helps keep their immigrant aspirations alive.
Liliana Maldonado, a 20-year-old computer student, has spent every summer in her parents' hometown in Ecuador.
"I think of it as going home, and I was born here, which says a lot," she said. "What it feels like to me is a relief."
 
Citizenship -- Dual Identities, Dual Loyalties
That the McManus Midtown Democratic Association, a century-old bastion of Irish-American politics, has a president born and raised in Cali is testament to the changing face of New York City.
That the president, Carlos Manzano, is a dual citizen of Colombia and the United States speaks volumes about the changing immigrant identity. At the same time as he courts Jewish, Italian and Irish voters in the district he seeks to represent in the New York City Council, he sends routine mailings about Colombian politics to his countrymen in the New York area.
"Fortunately, the election cycles here and there don't overlap," he said. "This spring, I was focused on the presidential elections down there. By fall, I'll shift gears back here."
Although immigrants taking the oath of United States citizenship must renounce their homelands, the renunciation carries no teeth. American courts increasingly tolerate dual nationality, and since the end of the Cold War, other nations have relaxed their attitudes toward the concept, too.
Some countries have long allowed it, and in the last decade, many others, including Russia and Poland, have decided to simply ignore their countrymen's new citizenship. And others have enacted dual nationality or citizenship laws as they have come to see their emigrants as assets rather than traitors; among them are Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Italy and Mexico.
The Mexican law, overnight, created a potential population of millions of dual nationals, as it not only recognizes Mexican-born Americans but their children. Since the new law took effect, five New Yorkers a day have sought to recapture their Mexicanness.
"The binational society is a trend that is unstoppable," said Jorge Pinto, Mexico's consul in New York. "It used to be limited to the border, but now the links are far afield."
For some, the issue of dual citizenship poses the ultimate question raised by the transnational phenomenon: Where does an immigrant's allegiance lie? Some fear that dual loyalties are necessarily dueling loyalties, and that the bond between a citizen and his state should be exclusive.
Others, though, say this is an old-fashioned notion in a world that is not at war, and an impractical one in the face of a global reality of entwined economies, of businesses and families that straddle borders.
Like Mr. Manzano, Fernando Mateo sees himself as doubly loyal. Naturally, almost physiologically, ebullient, Mr. Mateo hungered for a public role in his community once he no longer had to work day and night to keep his business afloat. His civic energy expressed itself both here and there.
In New York, he devised a campaign to urge New Yorkers to trade their illegal guns for toys. The Toys for Guns program went national and international. Mr. Mateo went on Oprah, met Bill and Hillary Clinton, and became a darling of Spanish-language television, which has hemispheric reach.
Through his minor renown here, Mr. Mateo was able to assert himself as a player in Dominican politics there. Last year, he won a battle to secure immigrants the right to vote from the United States -- making the Dominican population in New York the second-largest concentration of votes in any Dominican election, after Santo Domingo.
It also allows New Yorkers, including Mr. Mateo, to contemplate running for their homeland's highest offices. Mr. Mateo feels he has two countries, one that shaped him emotionally, and another that helped him rise above his station in life. He would fight for either country in a war, he said.
On a spring morning, from his home in Irvington, Westchester, Mr. Mateo debated by phone his potential as a candidate for election in the Dominican Republic -- with David Garth, the veteran New York political consultant.
In Yamasa, the Dominican Republic, Mr. Mateo continued the conversation with his wife as they danced to salsa on his brother's porch. Stella Mateo admires her husband's political ambitions, but she does not want to move back to the Dominican Republic.
Hips swaying, Mr. Mateo dipped her and said, "Babe, you smell that goat on the grill? That's not a smell you get every day in Westchester."
"Freddy, honey," she answered, "you like the smell of hamburgers and hot dogs, too."
Mr. Mateo's cellular phone rang. The music stopped. A third conversation began, this one private. Mr. Mateo's mother, who had been rocking in a chair drinking milk from a coconut, said: "Who is it? New York again?" She smiled proudly.
"My little gringo," she said.

HEADLINE: Midshipmen To Get Milk Through Middleman

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: GAMBRILLS, Md., July 16

 BODY:
For almost 90 years, midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis have drunk milk from a select group of cows, those grazing here on an 865-acre dairy farm about 15 miles north of the Academy's front gates.
But they will not graze here much longer, and some, alas, might not graze anywhere as one of the most archaic arrangements within any military branch comes to an end. 
 Judged too costly to continue, the Naval Academy Dairy Farm will cease operations on Aug. 10, when the Academy will start buying milk from a commercial supplier for the first time since an epidemic of typhoid fever swept through Annapolis in 1910, and the cause was traced to tainted milk from a local distributor. Almost two dozen people became sick, including several midshipmen.
As a precautionary measure, Congress authorized the Academy to set up its own milk-producing facility, which began operating on Academy grounds in 1911. Two years later, the Academy bought land here, and the milking operations were moved.
As the Academy bought more property, the farm expanded and the herd grew, to more than 500 cows, which produced as many as 1,000 gallons of milk consumed at the Academy each day.
Syd Rodenbarger, a former supply officer at the Academy, said that by the 1930's, the operation was regarded as so efficient that the British authorities planning to build "regimental dairies" for their troops in India modeled their efforts on it.
Even through the 1960's, the milking operation remained top rate, using the best technology of the time. But as the daily demand for milk by midshipmen fell over the decades to the current level of 430 gallons and fewer cows were required, Academy officials never felt the need to upgrade the milking equipment, which now tends to a herd that includes only 115 milk-producers.
It soon became clear to the Academy that newer equipment was not worth the investment of several hundred thousand dollars and that buying milk from elsewhere could save money. Congress was finally convinced by last year when the 1998 defense authorization bill gave the Academy permission to close the milking operations -- and buy milk commercially -- so long as the farm is maintained by the Academy "in a rural and agricultural state."
"We looked very hard at our dairy farm, and the economics simply don't support its continued operation," Vice Adm. John R. Ryan, the Academy superintendent, said when it was announced that the Academy would buy milk at $2.05 a gallon, a savings of 25 cents a gallon from the cost of producing milk at the farm.
Academy officials are uncertain about what will happen to the farm. Whether it is leased, sold or reconfigured, the cows will be dispersed through sale or auction and the remaining farmhands, about a dozen, will be out of work.
Pete Peterson, a retired Naval officer who has run the farm for 16 years, declined to discuss the closing, owing in some part, officials said, to feelings of sadness for the farm's employees, some of whom have worked there for 40 years.
But he has nothing on the members of a 4H Club, who visit the farm each day, tending to individual cows, heifers and calves.
Several were here this afternoon, getting their animals ready for a show on Maryland's Eastern Shore. "We've gotten really attached to them," said Shannon O'Brien, a 10-year-old sixth grader who has been grooming a calf she calls Sierra. "This makes us all pretty sad."
Shannon said she had won 20 first-place ribbons in the three years she had been a member of the club, several with Sierra, and she was not about to give her up.
Her plan is to save enough money to buy the calf, figuring it might cost as much as $400. What she might do with her is another story.
"I'm not sure," she said, admitting that her parents are not crazy about having a pet calf. "My grandpa has a garden. But there's also a pack of wild dogs around there, and something could happen to her. I don't know what I'm going to do."

HEADLINE: Britons Govern Their Own Retirements

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Shelagh Wellbelove, a retired secretary from just outside London, lives on about $1,000 a month. That is enough, she said, to take vacations, pay for a car and generally live comfortably, especially since she paid off her mortgage. And it seems perfectly fair to her that most of the money comes from her own savings and investment, with Britain's version of Social Security kicking in less than half.
"If you're in a decent job," she said, "why don't you save for your own future?" 
 Alone among the biggest industrialized nations, Britain has taken aggressive steps over the last two decades to shift responsibility for retirement income from government to individuals, a change very much in line with the market-oriented ideology of the Conservative governments that imposed it.
As a result, the financial burden of providing pensions to an aging population will decrease in Britain relative to the size of the economy. For governments in France, Germany, Japan and to a lesser extent the United States, it will increase sharply if their social security systems are not changed.
Most European countries have hardly begun to grapple with this, one of the biggest long-term economic challenges facing them, and one of the most politically delicate, given their welfare-state traditions.
The United States is just now plunging into a debate about what can be done to prepare Social Security for the baby-boom generation's retirement. Britain's economy is much more similar to the United States' than those of other countries often held up as examples of successful pension privatization, including Chile and Australia. So American economists and lawmakers are looking to Britain for lessons.
Among the options being seriously considered in the United States is partly privatizing Social Security much in the way Britain has overhauled its system. The idea would be to allow individuals to use a portion of the payroll taxes that finance the system to set up private retirement accounts.
"The United Kingdom stands out by the absence of a significant financing problem in its public pension system," Barry Bosworth and Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution in Washington wrote in a recent study of the economic challenges created by aging populations. "Through a series of legislative changes, it has already moved to scale back its public pension system, choosing to rely increasingly on a basically private system of providing retirement income."
Britain's public system is divided into two parts. The first is a basic state pension -- currently about $100 a week -- that is paid to all retirees. The second part pays a benefit based on the retiree's earnings history.
But under the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the mid-1980's, workers were urged through tax breaks and educational campaigns to "opt out" of the system's earnings-based component and instead invest a portion of their payroll taxes in a private investment account or a company-sponsored retirement plan. Nearly three-quarters have done so.
The lure for people was the chance to amass more retirement savings than the Government plan would provide by investing in stocks, bonds and lower-risk plans sold by insurance companies. The Government also made the state benefit less attractive by reducing the annual cost-of-living increase.
For the Government, the attraction was to address a fundamental problem shared by most big countries: the traditional "pay as you go" system, under which taxes levied on the current generation of workers pay for the state pension benefits of current retirees, will begin to buckle in coming decades as the baby boomers retire. At that point there will be proportionally fewer workers paying the taxes that finance the benefits.
Workers' taking responsibility for themselves will reduce the gap between the benefits due future generations and the money that governments will be able to raise through taxes on a shrinking work force.
In many ways the changes in Britain work just as intended. But they have also been criticized as moving the country closer to abandoning collective commitment to one of its most vulnerable populations.
Moreover, high-pressure sales of individual pension programs by insurance companies and other financial services groups in the early 1990's caused heavy losses for many people and cast a shadow over the entire process.
Indeed, the British experience has raised warning flags for the United States about the perils of transforming guaranteed government pension programs into investment-oriented plans that force people to make their own financial judgments.
Britain's main regulators, the Pension Investment Authority and the Financial Services Authority, have reviewed hundreds of thousands of cases, estimating that the cost of bailing out the investors could top $15 billion. Most of this would be picked up by the insurance companies that were the primary sellers of the plans.
"In my view it's gone way too far," said Mike Reddin, an authority on pension policy at the London School of Economics. "I don't believe people realize that we've almost entirely privatized income maintenance in Britain."
But Mr. Reddin acknowledged that there is little public pressure to reverse the changes, and as Mrs. Wellbelove's attitude suggests, the shift has left many retired people feeling relatively well off at a time when the economy is booming.
As a result, there has been only muted political opposition to the shift. The Labor Government that swept into power last year under Prime Minister Tony Blair has left intact the system put in place by the Conservatives, and has even flirted with expanding it.
"For individuals, it is a tradeoff between political and economic risk," said Roderick Nye, the director of the Social Market Foundation, a conservative research organization in London. "Which do you trust more, politicians or markets? If you look at a country like Germany, the politicians are going to have to default on the promises they have made to provide a certain level of publicly financed pensions. Here, people are investing in the performance of the economy."
In shifting to individuals most of the burden of saving for retirement, Britain will be keeping the lid on its bill from financing pensions. By 2030, when most of the postwar generation will have retired, the British Government's pension costs are projected to be 6.2 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 6.8 percent in the United States, 14.2 percent in Germany and 17.2 percent in France.
At the same time, the flood of money into a variety of investment products has generated returns in recent years well above those produced by government pension payments.
The system has helped create a large pool of private pension fund assets -- third in size only to the United States and Japan. Economists say this has helped Britain remain more vibrant and competitive than many other European countries by providing plentiful capital for British companies through the financial markets.
"If you believe as I do that private savings and consumption is better than public savings and consumption," said Mr. Nye, "then this system has to have put us in better shape."

HEADLINE: Government to Buy $250 Million in Wheat

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Citing a "dangerous moment" for hard-pressed American farmers, President Clinton announced today that the Government would buy wheat worth $250 million to lift farmers' prices. The wheat will be donated as humanitarian relief in Indonesia and Sudan.
"With prices for many farm products plummeting, America's farm families face a crisis, and we have an obligation to help," Mr. Clinton said in the announcement in his weekly radio address taped in Little Rock, Ark., where he was spending the weekend. 
 Mr. Clinton said that within days the Government would buy 80 million bushels of wheat, or about 2.5 million tons, which he said could lift prices as much as 13 cents a bushel. A bushel of wheat sells for about $2.75, down sharply this year as domestic supplies have soared and Asia's economic crisis has depressed important wheat export markets.
House Republicans say they will pass legislation before the August recess that could put $5.5 billion in the pockets of financially strapped farmers before the elections in November.
Mr. Clinton said the food would go to countries like Indonesia, which has been hit by civil strife caused by acute financial problems, and Sudan, where as many as 2.6 million people face starvation caused by 15 years of war and drought.

HEADLINE: Climate and Finance Conspire To Stunt the Northern Plains

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BUXTON, N.D., July 15

 BODY:
"Times are so tough," says a sign at the Buxton grain elevator, the closest thing to a public square in a pin-dot prairie town like this, "that even the people who don't intend to pay aren't buying." 
 It is a bit of black humor in this dusty half-mile hamlet, but these days there are not many people laughing.
Take Ron Eliason, 55, a farmer all his life. Stoic in the style of the Northern Plains, Mr. Eliason lost a battle with his composure the other day as he was forced to sell off every piece of farm equipment he owned and surrender to the idea that he would never again run the farm his father started when the century was young.
"I loved my job," said Mr. Eliason, his eyes misting as he watched auctioneers in his sun-scorched farm yard hawking his red wheat swather, his giant combine, his rugged little crop sprayer. "It's in your blood. I always said if I could make a dollar over expenses and living, I'd have a good year. But last year I lost over $100,000. You're not going to make it that way. And I couldn't."
Mr. Eliason's plight is becoming crushingly familiar across the Northern Plains this year, as a withering combination of bad weather and stunting economic conditions is driving farmers off the land in North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Minnesota and Montana.
Plummeting grain prices fueled by increasing foreign competition have farmers struggling to keep afloat, especially when the cost of equipment and fertilizer is higher than ever. Farmers have yet to recover from several years of floods and soggy fields that have saddled wheat and barley crops with diseases like scab and its corrosive by-product, vomitoxin. And deregulation, in the form of Congress's 1996 farm bill, is phasing out the farmer's safety net, the subsidies when prices fall below target levels and the automatic disaster aid when crops falter.
"We have farmers going broke en masse," said Roger Johnson, the North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner. Although some farmers have managed to survive and even do well, and family farms seem less affected than midsized ones, Mr. Johnson said the problems were the worst he had ever seen in the state, including the farm crisis of the 1980's. "Today, farmers just don't see a future they are really attracted to in agriculture. The continuation of this will simply be emptying out the countryside."
Small towns, which have long been facing a gradual hemorrhage of people to the cities, are fearful their Main Streets will shut down. Businesses that revolve around agriculture are beginning to wobble. Sales are down at farm equipment dealers, and rural banks are being parsimonious, afraid that declining farm incomes will dampen land prices and make for riskier loans.
Now legislators in Washington are wrangling with a raft of proposals for emergency aid and long-term solutions for the Northern Plains, a bumpy process with Democrats pressing for restoring some strands of the safety net and Republicans arguing against subsidies and for increasing export markets. At the same time, there are signs of subtler agricultural distress in other crops and other states: low prices for corn and hogs in the Midwest due to less demand from Asia's struggling economy, and drought-driven growing problems for cotton in the South.
"The financial security of the farm nationwide is not real strong," said Bill Biedermann, vice president and director of research at Allendale Inc., an agricultural economic research and brokerage firm in McHenry, Ill. "There's no way you can keep producing corn or wheat at today's price and make money. Cattle -- you should will those to the son-in-law you don't like. And the same with hogs. With soybeans, you can break even."
North Dakota has been hit the hardest. In the last two years, according to the North Dakota office of the Farm Service Agency, 2,511 wheat and cattle farmers have folded, and an additional 1,807 are expected to quit this year, leaving only about 26,700 farmers in this heavily agricultural state. Farm income has nose-dived 98 percent in the state to $15 million in 1997 from $764 million in 1996, the Department of Commerce said.
The problem is especially acute here in the Red River Valley, celebrated for its rich, grain-growing soil. Conditions keep farmers here handcuffed to wheat. So they are seeing no benefits from the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, which was intended to let farmers choose which crops to plant and lessen farmers' reliance on Government.
"It truly is the Freedom to Fail Act," said Brian Berg, 46, from Hope, about 30 miles southwest of Buxton, who quit cattle farming last summer and is still looking for work.
And farmers here bristle as they see truck after truck of wheat and other crops driving into North Dakota from Canada, a reminder of how subsidized farmers in other countries have been able to sell their crops under the noses of American growers.
"It's killing us," said Conrad Hapka, 65, who in April folded his family's century-old wheat and potato farm in Argyle, Minn., on the other side of the Red River, faced with a wheat crop that cost him $6 a bushel to grow, but netted him only $3 on the market.
The struggle here in this table-flat land, sprayed with green ash trees and yellow tufts of wild mustard, is taking on a different character than the farm crisis of the mid-1980's when farmers across the country failed. Because some parts of the country are much more severely affected than others, farmers know there is little prospect of a national uprising of farmers, no Farm Aid concerts, no marches on Washington.
There is also little stomach in Washington, they know, for repealing deregulation. The Governor of North Dakota, Edward T. Schafer, a Republican, favors marketing crops overseas and shifting farmers into ventures that process the crops on site like the Dakota Pasta company, a bison meat plant and sugar beet growing operations, all of which have been profitable for farmers who got involved early, but are an expensive investment for the floundering farmers in the Red River Valley.
In many cases, too, these farmers consider themselves the survivors of the 1980's, the people who learned to be smart farm managers. Some of those farmers are now deciding to bail out or retire early, before they plunge irrevocably into debt. They are selling their middle-size farms to other farmers who hope that planting more and more acreage will push them into the black.
Younger farmers are seeing the writing on the wall and quitting while they can still get city employers to hire them. Some are entering college in their late 20's. Derric Knudsvig, 24, gave up farming alongside his father last year, moved into Buxton and took a job installing sheet metal for a heating and cooling company in Grand Forks, about 30 miles away.
"The last five years were getting worse and worse," Mr. Knudsvig said in the bright kitchen of the small house he shares with his wife and baby daughter, his pinstripe mechanic's uniform taking the place of a plaid farmer's shirt and seed cap. "The older generation is not as lucky as I am."
The farm failures are most traumatic for people like Mr. Eliason, proud, stalwart men in their 50's who have ridden out every farming storm.
Mr. Eliason, a stocky man with wire-rimmed glasses and a brushy mustache, was nearly beaten by the drought years of the mid-1980's, selling his equipment at auction in 1991, but buying it back immediately and throwing himself into 1,250 acres of hard red spring wheat, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflowers and barley.
When crop prices began to sour, Mr. Eliason, so devoted to farming he collects hundreds of miniature combines and tractors, took out second mortgages. But when he could not pay his bills or get a loan to farm this year, he knew he had no choice.
Now, after decades of being his own boss, Mr. Eliason, with no high school diploma, is a hired hand on a friend's farm, making $8 an hour. His equipment auction was disappointing, because fewer farmers have money to spend on tractors, and he is afraid that in a few months the bank will take his pale yellow house and farmstead.
Some farmers say they cannot afford to farm, but cannot afford to fail either, because the taxes they would have to pay on selling hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment would drive them into bankruptcy.
"I'm hanging on just one day at a time," said Clyde Soderberg, 52, another Buxton farmer, who last year saw his barley plagued with vomitoxin, had to destroy 72 acres of navy beans damaged by the weather, and lost about $60 on every acre of wheat. Like other farmers, he picks up odd jobs in the winter, like test-driving cold-weather vehicles for Chrysler.
"I'm entitled to a nice plaque from the Department of Agriculture that says Centennial Farmer," said Mr. Soderberg, whose great-grandfather started his farm in 1889. "I don't dare put it up because I'll just have to take it down."
Each failing Northern Plains farmer further endangers another species, the small prairie town. Over the last few years, Buxton, founded by Scandinavian pioneers in 1880 as the first grain market between Fargo and Grand Forks, has lost its grocery, Carroll's Beauty Shop, the Inspirational Book Nook, Knudsvig's Hardware, Mike's Place and City Cafe. About the only consumer businesses left are Paul's Pintos, which turns locally grown pinto beans into frozen baked beans and burritos to sell around the state, and the Triple V Lounge and Grill, named for the owner's father, Virgil Vernon Vigen.
Kerry M. Rice, manager of the grain elevator, expects to lose money this year for the first time because farmers will not be able to pay what they owe him.
"Fifty percent of the farmers who are left will probably be done soon," Mr. Rice said. "When there's not farmers, the church will be gone, the cafe will be gone, the bank will be gone. The town will dry up."

Diane Eliason struggled with her emotions on the day that she and her husband, Ron, had to sell all their farm equipment to pay their bills.

HEADLINE: Iran's Alternative Voices Now Demand to Be Heard

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran

 BODY:
In early July, just as Iranian officials were about to set ablaze more than 100,000 pounds of seized drugs as part of a much-publicized anti-drug spectacle, a small group in the audience began clapping and whistling as President Mohammad Khatami stepped up to the lectern.
In some quarters in Iran, clapping and whistling are considered un-Islamic behavior, an alien import from the West. 
 So a rival group tried to drown out the sounds with religious salutes to the Prophet Mohammed and his descendants.
As the clapping and whistling and saluting grew louder, tempers grew shorter and fists started flying. And in full view of the President, visiting United Nations officials, the diplomatic corps and thousands of guests, security forces had to step in to drag away the rowdiest participants.
This is Iran's fledgling "civil society," where almost two decades after the 1979 Islamic revolution religious strictures still dominate and repression can be swift but where competing voices increasingly are heard.
In August, it will be one year since the smiling Mr. Khatami assumed the presidency, rolling into office in an upset victory on a ticket that promised the rule of law, expanded freedoms, and the creation of a social and political environment that would make people believe -- as they did in the early years of the revolution -- that they had a stake in their country's future.
Since that time, Mr. Khatami has transformed the public debate over basic political issues, lifted restrictions on publishing, filmmaking and the news media, solidified relations with the Persian Gulf Arabs and the Europeans and reached out -- though only rhetorically -- to the United States.
But President Khatami, a cleric who proclaims fidelity to Iran's Islamic Constitution, finds himself fighting battles with political and religious enemies to keep his programs alive and his allies in office. Under the Constitution, Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, controls the armed forces, the security and intelligence services, radio and television and the judiciary.
Mr. Khatami is also struggling to satisfy a population whose per-capita income is about one-third of what it was two decades ago under the monarchy that preceded the Islamic Revolution. This comes at a time when the dramatic decline in the price of oil -- which accounts for 85 percent of Iran's hard-currency earnings -- and the paucity of foreign investment have blocked any meaningful economic expansion.
Even Mr. Khatami's closest aides openly acknowledge the problems.
"Many of the levers of power are not in the hands of the President and since his rivals had a bitter defeat when he was elected and are holding some of the most powerful positions, they're not giving him any help," said Mohammed Ali Abtahi, Mr. Khatami's closest personal adviser, in an interview. "Compounding the problem is that many of the 20 million people who voted for him don't understand his limitations and are demanding speed and action. Some of them don't even believe in religion or the Constitution.
"So we're caught between fascism and anarchy."
That sentiment was echoed over and over in interviews with dozens of Iranians throughout the country during a three-week visit to Iran.
Abolfazl Mohammednejad, for example, has worked most of his 55 years as a caretaker on a fruit orchard an hour's drive west of Tabriz.
He says he feels that God has blessed him with a tragedy-free life and healthy children. But he has little use for what he calls "know-nothing hooligans" who hold high positions in Government. "They drive Mercedes," he said. "I keep on shoveling."
And as for campaign promises made by Iran's President, Mr. Mohammednejad has yet to see results. "I haven't seen anything yet to judge anything," he said.
A 49-year-old high school electronics teacher in Tabriz, who would only give his name as Asghar, said much the same thing. "Iranian people are patient people," he said. "But we are waiting for Khatami to deliver. We expect freedom of expression, the kind of freedom you have. The kind they have in France. We expect him to create jobs. Twenty million people who voted for him have demands."
In contrast to earlier times when many political battles were fought in secret, tensions in the system now play out much more openly.
The recently completed court hearings in the trial of Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi was televised in full -- the first time a trial had been broadcast -- in restaurants, teahouses and airport lounges. Ordinary Iranians sat riveted to their television sets until 2 or 3 in the morning, exposed for the first time to a legal system in which the judge, who has yet to hand down the verdict, is prosecutor and jury as well.
The Parliamentary debate that ousted Interior Minister Abdullah Noori in June was broadcast live on radio and later shown on television, much as C-Span televises floor debates in Congress.
In this environment, social and political liberalization seems peculiarly uneven.
Despite all the emphasis on the rule of law, Mohsen Saidzadeh, an outspoken midlevel cleric who has written and spoken extensively on the rights of women, was arrested at his home in early July.
In the preceding weeks, Mr. Saidzadeh had written articles opposing bills in the Parliament that would ban the publication of photos of unveiled women in the press and ban male doctors from treating female patients. Even more daring was an article he wrote declaring that laws that deprive women of their rights stem from incorrect interpretations of Islamic law.
His wife was given no reason for his arrest.
The tension between the impulse to appear modern and the desire to remain faithful to ideals inherited from the revolution plays out in other ways. President Khatami graciously signed a soccer ball for the soccer-playing daughters of a visiting American journalist. But in Iran, women and girls are banned from playing the sport.
Hotel managers of Teheran's best hotels are industriously renovating for what they hope will be the invasion of American tourists. But certain rooms are still used occasionally for interrogating political prisoners.
Conservative clerics rail about the evils of "cultural invasion" from abroad. But even many religious families have bought satellite dishes (still officially banned), a small Teheran hotel plays "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" when callers are put on hold and bootlegged video copies of "Titanic" sell for less than $3 on the streets.
A palace in north Teheran that is used by the presidency to receive important foreign visitors displays Western paintings of peasant girls and aristocratic ladies with exposed hair, neck and shoulders. But across town, an American female journalist was at first denied admission into the courtroom where the Mayor of Teheran was on trial not because her head and body were insufficiently covered but because she was wearing too many colors.
Still, the political terrain is so transformed -- at least on the surface -- that some of the same people who took the most uncompromising stances during the early years of the revolution -- confiscating private property and castigating politicians who preached tolerance -- are now backing Mr. Khatami's line about the importance of the rule of law.
That metamorphosis from revolutionary purism to reform in the name of creating a civil society has been particularly dramatic for the founders of Jameah, Iran's liveliest and boldest daily newspaper and one that is emblematic of the changes in Iran's intellectual life since Mr. Khatami's election.
Mashallah Shams ol-Vaezin, the paper's 40-year-old editor, served as the revolution's first editor of the rigidly Islamic daily, Kayhan. Mohsen Sazegara, the publisher, was a leading member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
Last February, after raising $100,000 and taking out a bank loan, they began publishing Jameah in a white, California-style villa with an unused swimming pool and state-of-the-art computer equipment.
The paper ran a three-part interview with Abbas Amir Entezam, a former official freed after serving 15 years in prison as an American spy, who talked about torture in the prison system and the need to separate religion from politics.
Jameah was the first to report the closed-door speech of the commander of the Revolutionary Guards in which he vowed to "cut the necks and tongues" of political opponents.
It regularly publishes front-page pictures -- in color -- that celebrate what it calls "the joy of life" -- village women taking presents to neighbors, two women farmers smiling as they harvest wheat, a field of flowers in spring.
But in June a court revoked its license. What was particularly offensive to the authorities, said Mr. Shams ol-Vaezin, were photographs that were declared "immoral," a report that prisoners must pay four times the market price for eggs, a satirical column that made fun of various clerics and political figures and the publication of the Revolutionary Guard commander's speech.
The two men have appealed the court's ruling and have been allowed to continue publishing pending a final verdict. They have received letters of support from human rights groups and have been granted permits to publish under a different name.
"We are a test case of how much openness the Government can tolerate," said Mr. Shams ol-Vaezin. "I call it a hot test of democracy."
But some avid readers of Jameah express disappointment that since the revocation of its license, the paper has taken fewer risks and lost its cutting edge -- another illustration, they say, of the country's larger political battle with high stakes and an unpredictable ending.

HEADLINE: Memories of Glory;
G.M. Strike Recalls Era When Cars Were Big, and So Was Union Power

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: FLINT, MI

 BODY:
In many ways, the 44-day-old strike against General Motors seems to belong less to the 1990's than to a bygone era when mighty unions brought the nation's industrial giants to their knees and labor's titanic battles commanded as much attention as the seventh game of a World Series.
In that era, Presidents worked feverishly behind the scenes to press the combatants to reach a settlement before the nation's economy suffered grievous harm. And politicians, corporate executives and millions of Americans followed every detail of those showdowns because the contract that emerged often set a pattern for American industry. 
 That was an era when struggles against giants like General Motors or United States Steel produced innovative benefits, like employer-financed pensions and cost of living adjustments, which were later granted to millions of other workers.
The strike by the United Automobile Workers brings back memories of labor's glory days of the 1950's and 1960's because the union has made a show of strength rarely seen nowadays: not only has it shut down an entire company, but it has crippled the very colossus that has long symbolized American industrial might.
That labor can still muster so much muscle comes in a way as a surprise after decades during which the percentage of American workers belonging to unions has plunged and unions have been on the defensive because of downsizing, deregulation and competition from imports.
Despite this decline, unions in a handful of key industries, including autos, airlines, aircraft production and railroads, can still paralyze huge companies almost overnight.
"When I was president, we had 1.5 million members, and now we have 700,000, so people think ipso facto we're half as strong," said Douglas Fraser, who headed the U.A.W. from 1977 to 1983. "You can't gauge strength that way. It's not in numbers. It's in your ability to strike effectively. We can strike as effectively today as in any decade you want to pick out."
The U.A.W.'s willingness to strike is a far cry from the 1980's, when unions were scared to walk out, wary of high unemployment, strikebreakers and the explosion of low-cost imports. With the jobless rate at its lowest point in decades, the auto workers feel emboldened about striking. Indeed, some labor experts say, the union thinks that with car sales booming, imports have increased the strikers' leverage by pressuring G.M. to settle soon, lest it lose market share to imports.
While the scope of the G.M. strike resembles the epic struggles of the 1950's and 60's, the current strike is far different. Decades ago, the auto workers' militancy was characterized by nationwide strikes -- Chrysler's workers walked out for 104 days in 1950, Ford's workers for 66 days in 1967 and G.M.'s for 67 days in 1970.
Back then, the nation would hold its breath every three years as the contract deadline approached at a Big Three auto maker or a steel giant. In that era, the U.A.W. was serious about the slogan "No Contract, No Work," because if there was no settlement before the strike deadline, the union walked out. The U.A.W. now shows more flexibility when contracts expire.
Little wonder then that as strike deadlines neared, White House officials flooded Detroit and Pittsburgh with phone calls. The 50's and 60's were an era when steel, not software, was king and when industrial might was measured in millions of tons, not megabytes. A strike in a basic industry like autos or steel sometimes put 500,000 workers on the street and could take a large bite out of the gross national product. President Harry S. Truman was so worried about such strikes that he seized the steel mills in 1952 to prevent a walkout.
Today's G.M. strike shares many attributes with the nationwide stoppages of yesteryear, but it began in just one factory, a metal-stamping plant in Flint. There, union and management are grappling over G.M.'s reluctance to make a $180 million investment and its unhappiness with production quotas that let some employees stop work after five hours.
The strike at that plant on June 5 and a related walkout at another parts plant in Flint have shut down 26 of G.M.'s 29 North American assembly plants, idling 186,400 workers and costing G.M. $75 million a day. Never in the union's history has a local strike shut down so much of G.M. for so long.
"The auto workers are expert at knowing where to put their thumb to stop things from flowing," said John T. Dunlop of Harvard, who was Secretary of Labor under President Gerald R. Ford.
This strike -- and six other local strikes that have hit G.M. since 1996 -- reflect a little-understood trend in Big Three bargaining: negotiations are focusing less on national contracts and more on local plants.
"There's a decentralization, a downward movement in the focus of bargaining to the plant, to the work rules and job security problems of the plant," said Harry Katz, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University.
This shift in the locus -- and focus -- of bargaining means that the settlement reached in the G.M. dispute is unlikely to have nearly the effect of an accord in nationwide negotiations -- especially those where the U.A.W. chose an auto maker whose contract set the pattern for the other auto makers.
Because of its local focus, the G.M. dispute may well produce a contract that is a whimper rather than a bang. The settlement might focus on fine points, such as increasing investment or production quotas at the Flint stamping plant -- measures with few ramifications elsewhere.
Paralleling this shift from the national to the local has been a shift in the subject of bargaining. The focus used to be wages and fringe benefits, but now that auto workers are so well paid, it has shifted to issues of job security, like getting G.M. to pledge not to move a plant's work to Mexico.
Not surprisingly, the White House paid far more attention when a basic industry's bargaining was national, not local, and focused on wages. With economists frequently dwelling on wage inflation in decades past, there was great fear that a generous steel or auto settlement would percolate liberally through the economy.
"In the 50's, 60's and 70's, regardless of what kind of political administration was in office, Democratic, Republican, liberal or conservative, every major negotiation in auto, steel, rubber, glass, was jawboned to death by the Administration the minute the negotiations opened," said Dale Brickner, a professor emeritus of industrial and labor relations at Michigan State University. "I remember President Lyndon Johnson saying, 'You all better have a nice deal because we don't want to have this pushing up inflation.' "
But today, with so many auto strikes beginning as local brush fires, Presidents cannot be expected to get involved early on. Still, now that the G.M. strike has erupted into a conflagration, many labor experts are wondering whether the Clinton Administration will start pressing the two sides to settle in the hope of containing the economic damage.

HEADLINE: Clintons Seek To Repair Rifts For Democrats

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
With an eye to the November elections, to the 2000 Presidential campaign and perhaps to his own legacy, President Clinton has embarked on an aggressive drive to repair divisions between the liberal and moderate wings of the Democratic Party.
The effort is being championed not only by Mr. Clinton but by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had largely kept a low profile in Democratic politics and policy discussions after attacks over her role in the health care debacle in 1994. 
 But last week, Mrs. Clinton convened and presided over the first of what is expected to be several meetings at the White House at which prominent Democratic thinkers discuss ways of finding common ground on issues like trade, education and Social Security.
Several participants said in interviews that although the purpose of the session was to engage the party in a deeper philosophical debate, an underlying theme was more practical: how best to position Democrats for the 1998 and 2000 elections.
In a memorandum describing the meeting, one of the participants, Ruy Teixeira of the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group here, wrote that Mrs. Clinton and others "may see the uniting of the party" around a new political approach "as important to Clinton's legacy."
Another participant, Benjamin R. Barber, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said, "There is a sense that this is a stage where the Democrats can begin to heal their rifts."
When President Clinton first took office in 1993, he alienated many among the party's moderate wing with his stands on issues like homosexuals in the military and increased spending for social programs. Later, he veered so far to the right -- on matters including welfare and free trade -- that liberals complained that they had been abandoned.
While political labels have grown fuzzy in modern American politics, moderates in the Democratic Party generally favor programs that promote competitive, market-driven economic policy and, on social programs, are less-inclined than liberals to concentrate on Government-sponsored remedies to protect the disadvantaged.
The Clintons are trying to address something of a national identity crisis for the Democrats. The most reliable Democratic voters -- those who are most likely to go to the polls in November -- are those who are most devoted to the party's traditional liberal ideals.
In their discussions, the Clintons are struggling to come up with compromises that will satisfy those liberals without turning off the more moderate voters, particularly in the suburbs, who are not as loyal to the Democrats. The support of these voters is considered crucial if the party is to regain control of Congress and Governorships in pivotal states.
The appeals for unity reflect a recognition that Mr. Clinton's effort to fashion a Democratic Party around moderate positions is not in itself enough to insure the party's dominance in the future. But many of the participants acknowledged that the effort could fall apart.
In his memorandum, Mr. Teixeira said the gathering might have been propelled by a recognition among moderate Democrats that "the liberal-labor wing of the party is not going away and is, in fact, key to winning in 1998, as well as 2000." Another reason for the meeting, he said, could be Vice President Al Gore's ambitions, including "agendas around Gore's candidacy for President."
Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White House aide who organized the meeting, declined to discuss the immediate political implications. "This was a step in the long-term development of a new progressive politics in America that has been begun by the President," he said. "And it reflects that the center of political and intellectual vitality lies here in what we call 'the third way.' "
This "third way" strategy, championed by Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, is founded on the notion that political parties should not feel limited to the traditional right or left approach to governing.
The meeting called by Mrs. Clinton of more than two dozen Democrats -- it included White House aides but was dominated by people outside the Administration -- marked an intensified move by the Clintons to reposition the Democratic Party. The session included several allies of Mr. Gore, including Elaine C. Kamarck, a lecturer at Harvard University, and Bruce N. Reed, the White House domestic policy director. It also included Barry Bluestone, a professor of political economy at the University of Massachusetts. He is close to Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, who may challenge Mr. Gore in 2000.
"Nobody in the party wants Al Gore and Dick Gephardt tearing the party to pieces," said Mr. Barber, the Rutgers professor.
Mr. Barber added that because many issues discussed fell in the traditional purview of First Ladies -- like education, health and children -- the session was also an opportunity for Mrs. Clinton to re-emerge on policy matters "without reasserting herself in an overtly political way."
The participants said the session was friendly, although some discussions grew intense. "Everything was cordial, but people were willing to disagree on certain points like charter schools and Social Security," said Fred Siegel, a professor of history at Cooper Union and a fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist group. "Those were the flash points."
Participants said they were struck by the degree to which Mrs. Clinton was in control. "She was clearly the guiding spirit and very, very fully engaged in the discussion," said William A. Galston, a deputy assistant for domestic policy during Mr. Clinton's first term.
Though Mr. Galston said the focus was far in the future, he added, "If the Democratic Party is united and has clear answers to the central policy questions today, that will certainly help a nominee such as the Vice President, who will be strongly defending the Administration's record."
Another person at the meeting, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mrs. Clinton's role had led him to think that she was signaling her involvement in 2000.
"It struck me as part of this that Hillary's going to play a major role in the Gore campaign," he said. "There were people from Hillary's staff, Clinton's staff and Gore's staff. It looked to me like a kind of pre-preparation for the year 2000."
After the meeting, participants -- not including Mrs. Clinton -- met over lunch at the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of centrist Democrats that claims credit for much of Mr. Clinton's agenda in the 1992 Presidential campaign.
Al From, the president of the council who for years battled with liberals, put forth a more accommodating tone at the gathering. "We are not going to be a protectionist party," he said. "But there are issues like labor law reform that we haven't taken enough of an interest in that we need to look at."
Several participants, including liberals, said they endorsed Mr. From's concept of broadening those who benefit from the improved economy, an idea that became something of a mantra of the meeting.
"Some people described it as 'expanding the winners' circle,' " said Nick Littlefield, a Boston lawyer and a former top aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. "I described it as making sure that everybody shares in good economic times. The important thing is that we focus less on the notion of 'a third way' because I don't know what that really means."
Instead, Mr. Littlefield said that much of the discussion had focused on identifying shared values and enunciating them in the 1998 campaign. "Everybody was saying, 'Wouldn't it be great if there could be specific themes other than H.M.O.'s and tobacco and campaign finance?' " he said.
In a memorandum to Mr. Blumenthal before the meeting, Jack Donahue, an associate professor of public policy at Harvard University, suggested that the most important area for the party to find common ground would be a "mend it, don't end it position on public education," rather than a "scorched-earth assault" on public schools.
The more liberal contingent included Richard Rothstein, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute; Richard C. Leone, president of the Century Foundation, and Paul Starr, editor of the American Prospect. Moderates included Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy Institute and David Osbourne, a consultant. Those considered between the two branches included Ralph Whitehead, a specialist on media and politics at the University of Massachusetts, and Barbara Whitehead of the Progressive Policy Institute.
White House officials at the session included Paul Begala, a senior aide; Maria Echaveste, a deputy chief of staff; Michael Waldman, the chief speechwriter; Morley Winograd, Mr. Gore's senior policy adviser, and Minyon Moore, the head of public liaison.
Not all Democrats support the drive to establish "a third way."
"Clinton has never really tried to be a party leader," said Terry Michael, a former communications director for the Democratic National Committee. "And I'm just wondering what this 'third way' thing will amount to. If they're simply trying to find another label and run away from the term 'liberal,' that's going to turn off much of our base."

HEADLINE: Don't Blink, Next Sprinting Star Is Within View

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., July 16

 BODY:
Marion Jones calls it simply "the Day," and she has imagined its every moment and every nuance. She created it as a sculpture of the imagination on which she has labored -- lovingly, perhaps a bit obsessively -- until she now firmly believes it will all emerge, given time.
She knows what the temperature and wind speed will be -- 80 to 85 degrees with a slight breeze, just under two miles an hour -- what she will wear and what she will have eaten for breakfast. 
 "Even the birds are going to have to be chirping in a certain way," she said.
This will be the day Jones breaks the world record in the 100-meter dash to become the fastest woman who has ever lived. By then, she said, she hopes to have already crumpled the record in the 200 meters and long jump -- a plausible triple feat that could establish Jones, a top-flight basketball player on top of everything else, as the world's dominant female athlete.
Jones's versatility and natural, commercially appealing charm are a part of what has made her perhaps the next female athletic megastar. She is a still-emerging phenomenon who talks about planetary domination with the blissed-out confidence of a 22-year-old prodigy and the easy laugh of the California tomboy that she says she still is.
"When I was 6 or 7, I wrote on my chalkboard that I wanted to be an Olympic champion," Jones said.
"I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew from watching television, and seeing the way people compete and the feeling that they seemed to get when they won, that it was something I wanted to be a part of, and that I wanted to experience."
Last month, she won simultaneous United States national championships in her three signature events -- the 100 meters, the 200 meters and the long jump, an accomplishment last achieved in women's competition 50 years ago.
In May, Jones ran the fifth-fastest 100 meters ever by a woman, 10.71 seconds. That is 22 hundredths of a second shy of the world record of 10.49 seconds set by Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988, a mark long considered untouchable.
Jones will again be chasing what she calls "the big one," the 100-meter record, at the Goodwill Games on Sunday in New York.
"I don't see anyone in the world right now who's got her speed," said Tom Tellez, a legendary former track coach at the University of Houston who coached Carl Lewis, the nine-time Olympic gold medal winner. "She's awful fast, and it's looks like to me she can run even faster."
Yet in many ways, she remains undiscovered, untested, and in a sports world that thrives on manufactured artifice, unspoiled. She is barely recognized outside the world of track and field, even by students here at North Carolina State University, where she trains. Sports marketing experts say she has the grace and appeal to become a hot product endorser, but she competes in a sport that has become nearly invisible in the United States in recent years.
And what makes her coming-of-age more awkward is that she gave up her other sports passion -- basketball -- to chase her dreams of immortality on the track. As a 5-foot-10-inch, 140-pound point guard, she led the University of North Carolina to a national basketball championship in 1994. But since last year she has watched -- enthusiastically but from courtside -- as former teammates like Tracy Reid have gone on to the Women's National Basketball Association, where heavy promotion is turning players into household names and even a "W.N.B.A. Barbie" is being marketed.
"I didn't play basketball just because I like it," Jones said during an interview at the North Carolina State track. "I have a passion for the game; I love it. But I think it was the right time in my life to choose track and field. Maybe when my career is over in track and field, down the line, once I've achieved everything that I hope to achieve, maybe I can play a couple of years in the league, if I'm able to play where I want to play and how I want to play."
 
Athlete With 2 Loves: Basketball and Track
Basketball and track have been her conjoined passions at least since she was 17, when she got the tattoo on her ankle that signifies them. In the tattoo -- a basketball with a thunderbolt passing through it, held aloft by little white wings -- the thunderbolt represents track. The wings show what it feels like to fly, she said. The basketball dominates.
"It has no really deep meaning -- I just liked it," she said, laughing and shrugging and reaching down in embarrassment to cover the tattoo with her hand when it was brought up. Asked whether it still represented her feelings, she said, "It'll be appropriate until the day I die."
But she has also clearly arrived as a full-fledged track star, with an early commercial splash. With sponsorships from Nike, among others, she is able to train full time. She recently bought a new Jeep, although her coach, Trevor Graham, said she could have had a Mercedes if her tastes ran that way. The web of commercial endorsements that make for economic success, especially in a sport like track where there is no real employer, are finding their way to a woman who, like Michael Jordan, is becoming known by the most famous initials in sports.
"Hey, M. J., is that a Nike shirt?" Graham shouted at her, laughing. Jones, who has a smile that always appears suddenly on her face, as though it had jumped there, was wearing a T-shirt bearing the image of the reggae group, "Inner Circle." She grinned and turned away from her coach without answering.
Sports marketing experts say that Jones's lasting power, at least as an economic performer, is still uncertain. Track stars, with the notable and important exception of Griffith Joyner, have not tended to last as economic heavyweights.
"She's charismatic, but we haven't had enough time in the spotlight to evaluate what's going to happen with her," said Bob Williams, the president of Burns Sports, a Chicago company that matches advertisers and athletes.
Her appearance at the Goodwill Games, where she will run against women like Gail Devers and Merlene Ottey -- both among the fastest in world -- is thus being seen as a kind of coming out for Jones. At the same time, it also represents a kind of passing of the baton. Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the winner of two Olympic gold medals in the heptathlon and one in the long jump, has been widely regarded as the greatest all-around female athlete. But Joyner-Kersee, who will be making one of her final appearances before retirement at the Goodwill Games, has already said the title of "greatest all around" now rightly belongs to Jones.
Sylvia Hatchell, Jones's former basketball coach at North Carolina, said that athleticism is only part of Jones's strength, matched by her intensity of purpose. When Jones told her coach in the spring of 1997 that she was giving up basketball, though she still had a year of eligibility remaining, the reasons she gave were simple and grandiose all at once.
"She said, 'I want to become the fastest woman in the world,' " Hatchell recalled. And Hatchell said she believed it possible right from that moment. Jones, she said, is too modest to boast, so she must therefore be stating a fact. "When Marion Jones tells you what she's going to do, you can go ahead and put your money in the bank, because it's going to happen," Hatchell said.
The chronology of Jones's emergence, though, reads like a mystery novel or a romance, with the question always: to which sport would she lose her heart? Born in Los Angeles, she made her first flash into the news in 1991, when as 15-year-old sophomore at Rio Mesa High School, she demolished the record for the fastest 100 meters ever run by a girl in a high school meet, 11.17 seconds, .12 faster than the 10-year-old record of Barbara Bell. She qualified for the United States Olympic team the following year, as an alternate on the women's 400-meter relay team, but chose not to go to Barcelona because her mother thought it was too much too soon.
 
Turning to Track Only for First Time
While other colleges recruited her for track, North Carolina wanted Jones to play basketball. Jones, wanting to perform in both sports, headed to Chapel Hill. But she broke her left foot twice, causing her to miss the 1996 Olympics and most of her last two years of college track, as well as a year of basketball. She turned full time to track about 15 months ago, but by August, after about four months of serious training, she won the 100 meters at the world track and field championships.
Jones's greatest influences, she said, have all been family, especially her mother, Marion Toler, and an older half brother, Albert Kelly. Toler, an immigrant from Belize, supported the family by transcribing medical and legal documents after divorcing when Jones was very small, and helped manage her daughter's sports career through college. Her brother was her first sports idol. She followed him and his friends, trying to do whatever sport they did -- to run as fast or faster, leap as far or farther.
But part of Jones's new path since leaving the warm team embrace of basketball is what she described as a growing sense of independence and maturity -- an inevitable development, perhaps, given the solitary mental discipline of the sprinter.
 Marion Toler, who lived near Chapel Hill when Jones was in college, has moved to the Houston area, and the two have grown apart, sometimes going months without talking. Toler could not be reached. Jones plans to get married this fall, establishing her own life further still. She met her fiance, C. J. Hunter, a shot-putter and coach, when the two were at the University of North Carolina.
But not having a team around her for camaraderie and inspiration -- and, as has been the case in many of the races she has run lately, not having anyone to challenge her -- has meant a need for new sources of motivation. So she saves newspaper clippings in which unfavorable things are said about her, or in which other sprinters are quoted as saying they think she can be beaten. She uses such material as fuel, to burn somewhere inside her to make her work harder, to push the extra inch -- an important trait in a sport in which inches and fractions of a second define everything.
"Sometimes when I have a bad performance, a bad long jump or a bad race, I can't sleep that night," Jones said. "I'll be up all night, going over in my head what I need to do to improve that." Until she finds a solution, Jones said, she feels in some way broken inside. "I just don't seem to flow right -- I really don't know how else to explain it," she said.
 
A Natural Ability And Coachable, Too
Sprinting experts say that her perfectionism, her ability to incorporate minute adjustments and suggestions into her start and stride, and a naturally fluid motion combine to explain her achievements. Her coach, Graham, met Jones by coincidence when she was training one day last year by herself. Graham, who works with a group of sprinters training in Raleigh, said he walked up and gave her a suggestion about her starting stance, and she got faster. Then he made another small suggestion and saw her time improve again.
But for now, Graham said he tries to keep Jones's focus closer to the ground, away from the world records. His aim is to guide her to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, and to the winning of an unprecedented five gold medals in running, jumping and relay events. One thing at a time, he said, in the manner of all good coaches. One should not focus overly on dreams of immortality. "Our plan is to make sure that she runs faster and jumps farther than anyone else on the planet," he said. "If the world record comes, it comes."
Jones, however, is not to be dissuaded. The perfect day that she has created in her mind is out here, she said. She does not know when it will be, or whether she has fully imagined all the elements that will make the dream real, or the lessons she may still have to learn along the way.
What she knows, though, burns like fire: it can be done.

HEADLINE: Keeping the Boom From Busting

BYLINE: By Jacob Weisberg; Jacob Weisberg is a columnist for the on-line magazine Slate. He last wrote for The Times Magazine about the British author Paul Johnson.

 BODY:
Only a few years ago, Japan was regarded as America's most dangerous economic rival. But during the third week of June, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin pondered the question of how to coax that country back in from the ledge, no one was yelling for Japan to jump. The debate was about whether we could help the sagging Japanese economy by intervening to support the yen, or by stepping back as it continued to slide.
Foreign-exchange traders, who make it their business to know what Rubin thinks, had every reason to think he was not going to move to support the yen. In Senate testimony earlier in June, he underscored his familiar argument that without financial reform in Japan, intervening to prop up the yen could have only a temporary effect. Rubin made this point again to reporters on June 16: only the Japanese could rescue their faltering economy, which shrank at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of this year. That same day, Rubin joined a conference call composed of Clinton Administration officials who had been dealing with Asia's economic crisis since shortly after it began, following the collapse of Thailand's currency, in July of last year. He fretted that even Clinton's plan to phone the Japanese Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, that evening to encourage him to fix his country's troubled banking sector could prove counterproductive. Rubin was worried that Clinton would end up sympathizing with Hashimoto's political plight instead of pressing him to act. 
 In an Oval Office meeting a few hours later, Rubin hung back and remained quiet, as he often does when faced with an array of bad choices. When Clinton asked what he should do about the yen, which had fallen as low as 147 to the dollar, Rubin repeated that intervention by itself wouldn't do much good. After the meeting, he walked back across the courtyard that separates the White House from the Treasury. There, in the office of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, he joined a discussion in progress among the tight-knit circle of advisers who constitute his brain trust.
Although he meant what he said about the limited value of intervention without reform in Japan, Rubin is someone who loves to examine and re-examine his options -- a tendency the academically minded Summers refers to as "his preference for optionality." As he sat down, Rubin told his advisers he was tired. In post-cold-war Washington, and especially since the beginning of the long boom that has marked the Clinton years, the Treasury Department has come to be perceived as a venue for crucial decision-making in international affairs; for Administration insiders today, something as recondite as a currency intervention can bring about the political drama -- and the sleepless nights -- once reserved for decisions about whether to stick with a third-world anti-Communist dictator.
Rubin, Alan Greenspan (the Federal Reserve chairman) and the aides gathered in Summers's office had been going back and forth about the yen for four days. An argument against action was the risk of damaging American credibility by intervening unsuccessfully, something Rubin worries about constantly. But continuing to prod the Japanese without intervening seemed just as dangerous. The Japanese Government lacked the political will to face its economic problems, the most serious of which is a banking crisis that is, in essence, a version of America's savings-and-loan crisis of the 80's, only much larger in scale, with an estimated $600 billion in bad loans. Inaction on the part of Japan was deepening the country's recession and undermining chances for a comeback in the rest of Asia.
If the yen continued to fall, it could prompt Korea and Indonesia to devalue their currencies again; there was the danger, too, that China might devalue its yuan. Taken together, such devaluations could set in motion the worst bout of a contagion that has already reached as far as Moscow. And another round of plunging currencies, especially if accompanied by a Japanese bank panic, could send U.S. markets into a tailspin. Because of these concerns, among others, two aides whose views Rubin respects most -- Summers and Timothy Geithner, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury -- were now both in favor of acting, arguing that it could help prod Japan toward reform. The next day, Japan's legislature, the Diet, was going to vote on the country's budget. Afterwards, politicians would make public statements. "I had not realized that the Diet was going to have its final session on the budget," Rubin says, "and that added a little bit of weight." He now saw the intervention as part of a package that included a trip by Summers to Tokyo and public statements that Japanese elected officials would make about reform. Though Rubin predicted that the yen intervention would prop up the currency only temporarily, he was persuaded that, taken in sum, these actions stood to increase the probability that the Japanese Government would budge and move ahead with reform.
At about 9:30, Rubin told his assembled aides, "I think we probably ought to do it." He then scanned the room and said that anyone who disagreed strongly should speak up. No one did. Later that evening, he phoned Clinton from the Jefferson Hotel -- Rubin lives there during the week, just blocks from the Treasury and the White House -- to prep him for his call to Hashimoto. When markets opened the next morning, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York converted an estimated $2 billion into yen, catching foreign-exchange traders napping and driving the rate back up to 136 to the dollar.
In the following weeks, Rubin's analysis was at least partly vindicated. Though the yen resumed its slide, as predicted, Japan did go some way toward answering global demands for action to revive its economy with a plan to clear up the hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans. Rubin remarked to aides afterward that the decision was one of the most difficult he had faced as Treasury Secretary. But a week later, on the phone from China, where he was accompanying the President, he was philosophical. "This is the kind of uncertainty I used to live with all the time," he said, referring to his days as a trader at Goldman, Sachs, Wall Street's most storied investment firm. "In the final analysis you just live with all the pros and cons. These are all imperfect choices. You decide which one seems best."
The yen intervention was more than a marker of Japan's humbling. It signified a moment in our own politics in which the defense of prosperity became an overwhelming national preoccupation. With the recovery now in its seventh year, almost everyone in the United States has felt its effects. Our unemployment rate is -- incredibly -- nearly as low as Japan's. Working wages, stagnant through much of the past decade, appear to be on the rise again. Inflation is a memory, and the long bull market has left the swelling ranks of shareholders feeling flush. We live in anxiety, however, that these happy conditions may come to an abrupt end. Though the U.S. economy appears remarkably robust, the potential threats to it are many and diffuse. Growth that is too rapid might ignite inflation; cash flight into the U.S. could pump more air into a market bubble, and bubbles burst; or a currency crisis ricocheting out of some country most Americans couldn't find on a map might bring on a worldwide slump.
Ours is an uneasy opulence, which looks expectantly to those who seem able to comprehend obscure threats and ward them off. A few years ago it was Greenspan, maestro of the money supply, who was viewed as the recovery's essential man. But of late it is Rubin. If he looks exhausted these days, it may be less from five and a half years of commuting between New York and Washington than from the strain of playing Atlas to the world economy -- carrying a globe that constantly threatens to spin out of control.
This is an unexpected position both for the Clinton Administration and the man sometimes described as its second most important member. Clinton never expected to be remembered as the President who tickled the stock market pink. He came to Washington with a set of ideas about assisting the middle class through innovative programs like managed-competition health-care reform and voucher-based worker training. Rubin, though his own concern has always been focused more on the poor than the middle class, shared Clinton's notion of a reform liberal activism. He gave up the chairmanship of Goldman, Sachs and joined the Clinton Administration as chairman of the National Economic Council in hopes of playing a part in helping the inner cities and the public education system.
To the frustration of its more populist-minded members, the Administration never got a crack at deploying most of Clinton's ideas. But along the way, Clinton found himself the beneficiary of a growth spurt that has done more for the poor and middle class alike than all his unhatched programs could ever have done. A factor in this spurt was Clinton's decision to close the budget deficit -- a strategy promoted by Rubin. For many of the original Clintonites, Rubin's success in economic policy is bittersweet. "Bob has done an able job keeping Wall Street happy and confident," says Robert Reich, the former Labor Secretary. "And in today's world, their confidence is critically important to the success of the economy. But is it necessary to accept a world in which Wall Street has that much influence over both economics and politics?"
The last five years haven't played out as Rubin anticipated, either. He has done his utmost to resist Wall Street's dictates on a number of issues, including the capital-gains tax cut and the notion of reforming Social Security through privatization. He still cherishes hopes of a renewed bout of domestic activism finally made possible by an era of surplus. But in the autumn of his government service, Rubin surely realizes that his own legacy will be in the economic sphere. His move from Wall Street to Washington has turned out to be less of a departure than expected.
Of course, there is the question of whether Rubin really is an important factor in the 90's boom. Most economists who have considered the question agree that the power of any President and his team to create prosperity is marginal. To many economists, and to most conservatives in Congress, Rubin is like the President he works for, the undeserving beneficiary of an amazing run of luck.
And Bob Rubin is indisputably a lucky man. Before he came to Washington, he made a fortune, which has grown to more than $100 million, at Goldman, Sachs. (Though he would be in line for several times that if he'd stayed.) At 59, he is happily married, admired by his colleagues and blessed with an economy that can't stop cooperating. Even the Asia crisis may end up going his way: if successfully contained, it may provide a well-timed correction to an overvalued stock market.
Rubin himself is both too modest and too given to nuance to take much credit for the performance of the economy. "It's a combination of a lot of factors," he told me over lunch in New York last month. "It's some things we've done, some things other people have done, what the private sector has done. It's good fortune. It's all this coming together, plus some elements I'm sure that no one recognizes today. Economic historians 25 or 30 years from now will identify factors you can't see sitting where we're sitting." And to the extent the Administration has fostered favorable conditions, he insists it is the President, not he, who is responsible.
But even if he declines his bow, there is a case for giving Rubin a considerable share of credit. The Treasury Secretary's sang-froid in moments of crisis, his intense thoughtfulness and his instinct for how markets behave aren't merely coincidental to the boom. There are fund managers on Wall Street who say the Dow could easily drop 1,000 points the day that Rubin announces he's moving back to Park Avenue. You might call this the Rubin premium -- the amount investors pay for the security of having him where he is. It's too crude to say that Bob Rubin made the boom. But despite numerous threats, it has yet to go bust, and Rubin's calculations have played no small part in that.
Rubin began thinking about the interplay of luck and skill as a student of economics at Harvard in the late 1950's, and continued to ponder it at the London School of Economics and at Yale Law School, where he finished in 1964. It was during these years, he says, that he learned to think about life "probabilistically." That is, Rubin came to believe that while no one can predict the future, it is possible to assess the odds of various futures. "At Harvard and Yale Law School I learned to think about the uncertainties and the ambiguities of life intellectually," he says. "When I got to Goldman, Sachs, I learned it was a matter of financial life and death to learn to be probabilistic. If you thought in absolutes and black-and-whites, sooner or later you got wiped out. The odds would catch up with you."
He didn't start at Goldman, Sachs. After graduating from law school, he went to work for the New York firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, where he did securities work. Before long, though, he decided that the dealmakers across the table had a more interesting job than he did. He began sending out resumes. Around the same time, L. Jay Tenenbaum, who was running Goldman's arbitrage trading desk, got Rubin's name from a mutual friend. Rubin was close to accepting an offer from Lazard Freres, but Tenenbaum changed Rubin's mind.
Tenenbaum's chief selling point was that at Goldman, Rubin would be working for Gustave Levy. Described by The Times when he died in 1976 as the best-known man on Wall Street, Levy is still remembered with a combination of affection, terror and awe. Born in New Orleans, he showed up on Wall Street in 1928 when his widowed mother could no longer pay his college tuition. As Levy often told the story, he moved into the 92d Street Y with $2 in his pocket, and got a job as a runner at a brokerage firm. In 1933 he went to Goldman, Sachs as a bond trader, and soon became an arbitrageur, eking out gains on price differentials among world markets.
After Levy returned from the Second World War, the old kind of arbitrage, which depended on the ability to communicate between unconnected markets, gave way to "risk arbitrage," a field he helped to invent. After the war, railroads that had gone bust during the Depression emerged whole. Arbitrageurs would follow reorganization proceedings and buy up bonds that had been in default. This developed into a technique for speculating on a wide variety of corporate bankruptcies, breakups and mergers.
Levy was brilliant at this work, and hard on those less capable. "His technique for management," Rubin recalls, "was yelling." In the days when he ran the arbitrage desk, he would regularly fire all his assistants. The traders knew to show up for work the following day. Despite his temper, he was an immensely gifted financier. As Rubin says, Levy virtually invented the modern equity-trading room -- and kept a close eye on it through a glass partition at the office at 55 Broad Street after becoming Goldman's chairman in 1969. Superstitious by nature, he described his success as "a miracle." According to Tenenbaum, Levy lugged around so many lucky coins in his pockets that they dragged his pants down off his hips. "I'd rather be lucky than smart," he used to say, when an investment turned out well for unexpected reasons.
Levy and Rubin could hardly have been more different. The gruff chairman could usually be found puffing a big cigar at his desk by 8 A.M. and liked to toss back three or four martinis at 21 after work. Rubin is a wiry ascetic who prefers carrot sticks, Perrier and Trident sugarless gum. Levy would yell and curse, second-guessing traders who lost money in a deal. Rubin, by comparison, is almost impassive and reins in errant subordinates by asking pointed questions. According to a former partner, you could walk by the arbitrage desk at Goldman and not gather from his expression whether Rubin had just made a killing or lost his shirt.
Nonetheless, there was a powerful bond between Levy and Rubin. Most of all, Levy loved Rubin because of his competence. After a short time on the arbitrage desk, Rubin was allowed to take charge of getting Goldman into the business of trading options and later into commodities. Such farsightedness propelled Rubin upward, making him a partner after just four years at Goldman, the fastest such rise in the firm's history.
Though he later turned his hand to foreign currency and bond trading, Rubin's greatest knack remained arbitrage. "I would say that he had a surprising tolerance of taking a risk," Tenenbaum says. "Bob's demeanor always exuded tremendous conservatism. On the other hand, when it came to a risk situation, he would surprise me. 'Why don't we do that? Let me take a chance.' He'd be quite willing. It's sort of paradoxical."
What was paradoxical about Rubin's risk-taking was how reasoned it was. "Arbitrage is an actuarial business, just like so much of life," Rubin says. "Each judgment was probabilistic. What you needed to do was make sure you didn't get so big in one position, even if the odds were very good, that if it went bad it wiped out everything else. You had to maintain your balance."
Put another way, Rubin played arbitrage the way a mathematician plays poker, keeping track of cards and weighing odds so as to reduce the factor of luck. In considering whether to take arbitrage positions, Rubin would muster all available information, constantly recalculate the percentages and make a decision only when necessary. Although a player with this kind of discipline will sometimes lose -- and sometimes lose big -- over time he has a significant advantage over those who behave less rationally. Rubin's returns as head of the arbitrage desk were consistently good, better than 20 percent a year through the market doldrums of the 1970's.
To try to understand how he accomplished this, I paid a visit to Robert Freeman, who sat next to Rubin at the Goldman arbitrage desk for 17 years. Freeman came to grief in the insider-trading scandals, eventually pleading guilty to one count of insider trading in 1989, though he maintains he was not guilty and Rubin says he believes in Freeman's integrity. (Since resigning from Goldman, Freeman trades stocks from an office over the garage at his home in Rye, N.Y.) Freeman recalled for me how he and Rubin made arbitrage calculations by sketching out a rudimentary "expected value" table on a legal pad. This is the arbitrageur's way of evaluating risk against reward. Say the stock of Roadrunner Inc., driven up by merger talks, is trading at $18. If a friendly takeover bid from Acme Industries goes through, the stock will be worth $21. If the bid fails -- if the companies' directors can't get along, or if the Federal Trade Commission blocks the merger -- the stock will most likely drop back to its pre-merger-plans price of $10. To decide if it's worth taking a position, an arbitrageur has to judge the probability of the deal's going though. Let's say he rates the probability at 80 percent.
80 % x + $3 = + $2.40 upside potential
20 % x $8 = $1.60 downside risk
Expected value = + .80
If the expected value is positive, as it is here, an arbitrageur would regard the risk as worth taking. However, the judgments that go into the calculation are complex and can be highly subjective. As Freeman explains, you might include "regret analysis." How bad would you feel about losing your firm's money if the deal failed? This might cause you to double the downside risk to $3.20 and not play.
"Bob was a very good arbitrageur because he was totally objective," Freeman says. "He could step outside and say, Look, I think this deal's going to go through. He didn't personalize." Freeman recalls his own job interview at Goldman in 1970. Rubin was watching a position he had taken in the liquidation of Roan Selection Trust, a company that owned gold mines in Botswana. "There had been a collapse in one of the mines," Freeman recalled. "My interview with Bob Rubin was conducted as he was getting phone calls from Africa. If someone had walked in and seen him, they would have thought nothing was going on. Bob would get a phone call about the mine collapsing and then turn to me and say, What did you major in in college?"
What Rubin still responds to is the elegance of this type of high-pressure decision-making, based on calculations made in his early Wall Street days with a slide rule. He once described this approach to me as trying to function as a kind of "mental yellow pad." The trick, he says, is to separate your emotions from the analysis. It's a bit of Wall Street Zen: don't invest in your investments.
Remaining detached was often no mean feat. For one thing, Rubin, as part of his job, was sometimes gambling with a third of his partners' retirement money. In 1979, for example, he took a number of arbitrage positions that depended on the expectation that inflation and oil prices would continue high. When oil prices and inflation dropped, many of his investments plunged. "We had one month in which we lost more money than the firm made in any prior year," he remembers. "But most people had internalized this sort of thing and the senior management, particularly, was very good about saying, Look we understand once in a while things like this will happen. It doesn't mean people weren't nervous because they were -- hell, I was nervous."
Of course, it would never have shown at the time. Rubin is the type who admits he was a bit rattled only after the bombs had stopped falling -- as they did later that year, when oil prices and inflation resumed their upward trajectory and rescued his positions. This serenity is partly a tribute to temperament and partly a matter of intellectual precision. If Rubin remains cool under pressure, it is because he rests secure in the knowledge that he has done his analysis and minimized his risks.
This is both a personal and a professional style. The effort to reduce uncertainty is visible in everything from the way he dresses -- same dark suit, same white shirt, same black penny loafers every day -- to his Spartan lunches of bottled water and salad without dressing. At dinner at the Jefferson, where he eats most nights, Rubin usually drinks a single glass of well-chosen wine. (One former aide jokes that when he finally checks out of his suite, his bill will be delivered with a forklift.) This does not mean he lacks a wide-ranging curiosity: Rubin shares his wife Judith's interest in the theater -- she was the chief of protocol for Mayor David Dinkins of New York and now sits on the National Council on the Arts -- and loves to browse in bookstores. On the shuttle and on the exercise bicycle in his hotel suite, he finds time to read things that have nothing to do with his work, like Noah Adams's book about learning to play the piano in middle age. But Rubin is a meticulous man who speaks with great care, constantly fine-tuning his utterances and only rarely giving vent to his wry humor. His approach is that if you make sensible judgments, you can improve your odds of success in every aspect of life.
"One of the first times I met with him, he asked me if a bill would make it through Congress, and I said, 'Absolutely,' " a young Treasury aide recalls. "He didn't like that one bit. Now I say the probability is 60 percent -- and we argue about whether it's 59 or 60."
The story of early battles over economic policy within the Clinton Administration has been told before, with Rubin at the center. What has not been well understood is how much the strategy that emerged was the product of Rubin's way of thinking about risk and reward, applied to the biggest bet of his career.
During the 1992 transition, and in the early days of the first Administration, the Clinton team was divided into two camps. On one side were the deficit hawks. On the other were more populist types like Reich who wanted a budget focused on new "investment" -- money for job training and the like. As head of the newly formed National Economic Council, Rubin presided over the debate.
Though he winced at their soak-the-rich rhetoric, Rubin sympathized with the populists and let them make their case to Clinton. But his own pitch to the President, bolstered by the message coming from Greenspan, was that if a credible deficit-reduction plan emerged, the bond market would react favorably, resulting in lower long-term interest rates. This would stimulate the economy, which in turn would boost tax revenues, inducing a "virtuous cycle" and a sustained recovery.
But for the bond-market strategy to work, it had to be credible to Wall Street. Investors had to believe that the new Administration was dead serious about reducing the deficit; its Republican predecessors had offered ambitious promises and then backed away. And even if Wall Street bought his program, Rubin warned Clinton, it might not work as hoped. Markets might react unfavorably, as some Republicans were predicting, causing the economy to contract.
Clinton also had to weigh the social and political costs of holding off on spending money for public investment. As Rubin saw the opportunities and risks, it was not unlike arbitrage. "Nobody ever put it together in quite that way, but it's an expected value table," he says. "The expected value framework is formalizing the way it seems to me you should think about these decisions. It's the same idea without the numbers."
There are, as Rubin says, a multiplicity of factors that have contributed to the boom. But perhaps the establishing act of what will soon qualify as America's longest peacetime expansion was the fact that Rubin's bond-market strategy worked as he forecast.
The story of the Rubin years at Treasury can be summarized as one of trying to anticipate threats to the recovery and head them off at the pass. As always with Rubin, it has been a matter of assessing risks and responding with exactitude and unflappability.
The first calamity was the currency crisis that hit Mexico shortly before Rubin became Treasury Secretary in early 1995. Rubin and his aides worried about a flood of immigrants and about losing the argument for free trade. An additional fear was the so-called tequila effect -- that under a New Domino Theory of global economics, wobbliness would spread through Latin America. Rubin, typically, analyzed the problem as an arbitrage. "I think initially, we felt if we had something that could work, it just seemed so overwhelmingly important to do it -- the risk of not doing it was far greater than the risk of doing it," he says. "Even if you thought the odds got a little bit questionable, the importance of doing it was so great. In an expected-value equation, the downside of it not working and the gains of it working could be so enormous that you would do it anyway."
Lawrence Summers plays a curious role in relation to Rubin on decisions like this. A prodigy who became the youngest full professor of economics in Harvard's history (he was 28), and later the chief economist at the World Bank, he is more brilliant than Rubin, and less restrained. An absent-minded professor, he is always losing his keys or forgetting to tuck in his shirttails. (True to form, when I joined him and Rubin on a trip to London in February for a Group of Seven Finance Ministers meeting, Summers missed the flight because he had left his passport home.) Like Rubin, who hired him as an economic adviser to Goldman, Sachs in the 1980's, Summers is always weighing probabilities. "It's really trying to maximize an expected value keeping in mind the multiplicity of possibilities," Summers says. "That basically is the canonical mode for making rational decisions. People who make job choices well in their lives, people who make personal choices well, are all people who have implicitly made sensible calculations based on the fact that there are a multiplicity of possibilities."
One thing Summers says he has learned from Rubin is the value of not always choosing among the available options. "Rubin ends half the meetings with -- 'So we don't have to make a decision on this today, do we?' Summers says. New information will evolve." In Treasury discussions, Summers's push for an intellectually satisfying conclusion is often buttressed by Rubin's worldly experience. Where Summers understands how markets work in theory, Rubin has a feel for how they react in practice.
With the new Gingrich House disinclined to grant funds for what could be described as a "bailout" of Mexico, Rubin and Summers decided that seeking legislative approval did not maximize expected value. Instead, they put together a package of nearly $40 billion in International Monetary Fund and Treasury loans that could be made without Congressional approval, but tied to stringent conditions. Mexico had to use its oil reserves as collateral and pay interest approaching the market rate.
What is telling about Rubin, and what makes him ultimately such an unusual character in Washington, is how he thinks about something like the Mexican support program in retrospect. He points not to the happy result -- that Mexico paid us back ahead of schedule, with a tidy profit for the Treasury -- but to the sound decision. "If the Mexican support program had gone bad, I would still have said that it was the right thing to do," he says. "But it was judged successful because it worked. I don't think that's actually the way it should have been judged. It should have been judged based on whether it was the right judgment for our national interest in terms of everything that could be known at the time." Rubin says that focusing on the result rather than the decision is what's wrong with Washington, because it deters people from "acting optimally."

Exporting U.S. Education to Romania

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AS educators in the United States struggle with questions about whether learning the basics and learning by rote should make a comeback of sorts, Romania has rewritten its school curriculum to allow for more innovation and less rigidity.
Helping them in this project is Dr. Lawrence S. Finkel, an associate professor of school administration at the College of New Rochelle's Graduate School, who is involved with training teachers to teach the new curriculum. Dr. Finkel has been a teacher, principal, superintendent of schools and former president of the 200,000-member Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Besides Romania, he has worked on staff development programs in 10 countries in the former Soviet Union under the auspices of the Soros Foundation and the World Bank. Working in Romania is particularly exciting to him because his mother was Romanian. 
 Here are excerpts from a recent interview with Dr. Finkel, who went to Romania in April and June and expects to return in September:
 Q. Why did the Romanian Government call on you to help its schools?
A. Dr. Dale Mann of Columbia University knew of my background. When he worked for the Rand Corporation he came to investigate the school in Washington Heights where I was principal. When I started there, it was the worst of the worst and when I left it was cited by the United States Department of Education as having one of the 10 best programs in the country. That's how he came to call me. So I started working with Russia and the independent states, and they kept asking me back again. Then as I understand it, Romania borrowed about $5 million three years ago from the World Bank, and they put out requests for proposals to different organizations in different countries, looking for people to help with a new curriculum, restructuring and retraining. The Educational Development Center in Newton, Mass., won the award for the United States, and the woman who is in charge, Dr. Jody Spiro, called me. She's also an adjunct here at the college.
Q. When did your mother come to this country?
A. As a very young kid. My mother was 2 or 3. She came before World War II.
Q. As a Jewish refugee?
A. Yes. And there were brothers who went to school there. In fact, I tried to track down the family name in various ways, but I never could. On my first trip to Romania, I told this to someone, and he asked me, How do you spell the name? And he said, That' s not the way you spell it in Romanian. So now they're going to look up the school records for the little town that my mother came from. I can't tell you the emotion I have felt.
Q. What did you find in the Romanian schools, and what do they want you to do?
A. My basic component is teacher training, both pre-service and in-service -- a massive task. When we got there, we discovered that they had, also under the auspices of the World Bank, just redone their curriculum, and here we were in mid-May and they wanted teachers trained in this new curriculum and in the use of new textbooks for September. Kind of a formidable task, to say the least. And Jody and I met with members of the ministry, people in charge, members from the curriculum area, members from the assessment area, to see what it is that they were doing, and we had all kinds of meetings. And what we did was develop a comprehensive plan to train a critical mass of primary and secondary schoolteachers in the new curriculum.
Q. What was wrong with what they were doing before?
A. All the teaching and learning was for the most part pure rote. The teacher expounded and the kids memorized. But what they did they did very well. On my first visit I went to a school on a Saturday when the school was running an education fair. They had invited anyone who wanted to come, and on a Saturday more than 300 people came -- parents and teachers. The beauty of it is that each department had to do something on the decided topic. And believe it or not, the topic was colors. And the English department had set up a debate on which color is more important: red or green. And these were high school students who had studied English from second grade, and this was a formal debate, with a chair and rebuttals. The thinking was absolutely remarkable.
Q. So that's not rote, is it?
A. No, but what I was watching were exceptionally gifted kids, some of whom had been to England for a few weeks. Generally, everything learned in the schools has been pure rote. Now, they will for the first time have a choice of three textbooks. Up until this semester, there was one textbook, and every kid was using the same textbook on the same page -- the same day at the same time.
Q. Was there an upheaval in the education system when communism fell?
A. Romania is a little different from some of the other former communist countries because Romania also had a dictator, Ceausescu, and he ruled that country with an iron hand. And so it was not as much communism as Ceausescu, and it was a very poor country.
Q. Was it an indoctrination kind of education?
A. Yes. That's what it was. To the point, as I understand it, that he convinced the populace that if you are having difficulty raising your children, give them to the state. We can do it better.
Q. After his fall, did the indoctrination continue?
A. Yes, it continued, and they've had a number of governments since. But the new minister of education has very far-reaching ideas, and he knows what he wants and he's evolving a staff around him. They also have a unique thing called the Institute for Educational Sciences. This is a group of the elite intellectuals in the educational system, who are the ones who designed and wrote the new curriculum and designed the new assessment tools they're going to use, and the people in the institute are now in positions of importance throughout the country.
Q. Does Romania have universal, free public education?
A. Yes.
Q. Had there been and is there now an elite for the intellectual?
A. There always was and there continues to be. Kids get tracked. You take exams to get into certain high schools and universities.
Q. Here in New York, there seems to be a trend to put more structure into curriculum, to take away some of the unlimited choices that at times seem to exist for what a teacher may teach -- a contrast to what Romania is now attempting to do.
A. It goes in a circle almost -- we used to have a very similar kind of curriculum, where on Nov. 14, say, in New York City this is what you would cover, and it was very cut and dried. Then the creative teachers began to scream, We can't do enough. So then they began to give topics, and teachers could move from where they wanted to go and use imagination and creativity. Then they discovered what you're talking about -- that all teachers can't handle that, so we're now going back to more structure -- not as rigid as it used to be.
Q. People want some rote brought back in the United States, right?
A. Yes, but if you really follow the good practices that we had, rote never went -- it was always an important piece. It's just that people jump on bandwagons. Anything that comes in in education we anticipate this will be the be-all and end-all and that if we use it everything will be just fine. It doesn't work that way.
Q. So why do educators do it? Why argue over phonics versus whole language when a combined method can be used?
A. Because you have got people out there selling their own particular point of view, and people join bandwagons and that's unfortunate. You said phonics and whole language, and we do know the road is definitely between them both. What they had there in Romania was no freedom whatsoever, and now they will have all of a sudden this new curriculum where the teachers are going to be asked to think a little bit. Many of them are very uptight about it.
Q. How long will the transformation in Romania take?
A. My numbers may be a little off, but we were talking about, for September, training 38,000 teachers in the new curriculum. We trained trainers who trained other trainers. I can't tell you how exciting this project is to me. I want to thank Dr. Steven Sweeny, the president of the college, and Dr. Joan Bailey, the senior vice president for academic affairs, for their support. And we're going to be bringing teams from Romania here.

HEADLINE: The View From/New Haven;
When a Home Is More Than Simple Housing

BYLINE: By ROBERT DUBROW 

 BODY:
MOST middle-aged men in Connecticut would consider a move into a one-room apartment to be a step down. But not Roy Caple. Mr. Caple had been living in a homeless shelter in New Haven until December, when Cedar Hill Apartments opened and he moved in. "I love it," he said recently. "I got my own place. I can go and I can come. I can lay back and think about how I was. It's like a dream come true."
Cedar Hill, on State Street in New Haven, is a project of the Connecticut Supportive Housing Demonstration Program, described as the first statewide initiative in the country to deal with homelessness by providing permanent, affordable rental housing with on-site support services. The program, serving single adults, is a joint initiative of the state and the Corporation for Supportive Housing, a national nonprofit organization. 
 Janice Elliott, the corporation's program director in Connecticut, says that the combination of affordability and support services is crucial. "The difficulty with providing services to people while they're homeless is their lives are extremely unstable," she says, "and it's very difficult to have someone sustain recovery in that context. Someone may get into an affordable unit, but if they're not receiving support services, often they will end up cycling from landlord to landlord, losing their apartment because they don't know how to budget money, because they may not be maintaining medications for a disability."
In 1993, nonprofit organizations interested in developing supportive housing responded to a request for proposals from a state Interagency Task Force and the Corporation for Supportive Housing. Of the 12 projects selected, 3 were turned down by communities. By last month, the remaining projects -- in New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport, Stamford, Middletown and Windham -- had been completed. The main source of construction financing was a package of low-interest mortgage loans from the state's Department of Economic and Community Development.
It was not difficult to fill the 281 one- and two-room units in the nine projects. Cedar Hill Apartments, with 25 one-room units, stopped accepting applications after about 140 had been received.
Half the units are set aside for people in the federally-funded Shelter Plus Care program, which serves homeless people disabled by a mental illness, a substance abuse problem or HIV/AIDS. One-quarter of the units are for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, but do not necessarily have a disability. The remaining units are for people with low incomes, defined as less than half the median income for the area of the state in which they live.
"It really serves a mix," says Ms. Elliott. "That's one of the beauties of the program, that whole integration."
Cedar Hill's grounds are landscaped with recently planted trees, shrubs and flowers. A visitor entered the building through a bright, open foyer. Framed prints by artists including Monet, van Gogh and Renoir as well as by the photographer Ansel Adams line the hallways. Meetings, including those of the tenants' association, a men's group and a women's group, are held in a room that also contains three computers for the tenants' use. Tenants socialize in a community room, where they can watch television and where monthly dinners take place.
Mr. Caple tends a vegetable garden in back of the building. Potted plants, cared for by another tenant, are set around the patio. The one-room units are furnished with a bed, a dresser, an end table, a kitchen table, two chairs, a stove and a refrigerator. Tenants can bring in additional furniture.
Home Inc., a nonprofit developer and property manager, owns and manages the property. Columbus House provides support services, paid for by the state, with one part-time and two full-time case managers.
The lead case manager, Emily Robinson, says that 23 of the 25 tenants have chosen to use case management services. Case managers help tenants find mental health counseling, drug treatment, other medical services, vocational services and entitlement benefits. They also provide informal counseling and help tenants with medication schedules, money management, cooking and taking care of their apartments.
Four tenants have full-time jobs. Seven of the eight who work part-time were hired as security guards or janitors by Edwina D'Aiuto, Home Inc.'s property manager. "We thought that for some it would be job training," she says, "because they have never had a job; for others, an opportunity to get a little self-respect back, learn a few skills. And some truly have skills. It really helps us. If you live in the house, you're going to be more concerned that the house is safe than if you come from outside."
Other sources of tenant income are General Assistance from the state and Social Security. Tenants "know if somebody is on G.A. and gets $200 a month," says Ms. D'Aiuto. "Toward the end of the month, somebody that's got Social Security will cook dinner and invite them over."
Tenants have leases and pay 30 percent of their income as rent. Two major subsidies, from the Shelter Plus Care program and the corporate-supported National Equity Fund, make up the difference between the rent roll and the housing's operating costs. Participating corporations receive Federal low-income housing tax credits in return.
Supportive housing is cost-effective, says Ms. Elliott. "It keeps people from having to cycle through the acute care system over and over again," whether it's for mental illness, addiction, or AIDS, she said. "The case manager can watch for signs that someone may be having a difficulty and intercede in a timely way. So the dollar investment in case management services is very small compared to what the cost would be otherwise."

HEADLINE: Here Come the Tourists, and All Their Dollars

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
ACROSS the state, admissions at tourist attractions are up 10 to 20 percent over last year, and the increase in inquiries from prospective visitors is running even higher.
Sometimes the interest in Connecticut even surprises those who work to promote it. Jackie LaVella, executive director of the Connecticut River Valley and Shoreline Visitors Council, said when she stopped at a bed and breakfast in Westbrook in May she found two groups of Germans staying there, and in June she was expecting a German film crew, coming to do a television piece on the tourist offerings of the Connecticut River. "You have the feeling that we've been discovered," she said. 
 Good economic conditions certainly have a lot to do with it. "When there's doubt in the economy, it makes people hold back," said George Donnelly, marketing director at Mystic and More, the regional tourism district that includes several of the state's most popular attractions, as well as two casinos.
Equally important is that the promotion of tourism -- the third-largest industry in the state behind manufacturing as well as finance and insurance -- in recent years is now bearing fruit.
Excluding the casinos, tourism is a $5 billion business that employs about 117,000 state residents, said Edward Dombroskas, executive director of the tourism division of the Department of Economic and Community Development. He said that so far this year, inquiries to his office for information booklets are 133 percent higher than the same period last year, and admissions to tourist attractions have risen about 12 percent. Restaurant receipts and hotel bookings are also higher. "All of the indicators together tells us that we're looking forward to a very strong tourist season this year," Mr. Dombroskas said.
Tourism officials said that Connecticut is most popular as a destination for families or small groups coming for three-day or four-day weekend visits, and they tend to make return visits. Residents also visit many of their own state's attractions. As a result, most of the promotion has been aimed at Connecticut itself, New England and the Middle Atlantic states, but as Ms. LaVella noted, tourists increasingly have come from farther afield.
The Litchfield Hills Travel Council found that while the greatest numbers of visitors to the northwestern corner of Connecticut came, as expected, from New York, New Jersey and New England, it also drew large numbers of tourists from California, Ohio, Texas, Florida and Wisconsin, as well as from Europe.
Mr. Dombroskas said that each of the 11 regional tourism districts develops its own marketing program, financing it with a portion of the 12 percent tax on hotel lodgings. By far, the largest tourism market in the state is southeastern Connecticut, anchored by Mystic Seaport and Mystic Marinelife Aquarium. Both are developing new exhibits, especially the Aquarium, which recently opened the first phase of a $52 million renovation project.
Deb Adamson, a spokeswoman for the Aquarium, said last year it admitted 750,000 visitors, and this year expects more than 800,000. Scheduled to open next spring is its Institute for Exploration -- a combination of scientific underwater research centers and tourism exhibits developed by Dr. Robert Ballard, the discoverer of the wreck of the Titanic.
Steven Spielberg's movie "Amistad" may have been a box office disappointment, but Peter Glankoff, a spokesman for the Seaport, said it helped increase admissions at Mystic Seaport, where much of it was filmed and where a full-size replica of the ship now under construction.
Meanwhile, Ms. LaVella's district is attempting to promote the scenic beauty of the Connecticut River, in light of its recent designation by the Nature Conservancy as one of the "10 last greatest places on earth."
Hartford is anticipating a revival in interest in Mark Twain as the result of a documentary on the author's life that Ken Burns is preparing for PBS.
The city also has Amistad-related attractions, and its tourism district found "Jurassic Park" helped promote Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill.
The Aquarium and Seaport in Mystic are both are members of Mystic Coast and Country, a nonprofit marketing agency that focuses on the immediate Mystic-New London area, unlike the district that covers a region reaching northward beyond Norwich. They also have their own programs, and later this summer will sell a discount-priced joint ticket.
Mr. Glankoff, of the Seaport, criticized the state tourism promotion for being too fragmented. Dividing the state into 11 independently operating regional districts makes tourism marketing far less coordinated than it should be in a state with only 5,000 square miles, he said.
On the other hand, the Coastal Fairfield County Convention and Visitors Bureau, the tourism district for the Fairfield County shoreline, has subdivided into three parts. Steven Paganelli, its executive director, explained that each subdivision -- centered around the cities of Stamford, Norwalk and Bridgeport -- has an individual character, and its plan lets the district better focus its advertising for each one.
Tourism officials generally agreed that the proliferation of tourism attractions is very good for the industry in Connecticut. Rather than competing with established attractions, new ones give visitors from other states more reason to make return visits. Thus, Bridgeport's new minor league baseball team, the Bluefish, will likely increase admissions at, for example, the Barnum Museum, a few blocks from the stadium.

HEADLINE: Teen-Agers, New Force In Charity

BYLINE: By DIANE SIERPINA 

 BODY:
CHILDREN with spending money. It's a scary thought for some people, but the future of philanthropy may depend on it.
The children of Baby Boomers nurtured on the concept and value of community service are ready for the next challenge, say experts. And some of the more progressive -- and better endowed -- charities and community foundations in the state have started putting thousands of dollars into teen-agers' hands, challenging them to determine which local programs and services are most deserving of support. 
 The charities are betting that when middle and high school students get the chance to see the world from their point of view at a young age, they will be better equipped to take leadership roles in the community and more generous with their time and money when they are adults. The immediate benefit is better services for young people.
"Youth are great collaborators," said Robert Collier, director of the Michigan Community Foundation's Youth Project, a 10-year-old program admired for engaging youth in philanthropy.
"They can stretch the dollar," Mr. Collier said, "and they really tend to know how to break down those boundaries we adults sometimes create. They put their own agendas on the shelf and say, 'Let's deal with this problem.' "
Added Debbie Spaide, founder of Kids Care Clubs, a national organization based in New Canaan: "This is completion of the circle. Now the kids are doing the research themselves and coming up with the ways they want to respond to the needs. They have total ownership in the whole process." While many community foundations are still debating the concept of youth grant makers, the Waterbury Foundation (with assets of $24 million) put a $64,000 initiative in place last January involving nine youth service agencies and 225 students in the northwestern part of the state. The initiative, called Youth in Action, targets the needs of young people in the region, said Ingrid Manning, the executive director. Participating students are in grades 6 through 10.
"We targeted students who were not existing leaders in their schools, but had the potential," said Ms. Manning. Each group was given $1,000 to $2,000 to dispense in the community according to need.
First, the young people spent a weekend at Camp Sloane in Lakeville to get to know one another and develop leadership and team-building skills. Then they met weekly to debate the merits of the proposals from the community representatives they interviewed. In June, they announced their grants.
Sarah Rodia, 13, a student at Woodbury Middle School, and her group divided $1,365 among the Flanders Nature Center, which wanted to provide a workshop for children; the middle school, for field trips and activities, and a local band to help other children record their own music and poetry.
The work was difficult, Sarah said, but in the process, the children became good friends, learned how to get along with different kinds of people and developed listening and decision-making skills.
"In the end, I felt really grown up because this isn't something you expect children to do. I learned how the real world is," said Sarah.
Her mother, MaryLou Rodia, has already seen a difference in her daughter, a former Girl Scout. "In Girl Scouting, it was more service-oriented," said Ms. Rodia. "In this, they had to work with money and build money skills. They had to know how that money was going to benefit all the people in our community, not just them. It was a big-time commitment, but they loved it." The Waterbury Foundation will continue the program this fall with a new set of students and another $64,000 endowment, said Ms. Manning.
And don't think the teen-agers are pushovers when it comes to judging the worth of funding pitches they get. The high school seniors involved over the past eight years in the United Way of the Capital Area's annual $10,000 grant-making program "were tough," said George Bahamonde, the president and chief executive officer. "What organizations had to go through for a $500 grant was very rigorous," he said. "It was a quality process."
The United Way's program was suspended this year so that it could be retooled to involve younger teen-agers and coordinated through Leadership Greater Hartford and Common Ground, Hartford area organizations designed to build leadership skills in teen-agers from diverse backgrounds.
"It's a natural fit," said Ellen Smith-Bigelow, director of Common Ground, of the collaboration. "It's just amazing -- especially when you're getting these kids who never saw themselves necessarily as leaders and you give them a job to do, teach them the skills to do it and let them do it. They're so pleased with themselves."
While the United Way and Waterbury programs do not involve fund-raising by the children, Ms. Spaide of Kids Care Clubs and Robert Kocienda, director of Xcel Inc. in Norwalk, a nine-year-old agency that promotes leadership, education and community service skills in young people, are designing their grant-making programs to do both.
"We want the kids to raise the money -- that's critical," said Mr. Kocienda. "It increases their sense of ownership." Ms. Spaide added that "kids are tremendously compassionate." "They will work so hard if they feel what they're doing will truly make a difference."
This spring, Ms. Spaide's daughter Heather, 17, recruited her New Canaan High School lacrosse teammates and their friends to participate in the first Kids Care Challenge. The afternoon of games and contests was to raise funds to send a young Stamford family whose father has brain cancer to the circus in New York City and buy them a video camera.
Thirty-four young people collected pledges totaling $3,500, $1,000 of which was earmarked for the family of Stanley Ferris, 36. After the challenge, the group decided to give Mr. Ferris's family another $2,000 and roll over the remaining $500 as seed money for next year.
Heather said the teen-agers enjoyed being in charge. "We were 100 percent the decision makers," she said.
Mr. Kocienda is modeling his grant-making program after an initiative at the Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Students created their own community foundation in 1994 after being challenged by a former principal, Mario Pena, who is now executive director of the Plan for Social Excellence based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., to raise $4,000 to help the less fortunate. Mr. Pena pledged to match it. The young people raised $5,000 that first year and have raised $12,000 more since.
As Mr. Kocienda sees it, "By and large, young people haven't been given enough opportunities to express themselves in real healthy and constructive ways.
"We want to get over the stereotype of ageism -- and the overlays of sexism, racism and classism -- and all the assumptions that go with young people and what they can and cannot do. We really want to start breaking some of the molds."
Most community foundation leaders look to Michigan as a successful model for the grant-making program. The Michigan Community Foundation's Youth Project was founded in 1988 with the support of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, one of the three largest in the world, said Mr. Collier, who grew up in Mystic.
To date, $45 million in permanent youth endowment funds have been paid out to more than 75 Michigan communities through 56 community foundations that cover the state. These funds have leveraged another $100 million in contributions for youth recreation, education, economic development, arts and environmental programs, he said.
The 3,500 grants awarded over 10 years fall into four basic categories: creating information resources, like yellow pages or Web sites; support for access to resources, like opening school gymnasiums for programs; mentoring initiatives and tackling tough issues, such as violence prevention, teen-age sexuality and H.I.V., said Mr. Collier.
"It's quite marvelous to see their ingenuity," he said. "What we've learned is that, one, young people are very responsible; two, cash really empowers and makes them a level partner with adults and nonprofits on kid issues, and, three, that this process helps young people understand the value of giving back to their community and of being problem-solvers."
The Michigan model being followed by several Connecticut agencies focuses on students in grades 8 through 12 who will remain involved for several years. They are not the recognized leaders, the Student Council types who are already terribly busy, said Mr. Collier.
"We try to go down to the next group of kids who, in many cases, haven't been asked to take on something like this . . . and they blossom," he said.
Some of those involved are teen-age mothers or are in trouble with the law. "It's a challenge," Mr. Collier admitted.
Each fall, students are recruited and trained to identify resources in the community. In the winter, they set priorities and send out proposal requests. Interviews are conducted from February to April and then grants are awarded later in the spring. By tying the youthful grant makers to established community foundations, he said, a sense of permanency is created.
"This is changing the way community foundations have operated in the past and nonprofits serving youths operate as well," he said.
Teen-agers who graduate are welcomed back to serve on the committees until they are 21 years old. The committees have between 15 and 25 members and dispense on average between $500 and $5,000 annually.
"We have community foundations in Michigan that have million-dollar youth endowment funds," said Mr. Collier. "So we have kids giving away $50,000-plus a year. In many of these communities, they've now become a significant donor."
Some of the first participants in the Michigan project graduated from college this spring and 150 of them will be tracked for 10 years to see if their involvement in the grant-making program had an impact on their professional and philanthropic lives, said Mr. Collier.
"Donors are aging," said Nancy Hadley, executive director of the Community Foundation of Greater New Haven, with approximately $200 million in assets. "We're trying to get with the younger generation before we lose them -- and then they just don't think about philanthropy as something of a culture."
Connecticut has 19 community foundations, ranging from the Hartford Foundation with $470 million in assets to recent startups with very little, said Nancy Roberts, president of the Coordinating Council for Foundations.
According to the Coordinating Council's latest figures, from 1995, Connecticut ranks No. 1 in the nation in per capita income, but only 34th in charitable giving. And with so much new wealth at a younger age and among women, the potential is for significant philanthropic growth.
The Community Foundation for Greater New Haven and the Fairfield County Community Foundation (assets $26 million) are in the process of creating funds for women and girls to support programs and services that help females overcome economic, political, racial, sexual and social barriers. Teen-age girls will serve on the grant-making panel.
Karen Brown, program director for the Fairfield County Community Foundation, said involving teen-agers in the decision-making helps educate and excite them about careers in the not-for-profit sector.
"It introduces them to the difficulties of raising money and making decisions about investing funds," she said. "And learning how nonprofits work and what their needs are. A lot of kids just don't know what's going on in their backyards or in towns that are nearby."

HEADLINE: Career Paths That No Guidance Counselor Suggested

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

 BODY:
BASEBALL gloves. Clean windows. Altar rails. Wool sweaters.
Some people want them. Some people need them. 
 And wherever there's a demand, there's an entrepreneur ready to be the supplier. Here are four people who have found their way into careers that rarely, if ever, come up in answer to that perennial childhood question: What you want to be when you grow up?
 
ALTAR RAILS
A Lot of Time in Church And Never a Time Clock
Louis Moses is a firm believer in the 11th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Waste.
A committed recycler at home, he also recycles for a living. But it's not paper and plastic that he's in the business of saving. It's religious articles -- votive lights, altar rails, baptismal fonts, vestments -- that churches want to get rid of. He sells what he buys to a company based in Mexico, which acts as a clearinghouse of sorts, reselling the articles to churches in Latin America.
As far as he knows, his one-man show is a one-of-a-kind operation. "There might be somebody far away, but there is no one I know of," he said.
And just how did he find his way into such a specialized business? Through the United States Army. How else?
The time was the late 1960's, during the Vietnam War. The place was Panama. Mr. Moses was a military policeman, "which wasn't a bad assignment," and on his days off he would visit local cathedrals, "just for something to do," he recalled. "The priests would beg me when I went to the States to ask if the churches there had anything they didn't need."
Those experiences planted the seeds that grew into Church Decor by Moses when Mr. Moses left the military in 1969.
Maybe it was foreordained. His father was a recycler of sorts, making a living in the scrap business.
"When I was 5 years old, I would go with him when they were emptying out old department stores and mansions, ripping all those things out, copper tubing and all," he said. "I was the little guy. I would go into the places where no one else could fit."
Now he goes into churches. Mr. Moses is Roman Catholic, and so are 95 percent of his business contacts. Sometimes he receives a call at his North Haledon home from a priest who has seen his ad. Sometimes he finds out on his own that a church is being renovated and tries to get there before it's too late.
Almost everything he salvages ends up in Latin America, after a stopover in his Paterson warehouse. "There's not much of a demand for used religious articles for other churches here," he said. "They prefer brand new. Much of the things that I end up with are antiquated." In the United States, for example, most churches use electric candlesticks, for insurance reasons if nothing else.
By the way, if you've been thinking that a confessional might be just the thing to complete your living room decor, don't bother calling Mr. Moses. He is very protective of the items he recycles, determined that they continue to be used as sacred objects. (The calls come anyway. There was a demand for vigil lights, he recalls, after they appeared in a video by Madonna -- the singing Madonna -- and again when the lights appeared in a scene in the movie "Forrest Gump.")
His work takes him from Boston to Philadelphia, with occasional forays to Chicago. A 2-month-old daughter, his first child, has made the road trips less attractive than they used to be.
"I've never had a real job, a job where I had to tell somebody somewhere how many hours I worked this week," said Mr. Moses, 50. "If I don't feel like going to work, if I feel like going tuna fishing, I can," he said, adding, "That's my only vice now."
Besides the freedom of his work, he also loves the thrill of discovery. "I never know what I'm going to find," he said. "I'll get a call that somebody has chandeliers, and they may turn out to be 10 feet across with little angels on them, or just little aluminum ones made last year."
Mr. Moses, the M.P. who used to visit churches on his days off, remains a practicing Catholic. "I don't go to church as much on Sundays as I should, but I spend so much time at churches in the week," he said. "If I've got a 9 o'clock appointment, I'll get there at 8:30 and go in to Mass. It kind of clears my mind for the day."

BASEBALL GLOVES
Good Hands And a Sense of History
People can get pretty attached to a piece of cowhide (or kangaroo skin). A few hundred innings, a few dozen fly balls, a few good (lucky?) catches along the way, and nobody is going to separate a ballplayer and his, or her, glove.
Nobody, except maybe John Golomb. And he will separate them only temporarily, in the name of the Sports Doctor, the company he founded a dozen years ago to repair gloves that have seen better days.
Whether players reach the major leagues or play pickup games in the park, "they love their gloves," Mr. Golomb says. "There are not many kinds of athletic equipment that falls into that kind of sentimentality."
He takes credit for the repairs that helped Wade Boggs's 13-year-old glove survive the third baseman's last season with the Yankees. Presumably the glove went with Mr. Boggs to Tampa Bay; spokesmen for the Devil Rays did not return phone calls last week asking how it has help up.
But repairs are an increasingly smaller part of Mr. Golomb's work. More and more of his time is spent making reproductions of gloves worn by baseball greats for serious fans and designing custom-made gloves for serious baseball and softball players.
It's not exactly the career that Mr. Golomb, 44, envisioned when he went off to art school at Syracuse University more than a quarter-century ago. Among the things he learned was that he "was not impassioned about painting."
Instead, he decided to learn more about the family business, the Everlast Company, a manufacturer of sports equipment that had been started by his grandfather in the Bronx and was then run by his father.
Starting out in the packing room, he moved on to cutting leather, supervising a product line and eventually designing equipment. His specialty was boxing gloves.
"I'm good with my hands," he said. "It was a natural to begin to make the equipment myself."
When the corporate softball team needed its gloves laced and repaired, he got the assignment. And from there, with the support of his wife, Barbara, he decided to move from boxing and the family business to baseball and his own business.
He has patterns for more than 800 different gloves, many gathered from contacts with collectors of baseball memorabilia. He says he can recreate anything from the glove Willie Mays used for his famous over-the-shoulder catch in the 1954 World Series to "a glove you had as a kid and you lost it."
For $125, Mr. Golomb will recreate the Babe, a 1920's fielder's glove. The Yogi, a 1950's professional model, costs $185. The cost of a custom-made baseball or softball glove, made of cowhide or kangaroo leather with hand-cut rawhide laces, starts at $290. Restoring a glove usually costs $40 to $100.
After working for 12 years from his home in Rocky Hill, Mr. Golomb has relocated his business to Little Ferry, where he plans a showroom that will be open to the public this fall. (Through Friday, eight copies of historic gloves made by Mr. Golomb will be on display at the Mary Jacobs Memorial Library in Rocky Hill.)
Does he like baseball? "I think it's a terrific game," he said. "I follow it every year. I'm very excited about the Yankees this year. I've always been a Yankees fan."

WINDOWS
A Clear View And a Strategy
 "Let's be perfectly clear," the ad says.
Alix Longfellow is. She does windows. She couldn't be happier.
She's happy when she's working outdoors, perched on a 40-foot ladder at a house looking out over the ocean or the marshes. She's happy when she can take a job that someone else scheduled for 130 hours and cut it down to 80. She's happy with her schedule, the fact that she can take long vacations in the off-season and enjoy an unscheduled rainy afternoon of reading.
Talk to her long enough, and you'll start thinking that maybe it's time to bid goodbye to the boss and buy your own window-cleaning equipment.
She did just that, more or less. (There was a little detour to New Zealand and, since it was in the neighborhood, Australia.)
Before New Zealand, there was college, and a job at Estee Lauder, where she was an administrator in the art department for the Clinique line, coordinating the work of photographers, models and artists. About five years ago, on the eve of a two-week trip to New Zealand, she learned that her job had been eliminated in a restructuring. "If I don't know where I'm going to end up," she remembers telling her boss, "I might as well take four months off, not just two weeks." She was gone a year.
Back in the United States, she met with a career counselor in Philadelphia who helped her figure out what she wanted to get out of her work. About a year later, she said, "I was doing the paperwork for my business, and I realized that I met all my goals."
The test results didn't go so far as to spell out D-O W-I-N-D-O-W-S. But they helped Ms. Longfellow figure out her priorities: personal growth; economic security; the opportunity to meet interesting people and, last but not least, respect. "That can mean all kinds of things," she said, "and to this day I don't know exactly what I meant. Respect from the community, in part, and more important, respecting myself."
She also knew she wanted to be down at the shore, if possible in Cape May, because her parents, who lived in Philadelphia, had had a house there "and it was pretty much like home."
Ms. Longfellow is the first to admit that window washing is not rocket science. She learned the basics from her brother, who operated a cleaning business in the 1980's to earn money for college. She went to a window washers' convention in Las Vegas when she was just starting out, and she continues to keep up with technological developments in the field. "I know how to clean windows," she said. "I do. I do."
Beyond good equipment, what she says she brings to the job is a good system, one that has allowed the business to grow from one job a day to four or more. "To me it's a game: how can we do it as quickly as possible?" she said. "It's like chess to me."
At this point, she still takes a hands-on approach. Anyone who doubts that can visit Ms. Longfellow on a job like the one she had last Friday in Stone Harbor. The views were great. But what else would you expect in a house with 120 windows?
Last year, she worked through December and was back at it in mid-February -- a longer season than she ever imagined.
Any other surprises?
"That I like it as much as I do. I like the paycheck and the sense of completion. I like results. I feel better when I am producing. You have a dirty window; then you have a clean window. It's satisfying."

WOOL
Riding Herd On a Farm of Her Own
 Many little girls dream of riding horses. Nancy Clarke took the dream one step further: "I wanted to ride a horse of my own, on land of my own."
Note that there's no mention of sheep in that fantasy.
Yet for 12 years Ms. Clarke has devoted her life to a flock of registered Romney sheep that she breeds at Castlegate Farm, just west of Flemington.
In between the little-girl dream and the grown-up reality of running a 33-acre farm, Ms. Clarke, 53, spent many years working in advertising and public relations for the Crown Derby line of Royal Doulton China. "I had fully expected to be with them until I retired," she said.
It was a horse, a horseback-riding accident and a bit of lucky coincidence that brought the farm dream back into the picture. A broken collarbone kept Ms. Clarke out of a horse show; to console herself, she went for a drive through the New Jersey countryside. On a whim, she stopped in a real-estate office, and within a week she had found her farm.
The next step was figuring out how to use it. At that time, New Jersey didn't give tax breaks to horse farms; the options, she said, were cows, chickens, pigs and sheep.
"The only one that seemed sensible to me were sheep because that would give me wool," she said. "I had a background in marketing and product development. And I liked to knit. If I had a source of raw material that I could control, the whole country could be a potential market."
And just what did she know about sheep at that point? "That they go baa and that they are woolly," she said with a laugh.
After talking at length with people who knew more, she decided to raise Romneys, a breed that originated in the southeast of England. "They don't get foot rot," an important consideration because of the type of soil on her farm, she said. "They're very hardy, very sweet, very calm, very affectionate. They're wonderful mothers, and they have fabulous fleece."
After a merger and a restructuring eliminated her job, she worked as a consultant while renovating the farmhouse on her land, with the help of her boyfriend, Richard Pantel, who owns an architectural engineering firm in Somerville.
By the early 90's, she had become a full-time shepherd -- "raising sweaters," as she puts it, with a flock of about 50 animals. Each sheep can provide wool for one to four sweaters a year, depending on the style.
Those sweaters, produced by private knitters who work from their homes, sell from $160 to $300. Besides the sweaters, the 400 to 500 pounds of wool that she shears each year turns up in the Wool Shop as hand-knit baby items, yarn that Ms. Clarke spins by hand, mill-spun yarn from Green Mountain Spinnery in Vermont and spinning fleece.
She insists that it was not that great a leap from marketing porcelain to marketing wool. "In the same way that when I worked in porcelain, I went to the factory to learn what I was selling, I learned how to spin to know what I was selling," she said.
What has struck her most since leaving the business world is the gap between the "created urgencies" of the office and the actual life-and-death issues of the farm.
"When a ewe is in labor and the lamb is stuck, and the vet can't get there, you do what you need to do," she said. "It's an exhilarating experience."
Just as she is responsible for bringing her animals into the world, she is responsible for how they leave it. That means sending some to slaughter, mostly rams that don't exhibit traits that will improve the breed.
"If you don't cull the flock," she says, "you end up with too many animals for the land, and you run out of viable breeding options. And my goal is to improve my wool and to improve Romney sheep. To my mind, it's the right thing to do, but maybe not to everybody's."
While they are with her, she says, the sheep live good lives. "There are no surprises, no loud noises. We don't chase them. They all have names. It's very mellow, and that keeps them very healthy."
Still, she says: "I cry when they go. As a shepherd, if you don't cry, there's something wrong."
That's another fact of life that was not part of her childhood reverie.
She has not let go of the heart of that dream. "I have a wonderful mare that I'm training in dressage, and my dream is to get to the second level with her, not to compete her, but for the sheer unadulterated joy of doing a correct dressage movement in my own arena at 6 in the morning."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Joyless Nephew Meets A Mame of His Own

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: MADISON

 BODY:
THERE is no joy in Southwood, Istanbul (even via the Orient Express), Boulogne, Buenos Aires, Formosa, Paris, Paraguay or any of the other exotic stopovers that compose the panoramic landscape of "Travels With My Aunt," which has been plunked onto the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's Other Stage here.
Even at its most accomplished -- as homage to the power of gesture and illusion, the truth and spareness of narrative theater art -- Giles Havergal's stage adaptation of Graham Greene's novel is bogged down by the baggage of too many characters, too many details and the labored obligation to amuse. 
 It is up to a mere four men in gray suits to personify some 25 personalities, including vividly written taxi drivers, policemen and hotel receptionists. But it is not permissible for any of these men to be mere.
All, tellingly, take turns being Henry Pulling, a truly mere retired and retiring bank manager who is still a clerk inside; the gray suit is a metaphor for his life. But only one of the four actors (Davis Hall) plays the one and only Aunt Augusta throughout. And that actor must transcend the gray suit and leap into the contrasting colors, glamour and largess of a mad, mad woman who, no surprise, declares: "I have always been very fond of travel."
Coming upon her nephew, Henry, at a crematorium, the site of his mother's funeral, the 75-year-old Augusta, his only close relative, lures him in Auntie Mame style into accompanying her as she travels from one lover (a West African factotum) to another (an Italian criminal), with side trips to hotel rooms everywhere and subplots about smuggling money and drugs, searching suitcases and a stolen Leonardo. "A tourist in my aunt's world" is how Henry understatedly describes himself.
For Greene, his 1969 tale of Henry's coming of age at 55 and his aunt's relentless pursuit of adventure was an artistic breather, a dash of whimsy and frivolity mixed with escapist intrigue, in contrast to the political, moral and theological complexity that dominated his works. The author called it an entertainment. In Joe Discher's staging here, it is an ordeal.
It is laboriously clear that the director's search for themes and connections, in an adaptation that insists on theatricality first and meaning later, really means hard work for the audience. Some evocative slides and supertitles ("The Flat," "The Mansion," "The Jail," "Back at the Hotel") denote change of place.
In the pivotal role of Aunt Augusta (and sometimes as Henry), Mr. Hall is an elegant if windy storyteller, not a master of bravura or the extravagance and economy of transformation. The actors, appearing more drilled than directed, make marchlike exits and entrances, seldom rising metaphorically from those gray suits.
A long two hours plus provides precious little payoff until a welcomely festive, and in all other ways welcome, last scene, in which the men in gray suits literally emerge as men in white suits, colored confetti and streamers fall from on high, and Alan Jestice (in which of his seven guises it is hard to figure) dances a merengue, Champagne in hand, serving up stage life. By then, everyone is desperate to party.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
An Annual Appraisal of the Urge to Innovate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR

 BODY:
THIS year's edition of the New Jersey Arts Annual at the Montclair Art Museum doesn't just stand (or hang) there decorously. Some of the work is sharp and direct, while other pieces challenge through subtlety and indirection. Although the work mostly stays within traditional, recognizable genres and media, the 47 artists share an urge to innovate.
The exhibition comprises selections agreed upon by a diverse group of judges: Maurice Sanchez, a master printmaker from Montclair; Grace Stanislaus, the former director of the Museum for African Art in Manhattan, and Gail Stavitsky, curator of collections and special exhibitions at the Montclair Art Museum. Any artist who lives or works in New Jersey, or was born in the state, was eligible to submit slides. 
 New Jersey art has long been closely identified with the industrial landscape, which is still a ripe subject. In the gauzily painted "Landscapes With Tanks and Chopper," by Robert Kogge of Hoboken, a helicopter hovers almost invisibly over twin oil storage tanks. In "Heading Up River," by David Ahlsted of Egg Harbor, factory smokestacks are in the distance, but the viewer's vantage point is a small boat tethered to a freighter.
"Warehouse," by Tom Birkner of Lambertville, presents a empty space, all bricks and wood floors, arranged in a series of similar rooms that might continue to infinity; the bare warehouse speaks to a changed economic climate. "Warehouse" has a country cousin in "Farm," by Paul Weingarten of Montclair. This tilled field, in the style of van Gogh, careers vertiginously, a sensation exaggerated by Mr. Weingarten's canvas, which is not a true rectangle but a lopsided parallelogram.
Figurative work here comes wrapped in psychological overtones. Sited so that they can be pondered at the same time are "Path of Least Resistance," by Nancy Depew of Kingston, and "One Can Be Trapped Without Realizing It," by Jean Kawecki of Upper Montclair. In Ms. Depew's startlingly clear canvas, a figure, reminiscent of one of Ingres's, curls into a difficult, abject position. Ms. Kawecki has fitted a generic figure, fashioned from slate and copper, between the viselike arms of a forked tree branch.
On the surface, "Watch Me," a large color photograph by Rosemarie Gelber of Summit, is two winsome little girls, near look-alikes, in party dresses. But one child's hair is slicked back, suggesting the possibility of androgyny. Two figures, one menacing, the other resigned, also fill the canvas of the blunt "Death Knows Me," by Miriam Beerman of Upper Montclair.
Artists today have abandoned the old battle in which a choice had to be made between abstraction and realism; they can use either tradition as needed. "Wounded," a hanging sculpture by Elaine Lorenz of Cliffside Park, is a spiraling form made of aluminum mesh covered with beeswax and painted like flesh. It is suspended from a vine, but its trunk seems to have been savagely hacked away. Near this disturbing piece is its seductive opposite: "Trisect," by Estella Lackey of Hoboken, who has simply stretched black lace on a triangular metal frame.
The New Jersey poet William Carlos Williams once wrote, "No ideas but in things," and the category of common objects includes, among other work, the stunning film noirish photographs "Evidence No. 3" and "Evidence No. 4," by Klaus Schnitzer of Upper Montclair. In one picture is a cigar in a half-empty whisky glass; the other shows spent bullets. At the other extreme, "Childhoods Passing," by Rolla Herman of Montclair, is a mobile whose elements are items of children's clothing made of brown paper.
But the ideas in things can be ineffable. The face of a perplexed child, scissored from a painting and collaged onto a surface of various reds by Gloria Rodriguez of Jersey City, is haunting, and the title, "Picture of Inner Clarity," isn't altogether reassuring. "Sac," an amber-colored container made of latex by Marion Held of Montclair, eludes a literal reading; it might be a purse, but the sculpture also might evoke the sacrum, the wide bone forming the pelvis, since what looks like a partial spinal column made of stoneware is emerging from it. "Breath," by Nancy Cohen of Jersey City, is a nearly impalpable sculpture of various materials, including glass, cement and wax. Facing a poster-size photograph of what looks like an atomic blast in "Waiting for Convection," by Jeannette Louie of West Orange, is a chair in the sleek 1950's modern style that flourished alongside nuclear-age anxiety.
ALTHOUGH a grounding in New Jersey is required, many artists have incorporated motifs from their countries of origin into their Jersey-made work. Tony Khawam, who was born in Syria but now lives in Budd Lake, was inspired by carpets for his busy painting "Interchange," whose title refers to a system of highways. For her sculpture "Watch Out America," Ela Shah, a native of India who now lives in Upper Montclair, has placed a teetering tower inspired by Hindu temples atop a toy mail truck. Zhiyuan Cong, who was born in China and now lives in Pompton Lakes, has etched the Great Wall in the jade and amber tones associated with Chinese painting and has included half-hidden images of venerable sages.
Artists also borrow from cultures not their own. In her drawing "Buddha," Batya Halpern of Montclair has prominently rendered the head of the eponymous enlightened personage. "Journey," by Robert Forman of Hoboken, is almost a tour de force: a seven-foot-tall painting in yarn. It features, as a wide border, a meticulous and detailed parade of the world's people. Mr. Forman learned the yarn technique in Mexico, but this ancient method is balanced by the computer-generated center of the work, in which figures are indistinct. This work is an emblem of the spirit of innovation that rules the exhibition.

The Middle Class: Winning in Politics, Losing in Life

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE great American middle class. Politicians of the left and right court it. Policies, liberal and conservative, are proclaimed on its behalf. Health care reform was to have eased its cares. Tuition subsidies educate its children. President Clinton made a "middle class tax cut" a centerpiece of his election campaign.
Most voters see themselves as members of the middle class, so Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, picked up the theme. When the Republican-controlled Congress finally passed a tax bill last year, he described it as the Republican "fulfillment of what President Clinton promised -- a middle class tax cut." 
But for all its mythic power, the middle class is finishing last in the race for improvement in the current economic boom. At the top and bottom of the economic ladder, wages are rising briskly. In the middle, they are rising slowly. This is unusual. While upper-income people often improve their lot faster than the middle class, lower-income workers hardly ever do.
The middle class of political exhortation and national myth isn't the same as the statistical middle of the wage scale, the place where progress is surprisingly slow. Half of the so-called middle class tax cuts enacted last year went to people earning more than $93,000. And while the median household earns almost $40,000 a year, the median individual wage is much lower: $11.13 an hour last month, or about $23,000 a year for a 40-hour work week.
It isn't that workers in this statistical middle -- people earning roughly $23,000 to $32,000 a year for a 40-hour week -- are visibly aggrieved because they are losing ground to their upper- and lower-earning fellow citizens. After all, their pay has gone up faster than the inflation rate over the last two years, even if the increase is not as great as the one experienced by lower- and upper-income workers.
"Everyone seems to be reacting to the favorable improvement in their pay," said Richard Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. "But the longer the expansion lasts, the more people will turn toward comparisons with other groups. That's when the grumbling and the wage demands begin. When you look across society, you are not really seeing that yet."
 
The Middle-Class Life
Lots of things can help someone improve his lot in life, of course. A rising stock market, tax breaks, inheritance, government subsidies like Medicare and Social Security, extra hours on the job and overtime pay all play roles, particularly for those at the top and bottom of the income ladder. The really wealthy often rely not on wages but on earnings from their investments. And many households put together the wages of two or three household members, bringing the median household income to nearly $40,000, which is enough to live a middle-class life in most of the United States.
By some estimates, a family of four must bring in at least $27,000 a year from one or more wage earners to maintain what John Schwarz, a political scientist at Arizona State University, describes as "a minimally adequate standard of living." In pursuit of that goal, most people measure their standing in the work force by what they earn individually on the job.
The bottom 20 percent on the national wage scale, earning $14,500 a year or less for a 40-hour week, has gained the most ground over the last two years, once wages are adjusted for inflation. Upper-income Americans, those earning north of $75,000 a year, have gained almost as much as the low-income people in the same two-year stretch. The middle group has gained a little ground since 1996, but less than the others.
 
Breakthrough
Viewed over the full eight years of the current economic expansion, the middle has actually lost ground, while the top and the bottom have gained at roughly the same gradual pace. Once wages are adjusted for inflation, the low end, for the first time, has regained all the ground lost in the early 1990's and is now earning more than in 1989, when the last economic expansion ended and a recession set in, undercutting wages.
Workers earnings slightly more than the poorest group or, at the other extreme, somewhat less than the richest wage earners, also did better than those in the middle, although not as well as those at either extreme.
The breakthrough came this year. The low-end wage, a maximum of $6.99 an hour last month for the bottom 20 percent, was 20 cents higher than in 1989, adjusted for inflation, according to the Economic Policy Institute, which calculated the trends from data provided by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
By comparison, the median wage, smack in the middle, was $11.13 an hour in June, or 17 cents lower than in 1989. The upper end, mostly peopled by well educated and skilled workers, seldom loses ground in any year. At the high end, the wage of $24.63 an hour today, adjusted for inflation, is 91 cents ahead of the comparable 1989 level.
There are reasons, of course, for the slide in the middle. Despite all the rhetorical emphasis on policies that favor the middle class, it is low-income workers who have gotten the extra nod from Washington in this economic expansion -- particularly through a 90-cents-an-hour increase in the minimum wage since October 1996. It was an increase that the Democrats proposed and the Republicans in Congress finally favored.
The minimum reached $5.15 an hour last September, and the ripple effect has pushed up wages for workers earning as much as 50 cents an hour over the minimum. That is a big portion of the people in the lower 20 percent of the American work force.
"The higher minimum wage is the key factor that has lifted people at the bottom," said Edward Wolff, a labor economist at New York University, whose own earnings calculations produced roughly the same results as those of the Economic Policy Institute.
The economy has played a big role, too. A surge in growth over the last two years and a falling unemployment rate produced labor shortages that showed up first at the low end of the work force. Meanwhile, middle-level workers, while finding jobs easily enough, had more difficulty raising their wages. Mr. Wolff and other labor economists tick off the reasons.
Computers have diluted the demand for clerks, secretaries and other medium-skilled workers. Unions, once the powerful bargaining agents of middle Americans, are weak today. Rising imports have hurt workers who make the same goods in this country. Corporate downsizing spread in the 1990's through white-collar ranks, making middle-income people feel less secure in their jobs and more reluctant to push for raises. And a bigger percentage of the work force now has a college education or at least some college training, diluting the demand for them. The wages of people with only four years of college are no longer rising.
"While middle income people benefit from the tight labor market, they have a harder time digging themselves out of the wage hole," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
 
Hard to Help
They are also harder for government to help, says Edward Montgomery, the Labor Department's chief economist. A huge swath of people who earn roughly $23,000 to $55,000 a year -- and pay more than 40 percent of all Federal income taxes -- are much more on their own than lower-income workers. There are government-subsidized training programs, for example, to get unemployed people into the low end of the labor force. The minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit (a Republican initiative that rebates tax revenue to low-wage workers) put a floor under their income. But middle-level people depend much more on their own dealings with their employers to determine their situations.
"It is harder for government policies to reach these middle level people," Mr. Montgomery said. "In a free enterprise society, we are hesitant to subsidize an employer for something he would do anyway."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the economic prospects of middle-income workers misstated the affiliation of John Schwarz, a political science professor who calculated the wage needed to achieve a minimally adequate standard of living. He teaches at the University of Arizona, not Arizona State University.

GRAPHIC: Photos: In America, middle class is as much a state of mind as an economic reality. In fact, the economics of middle-class life are often overlooked in the paeans to middle-class values. In the current boom, the statistical middle is falling behind; wage-earners at the top and bottom are improving their lot the fastest. (Edward Keating/The New York Times)
 
Graph: "Losing Middle Ground"
Americans earning in the middle wage scale saw their earnings decline since 1989, after adjustment for inflation, while the wages of those at either end have gained ground. The chart divides the workforce into equal segments and shows the percent change in the highest hourly wage for each segment from 1989 through the first half of 1998. Graph tracks percent change in hourly wages since 1989. (Sources: Economic Policy Institute; Bureau of Labor Statistics)(pg. 16)

HEADLINE: In India, an Arranged Marriage of 2 Worlds

SERIES: HERE AND THERE: Immigration's New Breed -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: JAIPUR, India

 BODY:
Vinit Sethi, a New Yorker born and bred, was wired from days of celebration when he mounted a small white horse to ride toward his bride. Dressed up like a Rajput prince, he nervously adjusted his golden turban and the strands of plump emeralds that hung around his neck.
His wedding procession, led by a lumbering elephant, fairly floated through the horn-honking, smoke-belching downtown traffic like some royal fantasy, trailing a band of his Ivy League buddies, merry revelers in Western suits. Mr. Sethi, a 24-year-old investment banker who loved night clubbing in SoHo, brought up the rear, his horse prancing past mesmerized beggar children. All were bathed in the fluorescent glow of green lights held aloft by small men in flip-flops. 
 His bride, a shy, hazel-eyed beauty of 20 named Anshu Jain, was waiting poolside at the Sheraton Rajputana. They had never kissed or held hands. She came from a family in which no woman had ever been allowed to call her husband by his given name. "For a wife, your husband is God," she explained. "And you don't call God by his first name."
Theirs might seem an unlikely union, this arranged marriage between the cosmopolitan American son of Indian immigrants and a sheltered Indian woman who had never set foot in America. Mr. Sethi's friends from the University of Pennsylvania had warned him that he should not consent to the match his mother had found for him in India just because it was expected of him. And he worried he was being "flaky" to agree to it.
For Mr. Sethi, though, the marriage wasn't the inevitability it had been for his immigrant parents. It was his own choice. And yet in making that choice, he was casting his lot with a traditional way of life, one that would bind him more closely to his parents and to India itself, and sustain that tie into yet another generation of American children -- his own.
By choosing to marry a woman of his mother's choosing, he managed to be both quite American and quite Indian all at once.
"I had mixed feelings with the concept," he said. "I didn't necessarily think I would go through with it. But my reservations got pushed to the side when I met her. I had an incredible feeling that this was the right thing to do."
In modern immigrant families -- where the bindings between new land and homeland are stronger than ever before -- the children almost inevitably find themselves pushed and pulled between the culture and values of their parents and those of the larger American society. Such ambiguities are perhaps never more acute than when a decision about marriage -- the arc of one's life -- is at hand. But what emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's wedding is the way many of these children search for, and find solace and grounding in, their connections to the world back home.
Mr. Sethi grew up in a tightly knit community of Indian gemstone merchants who, over three decades, have carved out a sizable niche in the historically Orthodox Jewish world of the diamond district in midtown Manhattan. Even as they scattered to doorman apartment buildings and to homes in predominantly white suburbs, these Indian families banded together in their business and social lives. They vacationed together in the Poconos. The sons skied together. The daughters took Indian classical dance together. And they still unite in Jaipur for events like the Sethi wedding.
They have held onto their socially conservative culture, fending off the onslaught of Americanization, by constant use of those totems of modernity -- telephone, fax, E-mail message and jet plane.
The fathers go back and forth most often, carrying satchels of gems folded up in tidy paper packets, each flight a thread stitching their lives here and there together. But the wives and children also go to India every year for weddings, family visits and religious pilgrimages.
Because of their wealth and the intensity of their business ties to India, these families are among the immigrants, Indian and otherwise, most tightly bound to their homelands. But their experience is common to immigrants from all over the world who have taken advantage of skills and contacts developed in New York and back home to build businesses and transoceanic lives.
Above all, the gemstone traders are held together by what they describe as a shared Indian idea of family, one that sees American-style individualism as a form of egoism that has fostered premarital sex, disrespect, divorce and other social ills.
They are looking back not just to India, but to a remembered India.
"India has changed tremendously, especially in the big cities," said Jyoti Pandya, one of the gemstone traders. "All the young ones there are trying to catch up with the West. Our children, we teach them the values of 20 years ago."
The heart of that teaching is an observance of hierarchies, the child giving deference to the parent, the daughter-in-law to the mother-in-law, the wife to the husband.
"Ladies have to admit that the husband is more powerful," said Haridas Kotahwala, a leading trader in the circle that includes the Sethis and Pandyas. "It is better to surrender than to have all these arguments."
But while the parents still consider themselves Indians, their children have grown up attending American schools, going to American movies, watching American television. Striving and ambitious, they often chafe at their parents' expectations. Just as often, they say they value the comfort and security of their affectionate, protective families.
Over the Christmas holidays, many of them traveled to this city in northwest India for the Sethi wedding with the nonchalance of New Yorkers vacationing at a Florida condo. Several, like Mr. Pandya's daughter, Komal, a Columbia University freshman, watched the wedding with more than academic interest. They are entering their marriageable years -- and, like many young Indian-Americans, choosing some form of arranged marriage with open eyes.
"An American girl dates a guy and she doesn't know much about him -- how he was brought up, his moral standards," Miss Pandya said. "I trust my parents to look for someone who will give me the life I've been brought up to have."
But the dissonance between her American and Indian identities emerged as she talked about her place in such a marriage. In one breath, she said, "I would never set aside family for career." And in the next, she said, "I don't want my husband to be my identity." Then she looked confused: "I'm like, oh yeah, I'm going to have my own identity and I'm going to be a demure wife. It is contradictory and hypocritical."
Just how these young Indian-Americans will seek to harmonize these clashing values remains to be seen. What is clear is that they feel little pressure to shed their ethnicity like some unwanted skin. "It's like P.C. that if my mom wants to be an Indian and wear a sari, it's O.K.," said Mr. Kotahwala's niece, Shweta, a 19-year-old international business major at New York University.
Instead, they will be sorting out just who they are on their own terms. Back in New York, Vinit Sethi is struggling to establish himself and his wife as a couple apart, within the close embrace of his family.
After honeymooning in the old royal city of Udaipur -- and Disney World -- they have settled into a one-bedroom apartment on Manhattan's East Side, in a traditional Indian family arrangement, across the hall from his parents. But Mr. Sethi has also undertaken to expose his bride to the Americana he loves. He has inflicted his old "Seinfeld" videotapes on her and taken her to Macy's, a Yankees game and the Great American Scream Machine at Six Flags.
And he has urged her to become a more independent, modern woman -- to go back to college, to wear jeans, to do what would have been unthinkable to her only a year ago: call her husband by his first name.
 
The Mother Finding a Match For an Eligible Son
Shashi Sethi is a guardian of family traditions, a woman who has given her life to her husband and two sons. As her boys grew up, she devotedly hand rolled the roti for their lunches, pushed them to study hard, instilled in them the family's religious values. She never once hired a baby sitter, not even for an evening. And as Vinit, the older son, came of age, her matchmaking instincts kicked in.
Mrs. Sethi knew he was a fine catch. At Manhattan's hypercompetitive Stuyvesant High School, he had excelled academically, but never dated. At Penn, where he graduated summa cum laude, he dated occasionally, but never had a girlfriend.
He took a job straight out of college with Lazard Freres & Company, the white-shoe investment bank, and promptly moved in across the hall from his parents. Many nights he dined on his mother's cooking in the room where he had slept on a Murphy bed as a boy.
It was when Vinit was 23 that Mrs. Sethi told him it was time to stop "goofing around" and marry. If he wanted to pick his own wife in the American way, she told him, that was fine -- as long as the girl was a strict vegetarian. If the newlyweds planned to live across the hall, "I would have to get along with her and she would have to get along with me, emotionwise, foodwise and livingwise."
Vinit told his mother he had no marriage plans. He had not yet decided between a match of his own making and one of his parents'. Either way, though, "I always knew I'd probably end up getting married to someone who wasn't very American, because I'm not myself in some ways," he said. "There's a certain level of individualism in American relationships I don't agree with myself."
So Mrs. Sethi quickly went into action. "I had an agenda," she said. "I began spreading the word with friends and family in Bombay and Jaipur." She planned a trip to India, but Vinit, immersed in his job and in no hurry to wed, refused to go.
The news that she was looking for a bride spread like wildfire. She received a package from a family friend in Dallas about a relative in India, Anshu Jain. It included Miss Jain's "bio data," a kind of resume for arranged-marriage prospects (Age: 19; Height: 5 foot 5 inches; Complexion: Fair), and an unprepossessing photo of an unsmiling young woman in a stiff pose, one arm crossed over the other. Mrs. Sethi set the envelope aside, barely giving it a thought.
Some months later, in January 1997, she set out for India. In Jaipur -- where her father once had an emerald-cutting factory -- she met several nice young women from good families. Then, while she was in Bombay visiting her husband's family, Miss Jain, her father and two uncles came to call.
The willowy, soft-spoken Miss Jain walked in looking nothing like the gawky young woman in the photo. She quickly won over Vinit's grandmother, uncle, aunt, assorted cousins -- and, most important, his mother.
"Anshu had a softness," Mrs. Sethi recalled. "She was very down to earth, very simple, very humble. It just clicked."
When Mrs. Sethi returned to New York, she and her son met for coffee at Dean & DeLuca near Rockefeller Center. She described the young women she had met, ranking the top four and their respective virtues. Always, Miss Jain headed the list. Her background was quite compatible with the Sethis'. She, too, was from a conservative family that followed Jainism -- a religion of nonviolence and vegetarianism, honesty and frugality. Her father ran a rental car company and a factory that made elastic.
Five months later, Vinit flew to Hyderabad to meet her. At a party before he left, one of his college friends brought out a cake topped with a plastic married couple and the words, "Happy 17th Birthday," suggesting he was going to be married off to a teen-ager. "I was a little spooked by the whole situation," he acknowledged. But he told himself he could always refuse the match.
The first day he and Anshu met, they spoke about hobbies, school, siblings. He was charmed, but felt he needed to know her better. But Miss Jain's family customarily allowed its daughters only a brief pre-engagement glimpse of the men they were to wed; a girl's reputation, essential to her marriageability, had to be carefully guarded.
Unbeknownst to the rest of her family, her father decided to allow another meeting. The next day, he sent one of his veteran drivers to pick up Vinit. During hours of talk in the back of the car, she told him of her bare-bones needs: "A guy who's patient and who doesn't smoke or eat tobacco." He, in turn, told her about his more complex requirements: a woman with whom he connected emotionally and who shared his commitment to family.
He knew there was no chance for a third meeting. He had to decide.
He flew to Bombay the next day and waited to see if the spell would lift. It didn't.
He said yes.
 
The Gem Trade A Generation Heads for New York
Haridas Kotahwala, dapper in a finely checked blazer and pristine white shirt, strode through a warren of dusty alleyways in Jaipur's Tripolia Bazaar, oblivious to the meandering sacred cows and scrawny dogs, his briefcase swinging at his side.
The eldest son in one of the 30 families that dominate the Jaipur gem trade, the 59-year-old Mr. Kotahwala has lived in New York for three decades. He had taken his wife and son to Jaipur for the Sethi wedding, but on this sun-drenched day, he was on his way to meet some gem brokers at the family's cutting and polishing factory.
Up a narrow, twisting flight of stairs, he emerged into a courtyard surrounded by rooms filled with the soft clicking sound of lapidaries at work. Soon he was sitting shoeless and cross-legged on a white floor mat, as comfortable haggling for sapphires and emeralds with the cell-phone-toting brokers as he was a few months later politely selling those stones from a booth at a trade show at the Javits Center in New York.
Jaipur had its origin as the center of India's colored gemstone industry in the 1700's. Today, the gem business is Jaipur's largest employer and gems and jewelry India's second-largest source of foreign exchange -- $5.6 billion a year -- after textiles.
The Indian jewelry trade, and the men of Mr. Kotahwala's generation, truly came of age in the late 1960's, thanks to the globalization of the economy and changing American immigration policy.
Congress had excluded Indian immigrants in 1917. But while the door was opened a crack in 1946, it was not until 1965, with the passage of the Hart-Celler Immigration and Nationality Act, that large numbers of Asian immigrants began arriving in America.
This sea change came at a fortunate time for the gemstone merchants. The demand for jewels in India had declined precipitously with the demise of its many princely states after independence from Britain in 1947. Several pioneering traders had discovered New York as jewelry exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows. The vast American consumer market beckoned.
The Kotahwala matriarch, Shyama Devi Kotahwala, said she worried that Haridas and his younger brother, Vinod, would be influenced by "the spoiled culture of America." She fretted that they would neglect her in her old age, that their children might marry outside their merchant caste and Hindu religion, perhaps even to Americans.
Still, with great trepidation, the families sent forth their young men to New York.
Mr. Kotahwala arrived in 1968 and rented a $200-a-month studio apartment in the diamond district, where he lived and worked. To break into a trade dominated by European and American Jews, he went door to door with a sample case, a confident, gossipy salesman slowly building a clientele. The Sethis arrived in New York four years later, after Shashi's father offered to help her carefully chosen husband, Dilip Sethi, gain a foothold in the emerald business.
There were then only a few thousand Indians in New York. In Manhattan, the traders say they found just two Indian restaurants and one grocery, where the owner never let them squeeze the vegetables.
Today, New York's Indian population has swelled to 200,000, and the gem merchants' trade group comprises 230 companies. Some of the more prominent clans, like the Kotahwalas, have become to families what multinational corporations are to businesses -- entities that transcend borders.
The Kotahwala family straddles America and the subcontinent, with offices also in Idar-Oberstein, Germany; Bangkok, and Hong Kong. Haridas and Vinod Kotahwala are based in New York, in a modern office in a sleek high-rise; for many years they lived together, with their families, in Queens. The other two brothers, in Jaipur, live with their mother, wives and children, in an aging mansion, called a haveli, within the terra cotta-colored walls of the old city.
And the pattern will continue: Haridas Kotahwala has a son In New York and another in Jaipur, and he recently set up a company for them, Royal India U.S.A.
Technology makes the Kotahwalas' way of life possible. The brothers here and there live with ears glued to telephones as they confer about deals. Their fax machines hum with orders. Their mother talks to her sons in New York by phone every week. She flies to America, and her sons and their families to Jaipur. Her hand in the family, as the matriarch, is still strong.
The family members move easily through the looking glass dividing the two worlds.
The 11-bedroom haveli, with its worn, aging couches in ascetic common spaces, is in the raucous heart of the Tripolia Bazaar. Outside, the streets are choked with bicycle rickshaws, motor scooters and carts drawn by camels with flowers perched on their noses and elaborate patterns shaved into their hides. Inside, Mrs. Kotahwala makes the rules, deciding on the menus (no onion or garlic), directing the servants.
Periodically, the matriarch spends a few months with Vinod and his wife, Shushma, 42, in their white stucco house in Forest Hills, Queens. There, the streets are orderly, the yew hedges manicured and the only sounds in the house on a quiet afternoon are the stately ticking of a grandfather clock and the tinkle of a teacup on its saucer. The two younger children attend private school, and on the advice of teachers, their mother has stopped speaking to them in Hindi.
Still, with the matriarch in town, the customs are those of the Indian family. "I wear traditional Indian saris in front of her, no pants or Western clothes," said Shushma. "I cook the way she likes. It's an obligation."
In her religious observances, Shushma Kotahwala also follows the way of her husband's family. She has set up a small shrine in a window seat of her bedroom, with an incense burner and statuettes of Krishna.
In Jaipur for the Sethi wedding, Shushma and her daughter Shweta journeyed to sacred places in and around Mathura, the birthplace of Krishna. As they moved from a windowless temple, where the visage of the family swami stared down from the saffron-colored wall, to shops where her daughter bought gaudy prints of Krishna, to the legendary mountain that Krishna held aloft on his finger, Shushma, so serious before, became girlish, almost giddy.
The trips to India come with many familial duties, but among the streaming multitudes of worshipers bearing sweets and tins of milk to pour on the black mountainside in offering to Krishna, she seemed exalted, her faith refreshed and her spirit renewed.
 
The Rules Young Brides, Boys With Prospects
Shushma Kotahwala had more than one wedding on her mind on her winter trip to Jaipur. The time had come to begin looking for a husband for 19-year-old Shweta.
Mrs. Kotahwala herself had married at 20, after learning the refined arts of embroidery, stitching, doll making, classical Indian dance and English literature. Her arranged marriage, she said, was her destiny -- and it brought her to America. "Nobody can change their destiny," she said. "That's what I believe and what most Indians believe."
Her daughter's destiny, Mrs. Kotahwala said, is likely to lie in India, in an extended family with her husband and his relations -- and that means her youth is crucial. If a woman is 25 or 26, "It becomes hard to mold the girl into the family -- and you get divorce," she said. "If the girl is young, she can be molded and it will unite the family. She won't have an independent way of thinking."
A woman in her mid-20's may also have lost her physical charms: "Maybe the boy can reject you because you don't look good."
Mrs. Kotahwala passed out Shweta's bio data to close friends and relatives, including her brother-in-law, Pramod Kotahwala, who lives in Jaipur and so would continue the search when she returned to New York.
Mr. Kotahwala explained the practicalities of arranging a marriage. In Shweta's case, he said, the goal is to find her a family from a big city since she is accustomed to life in New York. Whether the young man is from Bombay or Delhi, or even Singapore or Hong Kong, matters little. "Ultimately, these families are based in India," he said. "The connection has to be started here."
And the young man should have prospects: "We're looking for a boy who's settled in a business, not a profession, taking his own decisions, not necessarily earning much. I want to be able to smell the growth in him."
Shweta's wedding itself will be a costly multiday affair. He estimated the expense at $200,000 to $300,000 -- for clothes, a sum of money to take with her into the marriage, a set of jewels and the celebration for 3,000.
The Kotahwalas live simply in the Jaipur haveli, in part to save for the weddings of the family's unmarried daughters and for the jewels of future daughters-in-law.
"The son's wife has to have the same jewels as the other daughters-in-law," he said, "or she will have a complex because she is living in the joint family."
Shweta, who was born in India and has gone back and forth all her life, says she welcomes an arranged marriage, even if it takes her to Calcutta or Bombay. "I just want a cosmopolitan city," she said. "I don't want to go to Kentucky."
She also wants to finish college first, which should take a year -- and her parents agree.
For the first 13 years of her life, Shweta and her immediate family lived in Queens with her Uncle Haridas's family. She knows life in a joint Indian family and the art of compromise that keeps it operating smoothly. She enjoys living in a house where she is never alone. While other children played Nintendo after school, she was home squabbling endlessly with her cousin Vishal. "He'd want falafel," she said. "I'd want pizza."
Indian culture is deeply rooted in her.
"If I want to walk away from it -- out of the house -- I can," she said. "But I don't need to. I don't want to. I'm happy. That's a part of who I am. That's my individuality."
 
The Wedding Day Jewels and Silk And American Rap
They came from New York and Houston, New Delhi and Jaipur, the hundreds of people who poured into Jaipur's main auditorium on Dec. 25 for a gala evening of talent-show performances by the young friends and family of the Sethis. The women wore their finest saris in vivid hues of orange, pink and red. Their ear lobes, necks and fingers glittered with emeralds, diamonds and rubies.
Young men and women danced to Indian pop. Mr. Sethi's younger brother, Vaibhav, a student at the University of Michigan, lip synched to the rapper Notorious B.I.G., then performed a rap of his own.
 
It all started out way back in January,
When Mom met Anshu and this story began.
Mom thought, "Wow, she's perfect for my Beta."
But Vinit said, "No, not know, maybe lata."
The brother wound up with a typically Indian wedding wish: "Now let the wedding proceed, let's have some fun. This little story's over, now let's see a Sethi son."
"The New York girls" -- Shweta Kotahwala, Komal Pandya and a Barnard College freshman named Anjali Rawat -- swirled and undulated across the stage to the beat of Indian movie tunes, singing along in Hindi.
Miss Rawat was awaiting her own arranged marriage in Jaipur the following year to a young man from a family of Indian industrialists. They were engaged when she was 18, just after she graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan.
While she had always known that she would "be arranged," she said she was shocked that it had happened so soon, and threw a few tantrums. Eventually, though, she accepted it, and with considerable sadness has given up finishing her education at Barnard and her dream of becoming a television news anchor; instead, she will follow her husband to London or India. "I wish it didn't have to be this way," she said, "but I can't really do anything about it."
Vinit and Anshu watched from the audience. Since their engagement, they had come to know each other by talking for hours by telephone, running up $500-a-month bills at 69 cents a minute. Still, they seemed a bit awkward and frazzled later that evening as they stood together, she in a long white dress, he in a suit. Their hands never touched.
The next afternoon, the Sethi family and friends gathered beneath a gaily colored tent for the wedding procession. Vinit smiled broadly when his college friends clustered around him, joshing him about the wealth of gemstones strung around his neck. "He's the million dollar man," one said, to the laughter of all. But when they drifted away, Vinit remained on his horse, alone, his expression frozen into a tight, distracted smile.
At about 7 P.M., he reached his bride at the hotel. But only after a five-hour reception around the pool did the marriage ceremony itself actually begin -- at a time the astrologers had designated as the most auspicious.
 
The Wife Deference To Mummyji
Since the wedding, Anshu Sethi and her mother-in-law have settled into a comfortable rhythm in the long hours when their husbands are at work. Anshu pads back and forth across the hallway between the apartments, a sweet-tempered companion always happy to bring a tray of masala tea and salty snacks to afternoon visitors or to learn to cook the dishes her husband likes.
Most evenings, she and Vinit, who now works at a hedge fund, have dinner with his parents, then retire to the apartment his mother redecorated in soft greens, with a small shrine in a kitchen cabinet stocked with incense, a prayer scroll and a Jain painting. When they go out, they seem like any other young couple newly in love -- teasing, holding hands, sharing food from each other's plates.
Vinit's mother declares that she has found a new daughter in Anshu. And she loves having her son and his wife so close by.
"I've told Vinit," she said, " 'Living with you is the happiest thing that can happen to me in my life. But I'm not going to blackmail you for your presence. It has to be your and Anshu's decision.' "
Anshu seems to have slipped easily into the life of her new family. Which is not to say that there haven't been some adjustments. The new Mrs. Sethi sometimes finds herself caught between the different expectations of her mother-in-law and her husband.
There is, for example, the question of what she wears. Mrs. Sethi has insisted that when Anshu is at home, she wear a salwar kameez, a long flowing tunic over pants -- no jeans or Western attire. "I have many friends in the building," the mother-in-law explained. "The Rawats and Jhalanis, those ladies all wear saris and so do their daughters-in-law. Salwars are one step more casual than saris."
Vinit has conceded defeat.
"It's law," he said. "The jurisdiction of Shashi Sethi decides Anshu will wear salwars in the house."
He and his mother have also differed over Anshu's education. Anshu had already graduated from a college in India, but Vinit felt strongly that she should begin earning an American degree soon after the wedding. His mother, though, was cautious about moving the young woman too far, too fast. In the spring, Mrs. Sethi still felt she needed to accompany her daughter-in-law whenever she left the house.
"Vinit has to take an interest in her growing up, expanding her horizons," his mother said. "I also don't want her to limit herself just to the house. But right now, I'm not ready for her to go alone in New York City. She seems like a foreigner, not because of dress, but because there is a look of curiosity on her face that makes her vulnerable."
Anshu herself was torn. Her parents in Hyderabad had warned her, she said, that the issue should not become "an object of my mother-in-law's discontent with me."
The push-and-pull of the joint family, though, has had a happy outcome in this case. Anshu has applied to college for the fall. She is now venturing out on her own to the placement tests and interviews.
"Mummyji supports it now," she said.
The newlyweds plan to have children in a few years, and have already decided they will speak Hindi to them. Like his parents before them, Vinit and Anshu will fly often to India to see her family and his, propelling their children into the back-and-forth life that knits India and America together.

HEADLINE: CONNECTIONS;
Cultural Modernity and Its Gifts of Grace and Struggle

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
"This is a precious piece of Chinese culture," proclaimed the Shanghai Cultural Minister, Ma Bomin , of the opera "The Peony Pavilion," before preventing it from traveling to the Lincoln Center Festival. She accused the production of distorting the 500-year-old work by displaying a skewed vision of China and grafting on to it "pornographic" elements. The implication? That it was sullied by an American perspective.
Her fears are not solely those of a society unused to democratic cultural exchange. Just a few weeks ago, in Canada, an international meeting of culture ministers discussed ways of protecting their own cultures from an onslaught of American cultural commerce. A United States representative was pointedly not invited. 
 This idea has even been raised within the United States, as one minority culture after another has self-consciously staked claims of cultural autonomy. When a prehistoric skeleton was discovered in Washington State in 1996, scientific research was halted after an Indian tribe claimed legal rights to what it called the ancestral bones. Nearly every minority culture wants just such authority to assert possession of its past and the right to judge itself in the present.
This new notion of "cultural property" will be the subject of a conference next spring at the Columbia University School of Journalism. Cultural property is more than objects like the Elgin marbles that were taken from Athens to London, or the Egyptian treasures found in every major world museum. The property is also insubstantial. It is a set of ideas, attitudes, styles. It is what makes a culture seem distinct and autonomous. And it is felt to be at risk.
In the midst of all this, so much cultural resentment is aimed at the United States partly because American pop culture has become the dominant world culture, providing the only experiences shared by both Bedouins in the Sinai and plastic surgeons in Rio. That fact became an accusation -- and a very explicit one -- in 1982, when Jack Lang, then the French Culture Minister, denounced American "cultural imperialism" with its attempts to "grab consciousness, ways of thinking, ways of living." The language may be more decorous today, but the ideas are the same.
Is it really a helpful metaphor: treating cultural influence as if it were imperialist conquest? Cultures are always permeable, always evolving. Even warfare changes the cultures of both sides. In 1830, Goethe wrote that, after battles, nations "could not return to their settled and independent life again without noticing that they had learned many foreign ideas and ways, which they had unconsciously adopted, and come to feel, here and there, previously unrecognized spiritual and intellectual needs."
What previously happened through warfare now takes place through travel and television. In fact, it might have nothing to do with exploitation of cultural property.
Cultural influence has become almost dizzying. One form of African pop music, juju, arose out of the influence of American pop, developed a distinctive style, then returned to the United States as an import. The Shanghai Culture Minister claimed a sacral quality for "The Peony Pavilion." But that had less to do with its courtly Chinese origins than with 19th-century European esthetics: "This is about art," she said, "and the debate should remain about art." All this, just a little more than 30 years after the Chinese Communists, importing a 19th-century political ideology, demolished centuries of native artworks in the name of progress. The web of cultural interaction has touched every society, often in bizarre ways.
Goethe had it right. The spread of culture has been spurred not just by war but by the awakening of needs: spiritual, intellectual and even material. Cultural change does not fit the imperialist model. In fact, imperialism is now being reinterpreted according to cultural models. In one recent book, "The Wealth and Poverty of Nations" (W. W. Norton ), the historian David S. Landes argues that the military and economic dominance of the West in the last 500 years was due to crucial cultural achievements.
A thousand years ago Europe was a cultural and military backwater. Then came the separation of church and state, the development of semi-autonomous cities, the invention of printing, a tradition of rational investigation in philosophy and science and the creation of such apparently trivial objects as eyeglasses and the mechanical clock. These changes, some almost accidental, affected military technology and navigational skills, creating abilities that were nearly unique. Which is why the Incas (no strangers to warfare) weren't able to march into Madrid to massacre Spaniards, and why 18th-century Egyptians (no strangers to plunder) never strip-mined the graves of Westminster Abbey.
It is also why advances in science and medicine and notions of human rights and liberty evolved in the West, eventually creating something that has been called "modernity." Modernity has been powerful not just because of its association with earthly and military power, but because it has awakened "unrecognized needs" for political freedom as well as material goods, while providing the ability to satisfy some of them. Modernity does not recognize cultural property or cultural difference; it claims a transcendent vision. This is its threat as well as its promise.
One reason we are said to live in a post-modern era is that the claims of modernity are being challenged in worldwide culture wars. Is there any vision of the world that is transcendent or universal? Or has each culture built its own equally valid forms of authority? Nationalism rages in face of the modern. If, as modernity asserts, we are all equal, then how are we all different? And what will happen when such questions are tested in a united Europe, the region where most of these ideas began their pilgrimages?
The convulsive struggles, ranging from debates over multiculturalism to confrontations over "The Peony Pavilion," are not the result of imperialism; imperialism was an anticipation of these struggles. And now that American popular culture has become dominant, it is at the center of the fight. It is vulgar in the oldest sense: made for the broadest number of people. It has also created entertainments in film and music that tap into popular feelings about these very issues. These entertainments promise the satisfaction of desire but warn of its fulfillment; they offer paeans to both possession and dispossession, and provide visions of both material plenty and material disaster. At once they celebrate ethnic difference and cultivate shared experience. This is not conquest. It is not theft of cultural property. It's modernity at play.

HEADLINE: Testing to Begin on System to Fight 'Spam'

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 19

 BODY:
A company with perhaps the most ambitious commercial attempt yet to combat junk E-mail plans to announce on Monday that it has begun distributing a test version of its system, which is intended to intercept unwanted messages as they travel through the Internet.
The system has been designed by Bright Light Technologies Inc., a well-financed start-up company based here, which has already won contracts with four major Internet service providers including AT&T Worldnet, Earthlink Networks, Concentric Networks and USA.net. 
 Junk E-mail, often known as spam, is seen as a growing problem by the nation's Internet service providers because of the burden it places on computer disks, network capacity and the staff time of network operators. At some networks the volume of spam, which consists of commercial solicitations ranging from get-rich-quick schemes to pointers to pornographic sites on the World Wide Web, sometimes exceeds 50 percent of all electronic mail.
But spam is also reviled by many Internet users as well.
"Most commercial solicitations are viewed as an unwanted nuisance," said Don Schutt, vice president of consumer advocacy at Concentric Networks Inc., a network services company based in Cupertino, Calif. "But when parents see that their children are receiving unwanted pornographic messages, they go ballistic."
Indeed, Bright Light's founder, Sunil Paul, said that his inspiration for the company came when his wife expressed shock at receiving an unsolicited pornographic message.
Finding a solution to the problem of spam was a vital concern, he said, because many businesses are now beginning to run on electronic mail and cannot afford the clutter and distractions posed by spam.
Mr. Paul, a co-founder and former executive of Freeloader, an Internet software company, as well as a former executive at America Online., said his new company had raised $5.5 million in venture capital backing from Accel Partners and individual investors who include the author and newsletter publisher Esther Dyson and Benjamin Rosen, the chairman of Compaq Computer.
The company, which also has a strategic alliance with Sendmail Inc., which developed and supports the most widely used software for routing E-mail over the Internet, has built a tracking system that will detect spam sent to special decoy addresses established for that purpose. All other copies of those messages can then be blocked with a "spam wall" that will be installed on the mail-server computers of Internet service providers and corporate users.
Bright Light also has a technology alliance with Software.com, a software developer focusing on electronic mail systems for large Internet providers.
There are currently a number of other technology-based efforts under way to combat spam, including special filtering features in the Sendmail server and a blocking service maintained by a group of volunteers known as the Black Hole List. But spam presents service providers with thorny problems, including the problem of "false positives" -- mail blocked because it seems to be spam but actually is not.
To avoid this problem, the heart of the Bright Light system is a monitoring center where human operators assess messages that have been trapped by the decoy E-mail addresses. But Mr. Paul acknowledged that even the most sophisticated filtering system will fail to stop all spam, as spammers learn to adopt to the new countermeasures.
One big problem in combating spam is is that the cost of sending spam is remarkably low. Spammers can go into operation by purchasing a piece of software that costs as little as several hundred dollars and then purchasing lists of E-mail addresses that are also inexpensive.
The Bright Light system will permit network operators to let users choose whether they want the spam filter on or off or set to filter only certain categories of spam.
Testing of the Bright Light system is scheduled to begin on Monday, with an eye toward commercial operation by the end of the year.
Mr. Paul said Bright Light will produce a spam index to help gather better statistics on the actual network impact of junk E-mail. The company also plans to post a spam "calculator" on its Web site (www.brightlight.com), which will enable Internet users to compute an economic cost of spam, based on the assumptions they enter.
Several states have passed laws outlawing spam and there at least six bills pending in Congress attempting to control junk E-mail.
Still, most industry executives involved with fighting spam say a combined legislative and technology solution is needed. "The best enforcers of this are the people who are harmed, the consumer and the I.S.P.," said Ray Everett-Church, cofounder of the Coalition Against Commercial and Unsolicited E-mail.

HEADLINE: Debate Grows Over the Role An Operating System Plays

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Ask 10 computer scientists to state which features define an operating system, and you will probably get 10 different answers. Ask what those features will be four years from now, and the responses will range from some vague variation on the status quo to visions of vast, potent networks that empower individual computers with a sort of communal energy.
Asking such questions is not an academic exercise. The nature of the operating system, the master program that breathes life into computer hardware, is at the heart of the Justice Department's lawsuit accusing the Microsoft Corporation of antitrust violations. And yet, just last week, Sun Microsystems Inc. announced a product called Jini that is designed to negate the need for Microsoft's Windows and other operating systems used today. 
 Whether Sun's approach catches on, whether Microsoft can prevail in both the marketplace and the courtroom or whether software takes some other, unexpected evolutionary leap, it is clear that the technology is now moving too fast for anyone to predict the future of the operating system.
In a way, the judicial system versus the operating system is a mismatch. One of the slipperiest challenges facing Government lawyers is that no one, jurist or engineer, can say with any certainty which features belong in an operating system and which do not. At the same time, the Government learned a hard lesson in its 13-year antitrust case against the International Business Machines Corporation in the 1970's and early 1980's. Even then, the gears of the digital revolution were turning faster than the wheels of justice. The Government eventually abandoned its case, acknowledging that whatever their original merits, the charges had become "technologically irrelevant."
Those were days of relatively slow development of computer technology. In contrast, Sun's announcement of Jini suggests that the current pace of change could leave the legal system performing surgery on a beast that evolves from one species to another on the operating table.
Employing a concept known as distributed computing, Jini redefines the computer, its peripherals and other gadgets as a community of devices functioning together within a dynamic network as a single virtual machine. Microsoft is known to be developing a similar concept that it calls Millennium. Before distributed computing can make operating systems like Microsoft's Windows, Apple's Macintosh OS and the various flavors of Unix obsolete, however, wireless networks will have to evolve to a quality and price that makes connectivity ubiquitous.
That is likely to take several years. For the time being, the only link between a processor and everything else that goes inside and outside the box we think of as a computer is the operating system. And the question of which functions belong within the master program and which belong in independent applications software is a matter of debate.
"The problem is there is no clear line to draw," said Patrick Bridges, a doctoral student in computer science at the University of Arizona who runs a Web site about operating systems. Some, he said, stick to very basic functions while others are more all-encompassing.
Windows is of the all-encompassing variety. Its ancestor, the original MS-DOS used in the first I.B.M. PC in 1981, was basic. It did little more than control the keyboard, monitor and floppy-disk drives. Indeed, DOS is an acronym for disk operating system. It could be stored on a single 360,000-byte floppy disk.
As hardware evolved, Microsoft added support for hard-disk drives, CD-ROMs, audio, video, networking, type fonts, fax modems, Internet browsing and a host of other new technologies, usually at no additional cost to the consumer. Windows 98, which went on sale in June, contains 13 million lines of code and requires up to 295 million bytes to store.
Much of that inflation can be laid to the evolution of the operating system from an inward to an outward orientation. Where DOS was manipulated by typing arcane commands on an almost empty screen, Windows, like the Macintosh and other graphical operating systems, now controls almost every aspect of a user's experience with the computer.
Manipulating the user's very perception of what a computer is and does has become key to Microsoft -- and alarming to competitors and the Justice Department's antitrust division -- because for more than 90 percent of the people who buy computers today, Windows is the gateway to an explosion of electronic commerce on the Internet.
Microsoft argues that integrating the Internet into Windows benefits users and that at any rate, it has the right to innovate. Indeed, as each new version of the operating system has been introduced, Microsoft has come under fire from the trade press and consumers for its failure to incorporate one or another feature.
The Internet, Microsoft says, is becoming such a fundamental part of computer use that access to it should be part of the operating system, just as other types of networking already are.
But the Justice Department and Microsoft's critics say that Windows has an insatiable appetite for functions and features that used to be provided by separate programs and other companies. The result, they argue, is a stifling of innovation and competition.
The main focus of the Government's suit is Microsoft's inclusion in Windows of its Internet Explorer browser for navigating the World Wide Web, to the detriment of its rival in the browser market, the Netscape Communications Corporation. But there is also concern about Microsoft's linking of the opening screen in Windows to Internet sites and services that are owned either by Microsoft or by companies that pay Microsoft fees for this blue-chip real estate.
From a traditional computer science point of view, the issue seems simple: The operating system is software that is basic to running the computer and is needed by virtually all users; an application is software that performs a particular function and is needed by only some users -- for example, a program simulating airflow over a wing, an accounting program or a spreadsheet or word-processing program.
The two types of software have a symbiotic relationship. Without an operating system (and, indeed, the earliest computers in the 1950's did not have them), each program would have to include its own instructions for such mundane tasks as finding a spot on the disk to store information. The operating system frees programmers who develop applications from having to reinvent the wheel.
Operating systems began to be more concerned with the user experience when Apple executives discovered the work of researchers at the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1980's. Apple first imitated Xerox's "graphical user interface," which allows the machine to be controlled using windows, a mouse and pop-down menus, on its ill-fated Lisa. But with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, the graphical interface became the standard for personal computing.
But that does not mean that it is always an integral part of the operating system; it can also be a sort of digital facade, or shell. For example, users of Unix, an operating system used in engineering workstations and bigger machines, have a choice of several user interfaces.
At one time, Windows was also a shell bolted onto MS-DOS, and there were several other windowing shells from which to choose. With the introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft fully integrated the graphical interface with the underlying operating system, so that today it is impossible to distinguish between the user's experience and the machine's function.
As has been the case with the Macintosh from the beginning, Windows takes responsibility for the basic look and feel of the application programs that run on it. Without this kind of standardization, users would have to spend a much longer time learning how to operate each program. Microsoft argues that as technology evolves, once-specialized functions become essential and should be part of the operating system. While this can kill the market for some kinds of software, it also makes the development of other kinds faster and easier.
"There are times when we add services to the operating system and somebody has to shift their business as a consequence," Brad Chase, marketing vice president for Windows at Microsoft, said. "But it's trivial compared to the opportunity it's created for the industry and customers."
Even some competitors say this process is inevitable.
"If you focus on the things Microsoft's not doing there's plenty of opportunity," said Enrique Salem, chief technical officer for the Symantec Corporation, which provides software that extends the functionality of the operating system. Many of the improvements Symantec sold for Windows 3.1 were incorporated by Microsoft into Windows 95.
And even Gary L. Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has been a leader in challenging the practices of Microsoft, said the emphasis on keeping the browser out of the operating system is "in many ways the weakest part of the Government's case." Rather, Mr. Reback said, the Government should promote competition by breaking up the software giant. "I don't want to be in a position to decide what goes in or out" of an operating system, he said. "The market should do it."

HEADLINE: The Concert Juggernaut;
How One Company Is Transforming the Live Entertainment Industry

BYLINE: By By NEIL STRAUSS and JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 19

 BODY:
Over the past year and a half, the rock and pop concert business has quietly gone through the biggest transformation in its history.
The business, the last stronghold of independence in a rapidly consolidating entertainment industry, has long been a world of self-made and often ruthless local moguls, many of whom have held sway as music promoters since the days of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. But with the sudden arrival of a deep-pocketed, publicly traded company called SFX Entertainment, the business in the United States has begun to go the way of the movie, television and recording industries, and is fast becoming consolidated under the aegis of a sprawling corporate conglomerate. 
 Early last year, Robert F.X. Sillerman, a New York-based entrepreneur who controls SFX and made a fortune buying and selling radio stations, began a $1 billion binge of acquisitions. He snapped up a dozen of the country's largest regional music promoters, giving him control of more than half the national market, including concerts by acts ranging from the Eagles to the Spice Girls. He further consolidated his power by buying amphitheaters, tour-promotion rights, ticketing companies and artist-management agencies. Though other companies, like Universal Concerts, have taken steps toward centralizing and consolidating the concert business, none have operated on this scale.
The aim, SFX officials have said, is to revolutionize an inefficient and fragmented business, making it significantly more profitable. But many in the $1 billion-a-year industry feel threatened by this outsider and doubt its long-term intentions.
"There's this big gorilla in the living room, and everyone's wondering whether it's a friendly one or a dangerous one," said Alex Kochan, president of Artists and Audience, a concert-booking agency not owned by SFX.
For concertgoers, the emergence of this corporate giant is likely to affect where, when and under what circumstances concerts around the country are presented. For example, SFX wants to shift even more concerts into the summer and use a battery of revenue-enhancement schemes. These include a greatly expanded role for corporate advertisers at concerts and increasing tiered ticket pricing, which means choice seats would cost more while less desirable seats could cost less. (The average price of tickets is estimated at $35 to $45.)
Wall Street has responded positively, counting on SFX to bring efficiencies to the business. But critics, from competitors to heads of companies bought by SFX, wonder whether the discipline of Wall Street can be brought to an industry where a musician's health, a wet summer, a fickle audience or a band's sudden creative slump can wipe out a season. They question whether the focus on quarterly earnings rather than artistic development will stifle lesser-known bands.
And they fear that the old ways of working -- in which a band hires a booking agent to arrange shows either with in-house promoters or with independent promoters who in turn deal with concert halls in their regions -- will be eliminated, and that SFX's unprecedented national reach will give it extraordinary leverage in an already hard-edged business. This summer, concerns like these have sparked a kind of civil war in the concert business.
The scope of the company is enormous. SFX controls concert halls in 22 of the nation's top 50 markets, and has said it planned to operate stages in all 50. Among those it controls in the New York City area are the Jones Beach Marine Amphitheater on Long Island, the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., and the Roseland Ballroom and Irving Plaza in Manhattan. Mr. Sillerman said more acquisitions would be announced this week.
And music is only a part of its reach. This year, SFX spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying one of the country's top sports agencies, Falk Associates Management Enterprises (FAME), which represents Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, and another company, Pace Entertainment Corporation, the top producer of touring theatrical shows and a presenter of auto races and music. Last year, according to SFX, 27 million people attended 9,600 events arranged by the companies it has acquired.
"This is lightning in a bottle," Mr. Sillerman, 50, said in a interview. He added, "It's clear that because of what we're doing, the playing field is not what it was."
Mr. Sillerman has amassed $606 million in debt, a massive sum for this business, and has yet to turn a net profit. He has also paid large sums for his acquisitions. For instance, FAME, which had roughly $11 million in revenues last year, cost $120 million.
But he said the company would soon reverse its losses and that the bulk of future profits would not come from tickets but from advertisers. As in radio and television commercials, SFX intends to sell major advertisers access to neatly segmented, demographically desirable concert audiences. The company has said there would be far more corporate sponsorships of tours, the potential introduction of luxury boxes at amphitheaters and a barrage of advertising at events.
This has already happened to some degree, even in non-SFX tours; Sprint, for example, sponsored last year's Rolling Stones tour and Citibank sponsored a recent Elton John tour. But SFX says it intends to accelerate the trend, despite the fact that many rock acts and audiences have prided themselves on antiestablishment views.
In a recent enthusiastic report on SFX, Goldman Sachs & Company analysts stated: "It is virtually impossible for an artist to tour the United States without playing in an SFX venue. SFX has, in essence, become the gatekeeper for outdoor music concerts." The report estimated that SFX's revenues from sponsorship and advertising alone would increase 50 percent, to $60 million next year.
So far, investors have supported SFX even though a number of its tours this summer have suffered from lackluster ticket sales. SFX and its newly acquired businesses had revenues of $828 million in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. After having to make $52.4 million in interest payments on its debt, SFX reported a net loss of $30 million. Nevertheless, SFX stock, which traded in the mid 20's in early May, has soared since and closed last week at $55.
 
The Company's Goal: 'One-Stop Shopping'
Marketing experts said it was unclear whether companies would meet SFX's expectations by pouring more into advertising at live events, even though it would be easier to do under a centralized company.
"What they are attempting to do in this agglomeration of assets is to have one-stop shopping," said Jay Coleman, founder and chief executive of the Entertainment Marketing Company International, a leader in bringing corporate sponsors to entertainment events. "On the surface, that makes sense. In practice, it's not an easy task. First of all, there are a very limited number of advertisers who will do music. And only a tiny handful of tours are of interest to corporate advertisers."
Mr. Coleman added, "It's an interesting marketing idea, but very difficult."
Mr. Sillerman said his acquisition of FAME could help him with this problem. David Falk, founder and chairman of FAME, said companies that wanted to sponsor his athletes could be urged to sponsor concerts as well. "This gives us more cachet and more muscle in the market," he said. But he added: "You have to be judicious about how you use the muscle. You don't want to be heavy-handed."
Yet the concert business has long been seen as heavy-handed. Traditionally, promoter tactics like screaming violent threats at concert-hall owners and calling the fire department on rival clubs were common.
"I was sort of astounded at the old-line acerbic nature of some of the relationships," Mr. Sillerman said. "It did keep us away from the business for a while."
Since SFX has grown, a number of rivals have privately accused its promoters of strong-arming shows away from them. SFX promoters have denied the accusations.
One recent controversy involved the country singer Shania Twain. Four people at different companies working on her tour, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of other business relationships with SFX, said the following events unfolded: Delsener/Slater Enterprises, an SFX-owned Manhattan promoter, tried to coax Ms. Twain's management company to place her concert in an amphitheater that SFX owns, the Meadows Music Theater in Hartford, rather than a competing location, the Pepsi Arena in Albany. When that bid failed and the Pepsi Arena booked the show for Aug. 17, Delsener/Slater asked for a share in concert revenue as a co-promoter. In the process, the account went, Delsener/Slater threatened to divert all SFX-owned tours from the Albany arena if it could not promote the concert. The loss of a concert or two can mean a major dent in profits in a business in which most income is derived from just a few popular bands.
In the end, SFX was not given a piece of the show, and does not appear to have carried through on the reported threats. Several people who were involved in the negotiations said Ms. Twain's manager, Jon Landau, who also manages Bruce Springsteen, stood by them, which gave them more power to resist the pressure. Mr. Landau refused to comment.
A spokesman for Delsener/Slater denied using such threats, but declined to be quoted further about the incident. Mr. Sillerman said he was unaware of the accusations involving the Twain concert. "It wouldn't surprise me if that kind of stuff still goes on," Mr. Sillerman continued. "But that's not my approach."
Still, the size and power of the company has left industry competitors wary. Two said they had been interviewed informally by a Justice Department lawyer about SFX's effect on the industry. It is not known what prompted these interviews and the department would not comment on whether there was any inquiry.
 
Overcoming Suspicions Of Artists and Managers
Mr. Sillerman scoffed at the suggestion that the company had violated any antitrust law and said he had heard nothing about Government activity.
Some critics aren't sure SFX will be able to win over artists and managers, who typically make deals with promoters only on a per-show or, in a few cases, on a per-tour basis. With competition between promoters, bands negotiate 75 to 90 percent of a concert's profits for themselves, leaving the rest for the promoter. The more hegemony SFX has, the more it can adjust this percentage in its favor, cutting into band earnings. But bands may also benefit from increased corporate advertising.
"Artists and their managers and agents are suspicious of any one company having too much control," said John Scher, the president of Metropolitan Entertainment Group, a New York promoter and Delsener/ Slater's chief competitor. "It seems like their whole business model depends on everyone being willing to work for SFX, and it's not clear they will."
Artists and their managers are beginning to be aware of SFX. "Am I part of that?" said the heavy-metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, when asked about the company, which is involved in many of the stops on this summer's Ozzfest tour. "What's happening now is all these big IBM-type companies are moving in and their people come along to the door and tell you what you can and can't do. Forget it. If that's the way it is, I'll do it on my own."
Meanwhile, SFX's critics have been at war with the company this summer. Several major tours, including Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Eric Clapton and Van Halen, are being booked into mostly indoor arenas not affiliated with SFX. It is no coincidence, several people said, that all these acts are represented by Creative Artists Agency, a giant talent agency whose music head, Tom Ross, has been one of SFX's most fervent opponents.
So far, most tours that SFX has bought into have not been faring well. The SFX acts of Michael Crawford, and the double bills of Chicago and Hall & Oates, and Wynonna and Michael Bolton have played to halls a quarter sold or less on some occasions, while the Pretenders, the Horde tour and Stevie Nicks and Boz Scaggs, have not fared much better. Other tours that SFX has a stake in have been huge successes, including George Strait's country music festival and the Spice Girls, despite the departure of Geri Halliwell from the group.
Mr. Sillerman said that while some concerts might not be as profitable as hoped, overall ticket sales were strong, and new advertising revenues were starting to come in.
"Early indications are we have underestimated" profits, Mr. Sillerman said. "In the third quarter, we'll be able to announce not a belief, but tangible proof that this works."
He said he knew little about the concert industry when he acquired his first promoter, Delsener/Slater. But once he surveyed the business, he said, he became convinced that it was fragmented and ripe for consolidation, like the radio industry a decade ago.
Last year Mr. Sillerman made a financial killing when he sold SFX Broadcasting, which he had formed from a group of small radio stations across the country. The buyer was an investment company, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, and the price $2.1 billion. Some analysts have predicted that with SFX Entertainment, Mr. Sillerman is, once again, just building a business that he will turn around and sell in a few years for a big profit.
"Do leopards change their spots? No," said Harry J. De Mott 3d, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston who has followed Mr. Sillerman's companies. "It's a time in the economic cycle when people are feeling good and they're willing to spend more money on live entertainment. Bob is taking advantage of that, and I expect that when he produces something of great value he could well sell it."
Mr. Sillerman, who owns 15 percent of SFX, dismissed that notion.
However long Mr. Sillerman remains in the concert business, his arrival has shaken up the industry in a way it will probably never recover from. While many are scared, others are surprised it took so long. Some compare this moment in the evolution of the concert business to the history of the record business, in which many small labels have been bought and consolidated by multinational corporations.
"If you look at the entertainment business as a whole," said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of Pollstar, a concert-industry trade magazine, "the concert business was the last element that was still run by these independent entrepreneurs. So maybe it was inevitable."

HEADLINE: A Man With a Plan? Japanese Prefer Premiers Who Speak Softly and Hold a Lot of Meetings

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 17

 BODY:
As Washington yearns for a forceful new Prime Minister to emerge in Japan and take charge of the economy, history suggests that is not very likely.
Over the decades and centuries, Japan has had good rulers and bad rulers, but only rarely has it had a strong leader. The last leader who really reshaped Japan was arguably Ieyasu Tokugawa, who lived four centuries ago. 
 Even many Japanese speak wistfully of the need for a bold leader who could force through measures to revive the economy, end fears of a Japanese recession setting off a global downturn and restore the nation's self-confidence. But most also say that is simply not how this country works.
As the elders of the Liberal Democratic Party bargain furiously among themselves to choose a new Prime Minister to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned last Monday after the party's disastrous performance in parliamentary elections, the leading candidate is Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi.
Mr. Obuchi, a humble, graying man, is widely regarded as an extremely nice and sincere man who has managed to leave no fingerprints on his country's policies during 35 years in Parliament.
In any case, whoever is chosen seems likely to be another in the line of colorless Prime Ministers who have presided in recent years and left little impression on the world or their own country. Other societies around Japan -- China, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines -- have frequently produced vigorous rulers tugging their people this way or that, but not Japan.
"Japan remains a consensus society," said Yoshio Hatano, a former representative to the United Nations. "We may have had strong leaders in the past in some cases -- I can think of a couple -- but they were not very successful. The consensus makers were rather more successful as Prime Ministers."
Early in his career, Mr. Hatano was an assistant to postwar Japan's strongest Prime Minister, Shigeru Yoshida, who governed during most of the period from 1946 to 1954. But Mr. Hatano and others say Mr. Yoshida was an exceptional figure whose authority was possible only in the special circumstances after World War II.
These days, Mr. Hatano says, a strong leader like Mr. Yoshida would never rise to Prime Minister or last long if he did. Forceful politicians in Japan often irritate voters as well as bureaucrats and their colleagues, the argument goes, so that in the end they are unlikely to rise to the top and unlikely to accomplish much if they do.
American officials have been extremely frustrated with Prime Minister Hashimoto and his Cabinet for failing to act decisively while Japan tumbled into a slump that is creating havoc around Asia.
But Mr. Hashimoto and his Cabinet were simply doing what Japanese leaders always do: holding endless meetings and discussing alternatives and hashing out a course of action that has general support.
Indeed, there is some evidence that in the Japanese political culture, that process may be more effective than American-style arm-twisting or grandstanding. While Mr. Hashimoto was mocked in the West for a lack of leadership because he never seemed able to get anything done, by some accounts his problem was that he was too much of a leader for Japanese society: he annoyed people and therefore could not get their cooperation to carry out policies.
"One reason why Hashimoto was not so liked in the party or outside it was that he didn't listen enough," mused one senior Government official. "When we went to brief him, he was argumentative and said things like, 'I think you're wrong.' "
Speaking of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who retains far-reaching influence, the official added: "But when we saw Takeshita, he would say: 'Thank you very much. That's so helpful.' Then the bureaucrats feel satisfied and they give Takeshita full cooperation."
Likewise, one rare instance when Japanese Government officials acted decisively without worrying about building a consensus was the announcement in 1966 of a plan to build a new international airport at Narita, near Tokyo.
Farmers who owned the land were outraged at the Government's failure to consult with them ahead of time, and 32 years later, after constant battles and huge expenses, the Government still has not been able to pry them from the land and complete the airport's second runway.
One of the few postwar Prime Ministers other than Mr. Yoshida who was a strong and forceful leader was Yasuhiro Nakasone, who governed from 1982 to 1987, although his strength was more visible in his style than in any results he achieved. Mr. Nakasone was quite popular among Americans, but he remains disliked by many Japanese, who criticize him as pushy, arrogant and self-centered.
Likewise, in recent years one of the most forceful and visionary politicians has been Ichiro Ozawa, now leader of the Liberal Party. Mr. Ozawa has been widely hailed in the United States as a symbol of a new breed of Japanese leader. But within Japan he has very little support.
"There must be something about the Japanese character that dislikes explicit displays of power," mused Takashi Oka, a former aide to Mr. Ozawa who is now writing a book about the travails of the reform movement in Japan. "You don't have real political leadership here."
Much the same thing is true of modern Japanese history. In the late 16th century there were several strong leaders, the last of whom, Ieyasu, established the Tokugawa shogunate.
But since then, even when Japan has undergone revolutionary change, there has been no single person leading the way.
The modernization of Japan a century ago was a result of the efforts of many people. Likewise, while Americans often blame Hideki Tojo, the wartime Prime Minister, for Japanese militarism, Tojo was far less powerful than Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin or Hitler, and in fact he was dismissed in 1944 after just two and a half years as Prime Minister.
In the postwar period, one reason for the lack of strong leaders may simply have been that politics has not mattered so much. Economic policy was largely left to bureaucrats, and in foreign and defense policy Tokyo deferred to Washington, so politicians busied themselves less with policy than with arranging pork barrel projects.
The natural place for politicians to develop their leadership skills in a parliamentary system is the Cabinet. But in Japan, Cabinet ministers are mostly rubber stamps who are not really expected to do anything but back up the ministry's bureaucrats in Parliament.
Even more than Prime Ministers, the Cabinet members are figureheads whose only preparation is years of political machinations building seniority in Parliament. That leaves them unprepared to take charge of their ministries.
"It's terribly hard for them to manage the job they are given," said Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Prime Minister who is unusual in that he has unquestioned expertise in economic issues. "Their basic knowledge is inadequate, I would say, to carry out day-to-day duties as Cabinet ministers."
One result of this system, said Hirona Seki, a historian of ideas and prolific author, is that Japan has an understanding of political power and division of spoils, but no concept of a politician as a moral leader.
American politicians can hardly debate a topic without discussing it in terms of moral right or wrong, and historically even arguments over segregation or war or the gold standard have tended to be couched in moral terms, sometimes with each side invoking God's support against the other.
This is certainly a contrast with Japan, where mainstream politicians mostly describe policies as wise or foolish but not as moral or immoral.
"Moral leadership is a very hard thing for Japan to understand," Mr. Seki said.
"In Japan we don't have this religious tradition," he added, arguing that Western concepts of leadership are rooted in a Judeo-Christian tradition of not just adopting the best policy but also of doing the right thing.
"If we are to establish political leadership, we must learn a new tradition," he said.
Many Japanese also argue that although their system is perilously slow in reaching decisions during a crisis, it is very rapid in carrying out decisions. They say that by the time the decision is reached, a consensus has been formed and everyone is wholeheartedly behind it.
Still, there seems to be a growing feeling that Japan needs stronger leaders who devote more efforts to communicating with the public.
"The Japanese Prime Minister should be a better communicator to the public and to the world, as your Presidents usually are," said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a prominent Liberal Democratic member of Parliament.
In explaining the emphasis on cooperation and the distaste for strong leadership, many Japanese turn to pop psychology. Some say that in contrast to Western countries rooted in a tradition of hunting, Japan has always been a rice-growing nation of farmers working together, so that forcefulness is looked down on.
That image is not very convincing to Asian countries that were invaded by gun-toting Japanese rice farmers during World War II. But it is deeply felt in Japan, and it is true that Japanese society is almost obsessed with harmony.

HEADLINE: After Rejection By Parliament, Yeltsin Decrees Fiscal Reforms

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 19

 BODY:
Stung by his Parliament's rejection of tax-and-spending reforms widely seen as the only way out of Russia's fiscal tailspin, President Boris N. Yeltsin did this weekend what he had long threatened: He decreed reforms on his own.
He had little choice. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund will meet to decide whether to lend Russia $5.6 billion to build up the depleted reserves of its central bank. The money is regarded as crucial to stabilizing the value of the ruble and calming panicky foreign investors. 
 The money is part of a package of old and new international loans that totals $22.6 billion. The fund has demanded that Russia restructure its tax code, cut Government spending and take several other fiscal actions as a condition for getting the money.
Over the weekend, Mr. Yeltsin signed measures that will quadruple the tax on most land, allow producers of precious metals to export their products directly and regulate alcohol production and sales more tightly. He also vetoed two laws passed by Parliament, involving profits and excise taxes, that would have lowered tax revenues by billions of rubles.
Taken together, the actions will make up about $7.7 billion of the $12.6 billion or so in revenues lost because the Russian Parliament has refused to enact parts of the Government's fiscal package, officials in Mr. Yeltsin's office said.
Mr. Yeltsin has come in for some criticism that his refusal to abide by Parliament's actions is dictatorial. Oddly enough, however, even Communists in the legislature who played a major role in torpedoing parts of the fiscal package have praised his decision -- in part, perhaps, because they fix responsibility for unpopular measures on the President.
The I.M.F. has not made public the requirements it has set for approval of the loan on Monday. Today, Mr. Yeltsin's chief negotiator with the I.M.F., Anatoly B. Chubais, said that the fund's officials had taken Parliament's obstinacy hard, and that efforts to persuade them to proceed with the loans have been difficult.
But Western financial experts here and in London said today that it was highly unlikely that the first segment of the loan package would be rejected at this late date, especially in light of the fact that Mr. Yeltsin's Government is committed to the changes.
Rejecting the loan would also cast a shadow over the planned visit to Moscow this week by Vice President Al Gore. Last month Mr. Yeltsin sent Parliament 25 proposals to revamp the Government's fiscal structure, but only 14 had been passed when Parliament recessed on Friday; six were rejected.
In Washington, I.M.F. officials said today that they were still reviewing the Parliament's actions and Mr. Yeltsin's decrees in an effort to determine how close they came to fulfilling Russia's obligations. It is possible, the officials said, that the fund will trim back the first installment of its payment to Russia.
Among the most important laws passed were measures rewriting the tax code, regulating alcohol production and enacting a 5 percent sales tax and a minimum tax for small businesses.
In an interview today on the Russian television network NTV, Mr. Chubais said the money would only buy time for Russia's Government to get its house in order. "Only Russia's state power can solve these problems -- nobody else," he said. "We have bought time, which can be wasted together with the money we have borrowed, or we can use it to carry out the work we need to do."

HEADLINE: Europe, Bucking Trend in U.S., Blocks Genetically Altered Food

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: DALLIKON, Switzerland

 BODY:
Like his father and grandfather before him, Kaspar Gunthardt is a man of the soil. He lives in the solid old farmhouse where he was born and he has worked the rich earth around it for most of his 52 years.
He is a traditionalist who has nevertheless embraced the future. Mr. Gunthardt owns a sophisticated cooling system for storing dairy products. He recycles waste to fuel his farm, and cameras strapped to beams in his barn are connected to the Internet, putting the personal habits of his cattle on worldwide display (http://naturaplan.coop.ch). 
 But when it comes to playing with the rules of nature Mr. Gunthardt draws a line that he says he will never cross.
"There is some sickness spreading across Europe right now," he said, striding quickly through a 20-acre patch of organic potatoes on his farm just south of Zurich. "A bunch of people are trying to get rich by telling us that nature isn't good enough and that we will have to take genes out of a fish and put them in a strawberry if we want to survive. They are changing the basic rules of life and they want to try it all out on us."
"Maybe they will get their way," Mr. Gunthardt said, referring to the failure of a recent national referendum here on whether to curtail genetic engineering. "It happened in America. But it won't happen on this farm. Here we are going to live like God intended."
If Mr. Gunthardt seems inflexible on the issue he certainly has company.
From one end of Europe to the other consumers are in open revolt over the prospect of a future in which nature has somehow been altered by people holding test tubes.
Throughout the world last year more than 30 million acres of commercial farmland were planted with genetically modified seeds -- 10 times as much as the year before.
But not one of those acres was in the 15 countries of the European Union.
Prince Charles recently voiced a common sentiment when he announced that no genetically altered food would ever pass his lips. "That takes mankind into realms that belong to God, and to God alone," he said.
The debate here about how -- and whether -- to unleash the most powerful tools of modern biology says much about the cultural and philosophical differences between pragmatic and risk-ready America, where genetic technology that focuses on food has largely been accepted, and the far more reticent people of Europe. But it says more than that, because what happens to crops from Bialystok to Bruges will have major consequences not just for farmers, but also for industrial policy and for fields like medicine, agriculture and pharmaceutical research.
Europeans do make distinctions. They see genetic engineering in the pursuit of better medicine as worth a few moral doubts, and like many Americans they are profoundly unsettled about the prospect of such research involving humans.
 
Fears of Drastic Change And Memories of Abuse
Yet often the differences between research in plants and animals are completely blurred by sensational events. The cloning of an adult lamb in Scotland two years ago only deepened fears people already had.
There are many ways to explain the European conservatism: a strong environmental movement rooted in the 19th-century philosophy that nature is as wise as man, a fear of drastic change and the unusually large number of small farms still run by families who are reluctant to end practices that have been honed over centuries.
Recent history also plays a role, for in this part of the world the uses of genetics have not always been benign. In almost any discussion the dark but recent past also comes up.
"The shadow of the Holocaust is dense and incredibly powerful still," said Arthur Caplan, the American ethicist who is at the University of Pennsylvania. "It leaves Europe terrified about the abuse of genetics. To them the potential to abuse genetics is no theory. It is a historical fact."
Despite the victory for researchers in Switzerland, the battle for Europe continues to rage. Norway no longer accepts American soybean imports because more than one-third are genetically modified to ward off pests. Austria and Luxembourg have totally banned genetically modified food.
In France -- where food is never just food -- the issue was recently put before the nation by a "citizens conference" that produced an ambiguous statement of "cautious" support for such crops. In Britain vandalism has become so common at sites where genetically modified crops are tested that the Government is now considering concealing their locations.
 
An Old Challenge Met in New Ways
"These people who say they are defending nature simply harm the countries they pretend to protect," said Daniel Vasella, the president and chief executive officer of Novartis A.G., the pharmaceutical giant that has energetically begun to move into food production, as well. "We have enough food in Europe. So that's not really an issue. That lets them fight to keep everything forever the way it is now. They move ahead by looking backward. It is so very egotistical."
All farmers try to grow crops that resist disease and last long enough to arrive safely at the market. The task is obvious but not simple. Officials at the United Nations World Food Program estimate that up to 40 percent of the world's crops are destroyed as they grow or before they leave the field. Attempts to find a way to protect them have therefore been intense.
Scientists can now tell with precision which of 50,000 genes in a plant governs a particular trait. If it is beneficial, they can take that gene out of one species -- something that wards off a common insect, for instance -- copy it and stick it into another organism, to protect it. That organism, and its offspring, will then have a genetic structure that lets them resist such pests.
In a way that is nothing new. For centuries farmers have been trying to breed crops to make sure that the biggest and best survive.
It has been more than 500 years since people realized that rennet from calves' stomachs turned milk into cheese. At the time nobody knew why exactly. An enzyme called chymosin does the job.
Nevertheless it was a use of biotechnology that prevails today in modern form, an enzyme made through genetic engineering that has replaced the rennet from calves' stomachs.
"What is this 'mad' science?" asked Joseph Zak, who is paid by the American Soybean Association to try to calm European fears about how soy products are grown. "It is just another step in the history of agricultural technology. It falls in the same line as when tractors replaced the horse. It's like when fertilizers came into the picture and when we moved to breeding to make a better product."
But consumers often see it as tampering with their food. And in Europe, where regulatory bodies are not nearly as powerful or as respected as Washington's Food and Drug Administration is in the United States, the fact of manipulation drives people crazy.
In addition, Mad Cow Disease, which exposed fundamental flaws in food-safety regulation, reminded people that science is never infallible.
"I am sure all this food is safe and that there might be some promise to it," said Lianne Wilier, 31, an accountant in Zurich. "If it helps poor people somehow, I'm all for it. But I would never feed something to my children that is not natural. It feels wrong to me I guess because if we make a mistake on this level there is no going back. Saying we were wrong isn't going to be good enough."
 
What the Vanilla Gene Might Do to Madagascar
Despite enormous experience showing that the crops are safe to grow and eat, fundamental questions do exist about the possible uses of such technology.
It is now simple, for example, to put the taste of vanilla in almost any food by inserting the right gene into that food. It seems harmless, and physically it is.
"We looked into this carefully," said Maria Zimmerman, who is in charge of agricultural research for the sustainable development department of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. "If we start making fake vanilla we will destroy the lives of thousands of farmers in Madagascar," the African island-nation that is home to most of the world's vanilla crop. "We would ruin the island's economy. So we aren't moving forward with that."
Others would argue that the farmers in Madagascar need to find new crops to grow, and that fake vanilla could force them to do it. But it is a difficult issue for Ms. Zimmerman, because her job is to push genetically modified research toward its greatest goal, more -- and more effective -- food at lower cost for millions of people.
"It takes one hectare," or two and a half acres, "of land to feed 4 people," Ms. Zimmerman said. "But as a result of population growth, drought and the rise of a middle class that eats better food and more food in many countries, that same amount of land is going to have to feed 6 people in about 20 years. That means we need 50 percent more food. And this technology can help. It must help."
 
Science's Promise Of Abundance
She and other researchers say biotechnology can provide more nutritious rice, as well as cotton that requires less water to grow and fewer pesticides. She wants to find genes that will preserve crops, enrich their protein content and make them easier to grow. All that, theoretically at least, is possible.
There are dozens of varieties of genetically modified seeds -- corn, soybean, potatoes and cotton are examples -- that have been planted in the United States. Many more are on the way.
Soybeans that have been modified to tolerate an herbicide have revolutionized one of the world's most important crops. And, yes, it is now possible to take a gene from certain fish, which permit them to tolerate the extreme cold of the deep ocean, and insert it into a strawberry.
"Who wouldn't feel a little strange about all of this?" asked Msgr. Elio Sgreccia, president of the Vatican Bioethics Institute, which follows closely debates about genetic technology. "It is a troubling aspect of a world that seems to be moving too fast, one in which people often make terrible mistakes in the name of progress."
"Europeans are particularly aware of that problem," Monsignor Sgreccia said. "Still, there are genes and there are genes. From the Catholic point of view we are open to the use of genetic technology in agriculture and with animals, as long as we don't do it with man. We believe that man has a primacy on this planet and that as long as he uses it wisely nature is here for him."
At first glance Florianne Koechlin might seem an unlikely advocate in the struggle to ban the use of genetically modified organisms. She lives near Basel, the home of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry, and she is a member of the Geigy family, which started the company that has become part of Novartis.
 
Shorter Research Cycles And Swift Actions
Ms. Koechlin said she was convinced that humans were racing to put themselves in a position that they will ultimately regret.
"I am not saying genetic research should disappear," she said, sitting in the bright kitchen of her unassuming suburban house. "This pervades all areas of life on earth, food, seed, the cells of human beings. I know that. But why can't we slow down and think about it all?"
That may no longer be possible, not even in Europe. Research and development cycles shorten every year. International competition demands swift action to remain competitive.
"We have eaten the apple and now we will have to live with the knowledge it gives us," said Gian Reto Plattner, a professor of physics at the University of Basel. He is also a Socialist member of the Swiss Parliament who broke with his own party to oppose the ban.
But he did not do that lightly.
"If you look at this as a question of risks it's pretty clear that these crops are safe," Professor Plattner said. "Explosions and fire are far more dangerous, and we use them every day. But nobody is looking at the use of genetics that way.
"This is a religious discussion we are having. Many people feel nature is immutable. This work tells them they are wrong, and then they are being told to forget about their basic beliefs. It's really asking a lot."

HEADLINE: Teachers Pursuing Quality Control

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 19

 BODY:
John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers, objects to what he says has been the most widely used test to become a public school teacher: the thermometer test. "If you register above 97 degrees, you pass," he lamented.
It may seem surprising to hear a teachers union leader complaining that some of those placed in front of classrooms are only warm bodies. And, indeed, Mr. Cole said, not many years ago he would not have been caught doing so. He saw the union's role as that of purely protecting members from attacks by administrators and school boards. 
 But today, with education moving to the top of the national political agenda, much of the attention is focused on teacher quality, widely seen as the most important variable in a pupil's education. Advocacy groups, state legislatures and Congress are seeking ways to attract better candidates to the teaching profession and improve teacher education, needs that have grown in urgency as school populations swell after years of shrinking.
In one sense, the nearly one-million-member American Federation of Teachers, whose delegates, like Mr. Cole, are meeting here for their biennial convention, is an organization under siege. The leaders, who are treating better teacher quality as a priority, have little choice: If they do not promote change it will be forced upon them.
So today the union passed a resolution calling for local affiliates to negotiate a role in the hiring of teachers, take part in assisting and reviewing teacher performance and, ultimately, in dismissing those teachers who are beyond help. Because a similar resolution was rejected at the union's convention two years ago in Cincinnati, this year's vote is evidence of changing times and growing pressure.
Yet it is also clear in the cavernous halls of New Orleans's riverside convention center where some 3,000 federation delegates have been meeting that the new national focus on teacher quality is seen as an opportunity. If handled properly, it should translate into higher pay, better benefits and greater honor for a profession that has fallen on hard times in the last few decades.
"If a company has a shortage of computer programmers, what does it do?" asked Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers of Los Angeles. "It raises the salaries of programmers to attract more of them. The market works in every other sector of the economy. Why not here?"
Teacher salaries start at about $25,000 around the country, well below those of most other professions. Those who leave teaching -- as do some 50 percent within the first seven years of entering the profession -- further complain about safety, especially in urban districts, and lack of an attractive, professional environment. The buildings in which they work are often old; they frequently do not have easy access to telephones or computers and the lack of much contact during the day with colleagues can be isolating.
"My sisters are in the business world and they don't have to take professional development courses on Saturday or in the evenings," said Brenda Mitchell, director of the Center for Professional Growth and Development of United Teachers of New Orleans, the local federation affiliate. "They take them during working hours. They work in nice, air-conditioned offices and are treated like professionals. That's what we need for teachers today.
"I'm 51 years old and, as an African-American, I can tell you that many career paths were not open to me when I was younger. There was teaching or counseling. Today that's not true. All these other fields are wide open and people are going into them instead of teaching."
The teacher crisis stems partly, researchers agree, from the increased options opened to women and minority group members by the 1960's civil rights era. Their turning elsewhere combined with growing disorder in schools and reduced budgets, especially in inner cities, and a drop-off in school populations after the baby boom generation graduated. Now, with the children of the baby boom group in school and most good jobs so information-based, the need for teachers is heightened just as fewer high-achieving students are interested in the profession because of seemingly better options in a robust economy.
That is precisely what is worrying critics of public education, who maintain that teachers are increasingly drafted from a below-average group of applicants. In Massachusetts, for example, the first mandatory teacher test, taken in April, showed 59 percent of prospective teachers unable to pass a basic skills portion. Words like "improbably," "corrupt" and "relief" were often misspelled by the test takers.
The results led the president of the Massachusetts State Senate, Thomas F. Birmingham, to propose enticing new teachers with $20,000 signing bonuses. He said, "We're never going to pay teachers what corporate lawyers get but that doesn't mean you can't do something to attract better people."
In Washington, some members of Congress are proposing other financial incentives as well as sanctions, including abolishing student debts of teachers, especially those who go to poor neighborhoods to teach, and cutting Federal aid to teachers colleges whose graduates do not perform well on standardized tests. Only about 40 percent of the education schools in the country are accredited.
Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, made teacher quality the centerpiece of her convention opening speech here on Friday, saying it was on everyone's mind as well it should be, but she said the fault was not the union's.
"So long as state and local education authorities continue to issue emergency credentials and to misassign teachers into subjects they are not qualified to teach, higher standards will be a fiction," she said.
Ms. Feldman said there would be a need for 2 million new teachers in the coming decade and already some 6.5 percent, or about 13,000 out of 200,000, new teachers hired in public schools each year come with emergency credentials. In addition, she said, some 36 percent of the nation's public school academic teachers had neither a college major nor a minor in the subject to which they were assigned to teach.
She said that if administrators were to take up her challenge and this school year end the practice of emergency credentials, the teacher deficit would be truly exposed for what it is -- the result of school boards and administrators more concerned with placing anybody in front of a classroom than with real teacher quality.
Mr. Higuchi of Los Angeles said the national push for small class size was actually counterproductive without improving teacher quality.
"There is this illusion that all it takes is small groups to improve learning," he said. "But you could put the kids around a dining room table and if the teacher doesn't know what he is doing, it doesn't help."
Among the federation delegates there was some concern about the move to have the union involved in dismissing bad teachers when it is also the advocate for all its members.
Bill Roney, a kindergarten teacher from Yonkers, said such a dual role would only weaken the union, turning it into a form of management.
But other federation members said it was time for the union to move toward being a more professional association, rather than purely a trade union, in keeping with what teaching is. The A.F.T.'s union stridency is thought to have played a role in the rejection by the National Education Association, its rival, of a merger with it at its convention in New Orleans earlier this month. The two unions are expected to continue merger talks as well as cooperative ventures on things like peer review for teachers after the A.F.T.'s overwhelming vote on Saturday to pursue the merger.
Tom Mooney, president of the Cincinnati A.F.T. affiliate, said that in his city and a dozen others, peer review systems in which the union helps select and dismiss teachers have been working well. To critics who worry that the union will protect its own, he said that since the system began in Cincinnati, twice the number of bad teachers have been dismissed as under the previous system where it was only up to the principals.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Security for Sale

 BODY:
An ingenious arrangement that has encouraged Russia to convert its stockpiles of bomb grade uranium into much less dangerous civilian reactor fuel and earn precious cash in the process could soon be undone. The Clinton Administration, in a move that could easily disable the arrangement, is planning to sell off the United States Enrichment Corporation, the Government-owned company in charge of buying the Russian uranium.
As a private, profit-making business, the Enrichment Corporation will have strong incentives to walk away from the Russian deal, which competes with its more profitable core businesses. There are just a few days left before the sell-off becomes final. Vice President Al Gore, who helped negotiate the Russian uranium deal, or President Clinton could stop it and should. 
 Under the arrangement with Moscow, Russia blends down its bomb uranium to reactor fuel and sells it to the Enrichment Corporation. Moscow is paid for its blending services in cash and also receives offsetting amounts of natural uranium, a much less dangerous material, to compensate it for the underlying value of the uranium that it turns over to the United States. This scheme depends on Washington's ability to insulate uranium prices against adverse market trends. That leverage would be lost under privatization.
The Enrichment Corporation makes modest profits on the Russian deal, but much less than it does by enriching domestically obtained uranium in its own facilities. As a private company, it would be strongly tempted to cut back or even eliminate purchases from Russia, possibly by flooding the market with cheap natural uranium. Saving the Russian deal would then require large taxpayer subsidies, which Congress might not approve.
Two of the most prominent critics of the privatization plan are Thomas Neff, the scientist who conceived of the Russian uranium deal, and Joseph Stiglitz, who evaluated the economics of the sale during his term as President Clinton's chief economic adviser. Senator Pete Domenici, a sponsor of the privatization legislation and the Senate's most influential voice on nuclear issues, recently urged the White House to review the national security issues involved.
With private companies also wary of purchasing the Enrichment Corporation, the Administration has turned to the unusual expedient of selling shares directly to the public. That promises rich underwriting fees for Wall Street. But this deal offers little economic gain for the taxpayer and risks big losses for American nuclear security.

HEADLINE: Newark's Painful Challenge: Property Taxes Out of Kilter

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 17

 BODY:
After four decades without a recalculation of property values, Newark's property tax system is acknowledged to be so rife with inequity that almost every owner in the city is either paying too much or too little.
But city officials, under pressure from the state and Essex County to set things straight, are in a bind: A citywide revaluation, they say, will mean staggering tax increases in Newark's most stable residential neighborhoods even as the city is showing its first signs of recovery. 
 "Forcing Newark to go ahead with this reassessment as proposed would have a devastating effect on our residential property owners and severely hinder the great economic recovery Newark is experiencing," Mayor Sharpe James said last month in testimony before a panel appointed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to consider an overhaul of New Jersey's property tax system.
Property values anywhere would be expected to change over 40 years, but Newark's history has been particularly tumultuous since its last revaluation. The flight of much of the middle class, a decline of manufacturing, the 1967 racial riots, an influx of immigrants and now hints of downtown renewal are not at all reflected in the city's property records.
Last month, the State Attorney General's office asked a Superior Court judge in Essex County to order Newark to comply with state law requiring property taxes to be based on 100 percent of a property's "true value." Newark's assessments, on average, reflect only 16.38 percent of true value, according to state tax officials. City officials have asked the judge, Harry A. Margolis, to throw out the state's request, citing reports by real estate experts showing that a revaluation would shift 25 percent of the tax burden from commercial to residential owners and, in the worst cases, cause tax bills to double or triple for many of the middle-class homeowners that Newark so desperately needs to keep.
Newark, which completed its last full revaluation of property in 1961, has managed to fend off demands for an update since the early 1970's. It has now gone longer than any other city in New Jersey -- and apparently any large city in the country -- without updating its assessments.
At the same time, many state and local governments have adopted sophisticated technology to monitor real estate prices so they have the most up-to-date assessments and can guarantee that taxes accurately reflect property values.
 
A Case in Point: Homes On 2 Sides of the City
For a sense of how much things have changed in Newark, consider two three-story, three-family homes on lots of the exact same size but on different sides of the city.
The first, with plain gray siding, is in the Ironbound, a solid neighborhood of working-class immigrants and tidily kept homes. Its owners, Antonio Matias and his wife, Carmina, paid $108,000 for it 10 years ago and could probably sell it for almost $200,000 today. But according to city records, its assessed value is just $9,900, unchanged since the late 1950's.
The second house, with blue-gray shingles and a covered porch, is on the poorer West Side. There are several vacant lots nearby and two houses on the block are boarded up. Its owner, Annie Thorne, paid $40,000 for it last year and would probably get less than $100,000 if she sold it today. But its assessed value is $11,200, also unchanged in about 40 years.
While Ms. Thorne paid $2,672.32 in property taxes last year, the Matiases paid $2,362.14.
"There are gross inequities throughout the city that need to be rectified," said George Librizzi, the administrator for the Essex County Tax Board, which has been trying to force Newark to do a property revaluation for 25 years. "There is no other interest other than to be fair and equitable."
Because Newark's property tax system is so out of kilter, each year the city faces hundreds of tax appeals, many by commercial property owners, who are overcharged the most. So many of the appeals are successful that Newark has often fallen short of the tax revenues it needs. On several occasions, the city has had to float bonds to make up the difference, which in some years has been as much as $15 million.
Newark officials are quick to note that they could pay all their bills if the owners of tax-exempt property would contribute more. Almost 70 percent of property in Newark, an astoundingly high percentage, is tax-exempt because it belongs to the Federal or state governments, to government entities like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or to schools, hospitals or religious groups.
These owners do pay the city fees in lieu of taxes, but city officials contend that the fees are only a fraction of what the owners would pay if taxes could be levied.
 
In the Early 70's, It Was A 'Very Different City'
In the early 1970's, when the state first sought to force a revaluation in Newark, city officials fought back, reasoning that in the wake of the riots, property values had fallen so far that a revaluation would further encourage the flight of homeowners to the suburbs and discourage commercial and industrial businesses from rebuilding.
"Newark was a very, very different city at that point," said Stephen N. Adubato, executive director of the North Ward Center, a nonprofit social-service and educational organization that has been in Newark for 25 years. "It was a very troubling time. There was no hope. There was very little feeling about staying in the city."
Mr. Adubato's brother, Michael, a former state assemblyman who died in 1993, and other state legislators came to Newark's rescue by passing laws that made revaluation optional for more than 20 years. The first bill stated that "such cities are characterized by a high incidence of buildings and structure in need of rehabilitation" and that "any program for the general revaluation of real property in such cities at this time can only result in further deterioration."
But those protections expired in the early 1990's. Since then, city officials have continued to protest a revaluation while acknowledging that it is virtually unavoidable, and the city tax assessor's office has quietly proceeded with a revision of the tax maps that is a crucial first step toward revaluation.
Reports by academics and consultants, commissioned by the city, found that two neighborhoods that have blossomed, the Ironbound in the city's East Ward and Forest Hill in the North Ward, would see overall increases in property taxes. Residential neighborhoods that have yet to recover, including Clinton Hill in the South Ward, most of the Central Ward and most of the city's commercial areas, including the central business district and the port area, should see property taxes decline. Only in one residential area, Weequahic, are taxes likely to remain more or less the same.
One report, by Dickinson & McCormick, a real estate appraisal company, found that 25 percent of the property tax burden would shift from commercial to residential owners, with the Ironbound hit hardest.
For example, Mr. Matias, could see the taxes on his three-family house at 82 Barbara Street more than triple to about $7,000 a year. For another house that Mr. Matias owns in the Ironbound, an investment property at 173 Oliver Street, the jump could be even bigger: from $858.96 in taxes last year to more than $6,000.
"It's a bunch of crooks over there," Mr. Matias said of the city government. Anger flashed in his eyes as he considered the possibility of higher taxes. "If we can't support the house, we'd give it up or we'd put a match to the house and that's it," he said. "Where are we going to move? Who is going to buy the house after that?"
The frustration is common among Ironbound residents who feel that a revaluation would punish them for building a stable neighborhood. "They know what the city looked like 30 years ago and they know what it looks like now," said Mr. Matias, who came to Newark from Lisbon in 1971 and worked for a big meatpacking company before starting his own contracting business. "Do they want us to abandon the houses, too, so it will look like Central Avenue?"
 
A System Many Find Hard to Understand
What makes revaluation hard for many people to understand is that it is not a straight raising or lowering of everyone's tax bill. The goal of a revaluation is not to change the total amount of taxes collected by the city but to rebalance or equalize the tax burden. What a revaluation changes is how much each property owner pays in relation to other property owners.
State law does allow a town to phase in major increases in property taxes over three years. Newark officials would like that to be five years.
Even property owners who might be helped by a revaluation like Ms. Thorne often do not understand what it means. The tax on her three-family house at 428 South 17th Street is likely to remain the same or drop slightly. "I am not a tax-oriented person," she said. "I know whatever they say, you have to pay. You have to pay or they throw liens on that."
She was surprised to learn that the increasing value of houses in other neighborhoods might lower her taxes. "It never dawned on me to look at it that way," she said, adding that she would be happy to pay less. "Who wants to pay more taxes?"
Newark's tug-of-war over revaluation may also have an impact beyond the city. The state's property tax system is already under review by the panel that was created by Governor Whitman. And the outcome may have implications for other large cities across the country that, like Newark, argue that their homeowners pay too much in taxes and end up providing services for people who work, but do not live, within city lines.
"When we look at it, we are not just looking at revaluation," said Donald Tucker, a City Council member who is chairman of its revaluation committee. "We're looking at taxation and the fairness of property taxation within the city based on state guidelines."
"We provide a service to the larger region," he said. "We are, in fact, a regional city."
In testimony last month before the Governor's property tax study commission, Mayor James called for the creation of a local purpose tax on exempt property owners to cover the costs of police, fire and sanitation services. He also suggested that education costs be paid out of the state income tax rather than city property taxes.
"Your actions will decide if the residents of our cities can share in the American dream of home ownership," he told the commission, "or experience the nightmare of losing the home they have struggled to own."
Experts, meanwhile, call Newark's delay in revaluing its property unheard of. George Donatello, a former president of the International Association of Assessment Officers, who is now conducting a revaluation of Pittsburgh and the rest of Allegheny County in Pennsylvania, said he did not know of another city waiting as long as Newark.
"Forty years?" he said. "That's incredible The maximum I have seen is 20, and again the trend is more frequent reappraisals across the country. With these computer systems now and good market analysis tools, people want you to stay on top of change. They get used to a revaluation every year or every two years or every three years at the most."

Table: "FOR EXAMPLE: A Seismic Shift in Newark's Tax Burden"
If Newark is forced to revalue property -- for the first time since 1961 -- middle-class homeowners are most likely to feel the pinch. The rule of thumb is that if a property's value has increased more than 6.1 times since 1961, its taxes will rise. Below, examples of how the burden would shift.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Austerity May Deepen Crises

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your July 16 news article on a House panel's approval of $3.5 billion in new borrowing authority for the International Monetary Fund suggests that Dick Armey, the majority leader, has "virtually conceded the fight" against the I.M.F. Giving it one more penny without insisting on personnel and policy changes not only concedes the fight but also condones policies that are so destructive of the poorest countries. 
 I oppose any financing until we are confident the I.M.F. will stop imposing austerity measures and currency devaluations. I do not, however, agree with Republicans who would shut the agency down now.
For several years, I have called for the resignation of the I.M.F.'s managing director and top managers. The I.M.F. now proposes to lend Russia $11 billion, but the conditions it seeks would push Russia deeper into crisis and perhaps to the point where the Russians might yearn for a return of authoritarianism. Only a new management team committed to pro-growth policies of stable currencies and low tax rates would justify the full $17.9 billion being sought by the Clinton Administration.

An Incentive to Shop

 BODY:

To the Editor;
Japan's economic crisis (news article, July 14) will not be helped by the Keynesian expansionary measures proposed by everyone from the United States to the International Monetary Fund. Putting more money in the hands of the world's most prolific savers won't trigger spending, especially when they face an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent and economic and political uncertainty. 
 The only elixir is a dose of inflation. This can be achieved by opening up the money supply and shocking the market. Consumers will flock to the stores to spend their eroding assets.

Accountability Counts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Before resigning, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan said: "We could not live up to the people's expectations, and it is all my responsibility" (front page, July 13). When did we last hear an American leader, politician or executive, confess to lack of ability? How much easier it is to blame the opposition party, one's colleagues, unfair competitors, foreign powers, El Nino, personal problems and even the voters and shareholders. 
 Some may dismiss Mr. Hashimoto's comments as a ritualistic falling on his sword. His example, however, should serve as a wake-up call to a United States where the concept of accountability has been trivialized.

Re "Worries About Loans Revive Ghost of 1980's Bank Debacle" (front page, July 16): With poor prospects for world trade as a result of the Asian crisis, and the Government's restrictive economic stance, the United States economy is going to run out of steam unless the private-sector deficit rises further. Yet, as your article suggests, the flow of private borrowing to finance that deficit is already dangerously excessive. But if borrowing slows, or does not accelerate, there may be a prolonged period of stagnation, with grim consequences for production and trade worldwide.

HEADLINE: After Deaths, County Asks 'Why?';
Permissiveness Is Blamed as Teen-Agers Are Arrested

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: GLOVERSVILLE, N.Y., July 17

 BODY:
Heather Pettit, 16, sat in the searing heat on the porch steps of her home on North Street in this Fulton County town, holding a portable telephone. She said she was waiting for someone to call her, or for something to happen.
"I think in the beginning they're all, like, shocked," Heather said, "but I think in a couple of months, it's going to happen again, and in a couple of months, it's going to happen again. And I really think somebody has to do something about Gloversville." 
 After years without a single homicide, Fulton County had four in three months starting in late February. One victim was tortured, strangled and stuffed in a car trunk. One died of a shotgun blast. Another, a 77-year-old man, was tied in an easy chair and suffocated. As many as 30 students at Gloversville High School were said to have known about that killing two days before suspects in the case were arrested, but no one said a word to a grown-up.
The spasm of violence is horror enough. But what is especially chilling, people here say, is that most of the accused are teen-agers.
Fulton County has only about 54,000 people, most of them in the adjoining towns of Gloversville and Johnstown, which are about 40 miles northwest of Albany. The weight of pain and fear that has descended so unexpectedly on so many other rural towns in recent months, places where young people have killed without any sign of remorse or expectation of escape, has come here, too. And like the bloodshed in those other places, the slayings here have left questions and contending answers on the lips of the survivors.
Everyone has a theory.
The new Committee on Youth Violence met. "We had four judges, the D.A. and myself, and it took us seven seconds to agree that it's the parents, stupid," said Warren Greene, head of the county probation office and a member of the committee.
Abraham Seroussi, the Mayor of Gloversville, said: "You've got violence on TV, you've got violence on the damn video games, you've got the whole ghetto chic from the city. And it's all coming up here to the rural areas."
Rosalie Sweet, 42, a former glove maker, said that there was nothing for young people to do anymore. "When I was a kid they had the Glove Theater and the Civic Center and the Littauer playground and lots of places you could go," Mrs. Sweet said as she hung out in the heat and the traffic noise on South Main Street with her 13-year old son, Terry, and Terry's friend, Elvis Taylor, who is 18. "Kids don't have any of those things anymore."
Terry agreed. "There used to be the Spring Street Park, but they took away the swings so the kids couldn't get hurt," he said. "But I don't know why they took the basketball hoop set, too."
Elvis said, "People let kids get away with anything."
Before this year, Fulton County's last murder was in 1992, and that one occurred several years after the previous one, so people around here began wondering if the sudden spate of death was some kind of copycat phenomenon that could go on and on. Polly A. Hoye, the Fulton County District Attorney, said it was more like an infection.
 "I think as violence appears to be happening around you, some people begin to see themselves as able to be involved in something like that," Ms. Hoye said. "They don't see it as abhorrent, and as others do it, they no longer see themselves as being incapable of committing it."
 The killings began on Feb. 23, the day that Timothy Morgan, 19, got into a taxi in Gloversville with his shotgun and told Joseph Boop, 46, to take him to Bleecker, the next town north, for rabbit hunting. When they got there, the police said, Mr. Morgan shot Mr. Boop twice, once at close range, and again as Mr. Boop tried to escape in his cab. Maybe it was about the fare, officials said. The District Attorney may seek the death penalty for Mr. Morgan.
On March 17, prosecutors say, Amanda Djzierson, 20; Lucas Whaley, 17, and Theodore Cook, 17, kidnapped Miss Djzierson's former boyfriend, John Morgan, 19, tied him up inside Mr. Cook's filthy home outside Johnstown, tortured him and then strangled him. Apparently John Morgan, no relation to Timothy Morgan, owed Miss Djzierson money for the phone bill and for pay-per-view movies on television from the period they had been living together.
Two days after the slaying, the authorities say, Miss Djzierson and Lucas Whaley drove around with John Morgan's body in the trunk of her Geo, looking for help in disposing of it. They showed the corpse to a relative of Mr. Whaley's, who refused to help and then called the state police. The three suspects were arrested hours later with the body still in the car. Lucas Whaley and Theodore Cook have been charged as adults with second-degree murder, and Amanda Djzierson has been charged with kidnapping. They could all get life sentences if convicted.
 On May 3, the police said, John C. LaVeille Jr., 39, fatally bludgeoned William Holland, 49, in Johnstown after an argument over money. It was the only homicide of the four not involving a youth, and Mr. LaVeille is the only murder suspect in those cases who made any effort to get away. He was recently arrested in Ohio and arraigned on charges of second-degree murder on Thursday. The death penalty may be sought against him.
Of all the killings that shocked and frightened the people of Gloversville and Johnstown this year, the worst by most accounts occurred on May 24, on North Street, five houses down from Heather Pettit's. For months, Robert D. Wittemeyer, 77, a retiree who lived at 155 North, had complained to the Gloversville police about petty break-ins and harassment by teen-age boys, and on May 27 the police went to see Mr. Wittemeyer about one of the complaints.
They found Mr. Wittemeyer's decomposing body tied to an easy chair that had been tipped forward, pushing Mr. Wittemeyer's face into the floor and slowly asphyxiating him. Cushions, clothes and an old vacuum cleaner had been piled on top, adding to the weight on Mr. Wittemeyer's face. The police arrested Heather's friend and next-door neighbor at 145 North Street, Ronald Johnson 3d, 16, and Bruce Insonia, also 16, who lived around the corner at 23 John Street.
By the time the body was discovered, the police said, the two youths had been riding around in Mr. Wittemeyer's old Buick for two days, taking friends on rides and showing off a gun they said they had taken from Mr. Wittemeyer. There were five youths in the car when the police closed in, Ms. Hoye, the District Attorney, said, and local newspapers said that as many as 30 students at Gloversville High School knew of the slaying for two days before the arrests, but said nothing about it to anyone in authority.
 Heather said that she had suspected that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Insonia had Mr. Wittemeyer's car, but that she did not know anyone had been killed. She was asked why she did not tell anyone about the car. She looked away, down the street. Her gaze said it was a stupid question.
 "Frightening," said John H. Harzinski, the Chief of Police in Gloversville. "All of the kids allegedly knew and no one told anybody, which means the sensibility of these kids in terms of sheer humanity is very questionable." He paused. "God," he said.
Fulton County had been the center of the leather tanning and manufacturing trade since the pre-Revolutionary Leatherstocking days of the Mohawk frontier, and generation after generation grew up to work in the "skin mills," the men tanning and cutting and dying, the women sewing gloves in the shops that that gave Gloversville its name.
Now most of the leather business has moved overseas, and after years of high unemployment and economic decline, Fulton County has begun to recover, partly by attracting new but modestly paying manufacturing and assembly jobs. Spalding makes golf clubs here now, Sherwin-Williams makes paint, and Taylor Made makes motorboat windshields.
 Although the economy has improved, parts of the county retain a downtrodden, tumbledown look -- the "Appalachian look," as Mayor Seroussi puts it. In the County Risk Profile, which state agencies use to compare social conditions in New York's 58 counties, Fulton gets some good scores -- indicators of academic failure and school conduct problems are better than the state averages -- and some bad ones: Fulton was ranked the seventh worst county for youth alcohol problems. On a risk scale of 100, with 100 being the worst rating, Fulton received a 55 in family dysfunction and a 73 in youth delinquency; the state average in both categories is 40.
 Half of all police arrests in Gloversville are of people younger than 18, Chief Harzinski said, and 43 percent are of children younger than 15. He could not compare those numbers with earlier ones, but Federal statistics underscore the rise in violent youth crimes nationally. According to the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, trials of juveniles for assault, robbery, rape or homicide almost doubled from 1986 to 1995, to 377,300 from 190,000. Juveniles are generally defined as people 18 and younger, but the definition varies from state to state.
 On some of Gloversville's tougher streets, people say they can see the change in young people, particularly among teen-agers pretending to be gang members. (When Lucas Whaley was arrested in the slaying of John Morgan, the police said, he told them he was a member of the Bloody Murder Gang.)
 "You see them walking around like gang wannabes," said Carl Johnson, 42, who works at the Keymark Corporation aluminum manufacturing plant in Fonda. "They walk because they're too young to drive, but if you get in a fight with one of them, two days later four or five kids are going to jump you with soda bottles."
 Carmelo D'Amore has been dealing with young people as a guidance counselor at Johnstown High School for more than 20 years, and he puts the blame squarely on boomer generation parents who never learned to be parents. "The kids haven't changed; we've changed," Mr. D'Amore said. "Our parents said 'No!' even if they knew we were up to something. Today's parents say, 'Oh, I did that when I was their age. They'll get through it like we did."
 Heather Pettit sat on her North Street porch steps and said: "I know lots of kids who think they can walk all over their parents. They say they have the right because their parents didn't grow up in this world."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 21, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a spate of killings in Fulton County, New York, misstated the number of counties in the state. It is 62. (The figure of 58 in the article is the number of counties covered by the County Risk Profile, which state agencies use to compare social conditions in the state.)

A Good Place to Shoot Movies? Why, That's Baltimore

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
Novelists often explore what they know best, and the same sometimes applies to filmmakers. At least it does for Barry Levinson, who has made his hometown, Baltimore, a star in many of his feature films.
This fall, shooting is scheduled to begin on his latest, "Liberty Heights," a story of how race, religion and class distinctions in the same neighborhood once mixed in ways the nation has sometimes forgotten. The idea, Mr. Levinson said in an interview, grew out an anti-Semitic remark he read in a review of his film "Sphere," with Dustin Hoffman. 
 "It was so ignorant," Mr. Levinson said of a comment about Mr. Hoffman's role. "But it started me thinking about the time when all these things began to bubble up -- not with hatred but out of complete ignorance and a lack of understanding about people who are different."
"Liberty Heights" is set in a west-side neighborhood that Mr. Levinson, who is 56, knew growing up. It follows three other films he has shot in Baltimore -- "Diner," "Tin Men" and "Avalon."
As a body of work, along with his acclaimed television series, "Homicide: Life on the Streets," they have celebrated the idiosyncrasies of a city that many of its residents nonetheless regard as less sophisticated than its big-city neighbors, Washington and Philadelphia.
At the same time, projects by Mr. Levinson and Baltimore's other cinematic son, John Waters, have helped create a dense community of grips, carpenters, electricians, makeup artists and actors who are ever ready for the next film or television project shot in the city or nearby counties. And there have been scores of them in recent years as production companies have found that Maryland's varied architecture and geography are easily adaptable to whatever the script requires.
"We've been discovered," said Michael B. Styer, director of the Maryland Film Office, which promotes the state to production companies and coordinates their efforts with local government agencies. "We have all the right ingredients. We're cheaper here, and there's less hassle."
In recent years, all or part of nearly 60 movies, television series and pilots from virtually every major studio have been shot in and around Baltimore. These projects include "Broadcast News," "Sleepless in Seattle," "True Lies" and "Patriot Games."
By Mr. Styer's estimate, projects shot in Maryland over the last 10 years alone have added $500 million to the state economy.
Few people have done more to keep Baltimore in films and local people working on them than Mr. Levinson, who lives in Los Angeles, and Mr. Waters, who still lives not far from the Baltimore suburb where he grew up.
As directors, they have embraced the city and its style, including the nasal accent that twists vowels and mangles words, leaving them almost unintelligible to outsiders. For example, "cheern for them Ay's" is the parochial way of expressing support for the local baseball team, the Orioles -- or O's.
In Mr. Waters's case, every film he has ever made has been set in Baltimore, from early underground ventures like "Hag in a Black Leather Jacket," "Mondo Trasho" and "Pink Flamingos," the themes of which you really don't want to know, to his more ambitious films, including "Hairspray," "Serial Mom" and his latest, "Pecker," which is scheduled for release this fall.
"John has never filmed anywhere else," said Steve Yeager, a Waters protege who recently produced a feature-length Baltimore-based documentary, "Divine Trash." It is a biographical account of a transvestite actor known as Divine, a star of many of Mr. Waters's films.
One star of "Pecker" is the working-class neighborhood of Hampden, one of the quirkier parts of the city. Mr. Yeager said that Mr. Waters's production designer, Vince Peranio, had found a house for the film in which the residents had extended their carpeting two feet up each wall.
Mr. Yeager said he had asked Mr. Peranio: "How did you get them to do that? John will love it."
Mr. Peranio said, "I didn't touch the place."
Mr. Levinson, whose production company is called Baltimore Pictures, has relied less on satirical elements of the city than allusions to actual people and places. The diner in "Diner" was a real place, the Hilltop Diner on Reisterstown Road, a favorite family restaurant in the 1950's. Siding salesman were known locally as tin men.
To a Baltimorean, "Avalon," a film about generational change, conjured up images of the old Avalon movie theater, which was on the edge of a once-proud neighborhood that could not hold onto its middle class. "Homicide" is based on a book about the homicide squad of the Baltimore Police Department.
"I'm not unlike a novelist who writes about people and places that resonate within," Mr. Levinson said. "So I thought I needed to be that way, with the rhythms, the language, the characters, the architecture. It's all part of the design. I can't separate it out."
He said he knows Mr. Waters only casually but shares his love for the city, even if they express it in contrasting ways.
"He literally works in a different part of the city," Mr. Levinson said, referring to Mr. Waters's preference for its kitsch and kink. "So his sensitivity comes from another place. We may show two aspects of Baltimore, but that just proves how diverse the city is."

HEADLINE: Butte Breaks New Ground to Mop Up a World-Class Mess

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: BUTTE, Mont.

 BODY:
SO much copper was dug from the mountain this city in the Rockies was built on, it was dubbed the Richest Hill on Earth.
Now the copper is largely gone, and the bill for a century's worth of mining has come due. The mountains and waterways around Butte are so contaminated they make up the largest Super Fund complex in the country. The contamination is so widespread and difficult to deal with that company scientists have been forced to look for new solutions. Butte has, in essence, become a giant test laboratory for cleanup technologies. 
 The heart of the problem is in the city of Butte itself, which is next to one of the largest open-pit mines in the world. The mine was abandoned in 1979 and the Atlantic Richfield Co. stopped pumping water out of the pit in 1981. As maroon-colored water pours into the pit through mining tunnels that honeycomb the remains of the mountain, and more washes in from the surface, the water carries large amounts of sulfuric acid and a variety of heavy metals, including zinc, nickel, cadmium and arsenic, and especially high levels of copper. Some call this noxious brew "not-water."
In 1995, 342 snow geese landed on the water and never took off again. Burns in the esophagus indicated they died from drinking the water. "It's basically acid," said Michael Tuck, president of MSE Technology Applications, a company owned by the Montana university system and funded by grants from the Department of Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other Federal agencies. "And it has the potential to contaminate wells and creeks." The 30 billion gallons of water in the pit grows by seven and a half million gallons a day.
All this began in 1864, when a handful of fortune hunters made camp along Silver Bow Creek in southwest Montana Territory looking for gold and silver. But it was copper that ultimately came out of the Anaconda Company mine, named by a New Yorker who was inspired by a newspaper account of the Civil War in which Gen. George B. McClellan's forces were described as an anaconda that would wrap up the troops of Gen. Robert E. Lee.
As the country was being electrified, and power and telephone lines were being strung everywhere, the demand for copper wire skyrocketed and Butte boomed.
Mining was soon everywhere, and so was the mess it made. Thousands of miners, many of them immigrants, crawled through thousands of miles of tunnels. Piles of ore were concentrated by mixing in timbers and simply setting them on fire -- a process called heap roasting. Acrid smoke laden with arsenic and sulfur would envelop the town for days. Three million cubic yards of mine tailings were dumped along streams, and migrated along more than a hundred miles of river.
The fugitive nature of the metals in the Clark Fork Complex makes them especially difficult to control. They are so widespread in the watershed, and in such density, that thunderstorms have washed the toxic metals into the river where their concentration exceeds government water standards a thousandfold. For more than 60 miles from the headwaters of the Clark Fork, the bleached bones of cattle are not the normal white color, but a vivid blue-green from the copper in them.
The metals have killed fish and made them unsafe to eat. One so-called toxic pulse occurred in July 1989 and killed 5,000 fish. Normally, a river the size of the Clark Fork -- one of largest in the state -- would be expected to have 3,000 to 5,000 trout in each mile of water, but the Clark Fork has only a tenth that many, and in some places has a paltry 80 fish per mile.
Serious pollution has appeared 135 miles downriver near Missoula at the Milltown Dam. A layer of heavy metals 30 feet thick has settled behind the dam. Any attempt to remove the layer, officials say, will stir it up and release metals into the river. The Environmental Protection Agency and Atlantic Richfield have decided it best to leave the waste in place behind the dam and monitor it.
But the worst pollution is right in town. In 1955, Anaconda said the poor quality of the ore made underground mining unprofitable and began a cheaper pit-mining operation, chewing up the mountain with giant shovels, creating a huge wound a mile deep -- the Berkeley Pit.
Nothing was spared, and even Butte's historic uptown area would have been consumed had not Atlantic Richfield closed the mine when it merged with Anaconda in 1982.
Any solution will be less than perfect. Berkeley Pit's poisonous brew is expected to pollute the surrounding aquifer by 2022 if nothing is done. Atlantic Richfield plans to spend $48 million to build two plants to treat the water indefinitely at a cost of $14 million a year. The plan is to add lime to the water and neutralize the sulfuric acid, allowing the metals to precipitate out. But the process creates 1,000 tons of lime sludge each day, which would be dumped backed into the pit or stored in a lagoon.
MSE Technology Applications is studying other ways to treat the water, and to remove copper and other metals in order to help offset treatment costs. MSE looked at about 150 proposals and was evaluating 15 that seemed most promising. The water contains $250 million to $300 million worth of metals, but they are so diluted that it might cost more than that to extract them using current technologies.
One idea that works, at least chemically, is another precipitation scheme, in which sulfides are added to the brew. This makes the metal ions heavier, which means the most valuable metals, copper and zinc, precipitate out and could be sold. It would reduce the sludge to 300 tons a day, from 1,000. "Chemistry is straightforward, but the economics of building a treatment plant are another matter," said Mary Ann Harrington-Baker, manager of MSE's Heavy Metals Program.
Higher concentrations of copper and zinc in the water -- 30 percent instead of 3 percent -- would actually make a precipitation process very profitable and offset much of the cost. "Our two-beer scenario is to pour acid down the mine shaft and up the level of copper and zinc," Ms. Harrington-Baker said.
Although it is easy to get one or two metals out of the water, a half dozen other elements are left as waste. When a recent story about the problems with the pit appeared, Mr. Tuck of MSE said he was inundated with calls from back-yard inventors who said they had a solution, including one near Pittsburgh.
"We sent them five gallons of pit water, and I went and watched while he cleaned it," Mr. Tuck said. "He even drank it. But he had a gallon of sludge left over."
Down the valley from the pit is Silver Bow Creek, the small meandering stream where gold was originally found. Seven smelters lined the creek at one time. Thousands of tons of tailings laden with heavy metals were dumped along its banks. This stream was so polluted that 26 of its 30 miles had no fish.
Atlantic Richfield moved and buried the tailings, and planned to build a plant to treat the water with lime. Instead, engineers designed and built a two- to three-acre artificial wetland, complete with cattails. Contaminated water from the creek is pumped into a reservoir behind the wetland and seeps through the mud at the rate of three to five feet per day.
Bacteria in the mud consume carbon and oxygen from decaying plants. Once they deplete the oxygen, the bacteria begin to eat the sulfur from the acid mine drainage and make it more alkaline. As the water becomes more alkaline, the zinc and copper precipitate out, like the standard lime treatment. The water flows through another artificial swamp, where it is reoxygenated, forcing out the methane and hydrogen sulfide gases.
"Contrasted with a system with a lot of lime, it's cost-effective," said Sandy Stash, who directs the cleanup operation for Atlantic Richfield in Montana, "But it's not cheap." The method has been used in other areas, but is unproven over the long term in a harsh climate like Butte's, with its long winters. Because the pit water must be treated indefinitely, Atlantic Richfield hopes the system will need far less long-term maintenance.
Other biological cleaning systems have proved useful. At the Montana Post and Pole Site near Butte, where mine timbers were treated with creosote, engineers have experimented successfully with mushrooms that absorb the tarlike substance from the soil, and are harvested and hauled away. Now they are using bacteria that eat creosote.
But the best solution for acid mine drainage may be the simplest. The solution, called a "submerged bioreactor," is nothing more than cow manure dumped into a mine. Engineers have been dumping cow manure into the Lily Orphan Boy Mine near Elliston, Mont., for five years to see whether it would neutralize acid discharges into nearby Telegraph Creek.
Bacteria feed on the manure, raising the alkalinity of the water and increasing precipitation, similar to the mud in the artificial wetland. The bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide, which combines with the metal ions to make them easier to precipitate. The result is clean water in the creek. The remedy may soon be used in some of the hundreds of thousands of abandoned mines around the West.
"It's simple," said Marietta Canty, a senior environmental engineer with MSE who has worked on the project. "But it's also cost-effective and it works. We have a lot of cows in Montana, so we're all set."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Big-Ship Economy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
There was a funny political cartoon recently, spoofing the fact that nothing President Clinton does seems to affect his poll ratings -- as long as the stock market keeps rising. The cartoon showed a newscaster announcing that a severed head had been found in Mr. Clinton's sleeping quarters in the White House, but with the Dow having reached a new record high the U.S. public was indifferent.
Lately the whole world has started to remind me of that cartoon. I half expect Dan Rather to begin the evening news one day like this: "And here are tonight's headlines: India and Pakistan leveled each other's capitals today with nuclear bombs. The Taj Mahal went up in a mushroom cloud. In Moscow today, Russia declared bankruptcy and closed for business. In Asia, the Thai, Korean and Indonesian economies sank into depression, while in Japan, the country's political leadership was in such a state of confusion the main headline in one Japanese newspaper screamed: 'The People of Japan Are Home Alone.' Meanwhile, OPEC was in disarray today as the price of crude oil fell again, making gasoline much cheaper than Diet Coke. But on Wall Street, the Dow hit a new record high on expectations of higher corporate earnings. . . ." 
 How long, oh Lord, how long can the U.S. keep thriving while everyone else is in turmoil? Is America now on another planet or what? I posed that question to Goldman, Sachs' renowned market analyst Abby Joseph Cohen. Her answer: It can last longer than you might think.
Ms. Cohen argues that the U.S. economy is a lot like a supertanker -- not the prettiest of ships, not the fastest, but once it got on the right course, once the U.S. Government and leading corporations went through the necessary deregulation and streamlining to get ready for this era of rapid technological change and global markets, "this U.S. supertanker is not easily set off course, and it's the sort of ship you want to be on when the seas get rough."
Sure, the U.S. must care about what happens abroad, says Ms. Cohen. After all, America is the world's largest importer and exporter. But the U.S. economy is so big that foreign trade is still only 13 percent of overall U.S. economic activity, which remains "quite robust," notes Ms. Cohen. Moreover, U.S. foreign trade is divided pretty evenly among Western Europe, Asia and North and South America. So while Asia's on its back, Canada, Latin America and many Western European countries are getting stronger.
Also, notes Ms. Cohen, when you look into the U.S. economy you see that America, for the most part, is not competing with China to sell stuffed toys or VCR's, which have become commodities. We aren't even competing with Malaysia to sell basic computer chips. An increasing portion of U.S. exports are advanced technology items or high-level services -- all of which have a high value-added component and are not easily substituted by some lower-cost producer. There is no Korean alternative for Microsoft Windows 98. There is no Thai version of Andersen Consulting.
Moreover, what is hurting so many other countries -- the fall in the price of oil and other commodities and the slowdown in Asia -- helps keep inflation and interest rates low in America. This combination of falling gas prices and interest rates has amounted to a huge tax cut for Americans, and with the U.S. economy now restructured it can take full advantage of these lower input costs. Japan, Germany and France, by contrast, are still hybrid economies. They have some truly world-class, restructured, globalized companies -- like Toyota and Sony -- but also a lot of laggards. That's why America's markets today have replaced gold as the place many people want to put their money in times of uncertainty.
So what could wipe the smile off America's face? Everyone is waiting for some "event." But there really was no event that triggered 1929 or October 1987. What America is most vulnerable to is actually a subtle, collective change in mood -- so the next time the market dives, instead of lots of people buying on the dip, and therefore putting a bottom under any market fall, they sell on the dip. Yes, there are some solid fundamentals underlying America's strength today, and those competitors and investors who underestimated them have lost a lot of money. But overestimating can be just as dangerous. "Strong" and "invulnerable" are two different things. That's why the only thing we have to fear is the lack of fear itself.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Securities Are Mixed Prior to Greenspan Testimony

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were mixed in light trading yesterday, with gains limited to the longer maturities as investors wait for a report to Congress on the state of the economy by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.
The 30-year bond rose 16/32, to a price of 105 28/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.71 percent, from 5.74 percent on Friday. 
 Trading in the bond market yesterday was lighter than usual, with about $34.6 billion in securities traded through the major bond brokers by about 3 P.M., according to Govpx, a bond pricing service. Volume was down about 30 percent compared with an average Monday in the third quarter of last year.
Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking Committee this morning to deliver the first part of his semiannual testimony. He will conclude the testimony tomorrow before the House Banking Committee.
Many in the market expect him to suggest there is some slowdown in the economy, making a rate increase by the central bank unlikely. The Fed has not adjusted short-term rates since March 1997, when it raised the Federal funds rate, or target rate for overnight loans between banks, by 25 basis points, to 5.50 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
While the testimony from Mr. Greenspan is expected to be followed closely by investors, they will also be following the selection of a new prime minister in Japan this week to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto.
The following are the results of yesterday's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The media wait anxiously as G.M., in wake of strikes, cuts back substantially on spending.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE media are nervously assessing how much they may suffer as a result of the labor problems now hampering operations at the General Motors Corporation.
"What can we do except cry a little bit?" Brian McMahon, senior vice president and group publisher at Car and Driver and Road & Track magazines in Los Angeles, asked rhetorically. "We just hope it ends quickly." 
 "G. M. is our largest single corporate advertiser and has been for a number of years," he added. "You just hope you can make it up."
General Motors is the nation's largest advertiser as well as the largest auto maker, having spent $2.2 billion last year on sales pitches for cars, trucks and mini-vans, according to figures compiled by the Competitive Media Reporting unit of VNU N. V. That represented a 30.1 percent increase from the $1.7 billion that G. M. spent on advertising in 1996 and helped make 1997 a record year for American ad spending.
But strikes at two parts plants by the United Automobile Workers union have forced G. M. to halt nearly all production in North America. The losses G. M. is sustaining as a result -- more than $75 million a day -- led the company to significantly curtail ad spending across the board during June and July to save money.
Now those cuts have been extended through August, a top G. M. executive said yesterday, though they would be offset partly by a television campaign that may start as soon as Thursday. The commercials will remind consumers that despite the labor unrest, many vehicles remain unsold on dealer lots.
The substantial reduction in ad spending "is unfortunate, but it has become necessary because we are in a cash conservation mode," said Philip Guarascio, vice president and general manager for marketing and advertising at the North American operations of General Motors in Warren, Mich. He confirmed a report about the extension of the cutbacks that appeared in the trade publication Advertising Age.
"What hurts is that we had such terrific momentum going in the spring, particularly in June," Mr. Guarascio said, referring to vehicle sales that had been stimulated by incentives. "The biggest issue is that this has stalled us in the market."
G. M. is making ad-spending decisions "on a month-by-month basis," he added, "to give the media as much lead time as possible."
"We haven't gone dark," he added, because "there is some limited model advertising" for vehicles like the Pontiac Grand Am and Cadillac Catera, "and we plan to support the launches of big new vehicles like the Silverado and Alero." Still, the G. M. budget-slashing has affected virtually all media, many of which depend on the auto maker for large portions of their total annual ad revenue.
"It's just a very frustrating situation for everyone," said David Long, president for media sales and marketing at the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. in New York.
"And as we head into the fall," he added, when advertisers traditionally spend the largest portions of their annual budgets, "it's whoo boy!"
"I sit by the phone every day and wait," Mr. Long said of his largest advertiser. "We're a big enough company that we can weather this, but not happily."
G. M. has ranked first among all advertisers in magazines, network television and the yellow pages, according to Competitive Media Reporting, as well in first among national advertisers in newspapers. The company ranks second in national spot radio, cable television and spot television, again according to Competitive Media Reporting data.
"G. M. has cut spot TV back considerably across the country, which impacts the economy of the television business," said Ave Butensky, president of the Television Bureau of Advertising in New York, which represents close to 500 local stations.
"Historically, G. M. usually has a large inventory of unsold cars at this time of the year," he added, "so the company would continue advertising" even though the model year was winding down.
Mr. Guarascio said the media "have been super-cooperative" as G. M. turned back commercial time that had been bought on television, moved out of space that had been ordered in monthly magazines and deferred buying pages in weeklies.
"Our contracts ask them to provide their best efforts to help when we need it," he added, referring to clauses related to strikes and other business difficulties, "and they have. We understand the sacrifices being made and once this gets settled -- and it will -- we will take that into account as the money comes back."
In the meantime, however, the media anxiously await developments.
"G. M. is one very important client and obviously we're keeping an eye on the situation," said Harold Shain, president of Newsweek magazine in New York, a unit of the Washington Post Company. "We'll do what we can to help them ride it out."
Newsweek carried almost 104 ad pages from G. M. in the first six months of 1998 -- more than any other magazine, according to the Publishers Information Bureau and Competitive Media Reporting.
"Other categories have been up significantly," Mr. Shain said, "such as finance, technology and business, which have helped make up somewhat for pages in the automotive category being down."
At the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications, which owns magazines like Details, GQ, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Vanity Fair and Vogue, "the fickle finger of fate has certainly fallen on us," said Peggy Daitch, vice president for corporate sales and marketing, Detroit, who is based in Troy, Mich.
"G. M. executed the strike clause, canceling business in September and October issues," she added. "A number of our September issues were already on press or printed, but we canceled out whatever we could."
"Some of the divisions are talking about rescheduling ads for later months, depending on the strike ending," Ms. Daitch said, adding with a chuckle, "But we may run out of months." Her meaning: those pages may arrive too late for 1998 and not be tallied until 1999.
At Hachette Filipacchi, the unit of Lagardere Group that owns Car and Driver and Road & Track, "there have been some cancellations, beginning with October issues," Mr. McMahon said.
"That's not unexpected," he added. "When you have no days' supply of a vehicle, why advertise it?"
But G. M. dealers have many days' supply of many vehicles -- more than 600,000, according to The Detroit News, which reported yesterday that G. M. was developing a campaign to promote sales of already-built cars and trucks.
"Press reports have been somewhat misleading" about supplies, Mr. Guarascio said. "We have a lot of inventory in a lot of places for a lot of brands, especially on the East and West Coasts."
"So we're going to launch television advertising, possibly on the 23d, to tell consumers we have plenty of cars and trucks," he added. "It won't look like a local retail ad for a furniture store; the tonality will be upbeat and positive, not like a fire sale."
Mr. Guarascio read from a proposed storyboard for a commercial, footage for which was shot over the weekend on dealer lots from coast to coast. The campaign will "run a couple of weeks," he said, "primarily as a traffic-building effort"; the theme will most likely be "Lots of cars, lots of trucks, lots of deals."
The campaign will be created by McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy, Mich., Mr. Guarascio said, which is the agency for G. M.'s Buick division. McCann is a division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

HEADLINE: Operating Gain For McDonald's

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill., July 20

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation reported higher second-quarter operating earnings today despite weak economies in some international markets, including Asia, and strong competition in the United States market.
It cautioned, however, that because of difficult earnings comparisons in the second half of the year, it did not expect to sustain its current level of profitability. It fell $2.6875 today, to $70.5625, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 McDonald's reported second-quarter operating income, before charges, of $468.8 million, or 66 cents a diluted share, on total revenues of $3.18 billion. That compared with $438.2 million, or 61 cents a share, on total revenues of $2.83 billion a year earlier.
The company's second-quarter operating earnings were in line with analysts' estimates, as reported by the First Call Corporation, which tracks such forecasts.
The second-quarter results excluded $350 million of pretax special charges related to McDonald's "Made For You" and home office productivity initiatives. Including the charges, the company had net income of $233.8 million, or 33 cents a share, down nearly 47 percent from $438.2 million, or 61 cents a share, in the comparable quarter of 1997.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
I.B.M. Earnings Up a Bit, Despite Hardware Woes

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that its earnings edged up four-tenths of a percent in the second quarter as sharp declines in hardware sales were offset by gains from the company's computer services and software divisions.
I.B.M. earned $1.452 billion, compared with $1.446 billion for the corresponding quarter a year ago. That represents $1.50 a share, a penny more than analysts had expected. 
 The per-share earnings increased by 5.4 percent because I.B.M. has been buying back its stock, so more of its earnings are attributable to each remaining share. The company's sales were flat at $18.8 billion.
Over all, analysts expressed disappointment at the lack of sales growth but said that the company seemed to be gaining control of its hardware problems.
"It wasn't a great quarter, but the outlook for the second half is optimistic," said Gary Helmig, an analyst with Soundview Financial.
Sales of computers and other hardware declined by 13 percent, to $7.5 billion, as several of the company's business lines were hurt.
The economic slowdown in Japan, long an important market for I.B.M., continued to drag down hardware sales. Moreover, sales slowed for I.B.M.'s most powerful mainframe computers, the System 390, as customers delayed purchases in anticipation of an improved model that will be available in August. I.B.M. had hoped that customers would buy its older mainframe model and then upgrade later, but fewer than expected decided to take this more complex route.
Sales of personal computers fell by more than 25 percent from a year ago, as the company tried to reduce the glut of PC's in the inventory of its dealers. I.B.M., like its competitors, has offered buyers various financial incentives.
In total, I.B.M.'s sales to dealers were flat in terms of the number of units, but the dealers' sales of their I.B.M. inventory increased by 25 percent, said Douglas L. Maine, the company's chief financial officer. As a result, he said, total PC inventory in the United States fell by four weeks' supply, although he declined to quantify the supply on hand.
I.B.M. is trying to streamline the distribution of its personal computers by having many of them assembled at its distributors and dealers. As a result, Mr. Maine said he expected the company's PC business to improve in the second half of the year.
I.B.M. was also hit by the declining prices of D-RAM memory chips, the type most commonly used in personal computers. Although this is a small part of I.B.M.'s semiconductor business, the 70 percent price decline was big enough to cause some pain.
In addition, the company has faced slow sales of its Unix and Windows NT servers, computers that store files for a corporate network or for Internet sites. The company attributed these shortfalls to mismanaged marketing.
The strong dollar continued to drag I.B.M.'s earnings because so much of its business is outside the United States. The company said that currency conversion shaved 4 percent off its revenues and 13 cents off its earnings per share.
"Currency remains an issue for the second half, mainly because of the yen," Mr. Maine said in a conference call with analysts.
The gem in I.B.M.'s business line was again the global services business, which operates computer systems and provides consulting for businesses. Services revenue grew by 22 percent, to $5.6 billion, or 30 percent of total revenue.
Software, long a slow-growing but lucrative business for I.B.M., pepped up slightly, with revenue increasing by 5 percent, to $3.2 billion.
"A lot of people think of I.B.M. as a hardware company," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "But services and software are where the profits are coming from."
I.B.M. shares gained $1.8125, to $122, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company released its earnings report after the market closed.

HEADLINE: National Health Scare

BYLINE: By Kay Bailey Hutchison; Kay Bailey Hutchison is a Republican Senator from Texas.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Four years ago the Clinton Administration tried to federalize one-seventh of the American economy by creating a government health care system that would have limited our choice in doctors, cost millions of jobs and created new bureaucracies and tax increases. The American people and Congress soundly rejected the plan.
Since the public wouldn't swallow the whole hog, this time the Administration is serving it up slice by slice. The President vowed in a speech before the Service Employees International Union last September that he would carry out his health care plan "one step at a time until we eventually finish it." 
 As a result, President Clinton and the Democrats have unveiled a new plan for reforming health maintenance organizations -- a one-size-fits-all approach that would drive up health care costs, strangle small business and cost the American people millions of jobs and billions in take-home pay.
An estimated 140 million Americans are currently covered by managed care plans. As in any high-growth industry, managed care suffers from inefficiencies and growing pains. Many patients don't know what benefits are available under their plans and are rightfully upset when they cannot determine the course of their treatment.
For these reasons, Republicans and Democrats have both come up with bills that help patients know what their rights are. Some provisions are similar. Both plans would require managed care companies to disclose information on costs, benefits and quality of care. Medical records would be kept confidential. Women would be allowed to go directly to obstetricians and gynecologists without getting a referral. Patients would be allowed to appeal an H.M.O.'s decision to an independent panel.
But the differences between the two parties' plans are stark and important to understand. The Democrats' plan is not a "patients' bill of rights," but, as some have pointed out, a "lawyer's right to bill." Their legislation would use the courts as the first line of appeal for patients dissatisfied with their coverage. The Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick recently estimated that the costs of litigation alone could increase the cost of the average policy by as much as 8.6 percent. This would result in lost health insurance for as many as 1.8 million employees, the Barents Group concludes.
Simple reforms can protect patients without driving up costs or encouraging unnecessary litigation. Texas recently enacted a patients' rights bill that allows patients to sue their H.M.O.'s, but the process includes mandatory review by an independent panel, reliance on expert witnesses and the posting of bonds to reduce frivolous lawsuits.
Even without the costs of litigation, the Democratic plan would be a disaster for patients and their employers. The plan has 359 separate Federal mandates that would drive up the cost of health insurance. Managed care plans under state regulation would be controlled by the Federal Government, leaving states less room to innovate.
A recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office concludes that these Federal mandates would drive up health care costs by $25 billion and increase the cost of premiums by 4 percent. These costs, according to the Lewin Group, a public policy organization, would put the cost of health care coverage beyond the reach of one million Americans next year alone.
Republicans favor medical savings accounts that allow families to tailor their plans according to their specific needs. Although President Clinton supported a modest program for medical savings accounts just last year, he opposes the Republican proposal to expand this popular program to working families.
Congress should pass a patients' rights bill that allows states to develop plans of their own. Our model should be welfare reform, which set guidelines, then allowed states to figure out the best solutions.
This issue is too vital to leave to an Administration that has already shown it cannot be trusted to reform the finest health care system in the world.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING: It's a Long, Uphill Ride To Racing's Big Leagues;
But St. Julien, a Black Jockey, Is on His Way

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE 

DATELINE: GRAND PRAIRIE, Tex., July 19

 BODY:
Not too long ago, Marlon St. Julien was another clean-pants rider in the rundown jock rooms of Louisiana's Evangeline and Delta Downs, an afterthought on a second-rate circuit waiting for a break. He was young, inexperienced and black.
He was aware of the rich heritage of 19th century African-American jockeys in thoroughbred racing. But day after day after day, as he got passed over for mounts and saw how few other African-Americans were riding, he began to wonder what it would take to succeed in a profession dominated by white and Latin athletes. 
 Now, at age 26, St. Julien is ready to find out. His is a tale of how talent and perseverance sometimes needs a 49-1 long shot in the very first race at a brand-new Texas track to find the winner's circle. And stay there. Two Aprils ago, St. Julien brought home a colt named I Are Sharp in Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie's Premier Stakes.
His pants have shown the shadows of sweat ever since. He won the riding title at this summer's Lone Star meet, which ended Sunday, with a runaway 78 victories worth more than $1.7 million in purses. He is closing in on 1,000 career victories with nearly $8 million in purse money despite a slow start in picking up good mounts that seems at odds with the talent he has shown.
"I've worked hard to become a good rider," St. Julien said in a recent interview, "and I believe the trainers think of me in only that way."
St. Julien has already moved his tack to Hawthorne and the high-profile Chicago circuit at the invitation of the longtime jockey agent Harry Hacek. The Hat, as Hacek is known, has previously helped move riders such as Steve Cauthen, Alex Solis and Chris McCarron to the sport's top level. "The goal is to ride in California, to become one of the best and to ride in the Kentucky Derby," St. Julien said.
 The 5-foot-2-inch, 110-pound Louisiana native is focused on the future, but conscious of the past. He rattles off the fact that black jockeys won 15 of the first 28 Kentucky Derbys. That a pair of black 15-year-olds are the two youngest jockeys ever to win the race -- Alonzo Clayton aboard Azra in 1892 and James Perkins on Halma in 1895.
"You know about Isaac Murphy? How he won three Kentucky Derbys, two of them back to back?" he asked, referring to the Hall of Fame rider who won the 1884, 1890 and 1891 Derbys. "We've been around for a long time."
Maybe so, but no African-American has ridden in the Kentucky Derby since Jess Conley in 1911. When asked to name the current crop of black riders, St. Julien was silent.
The Jockey's Guild has 900 registered riders, according to the organization's national manager, John Giovanni. But race is not specified in the registration process, and Giovanni said he could not be sure how many African-Americans are actually riding. Best guesses are less than 5 percent. This much is sure: None have made a dent on the rich New York, California and Kentucky circuits.
African-American jockeys began disappearing from the race tracks as the last century turned and the economy shifted from agrarian to industrial. "Most were very young and either employees of the farms or former slaves," said Phyllis Rogers of the Keeneland Library in Lexington, Ky., which houses an extensive collection of works about African-American riders of that era. "Like a lot of people at that time, they went to the cities for jobs in manufacturing."
Also contributing to the disappearance of African-American riders were factors such as the influx of new immigrants and the difficulty of making weight, factors that are still at work today. First, it was the Germans and Irish who began appearing as riders. Now, jockeys from Latin America and the Caribbean are major players at tracks across America.
"Each generation of Americans has gotten bigger," Giovanni said. "It's hard to make the scales. We've seen the Latin riders come. Now we have growth in women riders who don't have as difficult a time making weight."
At Lone Star, a successful second-year track that is part of the Texas-Louisiana-Arkansas circuit, St. Julien is known as a talented money rider. Three weeks ago, he powered the Texas-bred Mocha Express to an upset, come-from-behind-victory over a talented field -- which included Bob Baffert's graded stakes winner, Anet -- to capture the $200,000 Lone Star Handicap.
For St. Julien, it was the richest victory of his career. For many trainers here, it was a sign that the rider who has earned the nickname "the Saint" wasn't going to be around much longer.
Larry Robideaux, one of Lone Star's leading trainers, compares St. Julien to Eddie Delahoussaye and Kent Desormeaux, whom he once used as riders before they moved on to bigger tracks. "He's a strong finisher," Robideaux said. "He can ride a speed horse. He listens to instructions. He's got the timing, power and soft hands. He's the best I've seen come up in a long time. He's ready for California or New York right now."
St. Julien was introduced to horse racing as a boy by his mother, Cynthia Sargent, an elementary school teacher whose brothers owned and raced thoroughbreds in the horse-crazy country around Lafayette, La.
As an honor student in high school, St. Julien was determined to play football. He said he became obsessed with weight training and dietary supplements enough to blow up to 140 pounds. A couple of good hits at practice made him think it was less dangerous on top of a 1,000-pound horse. He lost the weight, though not the strength, and in the summer before his senior year applied for a jockey's license. "I was surprised and more than a little scared," his mother recalled.
"I wanted him to go to college," she said. "I didn't want him to get hurt. It crossed my mind that we hadn't seen but a few African-American riders in the time we went to the races."
In the first month of his riding career, St. Julien had a nasty spill at Evangeline. When he woke up at Lafayette General Hospital with a fractured sternum, broken ribs, lacerated liver and ruptured spleen, St. Julien told his mother he was college bound. But he recovered "too quickly and returned to the track," she said with a laugh.
Harder to take, however, were the idle days he spent in the jockey room waiting for a break. St. Julien is careful about blaming racism for his slow start in Louisiana. But he conceded that he got frustrated when his childhood friend Robbie Albarado and other white riders got mounts he knew he could ride. "I got paranoid," St. Julien said. "There's still a lot of prejudice in this world.
"I don't know, I might have lost some mounts."
The question is difficult to duck. Robideaux, who is based in Louisiana, said St. Julien had to earn the benefit of the doubt in the minds of some owners and trainers. Albarado, now based in Kentucky, moved more quickly through the Louisiana circuit and this year rode in the Kentucky Derby. Although he is a year younger than St. Julien, Albarado has ridden nearly 2,000 more races, has 500 more victories and has earned more than $25 million in purses.
"I have had a few people tell me they would never ride him," said Richard Price, St. Julien's agent for the last two years, "but eventually they come back around because he's a great rider."
St. Julien has established a reputation as an intelligent, hard-working rider who will exercise up to a dozen horses for trainers in the mornings. Shy and easygoing off the track, he turns professorial when breaking down a horse's workout performance as the trainers step quickly to follow him back to the barn.
"He's an intelligent, very polite kid," said the trainer J. Keith Desormeaux, whose brother Kent rides Real Quiet. "I wanted to put him on a horse before I ever saw him race because he has so much respect for the game. Looking good on a horse, which he does, is only half the battle.
"You got to be level-headed. Not carouse at night. Show up in the mornings. He does all those things."
There's an urgency to St. Julien's climb up the jockey ladder. He and his wife, Denise, are expecting their first child in the winter. And though their addresses have changed over the years, Vinton and Shreveport in Louisiana and now the Dallas area, their home has remained the same: a 40-foot trailer. More than getting to ride in the Kentucky Derby, St. Julien longs to land a job at a top track and build a house for his family.
Last summer, St Julien rode the fair circuit in California after Gary Stevens, a Hall of Fame rider, encouraged him to go West. The two met last year at the inaugural All-Star Jockey Challenge created by Lone Star Park. Stevens was impressed with St. Julien and said, "He's got all the tools."
St. Julien did well on the fair circuit, then went to try his luck at Santa Anita. He worked out horses but never got a mount, which is not unusual for the toughest jockey colony in the country. He was discouraged, but took heart in what Stevens told him one day in the jockey room: that he had proved his talent. Now it was time for patience.
St. Julien said he had thought about that conversation a lot and what it would take to reach the big time. "I know about patience," he said. "I'll get there."

HEADLINE: Administration Staying Out Of G.M. Strikes, for Now

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 20

 BODY:
Last year, the Clinton Administration blocked a strike against American Airlines and leaped in to resolve a walkout against the United Parcel Service.
But 46 days into strikes at the General Motors Corporation that have idled 26 factories and more than 186,000 workers, the Administration has made no such move. President Clinton has not even mentioned the dispute publicly for more than a month, and he spoke about it then only in answer to a question. "I would like to encourage the parties to work it out," he said then. 
 Nor has Mr. Clinton spoken directly with leaders of the United Automobile Workers or G.M., aides said.
Yet the Administration's action -- or inaction -- is consistent with labor law, labor politics and labor history, particularly within the intense and sophisticated tradition of auto bargaining.
Neither the U.A.W. nor General Motors has asked the Government to step in -- as the parties did during the U.P.S. strike -- and they never have in the past. With a 60-year history of bargaining between them, the union and the company fiercely believe in their ability and their right to handle their own disagreements without state or Federal interference.
"The mediator just gets in the way," said Douglas Fraser, who was the president of the U.A.W. from 1977 to 1983. "He wouldn't add anything."
Alexis M. Herman, the Labor Secretary, has offered the parties the use of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, but they have not taken her up.
In an interview today, she noted that collective bargaining in principle was not supposed to involve the Government. "This really is bargaining by the parties and not bargaining by the Government," she said. Ms. Herman was here for a convention of the American Federation of Teachers, which Mr. Clinton addressed today.
Ms. Herman said that unlike the labor confrontations last year, "these talks have not broken down, they continue to negotiate." She described her role as insuring "that they are at the table and that they are talking and working through these differences."
"That's the important role for this Administration, given that they are still bargaining in good faith," she said.
The President does not have the legal authority to step in, as he did in the case of American Airlines, according to the Administration and outside labor experts. Under the Railway Labor Act, which also governs labor relations in the airline industry, the President has the power to impose a cooling-off period in the event of a strike that threatens commerce or travel. But under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs auto strikes, he may not step in unless the strike imperils "the national health and safety" and affects an entire industry.
"We certainly don't believe this strike has reached that level of impact," Ms. Herman said.
John T. Dunlop, a Harvard professor who was Secretary of Labor under Gerald R. Ford, said that the company, the union and the Government were conducting themselves in this dispute much as they have over six decades of labor turbulence in the auto industry. "It is in keeping with past practices," he said.
Despite his public silence, President Clinton is said by aides to be closely monitoring the dispute. Every day, he receives a stack of clippings about it and a memorandum breaking down the number of workers idled in each state. Ms. Herman said that she speaks to both sides frequently and is tracking the economic impact of the strikes in the industry and beyond. She said today that she was becoming concerned about reports on the damage caused by the strikes at two parts factories in Flint, Mich., to G.M.'s vendors and suppliers.
G.M. is losing about $75 million a day. And that, from the union's perspective, is one more reason for the Administration not to intervene. To the union, any Federal interference would weaken its most precious power, the financial damage caused by a strike. (Today, about 300 U.A.W. leaders gathered at a hotel in Flint to map out strategy.)
Auto workers and unions generally remain an important, if diminished, element in the base of the Democratic Party. And that base of loyal voters will be particularly critical in the midterm elections this year, as less politically active voters are likely to stay home from the polls. Despite misgivings about Mr. Clinton's centrist policies, union members have proved stalwart supporters of the President, who has presided over an economic boom that has meant high overtime pay for most auto workers.
Administration officials are now awaiting the outcome of arbitration between the union and G.M. that is scheduled to begin on Wednesday. The arbitrator will decide whether the strikes represent an illegal walkout that violates the company's national agreement with the union. If the arbitrator rules that the strikes are illegal, G.M. has asked for a court order to end the strikes, as well as to grant financial penalties against the union. That outcome, one official said today, would make any question of Government action moot.

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 20

 BODY:
Courting world opinion is not something most Japanese politicians are good at or consider important to their success, but Seiroku Kajiyama, one of three candidates to become the next Prime Minister, took a stab at it today.
Mr. Kajiyama held a news conference for foreign reporters at the governing party's headquarters, an event about as common in Japanese politics as the passing of Haley's comet. He fielded questions about his policy proposals, addressed the issue of his age -- he is 72 -- and otherwise explained himself. 
 It was a chance to burnish his image in the West as a forceful leader and in turn to influence the party leaders' choice. His effort to get his message heard beyond Japan is yet another measure of how bizarre, by traditional standards, the current political race has become.
"You don't have to be a genius to figure out that international markets are having an influence on who will be picked as the Prime Minister here," said John Neuffer, a political analyst at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute.
The fact that there is such public lobbying is extraordinary. The choice of the governing Liberal Democratic Party has traditionally emerged from smoke-filled rooms after long hours of political wrangling among the powerful heads of the party factions.
But on Thursday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was widely regarded as a shoo-in to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto as Prime Minister, found himself confronted with a competitor from his own faction -- Mr. Kajiyama -- later joined by Junichiro Koizumi, a popular upstart.
Mr. Hashimoto's resignation on July 13 was itself a surprise, forced by an angry electorate that reduced the size of the Liberal Democrats' delegation in the upper house of Parliament and by younger party members suddenly emboldened by the fear that they would lose their jobs.
Add to that two televised debates on Sunday and Mr. Kajiyama's news conference today, and it appears that Japanese politics have fallen through the looking glass.
Mr. Kajiyama is keenly aware of Japan's global profile. He repeatedly noted the importance of a Japanese economic recovery to Asia and the rest of the world, including the United States and Russia. "Japan has to take responsibility for the position it has in the global economy," he said, a statement that echoed comments by United States officials.
In addressing his age, he said that if Japan could not turn itself around during his lifetime, it would be in "grave trouble."
He sought to soften his image as a loose cannon. In 1990, when Mr. Kajiyama was Justice Minister, he ordered a roundup of foreign prostitutes in the Shinjuku area of downtown Tokyo, saying they "ruin the atmosphere" and comparing them to blacks moving into white neighborhoods in the United States.
The comment, he said today, "reflected my ignorance at that time, because I grew up in a village where we did not have different ethnic groups."
"In Japan, we have an adage, 'A pheasant would not be shot if it had not crowed,' " he said. "If I hadn't become a candidate, no one would have said anything about this, and I knew that but decided to run anyway."
But it is precisely Mr. Kajiyama's willingness to open his mouth that has landed him in the unlikely position as a contender for party president, who automatically becomes Prime Minister because of the Liberal Democratic majority in Parliament's lower house.
He has vigorously criticized Japan's shaky banking system and the Government's efforts to repair it, reversed his commitment to fiscal austerity and accused the powerful Finance Ministry of obfuscation and violation of trust.
Mr. Kajiyama clearly sees shoring up the country's faltering financial system as his primary goal. For that, he is the darling of world financial markets, which seem to regard Mr. Obuchi, the leading contender, as a sign of more of the same dithering that was seen during Mr. Hashimoto's reign.
Mr. Kajiyama says the Government's recently announced "total plan" for fixing the nation's financial system would serve as a basis for resuscitating Japan's debt-laden banks, although he suggests that the plan does not go far enough because it lacks two critical elements: forced disclosure of the extent of the banks' problem loans and a plan for final disposition of the bad loans.
Similar criticism has been leveled by foreign analysts, several of whom Mr. Kajiyama consults regularly.
But Mr. Kajiyama faces an uphill battle by most calculations. Mr. Koizumi threatens to lure away younger party members who would otherwise throw their support to him. But party rules require a runoff election should any candidate fail to win a majority, so a pure Obuchi-Kajiyama face-off is still a distinct possibility.
Mr. Kajiyama tried to enhance his image as a reformer today when asked to handicap his chances. "I cannot destroy the unity of the L.D.P. factions by myself," Mr. Kajiyama said of the party that has run Japan for most of the last 40 years. "With Mr. Koizumi, who is very strong, running, we can destroy that."

HEADLINE: In Climb Up the Ladder, Married Blacks Are Choosing Small Families

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
In virtually every way, including the size of their family, John and Paula Lawrence are quintessentially middle class.
They live in a white brick Colonial in the leafy upper Northwest section of Washington. He is a commercial real estate lender. She is an audiologist. Their daughter, Candice, 12, attends private school, plays violin in a citywide youth orchestra and studies origami. Their son, John Paul, 6, has yet to develop the patience needed for such pursuits, but his parents are confident that in time he will. 
 The Lawrences, who devote a lot of time and energy to their children, are also adamant that they will have only two.
In their decision to limit the size of their family, the Lawrences are an example of a little-noticed but striking trend in the nation's black population: a steep decline in the birth rate for married African-American couples. Married black women gave birth to 357,262 babies in 1970. But by 1996, the last year for which complete figures were available, that figure had dropped to 179,568, a decline of nearly 50 percent, nearly twice the drop in the birth rate among married white women.
Most of the reasons for the sharp drop in child-bearing among black women are universal: higher family incomes, more education, movement away from parents and relatives who can provide support and child care. As more black families move up the economic ladder, they are following the well-worn path of other ethnic groups and reducing the size of their families.
But some who have studied the phenomenon also say the slowdown in the birth rate among two-parent black families is caused by some forces not found in the larger white population. Black couples often want to maximize the benefits they can give to their children so that the offspring will have a better chance to compete in a society the parents feel is racist, these expert say.
"I've talked to numerous African-American parents who really are very serious about making sure their children are having rich, rewarding experiences so that they start life with an advantage and not disadvantage," said Dr. William Turner, a professor of family studies at the University of Kentucky.
The sharp drop in the birth rate for black married couples has resulted in something of a statistical conundrum. It has contributed to what has been described as a "crisis" of illegitimacy in the black population, where nearly 70 percent of babies are born to single mothers. The number of single black women bearing children has increased steeply, rising to 415,213 in 1996, from 215,100 in 1970.
But statisticians and demographers point out that the startlingly high percentage of black children born outside of marriage is not merely the result of more single black women giving birth. The percentage of single black women giving birth has been declining since 1989, and reached a 40-year low in 1996. Instead, the high proportion of black babies being born out of wedlock is now mainly a function of its statistical comparison to the steep drop in the number of black children being born to married black women.
Experts say the trend means that married black couples, whose median household income is rapidly approaching parity with their white counterparts, are able to give their children more of the advantages of enhanced economic status, like better housing, better schools, more material goods, more opportunities for travel and cultural enrichment.
"I don't think either one of us ever thought in terms of having three or four kids," Mr. Lawrence said. "I didn't have any fast or hard ideas not to. I don't think Paula had any fast and hard ideas not to. But I don't think we ever really contemplated more than two."
But experts warn that because incomes for single black mothers remain stagnant and the rates of their having children have not slowed as rapidly, the sharp decline in the percentage of married black families having children could widen the class divisions among blacks.
"I do think that the potential for these rifts to be exacerbated is terrific," Dr. Turner said. "Unless there is some constructive, meaningful dialogue and some organizations that are strong in the black community get involved and deal with this in a meaningful way, I think you will see those rifts grow even more and more and more."
The disparity in birth rates between married and unmarried women is a subject of discomfort and concern among several black families interviewed. Some expressed concern that not enough married African-American couples were having children, though that criticism was directed toward those who were childless, rather than those who had only one or two offspring.
"I've said that many times," said Paula Jackson McClain, manager of Federal disability programs for the public schools in the District of Columbia. "We have so many young black girls having babies who really can't afford to have them. It's a shame that our black families who have two-parent homes and the economic resources to provide for their children aren't having any children. If you're not having children, how can you say what our future will look like? If the numbers are coming from parents who are too young, or don't have the same educational drive and don't reinforce that in their children, then we're kind of letting down our own race."
Skip and Brenda Woods Francis have two sons, 11 and 7. The couple lived for a time in Zaire, and Mr. Francis said that the help provided there by others might have allowed them to have a larger family.
"If we had not returned to the United States we might have had three, maybe four, children," said Mr. Francis, 46, who is director of AIDS research for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. "Comparing living there with living here, the biggest difference is infrastructure and support system. When we lived in Zaire we could literally say we need to go away for two years, and the neighbors would take the child or children and take care of them until you come back."
Wanda Newman, 44, a teacher in Prince Georges County, Md., has only one sibling. Her husband, Dominic, 45, a ground maintenance foreman for the National Park Service, is one of 13 children. The couple has two sons, 19 and 16.
"If I can produce two responsible adults, I'm happy," Ms. Newman said. "If they can go to college, get out and work, have a solid religious background, I don't feel bad about not having any more."
Women in several families who were interviewed said that small families had become the norm, that it was hardly spoken of anymore.
"The only one I've ever spoken with about it was a friend of mine who has four kids," said Ms. McClain, 36, whose children are 1 and 9. "When she was expecting her fourth child, she said to me that only one person ever really congratulated her. Usually people's response to the news was, 'Well, I'm happy for you, if that's what you want.' It was as if she had done something inappropriate and not something you should be jubilant over."

HEADLINE: NEW NIGERIA RULER PLEDGES ELECTIONS EARLY NEXT YEAR

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, July 20

 BODY:
Pledging democracy but also playing for time, Nigeria's military Government said today that it would hold elections in the first three months of next year and hand over power to a civilian President on May 29, 1999.
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who took over as President last month, announced his plans for the creation of what he called "an unfettered democracy" in a speech to the nation that amounted to a clear rebuke of the staggeringly corrupt dictatorship of his late predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha. 
 The President, dressed in full military uniform, said he would release all political prisoners jailed by General Abacha, allow the free formation of political parties, reinforce the judiciary, permit international monitoring of elections, reform the prison system and put an end to what he called "lapses" in the management of public funds.
The televised speech, in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, was clearly intended to convince the United States and other Western governments that a page has been turned in Africa's most populous nation, and to allay seething anger at the death in detention this month of the leading opposition figure, Moshood K. O. Abiola.
But while vowing to eradicate the legacy of General Abacha, the new President opted for caution. Apparently bowing to military hawks who argue that Nigeria is vulnerable to fragmentation among its more than 200 ethnic groups, he rebuffed opposition calls to hand over power by Oct. 1 to a civilian government of national unity that would organize elections.
In a thinly veiled denunciation of General Abacha, who died on June 8 with his country in a state of economic collapse and international isolation, General Abubakar said: "We must admit that mistakes have been made. In particular, our most recent attempt at democratization was marred by maneuvering and manipulation of political institutions."
General Abacha, whose appetite for personal enrichment was matched only by his ruthlessness in imprisoning his opponents, had made himself the only candidate for presidential elections that were to have been held on Aug. 1.
Arguing that a civilian government of national unity would be "full of pitfalls and dangers," and potentially unrepresentative, General Abubakar said, "We will not substitute one undemocratic system for another." He added that his administration "has no desire whatsoever to succeed itself." That commitment may not win over many Nigerians. Democracy has repeatedly been dangled before this country's 105 million citizens. It is likely that the general's pledge to leave office in 10 months' time will be doubted until it happens.
Some opposition figures were inclined to stand their ground. "The date of May 29 is by no means as short a time as some of us have asked," said Clement Nwankwo, an opposition lawyer. "But if the date if really respected, then it may be acceptable."
The program outlined by General Abubakar appeared broadly in line with suggestions made by the Clinton Administration, which was skeptical of the idea of a government of national unity. Although the 10-month extension of military rule is perhaps longer than American officials here had expected or favored, the Administration has been inclined toward caution in a country with multibillion-dollar American investments in the oil industry. Nigeria is the fifth-largest provider of oil to the United States.
The death of Mr. Abiola, the opposition leader whose apparent victory in the last presidential election in 1993 was annulled by the armed forces, has sharpened Nigeria's pent-up demand for an end to military rule and accentuated ethnic tensions in the country. Mr. Abiola was from the Yoruba of the south, and the general who canceled the elections was from the north.
General Abubakar spoke respectfully of Mr. Abiola, but said calls to return to the past were "unhelpful and impractical." He urged Nigerians to move forward "with confidence in the present and hope in the future."
Resentment and bitterness are, however, virulent among Mr. Abiola's followers, and they are certain to be unhappy with a program for democratic transition that takes no account of his seeming victory in 1993 and again places supervision of elections in the armed forces' hands.
The President, who attended several military training programs in the United States, said he would scrap the electoral commission set up by his predecessor and create a new independent one empowered to organize "free and fair elections" fought by new political parties.
"All the existing five political parties are hereby dissolved," General Abubakar said, referring to the groups created by General Abacha to back his plan to succeed himself, "and their assets will be taken over by administrators." New parties, he added, will be free to form and organize themselves without any military supervision.
Elections for regional governments held under General Abacha were also scrapped because of "their widespread lack of credibility."
However, at a time when ethnic suspicions are intense in Nigeria, General Abubakar warned against the formation of parties along ethnic lines. He urged all politicians to narrow their differences and work for "the formation of parties with a national following."
It was far from clear, however, that this call would be heeded when the Yoruba feel cheated by Mr. Abiola's death and convinced that the next leader should be Yoruba. Many Yoruba say that the eventual election of somebody from the northern Hausa or Fulani, who have tended to dominate military governments, would be unacceptable.
The armed forces have long argued that their continued hold on power was necessary to hold the country together. But the debacle of General Abacha's rule, the ruin of a potentially prosperous economy, and the move to democratic governments across Africa appears to have reluctantly convinced many Nigerian officers that power must now be ceded to civilians.
General Abubakar said his administration would "breathe into the conduct of government a fresh air of accountability." He demanded that "all public officers demonstrate transparency and uprightness in the conduct of goverment."
Before his speech, General Abubakar announced that he had pardoned and would release 10 prisoners sentenced in what General Abacha had called a 1995 coup plot. They included three prominent journalists -- Ben Charles Obi of the now defunct magazine Weekend Classique, George Mba of the magazine Tell, and Kule Ajibade, editor of The New Tempo.
No mention was made of two other journalists -- Niran Malaolu and Bagauda Kalto -- who are believed to be still in prison. Widespread rumors suggest that Mr. Kalto may have been killed by Abacha supporters.
General Abubakar did not name a new Cabinet to replace the one dismissed earlier this month, but indicated that he would try to bring a wide spectrum of Nigerian politicians into the government.
One of the many critical questions hanging over the transition plan announced today is what constitution will govern it. General Abubakar suggested that a constitution formulated under General Abacha but never promulgated may be approved by his military government after being presented to Nigerians.
This constitution is said by officials who have seen it to call for a system under which the presidency would rotate between different regions of the country. How such a system would work in practice remains as unclear as the ultimate ambitions of a Nigerian Army that has never stopped promising democracy but has ruled for all but 10 years since independence in 1960.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Backs $17 Billion for Russia, but Delays First Payment

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
The board of the International Monetary Fund endorsed a $17 billion emergency rescue plan for Russia tonight and formally approved its own $11.2 billion share. But the fund trimmed back its first payment in an effort to force the reluctant Russian legislature to enact austerity measures.
The decision was announced after a closed-door meeting that lasted hours, which seemed to reflect the enormous risk the fund was taking. Russia has repeatedly failed to live up to commitments it made in return for far smaller loans than the program supported today. And on Friday the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament, left Moscow for summer vacation without passing some significant elements of Russia's commitments. 
 The fund responded tonight by reducing its first payment to $4.8 billion from $5.6 billion, said Stanley Fischer, its No. 2 official. The fund apparently believed the $800 million reduction would not rattle the markets but would still warn the Duma.
Russia will get the withheld $800 million if it fully complies with the fund's conditions, which include unpopular new taxes and vigorous tax collection -- in a country where few people even file tax returns.
"Weaknesses in implementation have been the Achilles' heel of Russia's economic policies in the past," Mr. Fischer said in a statement tonight. "Thus it is critical that Russia take advantage of this opportunity to make the fundamental changes in economic policy that are needed."
The deal struck last week between the fund and Russia called for more than $17 billion in new loans to be issued during the next 18 months, including the aid from the World Bank and Japan. The fund's next $5.6 billion installment will come in September if Russia demonstrates its compliance with the agreement.
Even as the board began its meeting, President Boris N. Yeltsin's staff was scrambling in Moscow to come up with new decrees that would partly satisfy the I.M.F.'s conditions. Russia's chief negotiator with the fund, Anatoly B. Chubais, said in Washington this evening that he had worried during the last three days about the possible collapse of the sizable deal worked out last week.
He said he did not believe that the $800 million reduction would harm Russia's recovery. "If it is less than $1 billion there will be no major impact," he said.
Mr. Chubais attended the I.M.F.'s board meeting today and was questioned intensivelyabout the depth of Russia's commitments.
Both American and I.M.F. officials are acutely aware that if a bailout of this size fails, it will only fuel the growing criticisms of the fund's performance, which sparked to life again today on Capitol Hill.
As the fund's board met, one of its leading House critics, the majority leader, Dick Armey, said he would lead a floor fight to block an $18 billion increase in the United States' I.M.F. contribution. He appeared to be reversing course from a speech he had given last week, in which he said he expected that the fund would get as much money as the Administration sought, with few conditions.
But Representative Robert Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, said the troubles in Asia and Russia had persuaded him to support the $18 billion contribution. He is Mr. Armey's likely rival for Speaker should Newt Gingrich seek the Republican nomination for President.
"I think the economic argument for the I.M.F. is marginal at best," Mr. Livingston said in an interview with Bloomberg News Service, "but I do think that there is a psychological and political element that calls for us to support it now." He noted that the Senate had already approved the $18 billion contribution, and said "a majority in the House" were in favor.
The divisions among the Republicans reflect the party's growing suspicion of powerful international organizations as well as its concern about appearing inattentive to an economic crisis that is beginning to affect American businesses.
The agricultural lobby, for example, favors the additional aid because a drop in grain and other exports to the afflicted countries is depressing commodity prices.
And no one on Capitol Hill has yet been heard directly criticizing the bailout of Russia, perhaps for fear that if the fund is prevented from acting, there may be a demand for direct American support, the kind of bilateral loan that President Clinton extended to Mexico three years ago. So far the Administration has not offered direct aid to Russia, even the kind of "backup financing" it offered South Korea and Indonesia (neither of which has yet received the aid).
The strategy that emerged today was to hold back some of the first installment of aid. But the fund concluded that it was too risky to cut off Russia entirely in the midst of an economic crisis that has clearly weakened President Yeltsin.
"This is not a moment to kick Yeltsin because some of the Communists in the Duma stood in the way," one American official said. Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to leave for Russia this week, and American officials clearly have an interest in not plunging Russia back into a crisis during his visit.
The I.M.F. money is intended to bolster Russia's reserves of foreign currency, thereby avoiding a forced ruble devaluation. But a key requirement is that Russia assure a steadier flow of tax revenues.
Among the changes the legislature has failed to make was a requirement that local tax offices send tax revenues to Moscow. In return, Russia's provinces would be permitted to impose sales taxes. The Duma approved the sales taxes, but not the measures to assure that more payments are directed to Moscow rather than sitting -- often unaccounted for -- in regional offices.
In a statement sent to the I.M.F. today, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and the chairman of Russia's central bank, Sergei Dubinin, said they had acted unilaterally to increase revenue to the Government and reduce the budget deficit.
Investors appears buoyed even before the fund acted. They exchanged nearly $6 billion in short-term Russian treasury bills for longer-term bonds, a step the fund had urged to ease Russia's debt burden. The attraction for investors is that the longer-term bonds are denominated in dollars, not in rubles. That means the Russian Government, not the investors, would be caught short if Russia devalued the ruble.

HEADLINE: Casino Changes the Fortune Of a Hard-Luck Illinois City

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.

 BODY:
The Casino Queen riverboat arrived here five years ago, docking along the grimy riverfront of what was then the epitome of a dying American city.
Raw sewage backed up into the streets. Piles of trash shared the landscape with vacant and burned-out buildings. Murders were rampant, yet there was not enough money to buy gas for police cars. The city's debt was so high that when a man who was physically abused while in jail sued the city in 1990 and won, he was awarded the deed to the defendant's only asset of value: the building that housed City Hall. 
 "I drove into town at night and missed the exit off the highway because there were no lights on downtown," recalled Cheryl Childress, who after leaving East St. Louis 30 years earlier returned to her hometown in 1993 to become the casino's human resources director.
The arrival of the casino changed much of that. While many regions have turned to casinos to invigorate languid economies, perhaps no other city in the nation has become so quickly reliant on casino revenue -- and avoided imminent extinction -- simply by opening a place where people could gamble legally.
Over the last five years, the Casino Queen, now second only to the local hospital as the largest employer in East St. Louis, has brought 1,200 jobs to this predominately black city of 42,000 people just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. Today, nearly 50 percent of the city's operating budget comes from tax revenue generated by the casino.
"With my city, it's the lifeblood," Mayor Gordon W. Bush said of the four-story, side-wheeler gambling boat that cruises in the shadow of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. "If I take away a month of revenue from the casino, I start missing paydays for city workers. We fall on our backs without that money."
As casino gambling has spread across the country, the verdict on whether it ultimately hurts or helps communities is still out. A Presidential commission is expected to report next June on the effect that the proliferation of casinos and other forms of gambling has had on the nation.
The economic advantages of casino gambling are profoundly evident in places like the Gulfport region of Mississippi, where 62 percent of the 18,000 jobs created since 1990 were at casinos, as well as in Joliet, Ill., where two riverboat casinos pay the third and fourth largest amount of property tax in the city.
In East St. Louis, the impact of casino gambling has been dramatic. Once a strutting blue-collar town of stockyards, meat-packing plants, railroads and after-hours nightclubs, the city began to decline when its industries stumbled in the 1960's. Its population -- 82,000 in 1960 -- dwindled as many white residents moved out. So precipitous was the decline that by the time the state approved a license for the Casino Queen to open in 1993, few residents fervently opposed bringing legalized gambling to their community.
"Even the ministers who don't like gambling have not been openly negative about it," said Mayor Bush, a burly 55-year-old retired Army lieutenant colonel who has announced plans to seek a third term next year.
East St. Louis is still one of the poorest cities in the United States, however, and not everyone here is so sanguine about the gambling boat. Boarded-up buildings still line many streets. And although half of the casino's jobs have been filled with city residents, the unemployment rate here remains above 10 percent, and could be much higher because many of the chronically unemployed are excluded from the count because they are no longer looking for work.
The most commonly heard grievance is that the casino has not hired enough local people or used enough local vendors. Few people, even the leaders of the city's more than 100 churches, have been ardently opposed to the casino itself.
But the Rev. Walter Shackelford Jr., pastor of the Rush Memorial Church of the Nazarene, a small church just east of the downtown area, said his congregation still sees few benefits from the casino.
"Since the casino opened they have put a police substation in our area," Mr. Shackelford said. "But none of my members or anybody I know of is employed by the casino. We are still poverty stricken."
The direct impact of the casino, as well as its ripple effect, is significant, however. The city has used the approximately $9 million it receives in casino tax revenue annually to begin to reverse its long decline. Broken sewers have been repaired, streets have been paved and more than 1,200 derelict buildings have been demolished.
The city's police force has nearly doubled, and now has 98 officers. The number of patrol cars has also about doubled, to 73. Officers now have full medical coverage; several years ago, police officers had to pay their own medical bills when they were wounded.
Crime has decreased in most of the nation's cities, but the 100 percent increase in police protection here has led to an especially large drop. The number of murders, for example, peaked in 1991 at 68, but so far this year there have been only 14. Firefighters now have more than $1 million in new equipment, while their ranks have increased to 60 firefighters from about 45.
More important to the city's sustained survival is that the estimated three million people who visit the casino each year actually venture into East St. Louis, where people once feared that they were gambling with their lives if they visited. Casino and police officials note that no serious crimes have occurred in or near the casino despite the influx of visitors. This, many people here said, is changing the city's reputation and causing other businesses to consider developments in East St. Louis.
"When you get three million people to go somewhere that no one thought anyone would go to, then obviously there's some opportunity in that place," said Craig Travers, the casino's general manager.
Most of the people who visit the casino come across the river from Missouri, Mr. Travers said. Since it opened in 1993, the Casino Queen has led the region, which includes six casinos in Illinois and Missouri, in total gambling revenue. The Casino Queen Inc., which last year posted a total revenue of $131.8 million, is privately owned by five different groups.
And the casino's economic impact continues to grow. One private developer, Koman Properties, expects to begin construction this year on a supermarket, drugstore and video store. The company's president is James G. Koman, whose family holds 20 percent of the equity in the Casino Queen.
Another developer is planning a 72-room, $3 million hotel adjacent to City Hall, and the Union Bank of Illinois is planning to open a branch across the street. Along the riverfront, the Casino Queen is breaking ground this year on a 150-room $15 million hotel and a $5 million entertainment center. And Mr. Koman has been buying land to develop a $22 million golf course on a 200-acre site next to the casino complex.
Of the 600 city residents who were hired when the Casino Queen opened, about 35 percent came off the welfare rolls, casino officials said. Before she started working at the casino five years ago, Katrina Williams was raising her young daughter alone, earning $4.10 an hour working part time at a doctor's office, living in public housing and receiving welfare checks. Now 32 years old, she has been promoted several times at the casino and is earning $28,000 as an employment specialist, screening job applicants.
Ms. Williams's life has evolved in a way that casino officials said has become common among employees. Over the last few years she has bought a new car, got married and bought a house in another suburb of St. Louis "with an in-ground swimming pool and a basketball court," she said.
Based on the mortgage applications that they complete for employees, casino officials estimated that the casino jobs have created more than 200 homeowners. But, because of the poor housing stock and poor schools in East St. Louis, many casino employees have moved to other suburbs of St. Louis.
Mayor Bush and local developers hope that the exodus can be stopped. Besides the casino tax revenue, another $7 million that the casino paid to purchase some of its 95-acre riverfront property is also being used to finance something this city has not seen in years: the construction of new houses. Sixty new homes have already been built, and 200 more mixed-income houses are planned.
By renegotiating with its creditors and issuing bonds backed by the State of Illinois, the city has been able to lower its outstanding debt to about $13 million from $80 million, Mr. Bush said. In all, the city's operating budget has gone from about $6 million a year before the casino arrived to $20 million today.
East St. Louis has also regained ownership of City Hall after appealing the court decision and renegotiating a settlement with the man who won the lawsuit. On the lampposts lining the street in front of City Hall, large banners serve as not-too-subtle remainders of what has made this fiscal rebirth possible. "Chi-ching," one banner reads. "Jackpot," says another.

HEADLINE: After '97 Deal, New Showdown Over the Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Just a year after President Clinton and the Republican leadership succeeded in reaching a bipartisan balanced budget agreement, the two sides are again headed toward a showdown over taxes and spending.
Republicans have eviscerated Mr. Clinton's proposals for education, the environment, job training and child care, among other programs, continuing their assault on what they consider excessive Government spending. The Administration has already issued seven veto threats against spending bills, seeking to restore financing for what Mr. Clinton considers important initiatives or to delete language that would impose ideological conditions. 
 Bolstered by projections showing that the Federal budget surpluses will be bigger than Congress had expected, Republicans have stepped up their calls in recent days for a big tax cut. In doing so, they are defying Mr. Clinton's demand that any surpluses be placed off-limits until the two parties settle on a plan to shore up Social Security.
With both parties eager to emphasize their differences heading into this fall's Congressional elections, White House officials and Republican leaders are bracing for a confrontation in late September and early October, when Congress will try to finish its work for this year and allow members to head home to campaign.
"We certainly hope we can avoid the kind of crisis we've had in the past," a senior Administration official said. "But I must say, looking at where we're going, at the moment it appears that whether we want a conflict or not, we're headed toward some degree of conflict."
To some extent, the battle is ritualistic, with the White House and Republicans, especially those in the House, playing roles that have become familiar. Hard-line rhetoric is likely to give way to a degree of pragmatism when it is time to negotiate in earnest.
Republicans remain divided about how hard to push for deep tax and spending cuts, with moderates in the Senate balking at the plans being pushed by economic and social conservatives in the House. And since being blamed for shutting down the Government after their standoff with the White House in 1995, Republicans have proven willing since then to grant the President some of what he wants to avoid gridlock and Democratic charges of extremism.
For his part, Mr. Clinton has proven adept at casting compromise as victory, as in last year's balanced budget agreement.
Still, neither party is shying away from a fight. The Republicans are seeking to energize conservative voters, those most likely to turn out on their behalf in November. The Democrats believe they have positioned themselves well on critical issues, including improving education and child care and defending the environment and Social Security.
The squabbles over tax and spending priorities come against a backdrop of broader partisan struggles over social and economic issues like assuring quality health care, curbing smoking and limiting abortion. And with tension also running high because of the Whitewater independent counsel's investigation of Mr. Clinton, the bipartisan spirit that was briefly evident at the time of last year's budget deal is nowhere to be found.
The Administration's veto threats on the spending bills encompass a wide range of issues. The White House wants more money than the Senate is providing for the Interior Department's environmental and Indian programs and for the Energy Department's energy conservation efforts. It objects to the House's termination of one of Mr. Clinton's pet projects, the Americorps national service program.
Last week, Mr. Clinton strongly criticized the House version of the bill financing education, job training and child care, saying Republicans were "turning their backs on America's young."
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said that Mr. Clinton was again showing "a high predilection for discretionary social spending programs," and that the Congress would head off the White House's creeping efforts to expand Government.
"I would characterize it as the same old debate in a new context," Mr. Armey said, referring to the turnabout from huge budget deficits to the prospect of equally big surpluses in coming years.
"The context is in our favor," Mr. Armey said. "I believe we can accomplish a great number of things for the American people, including a tax cut, and it will be very nearly impossible for the Democrats to vote against it and the President to veto it in that context."
Indeed, the growing estimates of the size of the Federal budget surplus are reshaping political calculations. Even if the two sides can compromise on the spending bills, conservative Republicans, particularly in the House, seem intent on forcing a confrontation over taxes this year.
The most immediate catalyst was the Congressional Budget Office's report last week concluding that the surplus over the next decade would be about $1.6 trillion, more than double its estimate of a few months ago.
So emboldened are Republican tax-cutters by the projections that they are convinced they can defy Mr. Clinton's demand that the surplus be off-limits until Congress and the White House settle on a plan to deal with the Social Security system's looming problems. Fear of being portrayed as putting tax cuts ahead of saving Social Security has left many Republicans wary until now of pushing for a big tax reduction.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Friday that the budget office's surplus estimate over the next decade was about $1 trillion higher than it was when Mr. Clinton made his "Social Security-first" pledge early this year.
As a result, Mr. Gingrich said, Congress can set aside more than $600 billion for Social Security and still afford a $1 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years. That would be far bigger than the $100 billion, 5-year package that until now had been the goal of the party's conservative wing, or the $30 billion, 5-year reduction sought by Republican moderates in the Senate.
Mr. Gingrich is floating the idea of a package that would include tax cuts for many two-income couples, reductions in the capital gains and estate taxes, and tax cuts intended to help the elderly -- a component designed to neutralize any Democratic attacks over Social Security.
But while a big tax-cutting plan has the support of most Republicans in the House, it would face a difficult time in the Senate. Moderate Republicans like Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island have warned that they could not support the spending cuts necessary under current rules to pay for a $100 billion tax cut, and they are urging Congress not to go higher than $30 billion.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee, said the new surplus projections made him sympathetic to calls for bigger tax cuts in the long run. But for now, Mr. Domenici is confronting not only the objections of his own party's moderates but also Congressional budget rules that bar using the surplus for tax cuts. It would require 60 votes in the Senate to change the rules, a hurdle that would be all but impossible for Republicans, who have 55 Senate seats, to overcome this year.
White House officials are taking extra steps to point out that Mr. Clinton is not against substantial tax cuts, but that he does not want to consider them until the country has dealt with Social Security.
Mr. Clinton, in remarks to reporters on Friday, said it would be a mistake "to be talking of spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a tax cut based on projected surpluses that may or may not materialize, before we have spent the first dollar to save Social Security so that you aren't going to have to support your parents in a way that diminishes your standard of living."
In a preview of the strategy that Democrats are likely to use if Republicans press ahead with a big tax cut, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, said he was eager for a debate about "our Social Security protection versus their recklessness with regard to fiscal responsibility in using Social Security trust funds for tax cuts."

HEADLINE: Mayor Wants To Abolish Use Of Methadone

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani outlined plans to dramatically expand his workfare program to include drug addicts, he veered unexpectedly from his prepared speech yesterday and announced his desire to abolish all methadone treatment programs for heroin addicts in New York City.
Mr. Giuliani, who criticized the programs for replacing a dependency on heroin with a dependency on methadone, acknowledged that he could not unilaterally take such action. Federal and state officials provide about 92 percent of the financing for methadone treatment in New York, Federal officials say. But Mr. Giuliani said he would still lobby to reduce the role of the programs in the city, which has the largest concentration of recovering heroin addicts in the country. 
 "Over a period of time, hopefully within the next two, three or four years, we will phase out and do away with methadone maintenance programs in the City of New York," Mr. Giuliani said.
His comments quickly created a furor in the drug-treatment community. Methadone treatment has been embraced by the National Institutes of Health, by Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy chief, and by other drug rehabilitation experts, who have all called for an expansion of the program, which they describe as the best hope for recovering heroin addicts.
"He said what?" asked Don C. Des Jarlais, the director of research for the Chemical Dependency Institute of Beth Israel Medical Center and an expert on heroin addiction. "From a public health standpoint, that has to be one of the more ridiculous things for any public official to have said over the past 30 years.
"It implies that he was either misunderstood or misspoke, or he does not have much of an understanding of drug abuse treatment for heroin addiction," Mr. Des Jarlais said.
Federal drug officials, too, expressed astonishment. "The Mayor of New York City said that?" said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Does he realize this is scientifically considered to be the best treatment for heroin?"
About 36,000 heroin addicts receive methadone treatment in New York City, according to Wendy Gibson, a spokeswoman for the state's Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse. Ms. Gibson, who said state officials still supported the program, declined to comment on the Mayor's speech, saying her office would have to review it.
Dr. Robert G. Newman, a heroin expert and the president of Continuum Health Partners, the parent company of St. Lukes-Roosevelt and Beth Israel, said he supported the Mayor's efforts to push methadone patients into the work force.
But he said Mr. Giuliani's attack on methadone treatment reflected a common misunderstanding. Dr. Newman compared methadone to insulin for patients with diabetes and blood-pressure drugs for those suffering from hypertension.
"When someone has never before taken methadone, there will be effects like sleeplessness and euphoria, but the methadone maintenance patient does not get high from it," Dr. Newman said. "For the heroin addict, the purpose of methadone is to allow a person to feel normal, not to feel high."
The Mayor caught even some of his own city officials by surprise as he strayed from the prepared text of a speech that focused on his plan to require virtually all adults on welfare to work for their benefits by the year 2000.
Under the new policy, only the most severely disabled people will continue to receive cash assistance without working. The rest -- currently about 340,000 adults -- will be required to participate in workfare or to find private-sector jobs. The initiative, modeled after a policy in Wisconsin, would create the largest welfare program in the country to have a universal work requirement.
But Mr. Giuliani, who has been promising for months to enforce a universal work requirement, received the most sustained applause from supporters and welfare officials when he announced his plan to end the methadone treatment program. He described drug addiction as the most serious stumbling block on the road to putting most people on welfare to work, but he emphasized that drug addicts should learn to recover without medication.
"What we should be teaching in drug-treatment programs is the more difficult, but the much more loving and caring, attempt to try to reintegrate into a person the ability to take care of their own life," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Giuliani, who revolutionized the city's welfare system by creating a workfare program that has sharply reduced the welfare rolls, has already pushed hundreds of the disabled and the drug-addicted into workfare. Additionally, welfare officials have begun to discourage the poor from applying for welfare, urging them to rely on relatives, charity and work. And this year, the number of people on public assistance plunged to its lowest point since 1967.
But putting the universal work requirement into practice will be a much more daunting feat, and the problems posed by welfare recipients suffering from drug addiction is only one of many obstacles ahead.
Only about 22 percent of adult welfare recipients are working, and city officials must now confront the task of moving about 260,000 people into workfare or private-sector jobs over the next 18 months.
Some welfare caseworkers, union officials and advocates for the poor doubt the city can develop enough workfare positions, private-sector jobs or child care slots to support such a transition. A similar plan announced in 1996 never materialized. Today, about 36,000 people participate in workfare, and city officials say that number is expected to increase by only about 4,000 over the next year.
But Mr. Giuliani dismissed doubts about his plan yesterday, saying he was confident that New York City's strong economy and workfare program could easily absorb thousands of welfare recipients.
"We're going to end welfare by the end of this century completely," Mr. Giuliani said. "Everybody in this city will work, with the possible exception of people who are truly disabled or, for some short period of time, are unable to work.
About 30,000 people on public assistance have been excused from working, he said, because they were participating in drug-treatment programs. Under the new plan, he said, drug addicts will work and receive treatment. Since March of this year, 1,139 drug addicts have been assigned to workfare slots, city officials said. They did not have estimates for the number expected to be working in the next 12 months.
Advocates for the poor fear the city will not spend enough on support services for welfare recipients moving into the work force. City officials said yesterday that there were no plans to substantially increase the investment in child care.
"I think the Mayor is right to emphasize work, but it's important to know what's happened to people who are denied assistance initially or leave the rolls later," said Jack Krauskopf of the Graduate School of Management and Urban Policy at the New School for Social Research.
Mr. Krauskopf, who ran the city's department of social services in the 1980's, said the Mayor's universal work requirement was a worthy goal. "But it's a very difficult goal to get to," he said.

HEADLINE: Ending Welfare

 BODY:
Speaking in the executive dining room of a local bank yesterday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced his goal for New York City's poor. "We're going to end welfare by the end of the century completely," he promised. The old system would be replaced by a "universal work requirement" for anyone hoping to receive financial help from the city. Like his crime and civility campaigns, turning welfare recipients into independent citizens sounds like an aim worthy of the Mayor's energies and ambitions. One question is whether the Giuliani administration is increasingly shifting people from welfare to work or shoving them into other kinds of dependencies. Another is whether citizens will be able to get the information that will enable them to separate accomplishments from hype.
In his text, the Mayor argued that even Democratic heroes like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Robert F. Kennedy felt that welfare deprived citizens of dignity and incentive. As those views were supplanted by a less discriminating compassion for the poor, welfare rolls in New York City surged from 250,000 in 1960 to 1.2 million when the Mayor took office five years ago. Since then about 400,000 people have left the city's welfare system. 
 A booming economy plus shifts of some of the elderly poor and disabled to Federal rolls could account for a drop of almost 300,000 on the city's welfare roster, according to advocates for the poor. What happened to the others is still a mystery, although a state court has ordered the city to hand over welfare records to The Times. Now, with a new system of Job Centers, the idea is to shift recipients to work and drug treatment programs and to discourage applicants before they apply in the first place.
The Mayor's experimental Job Centers replacing welfare offices in Greenwood, Jamaica, Long Island City and Staten Island require a welfare applicant to meet with a "financial planner" whose job it is to find alternatives to cash from the city. This planner also reminds the applicant of a five-year lifetime limit on welfare and gives notice that some work is necessary to receive a check.
If the burden is on the welfare applicant to find other support or to do the most menial private or public jobs to receive welfare, the burden is on the city to make certain that the poor and their 420,000 children currently on welfare are not neglected. Drug addicts, the disabled and new mothers must have help converting to the Mayor's work-for-welfare system. Decent child care must also be available for those taking jobs to get their public checks, and some kind of training is needed to shift those on workfare to real jobs. If Mayor Giuliani wants to boast on the national political circuit about ending welfare in New York City, he must be careful not to create a beggar class in the process.

HEADLINE: Post Gets $24.4 Million in Incentives to Stay in New York

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
For the second time in two years, The New York Post has received large tax breaks and other subsidies from city and state officials after threatening to move some of its operations out of New York City.
Officials have granted the newspaper $24.4 million in incentives to build a new printing plant on 17 acres at a rail yard in the South Bronx. The deal, which included a $12.9 million cash grant from the state that was approved yesterday, has been criticized by community groups, environmentalists and some politicians who doubted that the company actually intended to leave New York. 
 Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for economic development, said the deal would enable The Post to build a $200 million plant and transfer 400 valuable manufacturing jobs to the South Bronx from the company's printing plant on South Street, near the Brooklyn Bridge. City and state officials had feared that The Post would follow The Daily News to Jersey City, where that newspaper opened a printing plant last year.
But critics say The Daily News has had occasional problems transporting newspapers through the tunnels into Manhattan during the morning rush, a problem that would discourage other newspapers from moving operations to New Jersey.
"It's another case of the city and the state throwing away hard-earned tax dollars on a company that would not have left the city anyway," said Franz S. Leichter, a State Senator from the Bronx. "Certainly, The Daily News shows the folly of moving these kind of jobs to New Jersey."
In addition to the $12.9 million grant from the Empire State Development Corporation, the deal brings The Post $4 million in sales tax breaks and $7.5 million in low-cost electricity from the New York State Power Authority.
"This is a great opportunity to keep and grow manufacturing jobs in the city," Mr. Levine said.
The Post is not the only newspaper to obtain subsidies. In 1992, The New York Times got a benefit package worth more than $29 million for a new $315 million printing plant at College Point, Queens. The following year, The Daily News got more than $15 million in tax breaks from New Jersey to move its printing operations from Brooklyn to Jersey City.
The Post and its parent company, News America, have now gone to the bargaining table with New York officials twice in recent years. In 1996, the city granted News America a $20.7 million package for the company's new headquarters at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, at 47th Street, after it had threatened to move some employees outside New York. News America transferred 400 editorial employees at The Post to the midtown building from South Street.
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday that News America had refused to include the printing plant in the original deal.
He said that the latest agreement with The Post cost a modest $9,600 per job to keep the Post printing plant in New York City, far less than the subsidy given The New York Times. "We're getting jobs in the South Bronx for a good price," Mr. Millard said.
Mr. Millard's calculations did not include both the value of the electricity from the State Power Authority and the $12.9 million in cash benefits granted by the state. All told, the deal to keep 400 manufacturing jobs cost taxpayers about $61,000 per full-time job.
The Post project would benefit further from millions of dollars in tax benefits and training grants that are available because the site of the new plant in the Bronx is within the city's Empowerment Zone.
The plant is to be built in what is known as the Harlem River Yards, in the Port Morris section of the Bronx, and the project also includes an adjacent eight-acre parcel where the Walnut Avenue bus depot sits.
The bus depot had been scheduled to close in two years, but the Post deal forced the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to move 220 buses to five depots in the Bronx and upper Manhattan and to spend an additional $1.6 million to speed the completion of a bus depot along the West Side Highway in Manhattan that will open when the Walnut Avenue depot closes.
Lawrence B. Reuter, president of New York City Transit, has acknowledged that it would cost more to run Bronx buses from a depot in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Hold H.M.O.'s Liable for Bad Care

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is disappointing to see President Clinton and his Democratic colleagues champion the right to sue ahead of all other patients' rights enumerated in proposed managed care legislation (news article, July 17). As both political parties weigh in with proposals for such legislation, the right to sue stands out as a divisive issue that could kill any chance for meaningful reform. 
 Of course managed care plans should have to pay when their decision to deny care results in physical or economic injury. The most expedient means toward that end is to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which was intended to regulate pension plans, so that it no longer regulates employee benefit plans.

Singapore's Exports Had 6.1% Gain in June

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Exports of goods made in Singapore posted a gain of 6.1 percent in June, reversing two months of decline, helped by higher electronics exports to the United States and Europe. Still, the Government warned that the better-than-expected numbers might not signal an economic turnaround. 
 June's export expansion was led by a 9.2 percent rise in shipments of computer chips. A decline in May amid reports of excess chip inventory and slowing PC sales had led economists to expect the beginning of a slide in exports. May's trade report was particularly grim as trade was roiled by turmoil in neighboring Indonesia and weak United States and Europe demand.

HEADLINE: Group Proposes Voluntary Guidelines for Internet Privacy

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
In a continuing effort to head off new laws governing how companies can collect and use personal information gathered on the Internet about consumers, an industry coalition today proposed a voluntary enforcement program to certify World Wide Web sites that comply with privacy guidelines.
Under the plan offered by the Online Privacy Alliance, Web sites that comply with the group's guidelines could display a seal of approval. 
 While privacy advocates said the measure fell far short of the level of enforcement that is needed, the Clinton Administration, which has been critical of the electronic commerce industry's initial progress in policing itself, applauded the proposal.
"I think the enforcement mechanisms that they are putting in place are what we have been calling for," said Ira Magaziner, Mr. Clinton's top adviser on electronic commerce. "Now what we need to do is monitor it to see that it really happens."
The proposal was shown privately to Administration officials today. It will be publicly disclosed on Tuesday at a Congressional hearing on on-line privacy. Several recent polls have indicated that privacy is the No. 1 concern for Internet users.
The proposed enforcement policy calls for appointing a third party to monitor compliance with the guidelines, which, among other things, require that consumers be told in advance what information is being collected and what it will used for. It would also establish a system to resolve consumer complaints.
Christine Varney, a former Federal Trade Commission member who is working with the coalition, said, "To increase consumer confidence in cyberspace, companies need to have an independent and trusted third party validate compliance with clearly stated policies and confirm that companies are engaged in credible self-regulation."
But some privacy advocates said the proposal did not go far enough.
"We have concerns that the whole process of the alliance is voluntary, that it is a self-selecting pool of Web sites willing to engage in fair marketing practices," said Jeff Chester, spokesman for the Center for Media Education, a nonprofit children's advocacy organization in Washington. "This scheme does not protect all consumers."
The F.T.C. earlier this year surveyed 1,400 Web sites and issued a report that found private-sector initiatives seriously lagging, especially regarding information collected from and about children.
In its report, the commission recommended that legislation be passed to protect children from on-line marketers. Several bills have emerged, including a proposal by Representative Ed Bryant, a Tennessee Republican, that would give the F.T.C. the authority to write and enforce rules for protecting children on the Internet.
While support for mandatory protections for children is almost universal, business and privacy groups are divided over whether laws are needed to cover adults.
The Online Privacy Alliance, representing 50 companies and marketing groups, is leading the push for self-regulation. Last month, it released a set of privacy guidelines on the eve of a meeting called by the Department of Commerce to assess self-regulation efforts.
The Commerce Department is drafting a report for President Clinton on whether self-regulation is working.
Commerce officials lauded the alliance's goals but chastised companies for not having self-enforcement plans in place. Today's proposal attempts to answer that concern. The program would include periodic reviews of companies' practices and a complaint resolution system for consumers. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 22, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about voluntary guidelines on Internet privacy proposed by an industry coalition misidentified the author of a bill intended to protect the privacy of children on line. He is Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, not Representative Ed Bryant, a Tennessee Republican.

HEADLINE: Suntrust to Grow With Purchase of Crestar

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In its first significant transaction in a dozen years, Suntrust Banks Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Crestar Financial Corporation for $9.5 billion in stock.
The deal, which is subject to the approval of Crestar shareholders and Federal regulators, will create the nation's 10th-largest bank holding company, with assets of $87.6 billion. 
 From its headquarters in Atlanta, Suntrust oversees operations in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama. Over the last few years, it has remained on the sidelines as large regional bank competitors like the First Union Corporation and Nationsbank have greatly expanded their size and scope through highly publicized, highly priced mergers and acquisitions.
The institution created by the deal announced yesterday will not rival either of those banks, both based in North Carolina. Indeed, for the time being Suntrust has chosen to leap-frog both North and South Carolina, where banking is dominated by First Union, Nationsbank and the Wachovia Corporation.
Crestar, based in Richmond, will provide Suntrust with a solid presence in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, fast-growing markets that Suntrust's competitors have been tilling for some time.
Perhaps most important, analysts said, is the clear message the transaction sends to Suntrust competitors.
"This signals that, longer-term, Suntrust wants to be a buyer and a player, to dictate its own destiny, as opposed to being merged into someone else," said Keith Stock, a consultant who specializes in financial services with A. T. Kearney, an international management consulting firm.
Indeed, disappointment on Wall Street that Suntrust is no longer to be a takeover candidate may have played a role in the sharp drop in its share price after the announcement.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Suntrust stock closed at $79, down $8.4375, or about 10 percent. Crestar's stock, meanwhile, jumped $9.3125, or 15 percent, and closed at $73.3125.
Under the terms of the transaction, Crestar shareholders will receive 0.96 of a Suntrust share for each of their shares.
The terms are based on the closing price on Friday of Suntrust's shares. But L. Phillip Humann, who became Suntrust's chairman, president and chief executive earlier this year, said the sharp drop in the stock price yesterday would have no bearing on the transaction.
Mr. Humann acknowledged that problems in the late 1980's with the First Tennessee Corporation, a bank that Suntrust had bought in 1986, may have made the bank wary of other deals for several years. He added that over the last six months the bank's attitude has undergone a marked change.
"The First Tennessee deal was the right deal with the right company in the right state at exactly the wrong time," he said. "Tennessee went into a very deep recession, and the economics became unattractive."
Since then, Suntrust has made a number of smaller acquisitions and has kept investors happy through stock buybacks and with the help of a sharp increase in the market value of its 48 million shares of the Coca-Cola Company, a stake that is now worth more than $4.2 billion.
Still, the banking deals that have shaken the financial services landscape over the last year did not go unnoticed in Atlanta, Mr. Humann said.
"As it became clearer that Suntrust would be competing against not just $200 billion banks but against several banks with assets of $600 billion, we did take another look at where we ought to be," he said. "That did not drive us toward this transaction, but our thinking has changed over the last six months."
Crestar, which until 1987 was known as United Virginia Banks, will continue to operate under its own name. Richard G. Tilghman, chairman and chief executive of Crestar, will continue in those roles and will become vice chairman of the Suntrust board.
Although the deal is expected to produce reductions of more than $130 million in annual expenses, both banks said they did not expect it to lead to significant staff cuts.
"This merger is not being driven by cost-saving considerations," Mr. Tilghman said, "but rather by two well-run organizations that exist in an attractive market from Maryland to Florida."
Morgan Stanley & Company was Crestar's financial adviser, and Lehman Brothers advised Suntrust.

HEADLINE: Cosmetic Breast Enlargements Are Making a Comeback

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
BOARDING a flight from LaGuardia to Minneapolis last Thursday, passengers could not help but notice Ana Voog. Strikingly attractive, with huge brown eyes, flawless skin and cropped platinum hair, Ms. Voog, who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 90 pounds, also has remarkably large breasts for such a petite woman. Her clingy white pullover bore a startling inscription: "YES, THEY'RE FAKE."
Two years ago, when she was 30, Ms. Voog, a rock musician in Minneapolis, gave in to her longtime craving for a bust line, and had saline breast implants -- pouches full of salt water -- surgically inserted into her chest. She went into the operating room, she said, "totally flat, like not even enough for a training bra," and came out a D-cup. 
 "It was the most surreal thing I've ever experienced," Ms. Voog said.
Surreal or not, the experience is one that more and more American women are seeking. Cosmetic surgery to enlarge the breasts (which does not include reconstruction after mastectomy) is regaining popularity after falling out of favor in 1992. That year, the Food and Drug Administration banned silicone-gel-filled implants amid worries about potential health problems from silicone leaking out of the pouches. The number of operations plunged to 32,607, from a high of an estimated 120,000 to 150,000 in 1990.
But the count has been climbing back up and exceeded 122,000 last year, according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. The states with the most operations are Florida, Texas and California, and plastic surgeons report that women in Texas request bigger implants than those in any other state.
Silicone gel is still banned from most cosmetic implants, but it has been replaced by saline implants like Ms. Voog's.
Why the resurgence? Plastic surgeons say the interest never died. There have always been women who wanted bigger breasts, but many were scared away by reports that silicone might be unsafe. Saline implants then gained acceptance as a safer alternative. Even though the covering is made of a rubbery form of solid silicone, it has not been linked to health problems.
Lawsuits have tried to link the silicone implants to autoimmune illnesses like lupus and scleroderma, but those links are still being debated because of absence of conclusive evidence. Some women take that as reassurance that implants are safe. The recent $3.2 billion settlement between the Dow Corning Corporation, a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Inc., and 170,000 women who claim to have been injured by implants did not resolve the question of whether silicone can cause systemic illness.
"I think people are feeling more sanguine about implants not being poison," said Dr. Bruce Cunningham, chief of plastic surgery at the University of Minnesota.
But saline implants are not without risk: infection and complications of anesthesia can occur, as with any surgery. Painful scar tissue can harden the breasts, and the implants can rupture, go flat and need replacing. They can also interfere with mammography.
But women are undeterred. Breast operations are just part of a larger picture: All types of plastic surgery are on the upswing, partly because a surge in the economy means that people can afford the operations, even though insurance does not cover them, said Dr. Scott Spear, professor and chief of plastic surgery at Georgetown University in Washington. Breast enlargement surgery usually costs between $5,000 and $6,000.
Dr. Roxanne Guy, a plastic surgeon in Melbourne, Fla., said that for some, breast implants have become a statement, like a tattoo or pierced eyebrow. "Women are more empowered, bold, more unabashed and free about their bodies," said Dr. Guy.
Dr. Diana Zuckerman, a psychologist and board member of the National Women's Health Network, does not see implants as a sign of empowerment. In many cases, she said, they reflect an urge to conform to an image of sexiness defined by magazines and lingerie catalogues full of models with implants.
Dr. Cunningham said he expected to see more implant operations as baby boomers work to defy aging.
" 'I'm going to emphasize how young I look,' " he said, describing the attitude. " 'Large breasts show I'm young and vital and full and happy.' I think you will see more of that, like you'll see more men on Harleys."
Not only are more women getting implants, but they want them bigger than ever, said Dr. Joel Rudin, a New York City plastic surgeon who performs two or three breast enlargements per week.
"Women are understandably concerned about appearing that they have breast implants, so they tend to be conservative," he said. "But all too frequently these same women return a year later saying that while they're happy with their implants, they wish they had gone a little bit bigger. And many do decide to make the change."
Few women are neutral on the subject of breast enlargement. Some shudder at the thought of having surgery just to fill a bigger bra, and assume that women who submit to it must lack self-esteem or intelligence. But others see implants as one more means of looking better, albeit a bit more extreme than hair dye, mascara and pierced ears.
Plastic surgery appeals to some people, said Dr. Spear, whereas "another segment would never do it and can't see why anybody else would. The key thing is not to let one group tell the other what they can do." His patients have included doctors, lawyers and judges, he said.
Many women want implants because their breasts shrank and sagged after childbirth.
One, a 31-year-old mother of two young children from Wayne, N.J., who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she had always been "small-chested," but developed "big, beautiful breasts" during pregnancy and nursing. Once she stopped breastfeeding, though, they became smaller than ever. She wanted the big ones back.
"I felt really depressed," she said. "I felt inadequate when I was intimate with my husband. It was nothing he did. I just didn't feel feminine."
Trying on clothes, especially bathing suits, she thought she looked downright masculine. Once, hoping to look good in a strapless gown, she resorted to using masking tape to try to create cleavage.
Implants took her from an A cup to a C. The operation was more painful than she had expected, and recovery took longer, but she thinks it was worth it. "Our sex life is so much better because I feel so much better about myself," she said. "I feel sexy and I guess my husband picks up on that. I buy sexy lingerie all the time where before I never did." She has even created a Web site (www.implantinfo.com) to help other women get information about implants.
Ms. Voog debated with herself about implants for 10 years before she finally got them. She said that before the surgery, her chest was so flat she had almost no breasts at all. "Clothes sort of just hung on me," she said.
Now her clothes look smashing, she said, but her D-cup anatomy is a bit more than she expected. "I think my surgeon went a little hog wild," she said. "I think I wanted to be a C."
There were other surprises. For a week after the surgery, she was in such severe pain that moving her arms became difficult, and her boyfriend had to take care of her. Her nipples have normal sensation, but scattered spots on other parts of her breasts are a bit numb. And her breasts do not feel the way she had expected they would. "I thought they would feel natural, and they don't," she said. "That was a shock. I'm self-conscious when I hug anybody."
Ms. Voog's breasts are round, high and firm looking. But her nipples are not centered; the implants have left them high and outside.
People respond differently to her appearance. Intellectual men, she said, seem less inclined than before the surgery to take her seriously. Feminists act disdainfully. Men she thinks of as "jocks" have suddenly become more interested in her. Some stare at her chest instead of looking her in the eyes while talking to her. "It's beyond their control," she said. "They become totally dumb, like deer in the headlights."
She printed "YES, THEY'RE FAKE" on her shirt with a marker to attend a party in Manhattan, just to head off questions, smirks and smug remarks. "People are always wondering," Ms. Voog said. "I just wanted to put it out of their minds."

HEADLINE: Sotheby's, Expanding, Plans a Showplace

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
An ambitious plan to expand Sotheby's headquarters on York Avenue and 72d Street into a department store for art with a sleek glass and granite facade and a sculpture garden on its roof has reached a critical stage in the city's approval process.
The plan, which is expected to cost more than $100 million, will be reviewed and given a public hearing tomorrow by the New York City Planning Commission. It is expected to receive strong support. 
 The four-story former Kodak warehouse that has been Sotheby's New York home for 18 years is intended to become an elegant 400,000-square-foot, 10-story building. It is scheduled for completion in September 2000 and has been designed to address the needs of an auction house poised for business in the 21st century. The building's interior will have a 10-story atrium with escalators, providing views of seven floors of exhibition space. Each department will have its own space to show objects year round, not just during the sale season.
For years, both Sotheby's and its archrival, Christie's, have been starved for space. Christie's finally decided to leave its Park Avenue and 59th Street site for 300,000 square feet in Rockefeller Center. The move is expected next year.
For these companies, whose total business has more than doubled over the last 10 years, physical expansion has become critical as each continues to grow from being merely auctioneers to also running ancillary businesses like real estate, insurance and storage.
Sotheby's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, who made his reputation and his fortune designing and building upscale shopping centers in affluent communities like Short Hills, N.J., and Stamford, Conn., has taken an active role in the plans for the building expansion. Ever since he and a group of investors bought the company in 1983, he has made it a priority to oversee the renovations of Sotheby's offices all over the world.
Mr. Taubman hired three Manhattan architectural firms to work on the New York headquarters. Kohn Pederson Fox has designed the exterior, Swanke Hayden & Connell has created the interior plans, and Richard Gluckman, who has just completed the Whitney Museum of American Art's new permanent galleries, has designed the building's top floor.
For both Sotheby's and Christie's, finding enough space in a location convenient to art and antiques buyers, in a neighborhood where precious paintings, furniture and objects can be moved in and out safely and efficiently, was close to impossible. Both explored many of the same sites, among them the former Alexander's department store at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street, the site where B. Altman stood at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street and an old storage company on the Upper East Side. Sotheby's also contemplated joining a team of architects and developers applying to build on the New York Coliseum site, but abandoned the idea.
"We did a lot of research," said Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive. "We met with about 150 clients and sent letters to over 250. In the end we came to the conclusion that people like where we are. It's easy to get a cab, and for those coming to the city from Connecticut or Westchester there's not much traffic and parking isn't a problem."
The location seems to make sense now, but when Sotheby's gave up prime space at 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, everyone thought the move to faraway York Avenue was crazy. The business was far smaller then, and York Avenue was less of a residential neighborhood than it is today.
Local residents are poised for a fight, although the community board has approved the project. "It will be as busy with the trucks and twice the number of loading bays as Bloomingdale's," said Paul Higgins, president of the 72d Street Association. "I surmise that every resident will take a 10 percent discount in the value of their apartments because it clearly sends a signal that this is a commercial district, not a residential one."
Sotheby's plans call for six floors to be built on top of the four-story building, tripling its exhibition space. At the Planning Commission's public hearing, it will ask for a zoning change to allow commercial rather than residential space to be built on the site. It will also seek a special permit to build what is essentially a 150-foot-tall building with setbacks.
Contrary to rumor, the plans include neither art galleries nor antiques shops as tenants. None of the art galleries Sotheby's has bought over the years, like the Andre Emmerich Gallery or Deitch Projects, will move to 72d Street either.
This is not the first time Sotheby's has thought of developing its York Avenue site. In 1985, Sotheby's signed a deal with Mr. Taubman under which his real estate company would develop a residential tower on top of the building. A zoning change in 1990 gave Sotheby's approval to build one floor of space for itself and 27 stories of apartments. But the plan was abandoned.
"The business has changed so much," Mrs. Brooks said. "Back then, we only had a $250 million auction business in New York; today it's $900 million. The economics are so different today that building a high-rise no longer looks financially appealing."
Sotheby's has been renting the York Avenue space but has an option to buy the building from Benenson Capital, a New York-based real estate developer, which it plans to exercise soon. The price is about 10 times its annual rent, or about $11.5 million. Mrs. Brooks estimates that the entire project will cost between $100 million and $115 million.
Sotheby's will stay open during the construction. While many offices will relocate nearby, Mrs. Brooks said, the core of the auction business will continue at York Avenue.
Right now Sotheby's spends about $5.5 million a year on rent. Besides the York Avenue site, it is leasing space in five other locations for storage as well as office and exhibition space: a nine-floor warehouse at First Avenue and 111th Street; 411 East 76th Street; 750 Lexington Avenue, at 59th Street; and 425 East 61st Street and 980 Madison Avenue. After the expansion, four of those leased spaces will no longer be needed, but brokers at Sotheby's International Realty will stay in the Madison Avenue offices. And Sotheby's will no longer have the expense of having a fleet of trucks transport furniture, art and objects between warehouses and auction rooms.
The design for the York Avenue expansion "is going to be very pure and understated," Mr. Taubman said. "Nothing is going to shout at you here except the objects."
Mr. Taubman designed his shopping centers so that visitors going to one store would find themselves spending money in another, and he has made sure that the new Sotheby's will work the same way. By putting the main salesroom on the seventh floor and most of the popular departments on the upper floors, the design takes visitors into the heart of the building, so that they see a lot more than they bargained for.
Each department will also have its own storage space adjacent to its offices and nearby exhibition space. "We felt it was crucial for everyone that experts live with their objects," Mr. Taubman said.
The first floor will house a restaurant and a bookstore. The 10,000-square-foot top floor will be devoted to contemporary art and will have ceilings 22 feet high, to allow extremely large works to be shown. (The average ceiling heights throughout the building will be also be high, about 18 feet.)
Unlike its current space, which has only one salesroom, the expanded Sotheby's will have five, some of which can be transformed into galleries when extra exhibition space is needed. "The concept here is that we wanted everything to be flexible," Mrs. Brooks said. "We've tried to build in what might happen."
Looking at the future of the business was crucial, she said. Since private sales are a growing part of the business, the plan includes galleries and offices for them. The company also plans to provide warehouse space, so that if a client is going away for a few months and wants a place to store a prized Matisse or Picasso, it can be sent to Sotheby's.
The plans call for devoting the entire third floor to Sotheby's Arcade, where it sells its less expensive merchandise. "We want to increase volume significantly," Mrs. Brooks said. "Right now we turn away between $5 million and $10 million worth of estate business because we simply can't handle either the space needed to show and store the objects or the sales schedule. People, understandably, don't want to wait months to sell these kinds of thing." She is considering "quick sale areas," similar to country tag sales, and even a retail jewelry department.
During the height of the construction, Mrs. Brooks said, she hopes to wrap the building in some kind of interesting contemporary artwork, and various artists are being considered. "While we're undergoing the worst of the construction," she said, "we still want this project to be fun."

Profit Down For Texas Instruments

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Texas Instruments Inc., the leading maker of semiconductors for mobile phones, reported a greater-than-expected decline in second-quarter profit yesterday, attributing it to weak prices for memory chips.
The Dallas-based company's net income fell to $43 million, or 11 cents a share, down from $249 million or 65 cents, in the period a year earlier. Texas Instruments' earnings before charges fell to $142 million, or 35 cents a diluted share, from $213 million, or 54 cents, before charges and gains in the period a year ago. 
 Analysts had expected earnings before the charges of 37 cents a share, according to a survey by the First Call Corporation.
Revenues declined about 15 percent, to $2.17 billion from $2.56 billion.
The semiconductor industry is ailing because of a global oversupply of chips, falling prices and the economic turmoil in Asia. Earnings were also hurt by flat sales of digital signal processors, the chips used in cellular phones and disk drives. Sales of the specialized chips were unchanged from the first quarter, although up from the corresponding period a year earlier.
Texas Instruments said it expected prices to remain depressed in the third quarter.
Prices for the dynamic random-access memory chips used in personal computers fell about 30 percent from the previous quarter and about 70 percent from the period a year ago, the company said.
Texas Instruments agreed last month to sell its memory-chip operations to the rival Micron Technology Inc. for $641 million in stock plus $190 million in debt.
Shares of Texas Instruments rose $2, to $60.9375, in Nasdaq trading.
Texas Instruments set aside $233 million before taxes in the second quarter to pay for a revamping that included the sale of its memory chip business to Micron and the elimination of 3,500 employees through layoffs and attrition. The company also reported a gain of $83 million from the sale of its joint venture with the Acer Corporation to Acer.
Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen & Company, said demand for digital signal processors should pick up next year, driven by an expected recovery in disk drive sales, as well as the introduction of new products that incorporate the chips, such as motor controllers for refrigerators and air conditioners.
William Aylesworth, Texas Instruments' chief financial officer, said the unusual sluggishness in the digital signal processor market was largely a result of economic woes in Asia, which had been one of the fastest-growing markets for the chips.
"Certainly in the third quarter, there is going to be continued pressure on margins because of the weak orders from the second quarter," Mr. Aylesworth said.

OPEC Oil Revenue Down One-Third in '98

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 21

 BODY:
Oil revenue of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has fallen by a third this year because of the severe decline in prices, industry trade data show.
Petrostrategies, a Paris-based weekly publication, said on Monday that the collective revenue of OPEC's 11 members fell to $60.7 billion in the first six months of 1998, compared with $89.6 billion in the first six months of 1997. 
 Nearly every OPEC member suffered a decline in oil export revenue. The exception was Iraq, whose revenue has risen about 20 percent this year. The United Nations is permitting the Iraqis to sell more oil under amended terms of the trade sanctions imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Iraq's production and sales of crude oil and products have risen to nearly 2.2 million barrels a day. While that is still below its production level of 3.5 million barrels a day before the gulf war, it is considerably more than the 500,000-barrel-a-day limit imposed in August 1990.
With oil prices remaining depressed, near 10-year lows at $12 to $14 a barrel, it is likely that OPEC nations' revenue will fall further.
Oil analysts predict that for all of 1998, the combined revenue of OPEC nations from petroleum exports will fall 30 percent from 1997 to $121.5 billion, the lowest since 1989.
"It means a great deal of belt-tightening for everybody and big cuts in budgets," Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, said today in a telephone interview.
Mr. Terzian and other analysts said the actual decline in OPEC revenue was far bigger than the figure suggested. In 1989, the combined revenue came on production of 21 million barrels a day. Today, OPEC countries are pumping 27 million barrels a day and getting less.
The Petrostrategies report added to an emerging picture of intensified economic problems among OPEC members. Last month, Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil, announced measures that for the first time suggested big reductions in the military budget. Although no figures were made public, the Saudis have ranked as one of the largest buyers of warplanes and weapons for more than a decade, concluding multibillion-dollar deals with the United States, Britain and France.
Saudi Arabia has also begun a quiet campaign to raise taxes on services at ports and airports, and reduce public employment. Iran, Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria and other OPEC members are also reducing budgets, which could lead to higher prices for food, energy and public services that have been partly subsidized.
"They have to cut subsidies and energize their economies to adjust to this crisis," said Mehdi Verzi, an oil analyst here with the investment firm of Kleinwort Benson.
He forecast more pain ahead for OPEC nations as the Asian economic crisis worsened, reducing a key regional source of demand.

Azerbaijan Oil Pacts
LONDON, July 21 (Bloomberg News) -- British Petroleum P.L.C., the Amoco Corporation and Ramco Energy P.L.C. signed contracts here today to invest as much as $13 billion to develop Azerbaijan's oil resources in the next 15 years.
President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan signed three separate contracts with the companies and their partners, including Monument Oil and Gas P.L.C. and Statoil of Norway, after a meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
The contracts add to 12 agreements that Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic in the Caucasus, already has in place and help insure that foreign companies will continue to develop the vast oil reserves of the Caspian Sea region, which are estimated to contain more than 30 billion barrels of oil, or about as much as the North Sea.

HEADLINE: Despite A-Test, U.S. Won't Bar Pakistan Bailout

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
Less than two months after declaring that Pakistan would suffer harsh economic sanctions for its nuclear test, the Clinton Administration said today that it would not oppose efforts by the International Monetary Fund to head off the country's economic collapse.
State and Treasury Department officials said the Administration decided to act on the Pakistan issue because of "the financial fragility of the country today." Even before Pakistan conducted the nuclear tests, which were in response to tests by India, the country's economy had been devastated by years of mismanagement. 
 But the announcement of sanctions by the United States and some of its allies appears to have pushed Pakistan over the brink, with investors fleeing, banks collapsing, currency reserves dropping to a scant $600 million, and Government officials warning that the country could default on its national debt of more than $30 billion.
Today's announcement came as Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, arrived in Islamabad on a trip to urge both India and Pakistan to abandon plans to deploy nuclear weapons. The decision to pave the way for economic aid to the country is part of a strategy to give Pakistan some negotiating room, especially at a moment when Pakistani officials have warned that the sanctions are setting off financial chaos.
But it also represents a further retreat from the use of the sanctions that President Clinton signed into law four years ago. The Administration has allowed the World Bank to proceed with most of its loans to India, declaring that they are for humane purposes and thus exempt from sanctions. Pakistan, far poorer than India and more dependent on foreign aid, was going to suffer more than its neighbor if aid was cut off.
Explaining today's announcement, officials said that technically the United States would not stand in the way of negotiations between the I.M.F. and Pakistan, and that it would abstain from votes to approve any agreement that emerges from those negotiations. The officials insisted that a vote of abstention complies with the provisions of the Glenn Amendment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act. That amendment requires the Administration to oppose all assistance to any country that detonates a nuclear device, except food, medicine and related aid.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, argued today that this was not a reversal of position, or an evasion of the sanctions law. "We have not softened or somehow waived the sanctions," he said. Their intent, he added, was "never to punish Pakistan or its people or precipitate an economic collapse."
The I.M.F. has an economic reform program under way in Pakistan, though it was suspended after the nuclear tests. Now the country's collapse is so severe that the I.M.F. appears likely to negotiate a far larger rescue package for the country than it has ever had in the past.
"The starting point for that renegotiation may well be the suspended program, but it has to be updated to take into account changed circumstances," a senior Administration official said at a State Department briefing today.
Any new accord would require Pakistan to agree to stringent economic reforms. Presumably, America's allies would vote to approve the package with the informal assent of the United States, even if Washington formally abstains from the vote.

HEADLINE: It's Official: U.S. to Consider Dutch Trial in Lockerbie Case

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that the United States and Britain would seriously consider the creation of a special court in the Netherlands to try two Libyans suspected of planting a bomb aboard a jumbo jet that exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago.
The announcement represents a turnaround for the Administration, which has said in the past that the Libyans would have to be tried in the United States or Britain for the bombing, in December 1988, which killed 259 people aboard a Pan Am plane and 11 others on the ground. 
 But President Clinton expressed some uncertainty that such an arrangement would work out. "We're looking at it, but I don't know that it can be done," Mr. Clinton said. "We've tried to find some way that has real integrity that will work, but there are all kinds of practical difficulties."
Although the State Department said many details were being discussed, the proposal is similar in many ways to one offered by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and it reflects a growing sense in the Administration that there may be no other way to bring the suspects to trial.
Eager for the lifting of economic sanctions imposed on Libya because of its refusal to hand over the two for trial in the United States or Britain, Colonel Qaddafi has proposed that they be tried under Scottish law by Scottish judges, but not in Scotland.
The proposal outlined today by the Administration drew mixed responses from family members of the American victims, who participated in a conference call with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Samuel R. Berger, the President's national security adviser.
Some family members suggested that the plan might be the only way to see justice done, given Libya's refusal to extradite the suspects for trial in the United States or Britain. Others, however, described the plan as a collapse by the Administration.
"This gives Colonel Qaddafi just what he says he wants, a trial in a third country," said Stephanie Bernstein, a clinical social worker from Bethesda, Md., whose husband, Michael, 36, died in the attack. "Sanctions are not perfect, but they are working."
The suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, have been identified by American investigators as Libyan intelligence agents. The two are accused of having planted a suitcase packed with explosives aboard the Pan American World Airways Boeing 747.
"We have been working very hard to see whether there is a way in which it is practicable to hold a Scottish court outside the United Kingdom and what steps would be necessary to make this possible," said the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin.
While acknowledging that the Administration had previously insisted that the trial be held on American or British soil, Mr. Rubin said the proposal was a "win-win" situation.
"It's a creative alternative," he said. "Either we achieve our fundamental objective, which is a trial under a Scottish or American court system, or we call Qaddafi's bluff and demonstrate the value of the sanctions to nations that have been less than supportive of them."
Administration officials said that under the proposal three Scottish judges appointed by Britain would hear the case in The Hague, which is also home to the International Court of Justice.
American officials said the United States and Britain had agreed that Scottish judges and legal procedures would be used in such a trial, because the crime was in Scotland.
A senior Administration official said, "Many questions have to be resolved if there is to be a trial," including the issue of where the suspects would be jailed if convicted. "Really," the official added, "nothing has been decided at this point."
The United States and Britain have been under pressure from some of the victims' families to consider Libya's proposal or something like it, because the sanctions seem to be fraying and because there seems no other way to hold a trial and to disseminate the evidence publicly.
"With the present policy, there will never be a trial," said Bert Ammerman of River Vale, N.J., whose brother Tom died on the flight. "This new proposal is a pragmatic, realistic approach."
But other family members said they resolutely opposed the proposal. "I'm absolutely devastated by what's happening," said Susan Cohen of Cape May Courthouse, N.J., whose daughter Theodora, 20, died in the explosion. "This is a total shift in the Administration's policy," said Ms. Cohen. "We're letting Qaddafi dictate the conditions for a trial."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Fed Chairman's Remarks in Congress

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, presented his twice-a-year report on the economy to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. He is scheduled to reprise it before a House Banking subcommittee today. Following are excerpts from his testimony yesterday: 
 Over all, the performance of the U.S. economy continues to be impressive. Over the first part of the year, we experienced further gains in output and employment, subdued prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Important crosscurrents, however, have been impacting the economy. With labor markets very tight and domestic final demand retaining considerable momentum, the risks of a pickup in inflation remain significant. But inventory investment, which was quite rapid late last year and early this year, appears to have slowed, perhaps appreciably. Moreover, the economic and financial troubles in Asian economies are now demonstrably restraining demands for U.S. goods and services -- and those troubles could intensify and spread further. Weighing these forces, the Federal Open Market Committee chose to keep the stance of policy unchanged over the first half of 1998. However, should pressures on labor resources begin to show through more impressively in cost increases, policy action may need to counter any associated tendency for prices to accelerate before it undermines this extraordinary expansion. . . .
Although national income and product data for the second quarter have not yet been published, growth of U.S. output appears to have slowed sharply. The auto strike has brought General Motors' production essentially to a halt, probably reducing real G.D.P. in the second quarter by about one-half percentage point at an annual rate. The limited available information on inventory investment suggests that stock building dropped markedly from its unsustainable pace of the first quarter. In addition to the slower pace of inventory building, Asian economies have continued to deteriorate, further retarding our exports in recent months.
Indeed, readings on the elements that make up the real G.D.P. have led many analysts to anticipate a decline in that measure in the second quarter, after the first-quarter surge. Given the upcoming revisions to the national income accounts, such assessments would have to be regarded as conjectural. It is worth noting in any case that other indicators of output, including worker hours and manufacturing production, show a somewhat steadier, though slowing, path over the first half of the year. And underlying trends in domestic final demand have remained strong, imparting impetus to the continuing economic expansion.
During the first half of the year, measures of resource utilization diverged. Pressures on manufacturing facilities appeared to be easing. Plant capacity was growing rapidly as a result of vigorous investment. And growth of industrial output was dropping off from its brisk pace of 1997, importantly reflecting the deceleration in world demand for manufactured goods that resulted from the Asian economic difficulties.
But labor markets, in contrast, became increasingly taut during the first half. . . .
To a considerable extent, investors seem to be expecting that low inflation and stronger productivity growth will allow the extraordinary growth of profits to be extended into the distant future. Indeed, expectations of earnings growth over the longer term have been undergoing continual upward revision by security analysts since early 1995. These rising expectations have, in turn, driven stock prices sharply higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps in both cases to levels that will be difficult to sustain unless the virtuous cycle continues. . . .
But a number of factors likely will serve to damp growth in aggregate demand, helping to foster a reasonably smooth transition to a more sustainable rate of growth and reasonable balance in labor markets. We have yet to see the full effects of the crisis in East Asia on U.S. employment and income. Residential and business fixed investment already have reached such high levels that further gains approaching those experienced recently would imply very rapid growth of the stocks of housing and plant and equipment relative to income trends. Moreover, business investment will be damped if recent indications of a narrowing in domestic operating profit margins prompt a reassessment of the expected rates of return on investment in plant and equipment. Reduced prospects for the return to capital would not only affect investment directly but could also affect consumption if stock prices adjust to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects. . . .
While we expect that the situation will develop relatively smoothly, the committee believes that, given the current tightness in labor markets, the potential for accelerating inflation is probably greater than the risk of protracted, excessive weakness in the economy.

HEADLINE: The Master of Orange County;
A Merrill Lynch Broker Survives Municipal Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE with ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
It is the embarrassing remnant of another era, caught on videotape.
The year is 1992, and Michael Stamenson is Merrill Lynch's No. 1 salesman worldwide. His client, Orange County, Calif., is by far Merrill's biggest account, snapping up billions of dollars in exotic securities. An ex-marine with a seven-figure income, Mr. Stamenson is the featured star in a training tape that exhorts young Merrill brokers to become a "master of the universe," just like him. 
 To become a successful Merrill broker, Mr. Stamenson tells the recruits, they need the "tenacity of a rattlesnake, the heart of a black widow spider and the hide of an alligator."
That tape, now under court seal, was a prominent exhibit in a lawsuit brought by Orange County that resulted last month in an agreement in which Merrill Lynch & Company paid $400 million to settle claims it helped push the county into bankruptcy with reckless investment advice. Giving that advice, and selling those high-risk securities was Mr. Stamenson, then on top of the world, at the top of his game.
Mr. Stamenson, 58, may no longer be a master of the universe. But, considering the wreckage left behind, he has survived relatively unscathed. He remains on Merrill's payroll at $750,000 a year -- a $250,000 base and a $500,000 bonus. He is not working at his regular job, but spends his days as a prime witness in the waves of litigation flowing from Orange County's $1.6 billion investment losses and December 1994 bankruptcy.
Merrill, which is trying to disentangle itself from this fiasco, has paid dearly in dollars and in public image. In addition to the $400 million settlement, Merrill reached a $30 million settlement with the county to end a grand jury investigation; paid $37 million more in settlements with smaller municipalities in Orange County, and is about to pay $3 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Yet Mr. Stamenson, the man at the center, is likely to escape any legal punishment and remains protected by his organization. Merrill said yesterday, as it has in the past, that it "acted properly and professionally in its dealings with Orange County" as, it says, did Mr. Stamenson. Mr. Stamenson retains his Merrill stock options and deferred compensation. By contrast, Orange County's former treasurer and deputy treasurer pleaded guilty to criminal charges.
By the accounts of former colleagues and customers, Mr. Stamenson was an aggressive salesman who knew how to manipulate clients' weaknesses and made soothing reassurances if they balked at risky investments. There is ample evidence both he and his superiors ignored danger signals as things began spinning out of control in Orange County.
A 1993 memo from Edson V. Mitchell and William S. Broeksmit, two Merrill executives no longer with the firm, for example, warned Merrill management of "potential adverse consequences for Orange County in the event of a substantial increase in interest rates and the flight of hot money" from the county's investment pool.
That memo, circulated among Merrill top managers, including David H. Komansky, Merrill's current chief executive and then Mr. Stamenson's boss, recommended halting sales of risky securities to Orange County. But the firm never did so.
The circling of the wagons around Mr. Stamenson began just five days after the Orange County bankruptcy, when Mr. Komansky voiced support: "I would say that Stamenson is exceptional as far as understanding the investment philosophies and goals of the clients he works with."
Last month, in an internal Merrill document given to Merrill brokers in case clients should ask about the $400 million settlement -- "Q&As for Orange County Settlement" -- a canned answer was prepared concerning Mr. Stamenson: "Mr. Stamenson remains an employee in good standing. As we've indicated previously, Mr. Stamenson has been spending most of his time in legal preparations. Now that the litigation has ended, his next assignment will be determined in due course."
 
After Bankruptcy, A Merrill Embrace
Mr. Stamenson is the man who knows too much. Because his actions and his close relationship to the Orange County Treasurer, Robert Citron, were fully known to his Merrill superiors, it would be difficult for Merrill to contend he was a rogue broker and cut him loose.
"It's not uncommon in corporate defense cases to worry about cutting off the guy who's at the center of it," said a lawyer for an Orange County municipality that sued Merrill. Like most people interviewed, he spoke only on condition he not be named.
"You frequently see the person at the center of the storm continue to be well compensated by the corporate entity, while they are denying all wrongdoing," the lawyer added. "The company can cut someone off or embrace them. In the mix, they have to think about: 'What are the risks if I cut this person off? What happens if he starts saying things to others?' "
Today, Mr. Stamenson, who did not respond to requests to be interviewed, is a recluse from his friends. He has no client responsibilities. He spends his days in an endless series of depositions. He has gained and lost so much weight on his 5-foot-8-inch frame that one lawyer said his videotaped depositions "look like ads for a weight-loss program."
"I really don't know what the future holds for him," Richard Marmaro, Mr. Stamenson's lawyer, said. "I don't think he knows." Mr. Marmaro added there had "never been any finding of wrongdoing" against his client.
Mr. Stamenson no longer enjoys an income that once came to around $3 million a year, but he is still paid more than most Americans. He has a young second wife whom he married just before the county's bankruptcy filing. He has his real estate: a $1.2 million, 5,200-square-foot, 13-room house on a street, called, coincidentally, Merrill Circle, in suburban San Francisco; a $755,000 town house in the Sierra Nevada foothills, and a $600,000 weekend getaway condo in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
While he no longer gives the lavish parties he once did -- complete with valet parking for his guests and a tour of his library filled with acrylic tombstone mementos of his Merrill deals -- his life is a far cry from his humble beginnings as the son of a Greek immigrant on a California farm.
Mr. Stamenson worked his way through college, graduating from California State University at Fullerton, majoring in business administration, before joining Merrill in 1971 as a retail broker in Santa Ana.
"He was one of the best salesmen I ever met," said a former Merrill co-worker of Mr. Stamenson, who asked not to be identified. "He knew how to manipulate and control customers. He could penetrate an account deeply and then tell them what to buy."
 
A Knack for Wooing County Treasurers
What happened next is a tale of a salesman who smelled opportunity in the sleepy backwater of municipal finance and struck a mother lode. When California enacted Proposition 13, which cut property taxes, in 1978, municipalities sought new sources of income, and Mr. Stamenson found them in exotic investments like derivatives, which carried much higher commissions than, say, plain-vanilla Treasury debt. (Derivatives gain their value from other securities to which they are linked.)
"He always came to conferences and was really good at making presentations to county treasurers," Don Merz, the Sonoma County Treasurer, said. "He was good at describing what securities were."
Chriss Street, an Orange County businessman and former broker, said Mr. Stamenson "picked a nobody client in the county treasurers."
"No one in their wildest imagination could foresee how much money could eventually be made from county treasurers," Mr. Street said. "He positioned himself with the right customer as the customer grew up."
In 1984, Mr. Stamenson was Merrill's salesman on its San Jose, Calif., account, which lost $60 million by using many of the same risky strategies that were later used in Orange County. But his role in that debacle did nothing to hinder his close relationship with Mr. Citron, nor derail his career with Merrill. The brokerage house played a relatively small role and settled for $750,000.
Although many transcripts relating to Merrill's Orange County settlement are still under seal, there is evidence Merrill put profits above caution and allowed a hard-driving sales culture, from the bottom to the top, to prevail over warnings of a potential financial disaster from cooler heads within. Even Merrill's current chief executive, Mr. Komansky, who was then the head of its debt and equity group, was listed as a recipient of memos raising red flags about Orange County, but did nothing.
Orange County's investment strategy was risky by anyone's standards; more so, since it involved public money. Starting in 1992, a series of Merrill executives urged caution, to no avail.
Under Mr. Stamenson's tutelage, Merrill helped arrange for Orange County to borrow billions of dollars short-term, in the form of so-called reverse repurchase agreements, which were then used to buy long-term interest-sensitive securities from Merrill, primarily Government agency debt and a type of derivative called an inverse floater.
Should interest rates fall, Orange County would reap enormous gains from this strategy. But, if rates rose, as they did in 1994 when the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy, the value of the interest-sensitive securities would plummet, as they did, causing the bankruptcy.
 
Big Trades Brought High Fives at Office
For years, Orange County was Merrill's biggest client. In two years alone, 1993 and 1994, it bought more than $6.3 billion in interest-sensitive securities from Merrill. Lawyers who have seen the numbers say that Merrill made more than $100 million from Orange County between July 1991 and December 1994.
Mr. Stamenson, whose "gross production credits" (a commission formula based on securities sales) were $50 million to $70 million a year in an organization where big producers were doing $5 million to $10 million a year, was rewarded with an ever-increasing salary and a shining Steuben star to show his rising status in the Merrill galaxy.
"Merrill knew exactly what Mike Stamenson was doing," added the former Merrill co-worker. "They were going along with it because he was making them a ton of dough."
Mr. Stamenson was Mr. Citron's No. 1 adviser, and Mr. Citron was his No. 1 client -- a client whose elephantine trades were often greeted with "high fives" by employees at Merrill's San Francisco office. The relationship was so close that Mr. Stamenson would write "Bullet Points" for Mr. Citron to tell the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Mr. Stamenson, along with other Merrill executives, gave $4,000 to Mr. Citron's re-election campaign, 10 percent of the total.
And when Mr. Citron became concerned that rising interest rates would undermine his investments, Mr. Stamenson produced a Merrill economist to quell his fears -- wrongly as it turned out.
"Stamenson was almost as arrogant as Citron himself," Zane Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, said. "They made a good pair. It was always known that Merrill would stand by Stamenson. Merrill had plenty of time to censure him before that."
 
Both Sides Saw Potential for Disaster
As early as 1992, when Mr. Stamenson was picked to star in the training videotape, evidence submitted in the trial shows that Merrill was already concerned about potential legal liability in Orange County.
A telephone conversation between Mr. Stamenson and Mr. Citron, recorded Nov. 9, 1992, and obtained by the Orange County District Attorney, shows both men and Merrill were fully aware of the high potential for a financial disaster.
In that conversation, Mr. Stamenson tells Mr. Citron how he was hastily summoned to New York on a moment's notice to answer questions about an article in the trade publication Derivatives Week that "went through Merrill Lynch like an ICBM," questioning the Orange County strategy.
At the New York meeting were "very senior" people, according to Mr. Stamenson, including "everybody from, what appeared to me, just quite flippantly I'm putting this, from the janitor to the chairman of the board." So worried were Merrill's top managers that they called Mr. Stamenson back for a second meeting days later, flying him from a London vacation on the Concorde.
"They said, 'What the hell's going on?' " Mr. Stamenson recounted on the phone to Mr. Citron. He said Merrill executives feared Mr. Citron had "too many of your eggs in one basket" and that Merrill might be facing "a bailout phenomenon."
Mr. Citron, in the taped conversation, says he had already been called by a Merrill executive "saying, 'Hey, we've got a legal problem here that Merrill Lynch has this great liability if something happens like, uh, San Jose or West Virginia, and we want to protect ourselves, O.K.?' "
"And I'm saying, I'm saying to Merrill Lynch, 'Yeah, that's fine,' " Mr. Citron continued, " 'but where were you, you know, for the year and a half that you were, you know, selling me this stuff?' "
To which, Mr. Stamenson replied, "Uh, we are not uh, we are not embarrassed or, or uh, or uh, by any of the things that we have sold you so far or any of the guidance that we have given you."

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Says Inflation Is Key Concern

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that inflation remains more of a risk than recession, despite the sharp slowdown in economic growth caused in recent months by Asia's financial crisis.
Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan signaled that the central bank was unlikely to raise interest rates anytime soon. But he said the economy retained considerable momentum despite the drop in exports induced by Asia's woes. And with unemployment hovering near its lowest levels in almost three decades, he said the Federal Reserve would have to be "particularly alert" to the possibility that a renewed surge in growth could set off a destabilizing spiral of wage and prices increases. 
 Mr. Greenspan's assessment of the economy was generally upbeat and covered a wide range of what he called "important crosscurrents," from the strikes against General Motors to strong growth in the money supply and a continued consumer spending spree. But he stressed the view -- pushed by a group of Federal Reserve officials who have been calling for months for a rate increase -- that inflation has by no means been vanquished.
He effectively dismissed the possibility of a rate cut -- raised by some economists in recent weeks as growth has slowed -- by ignoring the topic altogether. He labeled forecasts that the economy might have contracted during the spring "conjectural" and noted that many economic indicators had remained quite strong.
He said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee was concerned about two conflicting outlooks. Under one, the pressure on wages would grow as employers scrambled to find the workers they need at a time of continued healthy growth, setting off a cycle of inflationary price increases. Under the other, Asia's woes could hit the United States harder, leading to a more pronounced economic slowdown.
"While we expect that the situation will develop relatively smoothly, the committee believes that given the current tightness in labor markets the potential for accelerating inflation is probably greater than the risk of protracted, excessive weakness in the economy," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan's choice of words suggested that the Fed, at its last policy meeting on June 30 and July 1, had retained its policy "bias" toward raising rates -- effectively a warning to the financial markets that it is on a heightened state of alert against inflation. The Fed has left its benchmark Federal funds target rate unchanged at 5.5 percent since March 1997.
Mr. Greenspan repeated his warning to investors that it will be difficult in the long run for companies to meet Wall Street's ever-increasing earnings expectations. And he reiterated the Federal Reserve's warning to banks to be careful that the loans they are making now do not come back to haunt them when the next economic downturn comes.
Investors heeded his warnings about earnings growth, and drove stocks lower today. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 105.56 points, or 1.14 percent, to 9,190.19, its lowest level in a week. Bond prices jumped.
Mr. Greenspan will appear on Wednesday before a House Banking subcommittee for a second day of testimony about monetary policy and the state of the economy.
In response to questions from the Senate committee today, Mr. Greenspan said he supported proposals to create private investment accounts as part of the Social Security system. But he said he opposed allowing the Federal Government to invest the Social Security trust funds in the stock market, saying such a policy would inevitably tempt politicians to interfere with companies in which the Government was a shareholder.
The Fed chairman also reiterated his calls for Congress to approve more financing for the International Monetary Fund, whose reserves have been depleted by the Asian crisis and the bailout of Russia. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Clinton Administration's full $18 billion request for the fund today, but the fate of the request in the House remains uncertain.
Asked about growing Federal budget surpluses, Mr. Greenspan said his first choice was to use them to reduce the national debt but that using them for tax cuts would be preferable to allowing them to be spent on new entitlement programs.
In discussing the economic outlook, Mr. Greenspan said demand in the domestic economy appeared strong.
"With their incomes and wealth having been on a strong upward track, American consumers remain quite upbeat," Mr. Greenspan said. "For businesses, decreasing costs of and high rates of return on investment, as well as the scarcity of labor, could keep capital spending elevated.
"These factors suggest some risk that the labor market could get even tighter," Mr. Greenspan said. "And even if it does not, under prevailing tight labor markets increasingly confident workers might place gradually escalating pressures on wages and costs, which would eventually feed through to prices."
Mr. Greenspan added, though, that "a number of factors likely will serve to damp growth in aggregate demand, helping to foster a reasonably smooth transition to a more sustainable rate of growth and reasonable balance in labor markets."
If the slowdown does not happen on its own, Mr. Greenspan warned, "firming actions on the part of the Federal Reserve may be necessary to insure a track of expansion that is capable of being sustained."
The Fed's new economic forecast, released today, shows the central bank expects inflation to pick up slightly through this year and into next year, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2 to 2.5 percent next year, up from less than 2 percent this year. It expects unemployment to be between 4.25 and 4.5 percent in this year's fourth quarter, with the rate rising just slightly next year. The rate for June was 4.5 percent.
The forecast shows growth running at 3 to 3.25 percent this year, implying some rebound from the slowdown in the second quarter after the first quarter's 5.4 percent annualized growth rate in gross domestic product. By next year, the Fed sees the economy slowing to what many analysts consider its noninflationary trend level of 2 to 2.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Argentine Chief Drops Bid for Third Term

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 21

 BODY:
Facing a virtual rebellion within his party, President Carlos Saul Menem announced today that he was ending his bid for an unprecedented third term in office.
President Menem's surprise announcement came less than a week after he declared that he would run for re-election despite wording in an amendment to the 1994 Constitution that specifically prohibited him from running a third time. He won the backing of a convention of the governing Justicialist Party last Friday, but hundreds of delegates boycotted the event and many of the party's top leaders warned him privately that they could not support him. 
 "This President will leave office without fail on Dec. 10, 1999," Mr. Menem announced without emotion after meeting with governors from his party at his residence.
The presidential race is now wide open, with hard-fought primary battles likely in both the Justicialist Party, which was founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, and the Alliance, a coalition of two center-left parties. But few political analysts believe that the winner in next October's election will veer from Mr. Menem's free-market policies.
The Argentine leader, whose bushy sideburns, taste for flashy sport cars and impish sense of humor delighted the country in his first years in office, succeeded in reordering his nation's economy. He took growth rates to historic levels and cut the inflation rate from nearly 5,000 percent the day he took office to a current rate of just over 1 percent. His success followed the sale of huge chunks of Government-owned enterprises to private and foreign concerns and a pegging of the value of the peso to the American dollar.
But after winning election in 1989 and re-election in 1995, Mr. Menem seemed to lose his magic. An unemployment rate of more than 13 percent and almost daily news reports of corruption in his Government led to an opposition victory in congressional elections last October. The President's popularity sank along with his party's, and fewer than 20 percent of the people in recent polls said they supported his re-election.
Gov. Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos Aires Province, Mr. Menem's main opponent for his party's nomination, had called for a plebiscite in the province for September on the question of the President's re-election. While the plebiscite would be technically nonbinding, most political analysts said Mr. Menem would have lost it in a landslide. That, in turn, would probably have led to a decisive defeat in the party's presidential primary next April and left his Government virtually impotent as it struggles to dull the economic impact of the Asian financial turmoil.
Meanwhile, press reports suggested that members of the Peronist bloc on the Supreme Court were resisting attempts by the President's allies to persuade them to interpret the Constitution in a way that would have allowed Mr. Menem's re-election.
The Constitution includes a clause banning a second consecutive presidential re-election. A grandfather clause that specifically excluded Mr. Menem from seeking a third term was added to the document since the Constitution was written after his first election.
Members of the opposition had threatened that they would move to impeach any judges who backed Mr. Menem's bid, a threat that could have become immediate had legislators in the Duhalde camp joined the impeachment effort.
President Menem's choice for the nomination is Social Welfare Minister Ramon Ortega, a former pop singer with strong support in the rural provinces. "From today on, I am a candidate," Mr. Ortega told reporters soon after Mr. Menem's announcement. "I am confident I will win the nomination."
Mr. Ortega is running head to head in the polls against Governor Duhalde, whose support is strongest around Buenos Aires. The two are expected to compete hard for the party's labor base with populist language that could frighten investors, but neither is expected to reverse Mr. Menem's privatization policies.
At the moment, however, the polls favor the two candidates competing for the Alliance nomination. The two, Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a member of Congress from Buenos Aires Province, and the Mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua, expressed glee over Mr. Menem's announcement.
"Public opinion has prevailed," Mayor De la Rua said.
Ms. Fernandez Meijide said, "The President came to his senses." She cautioned, however, that Mr. Menem had said he was not a candidate before and then changed his mind.
But Mr. Menem's announcement seemed to leave no wiggle room. "I have decided," he said, "to exclude myself from any type of action that would allow me to compete in 1999."

HEADLINE: Mexicans' Radical New Politics: Top Party May Adopt Primaries

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: CHIHUAHUA, Mexico

 BODY:
A radical idea is gaining momentum within Mexico's governing party: primary elections.
For six decades after its founding in 1929, the Institutional Revolutionary Party so thoroughly monopolized Mexican politics that elections were a mere ritual in which its candidates, often unopposed, won election to all but a handful of government posts. Often, when faced with popular opponents, the party simply rigged the elections. 
 But in recent years, as Government corruption and economic crisis have fueled a surging opposition, one-party rule has come under assault in Mexico as elsewhere in the world. The party, known as the PRI, has lost so many elections that opposition governors and mayors now run much of the country. Scores of leaders have deserted the party, and many Mexicans wonder if it can survive in a competitive atmosphere.
But this year has brought surprises.
President Ernesto Zedillo has vowed that unlike previous PRI presidents he will not anoint his successor, a decision that has forced the party to start looking for a new way to nominate its candidate for presidential voting in 2000. The PRI began testing primaries this spring as a way of nominating some gubernatorial candidates, and in the northern state of Chihuahua, which borders Texas and New Mexico, the experiment attracted thousands of new voters and appears to have been a factor in the PRI's victory in the July 5 general elections.
Primaries are just one way the PRI and Mexico's opposition parties are experimenting this year, using techniques common elsewhere but not here. They have made broadcast messages a far more important ingredient of their campaigning than before, and for the first time the dominant party is using television and radio advertisements to disparage its rivals.
"This is a year in which the way of doing politics in Mexico is changing dramatically," said Rafael Gimenez, the chief poll taker for the newspaper Reforma. "The PRI is leading the way, but that's provoking changes in other parties, too."
One result is that election costs are exploding, Mr. Gimenez and other experts said, although there are no reliable statistics. Another is the surging influence of poll takers and marketing experts, and a corresponding decline in the power of traditional brokers like labor and peasant bosses.
During most of the 70-year rule of the PRI in Mexico, its national candidates have been chosen by Presidents and its local candidates by the state governors. Now, by yielding the right of a President to pick his successor, Mr. Zedillo is forcing the party to rethink its methods.
"The old rules of presidential control are broken, which most Priistas say is healthy," said John Bailey, a professor at Georgetown University, referring to members of the PRI. "On the other hand, they're uncomfortable, like little kids. It's a new game, Dad's not playing, and they have to figure out the rules for themselves."
This spring one of the PRI's top congressional leaders bolted the party after a rival was chosen as the nominee for Governor in Zacatecas State. In response, a party assembly decided to use public primaries to select candidates in five states, and they attracted surprising levels of participation.
In the primary in Chihuahua, Patricio Martinez Garcia, a former Mayor of the state capital, defeated a veteran party official and went on to victory on July 5. It was the first time the party had won back a state that was controlled by the opposition.
"The primaries have given the party an enormous activism and produced candidates with greater political force and legitimacy," Mariano Palacios Alcocer, the party president, said in an interview.
Another Chihuahua primary, however, held on May 9 to select the party's mayoral candidate in Ciudad Juarez, the state's largest city, ended badly. Backers of one leader of the party interrupted the vote count, occupying party headquarters and seizing ballot boxes to protest what they said was an attempt by party leaders to steal the election. The candidate who was finally declared the winner lost the general election, and voting records suggest that thousands of PRI members, embittered by the primary, deserted the party.
Whether a presidential primary could provoke a similar fracture nationwide is a subject of fierce debate within the party, said Agustin Basave Benitez, a PRI leader who is writing a book about attempts to modernize the party. A second debate among those who favor using a national primary to select a presidential candidate centers on who should be allowed to vote and who should be on the ballot, Mr. Basave said.
Mr. Zedillo favors allowing the general public, not just party members, to vote in the presidential primary. He also wants the party to drop its rule barring those who have never been elected to public office from seeking the presidential nomination, a requirement that prevents several members of his Cabinet from seeking the nomination.
Manuel Bartlett, the Governor of Puebla State, who heads the party's traditionalist wing, helped impose the eligibility requirement and he believes that only party members should be allowed to vote in the primary.
The party will decide how to nominate its presidential candidate at a convention late this year. Leaders of Mexico's two main opposition parties are to choose their presidential candidates at party conventions late next year. They have announced no plans to use primaries.
The debate over primaries has been unfolding as Mexico has opened an intense 12-month cycle of gubernatorial elections in 15 states. The contests in several states have already broken sharply with traditional Mexican campaigns, which for decades have centered on rallies in public plazas and with candidates meeting voters street by street.
This is not the first time that Mexican candidates have used television and radio in their campaigns. For years the PRI used Government-controlled newscasts to extol its achievements and to belittle opposition candidates. And since the Government loosened informal restrictions last year that kept opposition parties from buying air time, those parties, in several state races, have broadcast commercials criticizing corruption by Government officials from the PRI.
But this year all three parties are building campaigns around television commercials and radio talk show appearances. "We're entering an age of modern politics in which radio and TV are more important than personal contact with the citizens," said Alfonso Zarate Flores, who edits a political newsletter.

HEADLINE: The New Immigrant Experience

 BODY:
New York City is the capital of the new global economy and also America's traditional port of immigration. Put these together and you get, as Deborah Sontag and Celia Dugger have vividly reported in The Times this week, a new phenomenon of people living in two homelands, old and new, virtually at once. Previous immigrants remembered and even revisited their homelands. But this is the first immigrant generation that can connect back home instantaneously by cell phone, videophone and the Internet. Cheap airfares and relaxed rules on dual citizenship also help many people maintain lifelong relationships with their ancestral lands.
One result is a changing New York City, which now counts an all-time high of 2.7 million foreign-born residents. But the consequences are also felt around the world as these immigrants share their American experiences and American-earned dollars with relatives and neighbors who stayed behind. 
 When Hamid Ali goes into a videophone parlor in the Kensington section of Brooklyn, he can see as well as talk to his family back home. But his calls also bring his sister in Pakistan into a more intimate contact with America than she could ever get from Hollywood movies and television. When Vinit Sethi goes back to Jaipur, India, for his arranged marriage to Anshu Jain, he takes his friends from the University of Pennsylvania along with him. It is a meeting of two cultures in very personal terms.
Hundreds of immigrant workers return each year from New York City to Chinantla, Mexico, for the annual fiesta of Padre Jesus. That village has come to know New York, and appreciate its economic opportunities, better than many Americans do. Chinantla owes its economic survival to the $2 million a year sent back by its sons and daughters who toil as waiters, garment workers and mechanics in New York. Some of these first-generation immigrants go back to Chinantla to retire, assuring that their children, too, will make regular trips back home.
Contrast all this to a time when a ship voyage to New York took several weeks, and even a steerage-class fare amounted to a once-in-a-lifetime expense. Even for those who prospered, war or persecution often barred the door back home. Now, Jesus Galvis can serve on the Hackensack, N.J., City Council while running for a Senate seat in Colombia.
New possibilities of global commuting are emerging, and New York, appropriately enough, stands at the center of a new transnational immigrant culture.

Stocks Decline on Concerns Of Slow Earnings Growth
Predictions that corporate earnings will slow later this year and cautionary words about inflation from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, sent stocks falling.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 105.56 points, to 9,190.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 19.03 points, to 1,165.07, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 35.11 points, to 1,979.14. Page D8. 

Shares of Merck fell 7 percent, or $9.8125, to $128.5625 a share, after the drug maker warned that profits in the second half of this year would be a disappointment. Investors focused on this news, sending shares of other drug stocks, including American Home Products, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough lower even though some reported second-quarter earnings that were near Wall Street forecasts. D5.
 
The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 5.66 percent, from 5.71 percent on Monday. D8.
 
Worker Frustration Grows at Saturn
Unlike other General Motors divisions, Saturn has kept producing cars during a crippling parts strike, thanks partly to outside suppliers. But Saturn auto workers are furious because G.M. plans to use many parts from elsewhere for future Saturn vehicles. That is an important reason why they decided to authorize a strike if negotiations fail to resolve their concerns. A1.
 
Earnings Increase at Big Banks
Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, the nation's biggest banks, reported surprisingly high second-quarter earnings on gains in investment banking and currency trading. Banc One and Wells Fargo also reported stronger-than-expected results. But their shares fell sharply in a broad retreat in the stock market. D2.
 
Philip Morris Results Improve
Philip Morris reported an 8.9 percent increase in second-quarter operating earnings on increased sales of the Marlboro brand overseas, which helped offset the effects of a decline in smoking in the United States. D6.
 
Texas Instruments' Earnings Drop
The semiconductor maker Texas Instruments reported a greater-than-expected decline in second-quarter profit, attributing it to weak prices for memory chips. D6.
 
Home Building Rate Rose in June
Housing starts rose 5.6 percent in June, the first increase in four months. Analysts said the increase to an annual rate of 1.615 million units was unexpectedly large and reflected a combination of low mortgage rates, consumer optimism and a stable job market. D3.
 
Microsoft Names No. 2 to Gates
Steven A. Ballmer, left, was promoted to president of Microsoft, as expected. This means that William H. Gates, the 42-year-old chairman, will hand over some of his day-to-day management chores. He emphasized that the management change was mainly intended to allow him to spend more time on long-term technology and product issues. D2.
 
Seagate Technology Ousts Chief
Seagate Technology has asked its chief executive, Alan F. Shugart, a pioneer in the invention of the computer disk drive, to retire. It named Stephen J. Luczo, the company's president, to turn the financially ailing company around. D5.
 
Hewlett-Packard Warns on Profits
Hewlett-Packard warned that third-quarter profit would not meet analysts' expectations because the company is struggling with slowing sales, mostly in Asia. D4.

HEADLINE: Starts on New Homes Grew 5.6% in June

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Builders started work on more new homes in June than in the previous month as they sought to keep pace with record sales.
The Commerce Department said today that housing starts rose 5.6 percent last month, to an annual rate of 1.615 million units. The increase, which exceeded analysts' expectations, was the first in four months. For May, the decline was revised to 1 percent, from a drop of seven-tenths of 1 percent initially reported. 
 Home buyers and builders alike have enjoyed the fruits of declining mortgage rates, lofty consumer optimism, a stable job market and steady income growth. Housing starts have exceeded an annual rate of 1.5 million units for 10 consecutive months, the longest stretch at that level since a 55-month run from May 1983 through November 1987, a Government spokeswoman said.
The report today also showed that permits for new-home construction, a gauge of future construction starts, fell 1.7 percent in June, to a 1.517 million annual rate, after having risen a revised 1.7 percent in May, to a rate of 1.543 million units.
By region, June housing starts fell 9.3 percent in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 136,000. They rose 8.4 percent in the South, to a 760,000 annual rate; 1.6 percent in the Midwest, to a 310,000 rate, and 9.4 percent in the West, to a 409,000 rate.
Starts on single-family houses rose 2.5 percent; on multifamily buildings, 17.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Labor's Peace With G.M. Unraveling at Saturn

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: SPRING HILL, Tenn., July 21

 BODY:
 The biggest question in the auto industry this summer is how the enormous factory here is still churning out Saturn cars a month after strikes at parts factories in Flint, Mich., forced every other General Motors assembly plant in the United States to close.
The answer is that the 7,300 workers and their union have struck an uncomfortable bargain. In the name of preserving the nation's best-known experiment in cooperation between labor and management, they have set aside union solidarity by assembling cars using parts from Japan and at least one nonunion American company. 
 "I felt O.K. about it mainly because the biggest thing is to satisfy your customers," Stacey Young, a unionized wheel inspector and strong supporter of the local union leadership, said as he stood inside the entrance to the United Automobile Workers union hall here.
But even as the factory here keeps humming thanks to outside suppliers, the auto workers are furious because G.M. plans to build future Saturn cars and a new sport utility vehicle using many parts from elsewhere -- other G.M. factories, as well as outside suppliers paying lower wages.
The strongest expression yet of workers' frustration came on Sunday, when they voted overwhelmingly to authorize their leaders to call a strike if further negotiations failed to resolve the local union's concerns. Yet in a sign of continued reluctance to cause any harm to the G.M. division they helped to build, local union leaders have since said that they will talk for at least 30 days before actually starting a walkout. If the Flint strikes are settled during that time, national leaders of the U.A.W. are unlikely to give their permission soon for any more local strikes, so as to give G.M. and the union a chance to recover for a while.
Nonetheless, the workers' dissatisfaction here appears to be the leading edge of a new source of conflict between G.M. and the U.A.W. Most of the recent strikes, including the seven-week-old strikes in Flint, have been by workers demanding that G.M. invest more in their factories and not switch production to outside suppliers. But workers here are opposing even G.M.'s new campaign to reap huge economies of scale in its own factories by building a few common parts in huge volumes for many models. In the case of Saturn, workers do not want a new sport utility vehicle to use engines, transmissions and dashboards built at other G.M. factories.
The nation's only Saturn factory began producing cars eight years ago. The U.A.W. contract with G.M. here calls for substantial participation by workers in everything from how work stations on the assembly line are laid out to the long-range strategy of the Saturn division. The factory quickly attracted hundreds of delegations each year from companies and unions around the world. Visitors marveled at how Saturn workers could be so productive and get along so well with management in an industry and a corporation known for fractious labor relations.
Workers had hoped that the success of the Saturn brand would prompt General Motors to build more models here and even produce most of the parts here, thus preserving the Spring Hill factory's unusual self-reliance.
Saturn workers voted by a two-thirds majority in March to keep their innovative labor contract, which has given workers a large say, until now, in many business decisions. But relations with management have deteriorated considerably since that referendum was held, partly because of G.M.'s plans to build the Saturn-brand sport utility vehicle with relatively few parts from the factory here. G.M. is also paying workers a second-quarter bonus of $390 apiece when the union says $1,400 is owed.
Though many workers are particularly upset by their bonuses, their leaders are more worried about the planned sport utility vehicle. Though there has been no suggestion that G.M. will close the 7,300-employee factory here, employment will decline if less work is done inside, Michael Bennett, the local union chairman, warned. "They are looking at just basically outsourcing everything they can, and run it through a lean assembly and still call it a Saturn," he said.
Donald Hudler, Saturn's chairman and president, began meeting here today with local union officials in an effort to reconcile differences. But having created one of the nation's most successful brands, G.M. is determined to put the Saturn name on more models, and not just models produced by the workers here. G.M. is currently expanding the Spring Hill factory and wants to use its equipment to full capacity, so job losses are unlikely regardless of what vehicle models or parts are produced here, one company official added.
G.M. executives have made no secret of their desire to improve the auto maker's economies of scale by building just a few vehicle underbodies, engines and transmissions and then varying the sheet metal that goes over them.
G.M., the world's largest auto maker, previously used 22 vehicle underbody designs, each costing more than $500 million to engineer and sometimes differing by millimeters. Now the company has 14 chassis and plans to shrink the number to 9 within a decade.
Anger started to build here two years ago, when G.M. decided that a long-awaited Saturn midsize sedan, scheduled to go on sale next year, would share an underbody with the Opel Astra sedan from G.M.'s Opel division in Germany. The Saturn SL will be produced in Wilmington, Del., at a much older G.M. factory with a more traditional union agreement than here.
Saturn employees are particularly distressed to see work being done elsewhere because the small-car market is withering, as low gasoline prices have persuaded many Americans to buy sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks instead. Small-car sales dropped 7.6 percent during the first half of this year from the first half of last year, while sales of sport utility vehicles rose 18.4 percent.
Saturn now makes only small cars, with prices ranging from $10,595 for an economy version to $17,500 for a sports coupe with lots of options. Even within the small-car market, Saturn has been losing ground in the last two years to Asian competitors that have used the weakness of their home currencies to offer lavish rebates and other discounts. During the first half of this year, Saturn's sales tumbled 9.4 percent from a year earlier.
The growing unhappiness here is strengthening the position of union dissidents who want to scrap the cooperative labor agreement with G.M. and return to the national agreement in force elsewhere, which provides greater protection from layoffs but limits opportunities for bonuses. Two leading dissidents, Richard Benavides and Thomas Hopp, said that they would wait to see what the negotiations would produce and might later push for another referendum on the cooperative agreement.
Saturn's reliance on small cars worries even workers like Barbara Mason, a transmission gear assembly worker here who supports the current arrangement. "Our biggest concern is job security," she said. "We need something to come on line to preserve our job security."

HEADLINE: CONSTRUCTION COLLAPSE IN TIMES SQUARE: THE BUILDING;
Builders Had Good Record On Safety, City Says

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It is intended to be a towering symbol of the rebirth of Times Square, but the mirrored Conde Nast building under construction at Broadway and 42d Street has so far drawn attention mostly because of its spectacular accidents.
The collapse of an elevator support tower yesterday, which killed an elderly woman, was the third major incident at the site, and it came less than a month after a carpenter working near the support tower was crushed to death by a construction elevator cab. In January, a crane arm six stories above the street buckled and fell onto a building across 43d Street, shattering part of that building's glass facade. 
 But while city officials called the accident yesterday the most serious in more than a decade in the New York construction industry, they said that the contractors working on the Conde Nast building had had a comparatively good safety record since excavation for the 48-story tower began a year and a half ago.
Tishman Construction, the company that oversees the project, has been cited for two construction-related violations by the city's Building Department, neither of which concerned the elevator system or appeared to be major. Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said a separate inspection team that concentrates on work-site safety had cited the company for one violation, "poor housekeeping," which means that objects that could be swept off high floors by wind were not properly secured.
The officials said that the contractor responsible for building the elevator tower and scaffold, Universal Builders Supply of the Mount Vernon, N.Y., had been issued no violations on the project. The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has also inspected the site, is investigating the June 26 death of the carpenter, who worked for Universal.
But city officials emphasized that Universal had performed well on high-profile jobs. In the early 1980's, the company won the contract for the scaffolding that encased Statue of Liberty for two years during its face lift, and more recently, it erected the scaffolding for the interior restoration of Grand Central Terminal.
"Clearly this many accidents at one building is unusual," said Gaston Silva, the Buildings Commissioner. "On the other hand they're not connected.
"These are first-class builders," he added. "They're not fly-by-night."
Such assurances gave little comfort to shaken workers in the office buildings nearby.
Richard Valencia, a textiles salesman who works at 1500 Broadway, on the northeast corner of 43d Street, witnessed both the collapsing crane and yesterday's accident from his 14th floor office window. And last week, he said he was also nearly struck by 10-foot lengths of wood that blew off the building site.
"These were accidents waiting to happen," he said angrily yesterday. "They want to finish the building as quickly as possible."
Indeed, skyscrapers do go up faster in New York than anywhere else in the world, according to construction executives. And over all, construction is one of the most dangerous industries in which to work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 23 workers were killed at construction sites in New York City in 1996, the most recent year for which figures are available.
In the past, both Tishman and Universal Builders have been cited by OSHA for what it considers serious worker safety violations, though the agency's assistant regional administrator, Gill Gillen, said the companies are "not really out of the ordinary."
During a project at the Atlantic City convention center in 1996, Universal was assessed $1,800 in fines for two violations. Two years earlier, Tishman was cited for five violations at a project on Washington Street in the West Village and fined $10,750. The nature of the violations for both companies was unclear yesterday.
Demolition for the 48-story Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square began in August 1996, and construction moved along faster than anyone expected; at one point during the building of the steel skeleton, workers added one floor a week.
The project had been a triumph for Douglas Durst, who became the first developer to build an new office tower since a devastating recession in 1992. The building was the first of four skyscrapers that had been long delayed to begin rising in Times Square, and its two major tenants -- Conde Nast and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom -- were more proof of the area's rebirth.
But yesterday's deadly accident, coming on the heels of the other two, was a blow to Mr. Durst. "This is a terrible tragedy," he said.

Cone Delivers In Short Order

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
On the night after, David Cone restored some semblance of sanity to Yankee Stadium. The Yankees and the Detroit Tigers did not play 26 innings, or even 17. They did not take 5 hours 50 minutes to play the game the Yankees won, 5-1.
Cone, with a little help from his friends, tucked the Tigers away in a relatively crisp 2 hours 40 minutes, providing the perfect antidote to the exhaustion that overtook the players the night before. 
 Continuing to mount a strong case for his first full-season Cy Young award, Pedro Martinez notwithstanding, Cone stymied the Tigers on eight hits, allowed no earned runs, walked only one and struck out 10 in eight innings. The game marked the 10th time in his last 11 starts that Cone, who won the Cy Young in the strike-shortened 1994 season, has permitted fewer than three earned runs.
The Tigers scored a run against Cone in the first, but they did it with the aid of an error by Scott Brosius, who let Tony Clark's bouncer get through him with runners at first and third. The Tigers scored no more.
The Yankees, on the other hand, staged a varied offensive as the first two hitters in their lineup produced three runs with bats and legs. Derek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch each hit a home run, and Jeter used a walk and two stolen bases to put himself in position to score on a sacrifice fly by Tino Martinez.
"We don't need to go extra innings," a weary Jeter had said before the game, and he took steps to make sure the game ended in the regulation nine.
The victory was the Yankees' 70th of this magical season, the first time in the franchise's glorious history that the team has won 70 of the first 95 games. With 67 games remaining, the Yankees need to win 47 to register the most victories in a major league season.
A 47-20 record computes to a .701 percentage. The Yankees' 70-25 season record produces a .737.
In gaining his 14th victory, most in the majors, against three defeats, Cone has an .824 winning percentage. His 3.44 earned run average is misleading because he gave up 16 earned runs in his first two starts. Subtract those spring training-like performances, and Cone has a nifty 2.51 e.r.a., a figure that more accurately reflects the impressive pitching the 35-year-old right-hander has provided this season.
"I'm just real happy with my style," Cone said. "My approach is much better. I'm real aggressive and my walk total is way down. Even the strikeouts I'm getting have been of an economical nature. Over the last six weeks I've gotten some strikeouts, but they have been three, four, five-pitch strikeouts."
Cone nevertheless threw 134 pitches last night, his most since he threw the same number in a game three years ago in Milwaukee. His string of low-run performances, on the other hand, basically has come since he moved from the right side of the rubber to the left. Recalling that he changed after a discussion with Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, the last week of May, Cone said: "My curveball's gotten a lot better; my breaking stuff is much sharper. It gives me a little better leverage and a little better angle on my breaking pitches. I think it's been a key turning point for me this year, maybe in my career."
The Yankees' master did his best pitching last night in the first and seventh innings.
After the first-inning error by Brosius left runners at first and third with one out, Cone struck out Luis Gonzalez and retired Geronimo Berroa, always a dangerous Yankee Stadium hitter, on an infield pop-up.
Paul Bako, who at that point had caught 28 consecutive innings over two nights and three games, led off the seventh with a single, the third of his four hits. Deivi Cruz, the ninth batter in the lineup, then struck out. So did Brian Hunter, who extended his series futility to no hits in 18 at-bats.
But Damion Easley rapped a grounder past a diving Brosius for a double that sent Bako to third. Bobby Higginson, whose two-run home run made Monday night's second game closer than the Yankees liked, was the next batter.
"I wanted to stay in tight on him, tie him up, not let him get his hands extended," Cone said. "It seems like the home run he got last night in the upper deck was a pitch out over the plate."
Cone set up Higginson, he said, with two sliders in on him, then fired a fastball in that he took for the third strike.
"Without a doubt that was the key pitch of the game," Cone said.
By then, though, the Yankees had a 5-1 lead. Jeter drove his 11th home run of the season into the right-field stands in the first, and successive no-out singles in the second by Martinez, Tim Raines, Darryl Strawberry and Brosius led to two more runs.
The Yankees scored all of their runs against Brian Moehler, who failed to become the first pitcher to beat the Yankees three times this season.
Moehler has been a different pitcher on the road than at home. In 12 starts at Tiger Stadium, including two against the Yankees, he has a 9-0 record; in nine starts on the road, including two against the Yankees, he has a 1-7 record.

Officials Criticize Ruling On Expansion by Casino

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
A court ruling barring Donald J. Trump and the state from seizing three properties to make room for a casino expansion was criticized by state and local officials yesterday as an obstacle to redevelopment that will stop new projects from being built.
The Mayor of Atlantic City, James Whelan, and leaders of the State Casino Reinvestment Development Authority said the ruling would make it harder for casino companies to assemble enough land to build here. "The courts are making a shambles of economic development in this town," said James Kennedy, executive director of the authority. 
 In Monday's ruling, Judge Richard Williams of Superior Court said the state had no right to seize the properties of a homeowner, Vera Coking, and two businesses to make room for a Trump Plaza expansion because the primary beneficiary of the condemnations would have been Mr. Trump, not the public.
Mayor Whelan said money-hungry property owners were blocking new casino projects by putting exorbitant prices on their land. "There's a perception broadcast by the media that Atlantic City hasn't been redeveloped and why hasn't more been done in 20 years?" he said. "Then Vera Coking is held up next to the American flag. But she's in it for the same reason Donald Trump is -- for the money."

Sizzling on the Internet: Barbecued Hog and More
Kansas City, Mo., with its stockyards and slaughterhouses, and restaurant hickory fires burning day and night, is the world capital of barbecue, or so says the Kansas City Bar B Q Connection (www.rbjb.com/ rbjb/bbq.htm). Texas, Alabama and North Carolina all have their supporters -- and sites for staking their claims. But Kevin Halle, a New Jerseyan who now lives in Mississippi and runs the capacious Backyard Bar-B-Que site (home.cybertron.com/ khalle/bb00002.htm), says he has tried barbecue from all over the world, and to him the real capital is in any barbecue lover's heart.
Wherever that mythical place may be, barbecue is virtually sizzling on the Internet this season. Most barbecue sites seem to be in the South, where barbecue, real barbecue, means pork. It's mainly in the North that the art form ventures into beef, lamb, chicken and fish. 
 Home barbecuers might want to skip the regional pit wars and go straight to a basic rundown on the most popular ways to cook outdoors -- quick grilling, smoke roasting and "true-blue, slow-cooked barbecue." These are the ABC's of the Barbecue Man, Larry Gerber (novaplaza.com/bbqman/ hints.shtml), who is on radio and television in the Chicago area. Click on Recipes for examples like barbecued back ribs.
Mr. Halle, who is a Navy chef (and a shore-side barbecuer), provides a menu of foot-of-the-page links to navigate his site. He is lavish with recipes, including tequila chicken wings, grilled swordfish and buffalo stew. Go to his links menu for sauces, marinades, rubs and pastes. There is also a page titled "How to Cook a Whole Hog." (It takes about 24 hours, giving the family plenty of time to watch a video of, say, "Babe.")
Better Homes and Gardens (www.bhglive .com/survival) comes to the aid of backyard cooks with a summer's worth of meat-and-potatoes barbecue recipes. Tick a box for flank steak or sweet peppers or new potatoes, and up come grilling instructions.
Another food site worth knowing, food .epicurious.com, has put up three pages of barbecue recipes for the summer from Gourmet and Bon Appetit magazines called How Do You Want It? Flip This and Summer Flames. One of them, not always the same one, can be found by clicking on Eating, and it will link to the other two.
Even Bobby Seale, the onetime Black Panther, has a barbecue site on the Web (www.bobbyseale.com/bbq.html). It's there to sell his barbecue cookbook, but he offers samples and a mini-autobiography, with much about black American cooking and speech and the West African roots of both (click on BobbyQue? Yes!). Of childhood barbecues, he writes: "Under enormous tents which sheltered us from the blazing Texas sun, we'd feast on dishes prepared by the sisters of the church. Sweet potato pie, fried chicken and fish, and barbecues of smoked beef and spareribs were prepared by the men and women at the pits."
The booster sites on the Web are generally more interested in reviewing regional barbecue restaurants than in recipes. For Alabama, for instance, see www.wsfa.com/ bbq.htm. Texas Barbeque (pages.prodigy. com/TX/connieblack/bbq.html) offers chat, reviews, recipes and yarns. For North Carolina, try roscoe.simplenet.com/pork/ pork.html.
A slight counterweight to this Southern predominance is the New England Barbecue Society site (nebs.netrelief.com), which is dedicated to teaching Yankees -- or others not born to barbecue -- the difference between grilling and real wood- or charcoal-smoked pit barbecue. The site is a member of the Smoke Ring, 121 linked barbecue sites, some selling grills and sauces. Those with barbecue in their hearts, of course, can't get enough of this stuff.
 
The Old Switcheroo

"I developed a knack for substituting ingredients as a result of living in rural areas for most of my adult life," Lori Alden, keeper of the Cook's Thesaurus (www .switcheroo.com), said by E-mail. Those areas have included West Africa and the north coast of California, where Ms. Alden teaches economics at Humboldt State University and her husband is a forester. "I often substitute when I can't find exotic ingredients or when I want to avoid making a long trip to the store," she added.
The fruits of her lifetime interest appear on the very thorough pages of her site. Her suggestions for substitutes are intended for dieters looking for low-fat or low-calorie alternatives and for gourmets on a budget, among others. Ms. Alden offers 10 categories (like vegetables, alcohol, meat and fish, grain products), each subdivided further.
Her Sugars page (under flavorings and accompaniments) describes how baking will be affected by the use of powdered sugar, corn syrup, rice syrup, honey (she warns against feeding it to infants), maple syrup plus baking soda, granulated fructose or molasses. Under Milk and Cream, she gives substitutes for Chantilly cream, clotted cream, whipped cream and others, with discussions of butterfat content. For those with lactose maldigestion, milk allergy or casein intolerance, she also has a No Milk page.
Ms. Alden's bibliography (click on Sources and Links) shows just how deeply she has mined the subject.
 
New York Tastes (Cont.)

More tastes of New York on the Web for New Yorkers in exile (and stay-at-homes):
Balducci's has a mail-order site (www.balducci.com), set up as an on-line catalogue with illustrations of pastas and sauces; biscotti and cookies; delicacies like goat cheese in oil, white truffles and foie gras; coffees, and candies. The ordering process uses AT&T Secure Buy Service, to relieve those who feel uneasy about giving credit card information to a Web site. It's also possible to find what you want on line and then pick up the phone, call the store at (212) 260-0400, which stocks most of what's shown, and have it delivered (Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens only).

Greenspan Remarks Bolster Treasury Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds rose sharply yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggested the Asian crisis was slowing the economy, reinforcing expectations that interest rates will remain steady.
The benchmark 30-year bond increased 23/32, to 106 20/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 5.66 percent, from 5.71 percent on Monday. 
 In his twice-yearly appearance before Congress, the Fed chairman dampened speculation that the central bank might lower short-term interest rates soon. But bond traders said he also appeared to reaffirm the Fed's cautious approach, suggesting no change in policy. Many had expected Mr. Greenspan would not signal any change because of the financial crisis in Asia and expectations that it would slow growth in the second half of this year, offsetting the effect of a strong labor market and rising consumer demand.
Lou Brien, a trader for First Continental Trading in Chicago, said there was a little something for everyone in yesterday's testimony but that it was clearly interpreted as a positive sign for bonds.
"I think Mr. Greenspan has commented several times in the past that the economy is in a virtuous cycle, and today so are the bonds," he said.
Mr. Greenspan spoke to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. He will conclude his testimony before the House Banking Committee today.

Shares Fall on Fed Chief's Testimony and Profit Forecasts

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Forecasts of slowing growth in corporate earnings later in the year and cautionary words about inflation from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, sent stocks tumbling yesterday.
The declines halted a nearly two-week rally among technology shares, pushing the Nasdaq composite index lower after nine straight gains. 
 Earnings reports dominated the landscape throughout the day as concerns raised by companies of weaker results later this year overshadowed strong results of the latest quarter.
"You've got a stock market which is high; it's overvalued," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "Everything has to go right, and when one of the most dependable companies tells us that its earnings are going to be a disappointment, it stirs worries about profits."
That company was Merck, America's largest drug company, which said second-quarter earnings rose 14 percent on sales of new pills to treat asthma and baldness and increased sales of Zocor, a cholesterol drug.
But shares of the drug maker fell 9 13/16, or 7 percent, to 128 9/16, after it warned that such a performance would not be repeated later in the year.
While other drug companies reported strong earnings, Merck's second-half warning sent most drug stocks lower.
In contrast, I.B.M. rose 6 1/8, to 128 1/8. Although it reported only slightly better-than-expected earnings on Monday, there is some optimism that the company's performance will improve later this year.
In his semiannual testimony before Congress yesterday, Mr. Greenspan signaled that the nation's central bank was more concerned about inflation than slowing economic growth.
The bond market, especially sensitive to Mr. Greenspan's perceived warnings about inflation, interpreted his remarks as a sign that interest rates would likely remain steady. But in the stock market, major indexes ended sharply lower.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 105.56 points, to 9,190.19, its lowest level in a week and a 1.14 percent decline. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 19.03 points, to 1,165.07, off 1.61 percent. The Nasdaq index lost 1.74 percent, falling 35.11 points, to 1,979.14. Microsoft, Cisco and Dell led the declines.
Some analysts expressed confidence the market would rebound from Mr. Greenspan's remarks.
"He's just trying to talk the markets down," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Scudder Kemper Investments. "It's a buying opportunity."

From Freemen to Pheasants at a Montana Ranch

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: JORDAN, Mont.

 BODY:
At the old Clark farmhouse, where Freemen theorists once advocated the supremacy of white males, a new kind of pecking order is incubating.
Under bright lights, 1,000 pheasant brooders are fattening, preparing for release this summer into the rolling hills of the Missouri Breaks. The 960-acre Clark ranch, which two years ago was embedded into the nation's consciousness as a symbol of far-right anti-government resistance, is being reinvented as a place for tourists to pay to hunt birds. 
 In 1996, about two dozen Freemen, a group of rural extremists who claimed they were not subject to United States laws, holed up at the Clark ranch with 100 firearms in a standoff with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After 81 days, they gave up. The siege ended on June 13, 1996, without a shot fired.
Now Jordan residents have returned to their natural rhythms, complaining about low prices for beef and wheat and praising the heavy rains that painted an emerald green across Montana's Big Open.
"Maybe there are two or three on the edges that are left," Nickolas C. Murnion, the Garfield County Attorney, said of the collapse of the Freemen movement. "But most everyone is just kind of sick of it."
The lone lawyer in this county of 1,500 residents, Mr. Murnion was often the target of Freemen death threats and pseudo-legal screeds.
 On July 8, a Federal jury in Billings, Mont., convicted the group's six ringleaders of banking fraud and other charges. It failed to reach a verdict on charges against six others.
For his persistent opposition to the extremists, Mr. Murnion was recently honored in Boston with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Although Mr. Murnion said he saw the Freemen movement as dormant, he warned of a return of economic conditions that could make desperate farmers receptive to extremism.
"You can have a ranch worth $1.2 million on paper, not owe a dime, and still not make a living wage," said Mr. Murnion, a third-generation rancher, adding that wheat prices had fallen by half in three years and that cattle prices here were below production costs.
Jordan, a village with a population of about 500, is in a struggle to survive, a struggle repeated in small towns across the thinly populated plains. This spring, only an increase in the real estate tax kept Jordan's hospital from closing. One rural school is threatened with closing because it has fallen below the state minimum of five pupils for a one-room schoolhouse, and the county courthouse was destroyed in a fire.
Residents had grumbled about the invasion of reporters, Federal agents and paramilitary leaders during the Freemen siege. Today, they realize that the siege pumped millions into the local economy.
No Freemen tourism is on the horizon though. Because no blood was shed, Jordan is not on the itinerary of the far-right sites of martyrdom that includes Waco, Tex., and Ruby Ridge, Idaho. The siege left virtually no mark, a testament to the healing power of the land. Grass grows at the Garfield County Fair Grounds, once a muddy command post teeming with Federal agents.
On a hilltop, the green and white Clark ranch house looks little changed from the days when photographers trained the highest-powered lenses on what was identified as "the Supreme Court of Justus Township." One recent afternoon, though, the occupants, Dean Clark and his wife, were out, having casually left the front door open and the television on. He was farming and she was feeding the ring-necked pheasants. After the siege, Mr. Clark retrieved the ranch from Freemen relatives and was paid $50,000 in compensation by the Government, which had blocked access to his cropland in the standoff.
Down a hill is the ranch's fishing pond. During the siege, reporters calculated that there were enough trout and walleyes in the pond to sustain the 25 holdout Freemen for months. On a recent evening, Bud Holter, the retired owner of a sporting goods store, displayed a creel filled with fat trout. His two teen-age grandchildren frolicked in the swimming hole.
"This is my get-away-from-it-all place," the children's mother, Jeri Lester, said as she watched them swim. Referring to the pastoral site that was once "the Freemen compound," she sighed and said: "This is so peaceful. It is heaven on earth."

HEADLINE: From a Broker, Concern About On-Line Trading

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif., July 22

 BODY:
On-line trading can be hazardous to your wallet. That was the cautionary conclusion of John L. Steffens, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company, in a speech at the Spotlight conference, an annual gathering of computer industry executives and entrepreneurs held here this week.
Mr. Steffens said that the ease and convenience of Internet-based trading was seducing people into buying and selling stocks more often than they should. So-called E-traders, he said, tend to trade three to four times more often than people who buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage firms. And E-traders pay a price for that haste and frequency. 
 Mr. Steffens cited a study by economists at the University of California at Davis that looked at the trading habits of 60,000 households from 1991 to 1996. According to the study, the most active traders had a rate of return of 10 percent per year, compared with a 15 percent return for those who traded least often.
"People are killing themselves by trading too much -- there's no question," said Terry Odean, an assistant professor of finance at the university and one of the study's authors.
According to Mr. Steffens, 25 to 30 percent of retail stock trades are done electronically, and the median age of an on-line trader is about 36.
Mr. Steffens, 57, is of the old school of stock market investing, which is guided by a principle of long-term stock holdings. When held for years, not months or weeks, stocks gain value, he said, and serious investors recognize that.
Most of the 200 or so people in the audience were in their 30's and early 40's, and their livelihood depends on promoting the benefits of the Internet. Some two-thirds of those said they traded stocks on line.
"The question is, are you interested in fun and games or investing?" Mr. Steffens said in an interview. "The two are very different."
Mr. Steffens added that on-line trading had also caused increased volatility in the stock markets because of the ease with which it is done. And he agreed with an audience member that on-line trading could become the "Las Vegas of the next century."
There are several firms that offer no-frills electronic trading. But while Merrill Lynch uses the Net to give clients instant access to research and other information, it does not yet offer on-line stock trading, though it plans to do so for some customers by the end of the year.
Whether Mr. Steffens convinced his audience was unclear. He did, however, make some kind of impression. When a conference official polled the audience before Mr. Steffens's presentation, most people said they considered the Internet as more of an opportunity for Merrill Lynch than a threat. Thirty minutes later, when the same question was posed again after Mr. Steffens's remarks, most people in the audience decided that the on-line world was a threat to the brokerage firm.
David Braunschvig, a managing director at Lazard Freres & Company, who attended the conference, said of the opinion swing: "It's not that they were more bearish on Merrill, but they realized the complexity of the whole landscape. It was the first time they started thinking of the relative merits of, and challenges for, an established brand coming into the on-line arena."

NEWS
 
After 'Monty'
Robert Carlyle, who shed his clothes in "The Full Monty," may don a pivotal role in the film adaptation of Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning best seller, "Angela's Ashes." Variety reported that Mr. Carlyle was in discussions to join Emily Watson in Alan Parker's version of the story of the impoverished Irish family. Mr. Carlyle would play the alcoholic, chronically unemployed father, and Ms. Watson would play his wife. 

Ponderous Prose
Drawing inspiration from newspapers in his hometown, Milton, Mass., Bob Perry, a 46-year-old corporate lawyer, beat competitors from the United States and 14 other countries to win the 17th annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. The challenge -- composing wretched opening sentences for imaginary novels -- celebrates the memory of the prolific 19th-century novelist who began "Paul Clifford" with the immortal sentence: "It was a dark and stormy night." Mr. Perry's 93-word prize-winning sentence begins: "The corpse exuded the irresistible aroma of a piquant ancho chili glaze enticingly enhanced with a hint of fresh cilantro as it lay before him. . ." San Jose State University's English department, which organized the contest, said Mr. Perry's prize consisted of much local adulation and "a pittance."
 
Flying Visit
Count Kevin Spacey among actors with a busy, perhaps impossible, schedule. Plans called for him to take the night off from his role on the London stage as Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's "Iceman Cometh" and to fly via New York to Los Angeles yesterday for the premiere of his film "The Negotiator." Then Mr. Spacey was to catch the red-eye back to New York, board the Concorde and return to London, leaving 90 minutes to reach the Old Vic in time for last night's performance. In case of a delay, he said, he and his colleagues "have a good ending of the first act if I'm not there."
 
Grand Reopening
In Munich, Germany, the Alte Pinakothek, one of the world's great museums, is to reopen today, after four years of renovations. The $41.7 million project included modernizing the security system and installing air conditioning to protect the collection and glass to guard works by Durer, Tintoretto and Bruegel from vandals.
 
Princely Passions
From Renaissance royalty to the Spice Girls. That is the range of the exhibition opening on Saturday at the National Museum and Gallery in Cardiff, Wales, representing 500 years of art collecting by the Princes of Wales. Among the works on display for the first time is John Ward's portrait of Diana, Princess of Wales, in her wedding gown, commissioned by the Prince of Wales. The show, which runs through Nov. 8, includes sculpture, silver, arms, armor and drawings.

What Price Preservation?

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
THERE were no suntanned, silver-haired corporate angels on hand on July 14, when Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the Dutch Reformed Church here to talk about historic preservation. Her backdrop was the derelict Greek revival temple by Alexander Jackson Davis, completed in 1835, once an uplifting symbol of the city's material progress and now an evocative, camera-ready testament to urban decay.
"What does it mean to save a building?" Mrs. Clinton mused before a large crowd assembled in the sweltering heat. "When a town like Newburgh is able to revitalize its history, you become a beacon of economic development and tourism." 
 By saving landmarks and living with them daily, "you begin to tell yourselves and your children the story of Newburgh," she observed. "That makes America more real."
The day before, the President and the First Lady shared the dais at the National Museum of American History with Ralph Lauren, announcing with much hoopla the designer's $10 million rescue of the flag that inspired "The Star-Spangled Banner," (presumably this flag is off-limits for Mr. Lauren as a style phenomenon).
The dueling images -- Mr. Lauren as patriotic savior and a vacant city church without a patron -- underscored the paradox of Mrs. Clinton's "Save America's Treasures" tour: For every million-dollar pledge by a Ralph Lauren or G.E. to rescue a star, there were humbler places like the Dutch Reformed Church or the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Mass., waiting for deliverance. Who should pay to preserve them?
The First Lady made a pledge herself, donating royalties from a coming book of letters to the First Pets to the National Park Foundation. (The nonprofit foundation announced this week that the Coca-Cola Foundation was donating $1.5 million to pay for hands-on discovery centers at nine national parks.)
In an interview, Mrs. Clinton said that government -- Federal, state and local -- should bear a large part of the financial burden for historical preservation, supplemented by public-private partnerships. "Government has the primary obligation," she said. "But there are also many people with resources who might not have thought about the contribution they could make."
Although state and local governments made forays into preservation at least as early as 1816, when Independence Hall in Philadelphia was purchased and restored, ever since the Mount Vernon Ladies Association rescued George Washington's mansion and grounds, preservation in the United States has relied on contributions and philanthropy.
The most notable Federal exception, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, created the National Register of Historic Places, which now has nearly 80,000 entries, and a program of matching grants for their preservation.
But practically from the beginning, preservationists have had to be skillful quilters, piecing together funds from public and private sources. The private role in public monuments was perhaps most strikingly illustrated by Lee Iacocca's successful campaign to restore the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, which raised more than $400 million.
A leader in public preservation has been the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which has received money from Congress since 1966, but will lose its financing next year. Three years ago, after Congress threatened to pull the plug, the National Trust negotiated a three-year $7 million phase-out and has since been building a war chest to privatize itself. "We're comfortable with it," its president, Richard Moe, said. "The funding fight became a preoccupying thing that distracted us from the issues. We want to be more effective and entrepreneurial."
At the national parks, the repair backlog for historic buildings is more than $1 billion. Three years ago, an experimental program began that returned park entrance fees to the parks; it will generate about $400 million in the next several years, said Edward Norton, vice president for law and public policy for the preservation trust.
The House Appropriations Committee is considering a bill to increase funds for rehabilitating historic buildings in the national parks and to stabilize the deteriorating south side of Ellis Island.
"We're definitely making progress," Mr. Norton said.
But in places like Newburgh, when the tour bus pulls out and the bunting is folded, financing will probably depend, as it always has, on the grit of a determined few. "Preservation is the most underrated catalyst for urban rebirth nationwide," said Roberta Brandes Gratz, author of "Cities Back From the Edge: New Life for Downtown" (John Wiley & Sons, 1998). "The most desirable neighborhoods from Atlanta to Seattle are historic districts. But preservation hasn't gained the star status that big stadium and casino projects have because it happens in small increments."
The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, for example, a model of creative financing, has spent three and a half decades cobbling together reinvestment in formerly low-income, redlined historic districts, neighborhoods that Jane Jacobs once compared to "a working man's Georgetown."
The Pittsburgh foundation, said its president, Arthur P. Ziegler Jr., has set up a partnership with 11 local banks to provide low-interest loans to community-development corporations for low- and moderate-income housing and small businesses in the historic district. The foundation also provides architectural assistance. It set up a $25 million endowment by developing (and then selling) Station Square, a historic railroad station, now housing a hotel, restaurants and other businesses. The project, developed over 20 years, began with seed money from the Allegheny Foundation, heirs to the Mellon fortune.
On a smaller scale, Newburgh is beginning to use the same financing tools. On Lander Street, a block long plagued by drugs and abandonment and which Mrs. Clinton visited, Arnold Moss, a New York developer, is rebuilding 33 vacated 1850's row houses. Working with the Enterprise Foundation and Rural Opportunities, a nonprofit organization that manages affordable housing, he is knitting together private financing (about 80 percent of the $9.5 million needed), state, city and Federal funds and Federal tax credits for low-income housing and historic buildings.
The row houses are being designed as two-family duplexes, which will rent for $500 to $750 a month. The sight of old buildings beginning to look new gladdens Margie Peacock, who has lived on the block for 15 years. "It's not a bad place to live," she said, sitting on her porch, where a sign that says SANTA IS ALWAYS WELCOME HERE hangs on her doorknob. "I love to see it kept up."
T HE monumental Dutch Reformed Church, modeled on an Acropolis temple and considered one of the finest Greek revival churches in America, may have a tougher go. Davis, the 19th-century architect, wrote that the design, with its giant Ionic columns and 30-foot-high entrance door, was meant to be "indicative of the refined taste, discrimination and sense of classical beauty of the inhabitants of Newburgh." But the church lost its congregation in 1964 and has been vacant since. "It is one of the noblest buildings in the city," said J. Winthrop Aldrich, New York's Deputy Commissioner for historic preservation. "But it looks so derelict today, it's hard to imagine what it was or might be."
The preservation of religious properties is "one of the most difficult issues we face," said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a nonprofit organization based in Manhattan, which has provided grants and loans to about 500 religious properties statewide. "Cities seldom know what to do with them or how to raise money for them," she added. "Churches don't just affect the people who go there. They are the truest sense of landmarks: they mark the land, anchor the community."
Right now, the church, which is owned by the city, is in limbo, Mayor Audrey Carey said. Volunteers from the Newburgh Center for the Arts have replaced the roof and tend the grounds. "We'd like to see it become an arts center, or something compatible with community use," Mayor Carey said.
While this church awaits salvation, Target Stores recently bought a six-page insert in Time magazine, proudly hailing its role in helping restore the Washington Monument. (Target gave $2.5 million.) Some preservationists worry about the possible next step: corporate ads a la the Olympics, and logos flying from national landmarks.
On this potentially slippery slope, "it's a question of maintaining a balance," said Tony Wood, a New York City preservationist and founder of the New York Preservation Archives, a nonprofit group. "Our goal is to keep what's been here for 100 years standing," he said. "If you have to choose between corporate sponsorship and losing history, you'd be a fool not to take the check."

HEADLINE: Despite Cutoff by U.S., Ethiopia and Eritrea Easily Buy Weapons

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

 BODY:
Two African countries that had seemed to be on the road to peace and the beginnings of prosperity are buying expensive weapons in preparation for a full-scale war that many officials fear will involve peasant armies and result in instability and another crisis in the Horn of Africa.
The buying spree by Ethiopia and Eritrea -- for helicopters and pilots and rifles and bullets and so on -- is a setback for President Clinton, who has tried to prevent the conflict, which has simmered since May. 
 The World Bank, Japan and other aid donors that had been smiling on both countries in recent years fear that a war and heavy military spending will seriously impede nascent economic development.
Desperate to head off a war, the Administration has decided that it will suspend sales of weapons and war materiel to the two countries, American officials said this week.
The action is quite unlikely, however, to keep the peace. Ethiopia and Eritrea are having no trouble finding countries that are willing to sell weapons, notably China, Bulgaria and Ukraine, arms bazaars where the only question is, "Can you pay?"
China, long a major arms supplier in Africa, has shipped Ethiopia rifles and ammunition, and more has been contracted for, American officials said. For the Eritreans at least nine Ukrainian cargo planes loaded with Bulgarian-made Kalashnikov rifles, ammunition and grenades have arrived in the last week, according to Western officials and accounts in the Bulgarian press.
The Bulgarian company that flew the weapons, Air Sofia, has 10 additional flights scheduled for the next few days from Burgas, Bulgarian port, to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, aviation officials in Turkey said yesterday. Turkey has given permission to fly over its territory.
Air Sofia, which has been accused before of transporting smuggled weapons and other goods, declined to answer questions.
Although the Clinton Administration is alarmed about the prospects of war, it has not tried to stop those countries from selling to Eritrea and Ethiopia, American officials in Washington and Europe said.
It is not clear that the Administration would have any success if it tried to stop the shipments. "We could at least make some noises," an Administration official said.
The relative ease with which Eritrea and Ethiopia are able to procure weapons reflects the sprouting of buyers' markets, particularly in former Communist countries, and an absence of international agreements to control the spread of light weapons.
One nonproliferation agreement, the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement, which was concluded two years ago with support from Washington in the Dutch city for which it is named, has proved largely ineffective at stopping weapons transfers.
Shooting between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in May, when Eritrean troops marched into a small rocky area just inside Ethiopia that both countries claim. But the feud is just as much about economics. Last year Eritrea introduced its own currency, leading to a punishing trade war.
And Ethiopia retains its intense desire for a Red Sea port, which it lost when Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia and became independent in 1993.
For years rebel Ethiopian and Eritrean armies had fought together against the Marxist dictator of Ethiopia, Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was overthrown in 1991. Since then both countries, under pressure from the World Bank and other international donors, had substantially reduced their armies and military budgets. But now both are growing as they prepare for war.
"Both sides are recruiting and training, heavily," an American official said, adding that most recruits are peasants, who will be thrown into the front lines. "Each will have to have a rifle and at least one bullet."
Washington has sought to broker a peace, with senior American officials, including Susan E. Rice, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, shuttling between the capitals. Last month Mr. Clinton called the heads of both Governments, with a plea to find a peaceful resolution.
Bringing in arms from Bulgaria, China and Ukraine "makes a mockery of this whole peace process," said Patrick Smith, editor of a newsletter, African Confidential, in London.

HEADLINE: Revived Political Career Stirs Maryland Politics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: GAITHERSBURG, Md., July 21

 BODY:
This was what he missed the most, politicos and everyday people sitting around a place like Faye's Family Restaurant here, exchanging views, debating the issues of the day.
"This is the happiest I've been in three and a half years," William Donald Schaefer said after excusing himself from a table that included the Montgomery County Executive, the Mayor of Gaithersburg and other local officials. "It's just as if I never left." 
 As Mayor of Baltimore for 16 years through 1987 and then Governor of Maryland for eight years before term limits forced him to retire, Mr. Schaefer defined an era of politics for his focus on economic development and the incessant boosterism of his hometown.
He was brash, unpredictable, often audacious. Funny hats were his trademark but not his only way to make a point. He once responded to criticism from a taxpayer by writing a letter, saying, "I'm glad you have recovered from your lobotomy." To promote the opening of the National Aquarium in Baltimore in 1981, he put on an old-fashioned swimsuit and jumped into the seal pool, clutching a rubber duck.
Retirement lowered his volume and profile, confining him to the quiet of college classrooms, where he taught government, and an office at a Baltimore law firm, where he served as a consultant. He never figured to enter public life again.
Then Louis L. Goldstein, the state comptroller for 40 years, died of a heart attack on July 3. The filing deadline for entering the November election to succeed him was three days away. Mr. Schaefer, 76, saw a rubber duck in his future.
"Once you're in politics, it never gets out of your blood," he said as the lunchtime crowd in Faye's swelled to several dozen, including people who just wanted to shake his hand and welcome him back. "As a true politician, you never lose it. And if you think I'm not going to wear my little hats and do things, just remember, what you see is what you get."
Mr. Schaefer's decision to seek the state's third-highest office has already given this year's election campaign in Maryland a jolt of energy that could reap big dividends for the state Democratic party.
Even before Mr. Goldstein's death, in-fighting had begun dividing party loyalties, leaving Parris N. Glendening one of the few incumbent governors seeking re-election in jeopardy. In 1994, Mr. Glendening prevailed by winning only three of the state's voting districts -- Baltimore City, Prince George's County and Montgomery Country -- and in recent weeks leaders of two of them have broken with him.
Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore, who succeeded Mr. Schaefer, and the Prince George's County Executive, Wayne K. Curry, have endorsed Mr. Glendening's chief rival in the Democratic primary, Eileen M. Rehrmann, the Harford County Executive.
Mr. Glendening is expected to survive the primary, but the general election could be difficult. His likely Republican opponent, Ellen R. Sauerbrey, was defeated by fewer than 6,000 votes four years ago and has campaigned hard this year in the three districts she lost.
"He could help stimulate some turnout," Eric Uslander, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland, said of Mr. Schaefer's potential benefit to the Democrats. "There really isn't anyone else who has his presence."
After Mr. Goldstein died, 11 other Democrats and 7 Republicans filed to run for comptroller, who is the state tax collector. After Mr. Schaefer confirmed he was in the race to stay, 5 Democrats, including Michael D. Barnes, a former Congressman whom Mr. Glendening appointed to serve out Mr. Goldstein's term, and 1 Republican dropped out.
One Democrat who stayed in is Joan M. Pratt, 46, the comptroller of Baltimore since 1995. She bristles at the notion Mr. Schaefer's decision to run for office again might be fueled by his boredom with retirement.
"It is time for a new generation," Ms. Pratt said. "Maryland needs leadership that thinks differently from someone who has been in public service for 35 years."
She also raised an issue that might concern some voters, that a politician with such a strong personality as Mr. Schaefer's might not be satisfied playing a secondary role to a governor with whom he has occasionally differed in the past.
Indeed, the lines could be blurred. After Mr. Schaefer agreed to take questions here today from reporters representing community newspapers, they asked about Montgomery County's pension plan and a proposed highway linking Montgomery and Prince George's County, concerns better suited for a governor to address, not a comptroller.
Mr. Schaefer said he was sensitive to his relationship with Mr. Glendening and the perception that, if elected as comptroller, he would wiggle his way into policy decisions.
"I'd have my job; he has his," Mr. Schaefer said. "He does the policy work. I do income tax and revenue estimates."
Yet as comptroller, who also serves with the governor and state treasurer on the Board of Public Works, he would have considerable influence over important financial decisions that affect localities throughout Maryland. The board approves all contracts involving the state, and one negative vote can veto a deal.
Mr. Goldstein, who helped steer Maryland to a top bond rating for the last 25 years, was a notorious stickler for detail. His objections often saved the state millions of dollars.
The former comptroller ran his office so well that after Mr. Barnes declined the interim appointment, Mr. Glendening felt comfortable enough to promote Mr. Goldstein's deputy, Robert L. Swann, who agreed to serve through the election.
That was fine with Mr. Schaefer, who had no interest on an interim basis even if it meant that he could run as an incumbent. He said he wanted to spend time traveling around the state, schmoozing with local officials to reacquaint himself with topical issues.
Besides, he said, he has no intention of making wholesale changes in the comptroller's office, saying, "I'm not going to fix something that's not broken. The dumbest thing in the world is to get rid of career employees who know their business."
A smooth-working comptroller's office would not only serve the state well, but also Mr. Schaefer. As he noted here today, it would give him more time to wear funny hats, visit places like Faye's and schmooze.
Still, some voters may wonder whether Mr. Schaefer can temper his exuberance in such close proximity to power he held for so long.
"He's the 800-pound gorilla," Mr. Uslander said. "Nobody really knows to what extent he will try to shape state policy. He says there is only one governor, but he was such a powerful force that it might be tough to hold him to that."

Greenspan Act II Leaves Little to Cheer About on Wall St.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned investors again today not to assume that the good times on Wall Street would last forever but said it was hard to know when the party would end.
Asked during an appearance before a House Banking subcommittee if there would be a significant downturn in the stock market at some point, Mr. Greenspan answered yes. 
 "I think that history tells us that there will be a correction of some significant dimension," Mr. Greenspan said. "What it doesn't help you on very much is when. And indeed, history is strewn with periodic contractions of significant dimensions, and I have no doubt that human nature being what it is that it's going to happen again and again and again."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks appeared to contribute to the third consecutive day of declines on Wall Street, where stocks were also hurt by some surprisingly disappointing earnings news from two big high- technology companies, Hewlett-Packard and Computer Associates.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 61.28 points, to 9,128.91, bringing its decline so far for the week to 2.2 percent. Broader market barometers also ended lower, and volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the fourth busiest of the year at 739.9 million shares.
The market has continued to rise regularly to new highs this year despite the economic crisis in Asia, the possibility of resurgent inflation at home and warnings from some analysts that equities are overvalued. Even with the latest declines, the Dow is still up 15.4 percent since Dec. 31, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks is up 20 percent, and the Nasdaq index is up 25.4 percent.
Mr. Greenspan, who has argued repeatedly that stock market values are built on earnings expectations that will be difficult to meet, said it was unclear whether individual investors would bail out of the market in droves if stock prices fell sharply.
"Most of the evidence of recent years is that people who have built up 401(k)'s and other forms of investment and have become quite familiar with the stock market have been the ones who have been buying on the declines, and indeed have turned out to be prescient and wealthier," Mr. Greenspan said.
Responding to a question from Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Greenspan said the big risk from a steep decline in stock prices would lie in the degree to which investors had built up big piles of debt.
"The real danger exists if there is an awful lot of debt which, in the event of a significant stock market contraction, then all of a sudden becomes unserviceable," Mr. Greenspan said.
In his second of two days of testimony before Congress on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan emphasized that the "most probable" course for the economy is "a continuation of what is really quite a remarkable and benign economic environment." He repeated, however, that if the economy did not slow enough on its own to reduce upward pressure on wages and prices, the central bank might have to raise interest rates.
He said there was "no evidence of stability yet" in Asia and other developing regions of the world following the currency crisis that broke out last year.
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that policy makers were having a difficult time predicting how Asia's crisis would play out.
"I have been in the forecasting business for 50 years, and I know when I can forecast something reasonably well and not," Mr. Greenspan said. "This is a tough one."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasuries Off a Bit
Prices of Treasury securities retreated slightly yesterday in what dealers characterized as profit taking on a run-up in the previous session.
The dollar's rebound against the yen in foreign-exchange trading helped to underpin the bond market, dealers said, and the testimony by Mr. Greenspan before Congress had little effect.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 10/32, to 106 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.68 percent, from 5.66 percent on Tuesday.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, Canadian Pacific Railway is trying to persuade holders of 1,000-year bonds issued by the defunct Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway in 1883 to exchange them for Canadian Pacific stock or the security's face value of £100, worth $164 (United States).
Canadian Pacific now runs the old railroad and would like to call these bonds 885 years early, eliminating the administrative headache of keeping track of $1.18 million worth of the 4 percent bonds.

HEADLINE: DuPont Profit Fell by 12% In 2d Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., July 22

 BODY:
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company reported a decline in profit of 12 percent for the second quarter today and said similar results were also likely for the current quarter. It had warned earlier this month that a decline could be expected.
The company attributed the lowering of profit, which followed 16 consecutive quarters of record earnings, to costs related to acquisitions; lower prices for oil, fibers and chemicals used in crop protection, and the strike at the General Motors Corporation. 
 "We expect the challenges we faced in the second quarter to continue, exacerbated by slowing volumes from the growing effects of the General Motors strike and the Asian financial crisis," Charles O. Holliday Jr., president and chief executive, said. DuPont is the largest manufacturer of chemicals in the United States, and G.M. is one of its largest customers.
In the second quarter, profit before charges fell to $1 billion, or 87 cents a diluted share, from $1.14 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. The result matched analysts' forecasts.
DuPont's shares fell $3.1875 today, to $63.4375, on the New York Stock Exchange. On July 9, the day DuPont said earnings in the second quarter might fall as much as 15 percent, the stock lost $7 a share.
Charges and a tax benefit took net income in the latest quarter to $959 million, or 83 cents a share. There were no gains or charges in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Sales fell 2.3 percent in the second quarter, to $11.14 billion from $11.4 billion.
Sales in the chemicals unit declined 6.1 percent, to $1.05 billion, reflecting a reduction in shipments and divested operations. The unit's after-tax profit rose 16 percent, to $159 million.
Earnings from business in polymers, including plastics, fell 7.7 percent, to $239 million, as sales of automotive products were in decline. Sales over all decreased 1.3 percent, to $1.77 billion.
Revenue from fibers fell 4.3 percent, to $1.87 billion, as low-priced Asian imports hurt sales of apparel made from Dacron polyester and nylon. Profit before one-time items fell 8.6 percent, to $224 million, as prices averaged 3 percent lower.
Oil prices fell 8.6 percent during the quarter, to $14.18 a barrel. Profit before one-time items at DuPont's Conoco Inc. energy unit fell 27 percent, to $180 million. Sales declined 3.1 percent, to $4.71 billion. In May, DuPont said it planned to sell Conoco, which is based in Houston, and would start by selling a 20 percent stake.

Did You Notice? There's an Automobile Strike

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
There was a time when a strike that shut down General Motors, and hurt the economy, would have been at the top of the news every day. Public pressure for a settlement would have been intense.
In those days, G.M. so dominated American auto production that Detroit feared antitrust action to break up the car maker. Then, the issues that divided the United Automobile Workers and the company were much easier to understand. The workers wanted more money, and management was reluctant to pay it. 
 The current G.M. strike -- and the relative lack of attention it has received -- is a sign of how far the mighty have fallen. There is, to be sure, talk that the virtual elimination of G.M. production in North America is shaving economic growth by half a percentage point or so. But there is no pressure from Washington to do something about the strike. G.M. is just not as important to the country as it used to be.
Viewed from a long perspective, G.M.'s labor problems are another example of its inability to get the big things right. It tried to save money by eliminating the real differences between its brands, and found that customers noticed. It plowed huge sums into factory robots that did not live up to expectations.
Auto strikes once were threatened every few years, when the national contract was expiring. At G.M., they now seem to occur with regularity because the contract allows strikes over local issues such as job safety and speedups. And G.M., by adopting just-in-time inventory procedures, has assured that a strike at one plant can quickly affect most of the company. G.M. loses hundreds of millions, while the union strike fund barely notices the impact. (Most workers get unemployment compensation because they are counted as laid-off workers, not as strikers.)
Strikes over local issues are also permitted at Ford and Chrysler. But they don't happen. One reason may be that those companies took the painful steps to become competitive in the early 1980's, when times were tough. G.M. dithered. Another is that G.M. keeps losing market share, making more cuts necessary.
That slowness to move reflected the attitude of both management and workers that G.M. would always be a powerhouse. The company guaranteed job security for current workers regardless of how well G.M. did. That gave rise to a sense of entitlement among workers, as well as an almost reflexive hostility to any effort to change work rules or increase productivity. G.M. has the least efficient system of the American auto makers, and the worst labor relations.
Until recently, G.M. has talked tough but backed down in the face of potentially crippling local strikes. But now it vows not to give in, and to force workers to improve productivity. The workers think G.M. cannot be trusted, and fear that there will be no jobs for a new generation of American auto workers.
There was a time when G.M. could prosper even if managers and workers hated each other. But that was when competition was far less intense. Now the industry faces worldwide overcapacity. Plants with relatively high wages are unlikely to be competitive without a spirit of cooperation and teamwork.
Unfortunately, there are few signs that such a result is likely when this strike ends. Unable to cut a deal with the union, G.M. is trying to persuade a mediator that the strike is in violation of the national union contract because it is not about safety issues, as would be permitted, but instead about investment and the moving of jobs overseas. If it wins that argument and the workers come back against their will, G.M. will be able to make cars again, but it will be unlikely to make much progress in getting ready for the coming industry shake-out.

HEADLINE: United and U S Airways See Surprisingly Strong Profits

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
United Airlines and U S Airways Group Inc. reported surprisingly strong earnings for the second quarter yesterday, while the struggling Trans World Airlines Inc. posted a profit but failed to meet forecasts on Wall Street.
The UAL Corporation, the parent of United, the nation's largest airline, said net earnings rose 16.5 percent in the quarter. U S Airways, the No. 6 carrier, said net profits fell 5.5 percent, but the results still beat analysts' estimates. 
 Low fuel prices and solid domestic travel helped the carriers post another quarter of improved earnings. But T.W.A., troubled by high costs and an old fleet of planes, continued to lag behind its competitors.
The Chicago-based UAL said it had net profits of $282 million in the quarter, up from $242 million a year earlier, aided by a 12 percent drop in fuel costs. Earnings per diluted share were $2.44, up from $2.31.
Fully distributed earnings, which factor in UAL's employee stock ownership plan, were $418 million, up 11 percent from a year earlier. Fully distributed earnings per share of $3.24, up 15 percent from a year earlier, beat Wall Street's average estimate of $3.20, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks analysts' forecasts.
Sales rose to $4.44 billion from $4.38 billion.
The company said continuing cost-control efforts, as well as lower fuel costs and changes in its business, helped increase results.
"Despite the continued turbulence in Asia, we produced record net earnings once again, which tells us that our efforts to redefine the way we do business are working," the chairman, Gerald Greenwald, said in a statement.
United, one of the nation's two carriers with many flights to Asia, has been reallocating planes to more profitable routes. The strong domestic economy and traffic to Europe have helped United overcome problems from Asia's economic turmoil.
Shares of UAL ended at $83.18, down 75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange..
U S Airways, based in Arlington, Va., said operating profits rose to $374 million as fuel expense fell 20 percent. But net income fell to $194.3 million from $205.6 million a year ago as its corporate tax rate rose. The carrier's tax rate rose to 40.3 percent from 11.4 percent last year as the airline stopped accruing tax credits for operating losses in earlier years.
Earnings per diluted share rose to $1.95, from $1.92, beating Wall Street forecasts of $1.86, according to First Call.
Shares of U S Airways rose 87.5 cents, to $75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
T.W.A., based in St. Louis, had net earnings of $19.5 million, compared with a loss a year earlier of $14.4 million. Earnings per diluted share were 21 cents, compared with a loss of 36 cents. Earnings per share excluding costs from early retirement of debt were 28 cents. Industry analysts had forecast a profit of 34 cents a share for the latest quarter.
Shares of T.W.A. fell 31.25 cents, to $9.5625, on the American Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: June Maintains Pace for a Budget Surplus

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The United States posted a budget surplus in June of $51.106 billion as tax collections surged and a restrained pace of Federal spending kept the Government on target for its first annual surplus since 1969.
The surplus last month was lower than the the $54.635 billion surplus in June 1997, according to the Treasury's monthly budget statement. Still, for the first nine months of the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, the budget surplus totaled $67.067 billion. The Treasury was running a deficit of $11.083 billion for the corresponding period a year earlier. 
 The buoyant economy and stock market are generating strong capital gains tax revenue, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified to Congress today. Low unemployment has also helped cut spending, reducing the need for Treasury borrowing in financial markets by $22.4 billion this year.
Revenue, fees and other Government income rose to $187.86 billion in June, up 8.4 percent from the corresponding month a year earlier. Spending increased 15.2 percent, to $136.754 billion in June. But the percentage increase is somewhat misleading because a year ago some of the spending that normally falls in June was made in May when the start of June fell on a weekend.
The Treasury typically posts deficits in July and August, when few quarterly tax payments are made, and surpluses in June and September. The full year's budget surplus has been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $63 billion.

HEADLINE: House Panel Withdraws Bill for Billions to Help Finance I.M.F.

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
With Republicans in disarray, a House panel today yanked from its agenda a foreign spending bill that would have provided money for the International Monetary Fund.
The move, by the Appropriations Committee, could delay until the end of September the replenishing of the fund's reserves, which financial crises in Asia and Russia have depleted. 
 Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told reporters today that an infusion of American money to the fund was imperative and that in the end he expected that the House would approve it. "There are sufficient votes," he said.
But until then, the Clinton Administration said, the House was putting American farmers and other workers in danger because worldwide demand for their exports was falling.
"We see new evidence every week that the crisis in Asia poses a threat to the American economy," said a spokesman for Mr. Rubin, Howard M. Schloss.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, told Congress that a delay could be risky, especially if Congress were out of town. "If a crisis were to arise it would be very difficult to address expeditiously," Mr. Greenspan said.
Congress is planning a monthlong recess beginning on Aug. 7 and plans to adjourn in early October so that lawmakers can campaign full time.
The Senate has already approved the Administration's request for $18 billion for the fund. The House appeared last week to have been set on the same course, especially after Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas who is the majority leader and a strong foe of the I.M.F., conceded that supporters probably had the votes.
But his apparent acquiescence riled House conservatives, and on Monday, Mr. Armey reversed himself, vowing a floor fight to block the $18 billion.
His reversal is a symptom of the struggle for leadership of the House between Mr. Armey and Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Both men want to be Speaker in the event that Newt Gingrich vacates the job to run for President.
Mr. Armey and Mr. Livingston are locked in a fierce ideological battle behind the scenes for the support of individual House Republicans. Both are raising money from members and funneling it to the election campaigns of others. And both are trying to be responsive to the political needs of each member.
Mr. Armey's strength lies in his kinship with the most conservative members, those who coincidentally most strongly oppose United States involvement in the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Livingston, who supports giving money to the fund, has been building alliances with businesses, many of which are nervous that the Asian economic turmoil could soon reach home.
Mr. Livingston's committee had been set today to approve the entire $12.6 billion foreign-spending bill for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee had approved $3.4 billion for the fund, with the expectation that the full $18 billion would be added when the bill reached the House floor.
But in light of Mr. Armey's change of heart, Mr. Livingston and Mr. Gingrich agreed late Tuesday to drop the entire foreign operations bill for now, and the Appropriations Committee did not bring it up. The bill would have also covered other items like the Agency for International Development, the Export-Import Bank, military assistance and repaying international bank debts.

HEADLINE: McCall and State Dept. Clash on Sanctions Against Swiss Over Gold

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The State Department and the New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, clashed openly today at a Senate hearing over whether New York's threatened sanctions against Switzerland were the right way to press for reparations to Holocaust victims.
Speaking out in the festering dispute, Mr. McCall argued that New York had been forced to take foreign policy into its own hands after a comprehensive deal to settle a large class-action lawsuit against Swiss banks fell apart last month. 
 The State Department has consistently opposed sanctions by New York and other states, saying they were complicating its efforts to handle the issue through diplomatic channels.
Mr. McCall accused the State Department of following the same path of conciliation it took a decade ago when it opposed efforts by individual states to sanction companies doing business in South Africa.
"I have seen Nelson Mandela sitting in the presidential office, and I have heard him say that without sanctions -- without visible and painful economic pressure from the United States -- he would not be in that seat," Mr. McCall told the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing called by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, to turn up the heat on Switzerland.
"I ask the United States Government to support our efforts to obtain restitution for the innocent victims of one of the greatest horrors the world has ever seen."
The Swiss have been outraged by threats from New York, California and other states to impose sanctions, and Switzerland's President, Flavio Cotti, wrote to President Clinton this week asking him to block the state actions. The Administration has repeatedly urged New York and other states not to impose sanctions and today again called for a "cooling-off period." The sanctions, under which New York City and New York State would slowly to cut off business ties with Swiss institutions, are scheduled to begin on Sept. 1.
The sanctions threatened by New York State and New York City have been carefully synchronized, and unfold gradually to put more pressure on Swiss banks -- and the Swiss Government -- to reach a so-called global settlement with Holocaust survivors and their heirs. The settlement that was under discussion until talks broke down last month also included a "rough justice" fund for Holocaust survivors who are now destitute or who lost their assets at the hands of the Nazis but have little evidence in hand today.
Steve I. Newman, the city's First Deputy Comptroller, said today that if a settlement was not reached by Sept. 1, his office would bar putting city funds into overnight investments with Swiss banks and would bar Swiss investment companies from underwriting some of the city's debt transactions. On Nov. 15, the office will recommend, he said, that New York City pension funds exclude Swiss investment managers and end trading through Swiss brokerages.
If there is no agreement by July 1, 1999, he said, the office will ask the city's pension systems, which keep $84 billion invested around the world, to sell off holdings of Swiss stock. They now hold $735 million in the stock of Swiss companies, including $136 million in Swiss banks.
"This program of actions is a last resort forced upon us by the continuing failure of the Swiss Government to participate in the negotiations," Mr. Newman said. "We recognize that sanctions are a drastic measure," he pointed out, but he added that the talks had already gone on for two years.
The argument arose during hearings that were called to debate, for the first time, one of most potentially powerful actions the United States could take against Switzerland: Reopening a long-ignored 1946 agreement, called the Washington Accord, in which the Swiss grudgingly agreed to turn over much of the Nazi gold and other German assets it amassed in its vaults.
Switzerland never complied with the agreement, and a series of recent historical studies have proved that the Swiss Government deliberately deceived negotiators for the Allies about how much war booty they possessed after Germany's surrender.
For example, the Swiss returned only $58 million in gold after signing the 1946 accord -- leaving amounts estimated at more than $400 million in Swiss hands. Most of that gold was looted from central banks around Europe and sold to the Swiss National Bank by Germany in return for Swiss francs that were used to buy war materiel. At today's prices, the Nazi gold left in Swiss vaults would be worth more than $3.5 billion.
The issue has come to the fore again because a Swiss historical commission, appointed by the Government, concluded in May that leaders of Switzerland's central bank knew in 1941 that most of the gold they were buying had been looted by Nazis. But the central bank has refused to enter negotiations over return the stolen gold. Instead, the negotiations have involved only Switzerland's private banks.
It was the central bank, however, that purchased 87 percent of the looted gold that Germany sold to Switzerland.
But even discussion about enforcing the 1946 accord is so politically charged that the Swiss Government refused to send officials to testify at today's hearing.
The State Department opposes restarting the negotiations for the same reason it opposes sanctions. Stuart E. Eizenstat, Under Secretary of State for economic affairs, warned Mr. D'Amato's committee today that reopening the 1946 agreement "would harden positions further, probably irrevocably in the current climate," in Switzerland.
The threat of sanctions, he said, had already engendered anti-Americanism in Switzerland, leading one major retailer there, Denner, to ban four American products: sweet corn, California wine and two brands of whisky, Jack Daniels and Four Roses.
"The Swiss people believe that no matter what they do they get no credit," Mr. Eizenstat argued. "No sovereign country reacts well when there is a gun pointed at its head; we wouldn't either."
Mr. Eizenstat said that it was unlikely that the Swiss Government would agree to a "global settlement" of Nazi-era claims any time soon, however, and that undercut his call for a cooling-off period. "The historical pattern of denial and deception by the Swiss continues," Mr. D'Amato insisted. "It is time for the Swiss to stop talking and to face the reality of the historical record that even their own commission has established."
While the Swiss Government and Swiss banks refused to appear at Mr. D'Amato's hearing, a statement issued by the Swiss Embassy here says that renegotiating the 1946 accord "is out of the question."
And although the Swiss Government did not appear, a member of the Swiss Federal Parliament, Jean Ziegler, used the hearing to take on his own Government. "Switzerland received much more German assets, especially stolen gold, than it admitted," the Swiss lawmaker said. "The Swiss National Bank and the private banks should restitute without delay and in the quickest possible manner, the reparation sums which are still due."

HEADLINE: Heat Spurs Record-Setting Use of Power

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: EAST MEADOW, N.Y., July 22

 BODY:
On the hottest day the region has seen so far, electricity consumption set new records on Long Island and throughout New England and near records elsewhere in the New York region.
The temperature hit a high of 96 degrees at Islip between 2 P.M. and 3 P.M., according to the National Weather Service. Right after that, Long Islanders were demanding more electricity than they ever had before -- 4,209 megawatts between 4 and 5 P.M., according to Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority. This broke the previous record demand of 4,140 megawatts on June 26, when the temperature hit 93 degrees. 
 Utility officials on Long Island recognized that this was possibly a problem of their own making. They cautioned electricity customers in Nassau and Suffolk County, whose rates were recently cut 20 percent, against being energy spendthrifts.
"Don't use the rate reduction as an excuse to use more energy than necessary," Mr. Kessel cautioned LIPA's 1.3 million customers. "It will only put a strain on your own bill and a strain on the system."
The system is not close to failing. Mr. Kessel noted that there was a total capacity of 4,923 megawatts, including an 18 percent reserve margin. But he expressed concern that there could be a giddy rush to power gluttony by customers who, until two months ago, were paying the highest utility rates in the continental United States. Their rate cut was made possible in the partial state takeover of the former Long Island Lighting Company.
Although Mr. Kessel said there was no way to measure how much of the rate cut customers were spending on additional power, he did say: "It's a known fact in the utility industry that when rates go down, consumption goes up. Ironically we've always factored in the impact of higher rates. This is the first time in Long Island's history that we are dealing with the reverse situation."
The temperature hit 93 degrees in Central Park at 2:30 P.M., according to the National Weather Service. With that high came another conservation request. A Con Edison spokesman, Richard Mulieri, said that the utility was also cautioning its three million customers in New York City and Westchester to conserve energy while they battle the heat.
"When your air-conditioner is cranking away, it has a tendency to punch up your electric bill a tad higher than normal," Mr. Mulieri said.
"There are a number of really simple things you can do to help, like cleaning the air-conditioner's filter and closing your drapes or blinds to keep out the heat and sun," he said.
Con Edison's consumption hit a record 11,013 megawatts on July 15, 1997, and peaked today at 10,919 at 4 P.M., making it the second highest in the utility's history, Mr. Mulieri said. He defined a megawatt as enough power to light 10,000 100-watt light bulbs.
In the six New England states, the Independent Services Operations-New England power grid reported a record demand for today, more than 21,300 megawatts, said Bruno Ranniello, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, a member of the grid.
But he said Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut, fell short of breaking its old record of 5,800 megawatts, set on July 15, 1997. He said today's consumption topped out near 5,000 megawatts in the midafternoon. He said the utility's reserves had been bolstered by the 1,150 megawatts from its Millstone nuclear power plant, which had its Unit 3 returned to 100 percent capacity operation earlier this month.
Mr. Ranniello said the increase in demand in New England was due not only to the hot weather, but the overall improvement in the region's economy, leading to the construction of new factories and homes. "They all need power," he said.
New England's electric utilities declared a power conservation day today and asked residents to cut down on their use of electrical appliances between noon and 8 P.M., The Associated Press reported. This was not to save electricity, but to cut down on air pollution by reducing the need to turn up old power plants that burn fossil fuels, said Deborah L. Beauchamp, a spokeswoman for Connecticut Light and Power.
Bridgeport, Conn., reached a high of 93 degrees today. Fran Mayko, a spokeswoman for the United Illuminating Company, which serves 17 towns in southwestern Connecticut, including Bridgeport, said consumption peaked at 1,136 megawatts at 4 P.M. This came close to the utility's record of 1,183 megawatts set on July 15, 1997.
In New Jersey, Public Service Electric and Gas had no problems meeting today's demand for more than 9,000 megawatts between 4 and 5 P.M., said Paul Rosengren, a spokesman. But it was below the record 9,548 megawatts on July 15, 1997. "That's the day to beat," he said.
Despite the heat, Mr. Ranniello of Northeast Utilities found the energy to educate a utility novice in Powerspeak.
When asked if the utility had to initiate any brownouts to save power, he said, "The utility industry does not call it 'brownouts' anymore."
"We now do 'reductions' of about 5 percent, if necessary, but it's a step that is imperceptible to the public," he said.

HEADLINE: Supership Carries a Big Message;
To Secure Trade, Ports Need Deeper and Safer Channels

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: ABOARD THE REGINA MAERSK, July 22

 BODY:
After more than a century as the dominant seaport on the East Coast, New York Harbor has seen a lot of ships come and go -- but never anything quite like this one, the vanguard of a new fleet of cargo "superships," with a hull as long as the Chrysler Building is tall.
In the first visit to the United States by a cargo ship this big, with its horns blasting louder than a jet's roar, the Regina Maersk made a celebratory pause today in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, as fountains of water sprayed from a fireboat, and a fleet of tugs, pleasure craft, police boats and helicopters flitted about. 
 The arrival was carefully choreographed, because the purpose of the visit by the giant Danish vessel was only partly to unload 492 truck-size containers of toys, Christmas decorations, furniture and clothing at Port Newark, N.J.
According to its owner, Maersk Inc., it was also here to send a strong message to New York and New Jersey, which share the $20 billion-a-year bounty from harbor commerce, and to harbor officials and politicians at several other ports along the Eastern seaboard.
The message delivered by the ship, which had to lower its radio mast to slip under the 151-foot-high arc of the Bayonne Bridge connecting New Jersey with Staten Island, was that the vessels that will ply major global trade routes from now on are going to be very, very big, and that any port that wants to dominate maritime commerce in the 21st century has to be sure its channels are deep enough and docks modern enough to accommodate them.
The Regina Maersk, 1,043 feet long, is the first of a new generation of enormous cargo vessels that marine analysts say should soon transform marine trade into something resembling the modern airport system, with hubs served by the largest ships and spokes reached by smaller craft.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bistate agency that manages harbor trade, is engaged in an intense competition with about half a dozen other harbors to become the hub for the East Coast.
For New York Harbor, in particular, which has notoriously narrow, shallow channels leading to its main cargo docks in Port Newark and Port Elizabeth, N.J., the arrival of the ship today intensified the pressure on officials to obtain adequate Federal money to deepen major channels.
The toughest task is to blast the shelf of bedrock underlying the Kill van Kull, the narrowest, shallowest bottleneck in the harbor -- which also happens to be the gateway to the New Jersey piers. Even after nearly a decade of dredging and blasting, the channel is still only 40 feet deep on an average low tide.
When fully loaded, the Regina Maersk and a growing fleet of similarly sized vessels ride more than 47 feet deep in the water. Even on a high tide, negotiating the tight turns into Newark Bay on a ship that deep and long could be a navigator's nightmare.
Today, to make sure there would be no mistakes, the ship had two seasoned New York Harbor pilots quietly instructing the Danish helmsman on every tweak of the wheel.
A digital meter indicating how much water lay beneath the keel displayed a string of nerve-racking numbers, showing the gap between the ship and harbor bottom often at less than 10 feet.
The Regina Maersk was launched two years ago by Maersk Line, the largest container shipping company in the world, as the first in a fleet of more than a dozen ships, some even a bit larger, that are designed to haul enormous loads of consumer goods from Asia to Europe and North America.
The previous generation of large container ships could carry about 4,000 truck-size containers in their holds and lashed on deck. The Regina Maersk carries 6,000 of the aluminum boxes, which have become the standard means of shipping almost all manufactured goods around the world.
Port Authority officials and representatives of harbor businesses and unions stared up at the slab-sided blue craft from two charter boats that circled like herding dogs around a stray bull, and many said the message sent by Maersk was received loud and clear.
"The future is here today," Lillian C. Borrone, the director of port operations for the Port Authority, said in a telephone interview.
She said the Port Authority was prepared to spend its 35 percent share of the $623 million cost of deepening the harbor channels and to press Congress and the Clinton Administration to provide the rest.
So far, $35 million has been authorized by Congress to spend in the 1999 fiscal year on deepening the major channels in the harbor, said Peter Shugert, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal agency responsible for keeping major navigation channels clear.
But the pace of the project has frustrated shippers. Last May, Maersk and another large shipping line, Sea-Land Service, announced that they might move their main cargo-handling operations from New York Harbor to another East Coast port because of high rent and long delays in dredging shipping channels.
The two shipping companies handled about a fourth of the 1.4 million containers of cargo that flowed through New York Harbor last year.
Ms. Borrone said that if the port lost the two companies, other shipping companies could decide to shift as well, resulting in a drop in container traffic of as much as 30 percent.
The ship is also scheduled to visit several competing ports -- Halifax, Nova Scotia; Norfolk, Va., and Charleston, S.C. -- essentially representing a gauntlet thrown down by Maersk, challenging each port to see which handles the ship best.
The new fleet of giant ships like the Regina Maersk had not been expected to be needed for trade in North America until after 2000, but the economic crisis in Asia has produced a surplus of thousands of empty containers here, which normally would have flowed steadily back to Asia filled with raw materials to turn into finished products.
The Regina Maersk, after unloading goods here, will take on some export cargo, but will also haul stacks of the empty containers back to the Far East.
After the flurry of formalities near lower Manhattan, the ship returned to business, heading for the Kill van Kull and the wharfs beyond. On the bridge, 14 stories above the water, two Danish captains watched banks of instruments and surveyed the scene ahead with the sagging piers of Bayonne, N.J., and Staten Island closing in on both sides, making the sprawling harbor look cramped.
Capt. Henrik Solmer, who has taken dozens of ships into New York Harbor but was not on duty today, said that most American harbors -- unlike those in Asia and Europe -- are difficult to navigate. "The only place we don't see any problem is Long Beach, Calif., and Tacoma, Wash.," he said.
The New York Harbor pilots, who flanked the helmsman and captain, said that despite the ship's bulk, they had a relatively easy task today. The view ahead was unobstructed because the stacks of containers on the foredeck were low; the ship had only a fifth of a full load.
And with the light load, it rode only 36 feet down in the water, providing ample breathing room in the shoal passage.
The meter reading the distance from hull to bottom registered an unremarkable 4 meters, then 4.5, then 4.7.
Nonetheless, many of the Danish officers and Robert Moore, the New York pilot for the final leg inside the Kill van Kull, were now intently focused on every tiny vibration of the ship.
Many of the officers and Captain Moore were now smoking steady streams of cigarettes, and ashtrays quickly filled.
Nowhere were the quarters tighter than directly beneath the Bayonne Bridge. As the ship moved at a fast walking pace beneath the span, which was crowded with evening-rush traffic, several officers scurried to the open deck above to see just how close a fit it would be.
The smoke from the funnel blossomed around the busy roadway, a mere five feet above the tallest part of the ship. "I could have reached up and touched it," an officer said.

HEADLINE: Cold Pizza Hits the Spot in Japanese Politics

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 22

 BODY:
Cold pizza has become a hot topic in the race that will decide who becomes the next Prime Minister of Japan.
It started when John F. Neuffer, a political analyst often quoted by the foreign news media here, described the front-runner, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, as having "all the pizazz of a cold pizza." Since then pizza jokes have abounded and pizza has had top billing in the Japanese press. 
 The Foreign Ministry, however, fails to see the humor.
"Unfortunately, Mr. Neuffer's 'cold pizza' is now too famous," said Mikie Kiyoi, director of the ministry's international press division. "Of course, anyone can say what they want, but to have one country's prime ministerial candidate described as such is, well, sad."
The ministry is also questioning Mr. Neuffer's credentials and, by extension, the foreign news media's coverage of the selection of a new Prime Minister to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned after his ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a decisive setback in Upper House elections on July 12.
"Those analysts on Japanese politics quoted in your paper or other foreign papers are quite unfamiliar to us Japanese," Ms. Kiyoi wrote in an E-mail message to this correspondent and to Nicholas D. Kristof, Tokyo bureau chief of The New York Times. It was his July 13 report on the Japanese political situation that featured Mr. Neuffer's cold pizza comment and set off the commotion. "Are they only known within the gaijin ghetto?" she asked, using the Japanese word for foreigners. "Or am I simply ignorant?"
Mr. Neuffer, for his part, cannot believe the furor his cold pizza remark has unleashed. "It was a glib comment," he said today, noting that he coined the phrase in an April newsletter that went on to praise Mr. Obuchi's homespun appeal.
The tempest in the tomato sauce reflects a heightened sensitivity to outside scrutiny that is pervasive here. Japan is still smarting over the snub it received when President Clinton failed to stop here on his recent trip to China, and the persistent malaise in its once mighty economy and banking system is chipping away at its self-confidence.
"Recently, especially the Gaimusho is being unusually sensitive about how Japanese politics are portrayed in the Western press," said Robert Neff, the president of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, using the Japanese word for Foreign Ministry.
Mr. Neuffer is not exactly an unknown quantity to the Japanese Government, which employed him at its consular offices in New York from 1987 to 1990. "My title was special assistant to the Consul General, and my role was primarily speech writing," he said.
After that Mr. Neuffer moved to Tokyo, joined the Mitsui Marine Research Institute and in 1994 began writing a newsletter on Japanese politics called Behind the Screen.
He is not the most irreverent observer of Japanese politics. Makiko Tanaka, a young Liberal Democratic Party member whose father, Kakue Tanaka, is perhaps Japan's most revered postwar Prime Minister, recently described the current political race as "a garage sale."
But it seems to be Mr. Neuffer's cold pizza comment that sticks in the craw of the Foreign Ministry. "I'm afraid that Mr. Neuffer might be quite proud of his impact," said Ms. Kiyoi, noting that the comment has now been recycled in the German magazine Der Spiegel and many Japanese publications.
She is also taking foreign journalists to task for relying too often on the same commentators to explain Japanese politics. "Also, virtually all foreign correspondents interview only a limited number of analysts," she wrote in her message. "In that sense, there is no new face in analysts on Japanese politics just as in Japanese politicians. Are they making a sort of inner circle secretive to us Japanese? Seriously, Mr. John Neuffer? Who?"
Mr. Neuffer regards that as unfair criticism. "The stories I read from foreign correspondents quote from a wide range of commentators," he said. "You could make a good argument that Western correspondents tap into a broader range of commentary and write a broader range of analysis than the Japanese media does."
For his part, Mr. Obuchi has handled the pizza matter in a more gentlemanly manner than his ministry.
Reporters outside his home in Tokyo on Sunday were surprised when the door opened and one of Mr. Obuchi's assistants emerged juggling a stack of pizza boxes, which he then distributed to the press corps.
"Please, eat them while they're warm," he urged.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the foreign news media's coverage of the race for Prime Minister of Japan misattributed a response to a Foreign Ministry official's statement about foreign journalists' relying too often on the same commentators to explain Japanese politics. It was Robert Neff, the president of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, not John F. Neuffer, a political analyst, who said he regarded the comment as unfair criticism.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
At Computer Associates, Stock Option Plan Comes Home to Roost

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
An avalanche of selling hit the stock of Computer Associates International Inc. yesterday, after the company announced late Tuesday that unexpected tremors from the Asian economic crisis had reduced its sales expectations.
On extremely heavy volume of more than 25 million shares, the company's stock lost more than 30 percent of its market value, closing at $39.50, down $17.50. That represented a loss of $9.56 billion for investors in the company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y. 
 Computer Associates derives only about 5 percent of its revenues from customers in Asia, so news of Asia-related sales weak ness clearly caught Wall Street by surprise. But the reaction may have been exacerbated because the bad news came just two months after Charles B. Wang, the chairman and chief executive, and two other top executives received a remarkable $1.1 billion stock grant that wound up costing the company about $675 million.
"It left a bitter taste in the mouth," James C. Mendelson, managing director of Soundview Financial Group, in Stamford, Conn., said. "Clearly, some portion of the selloff is an emotional reaction."
The company included the warning about its sales prospects for the next six months in an announcement of its financial results for three months ended June 30. The report was released after the market closed on Tuesday, after which senior executives participated in a conference call with analysts. During that call, the executives explained that many of their big multinational customers seemed to be expecting slower growth in their own businesses primarily because of the problems in Asia. Those customers, who also have to deal with the Year 2000 adjustments, seemed to be holding back on major software purchases, the executives said. The analysts swiftly scaled back their expectations for Computer Associates' full-year earnings by about 7 percent.
That bad news swamped the good news that the company's basic income had been slightly above expectations in the most recent quarter. With analysts expecting earnings of 33 cents a share, the company reported operating profits of 34 cents a share, or $194.2 million, up almost 25 percent from the $155.8 million the company earned in the comparable period last year.
However, those respectable quarterly results were buried by the effects of the $675 million write-off necessary to finance the stock grants to Mr. Wang and to Sanjay Kumar, the president, and Russell M. Artzt, the executive vice president. Because of the write-off, the company reported a loss of $480.8 million, or 87 cents a share, for the quarter.
The compensation plan, approved by shareholders in 1995, entitled the three executives to collect substantial grants of stock as soon as the company's shares had traded above a set price, $53.33 a share, for 60 trading days -- a milestone that was reached on May 21.
As a result, Mr. Wang was awarded 12.15 million shares, which at the time were worth $669.8 million; Mr. Kumar received 6.075 million shares, which were worth $334.9 million, and Mr. Artzt received 2.025 million shares, which were worth $111.6 million. The total package was valued at $1.1 billion before taxes, but the executives essentially returned some shares to satisfy income tax obligations, reducing the package to $675 million.
Restrictions on selling the shares will expire gradually over the next seven years, so the three executives actually suffered as much or more damage yesterday as their fellow shareholders. Mr. Wang, for example, saw the value of his recent stock grant fall by more than $200 million yesterday.
Graef Crystal, an executive compensation specialist and editor of The Crystal Report, had been extremely critical of Mr. Wang's generous compensation packages even before the recent stock grants were awarded. Yesterday's news did nothing to soften his opinion, even though the selloff reduced the current value of the stock grants to Mr. Wang.
"He limped across the finish line, collected his huge stock award, and then suddenly they have just discovered this Asia problem," Mr. Crystal said. "I think we will see lots of lawsuits. This will be like dropping 3,000 pounds of chum into a shark tank."
But even Mr. Crystal said he was surprised at how deeply the stock declined yesterday, and wondered aloud whether Wall Street analysts had simply forgotten about the potential impact of the stock awards on the company's earnings.
Joseph Farley, a stock analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, dismissed that speculation. "The compensation plan was well known," Mr. Farley said. "There was no surprise today from people just finding out about the earnings impact."
There may have been some lingering resentment, Mr. Mendelson said. "There is some bitterness being expressed," he said. But Mr. Mendelson defended the company's decision to share its worries about the future with its stockholders.
"I think it reflects their desire to be as straight with the investment community as they can be," he said. With the company's annual stockholders meeting scheduled for Aug. 12, he added: "It must have been a temptation to say, 'If we postpone the report a few weeks, we won't have to face our shareholders until next year.' But they did not say that."
Mr. Farley remains wary, however. "Is the selloff overdone? I think we've all got about 5 percent of the information we need to answer that question," he said. "We have a company that has had a long period of very strong revenue momentum and predictability of earnings, and suddenly you are facing some vague, uncertain developments and we don't really know what happened."
The Computer Associates announcement came in tandem with a similar warning from the Hewlett-Packard Company, reinforcing in several analysts' minds the need to look more closely at how vulnerable technology companies are to such secondary effects of the Asian crisis.
Mr. Crystal pointed out that Institutional Shareholder Services, a company in Bethesda, Md., that advises investors on how to vote on proxy issues, had recommended against approval of the stock-grant plan when it was proposed in 1995. "But it was approved by investors anyway," he said. "So I guess you could say, stockholders got their comeuppance today."

Boeing Earnings News Disappoints Investors

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company stunned investors yesterday with news of a steep drop in second-quarter earnings and an even more unexpected warning that results for both this year and next will be about 40 percent below Wall Street estimates.
The announcement from the world's largest aerospace company caused a 13 percent drop in Boeing's share price and was one of the catalysts for a nearly 200-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing shares, one of the Dow average's component stocks, had been rallying in recent weeks. 
 "They know how to build bombs," said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, "and they delivered one today."
Boeing's results and the guidance it offered for next year helped convince investors that the company is not likely to cash in on the current boom in commercial aircraft sales because of its high costs and stiff price competition from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that is Boeing's main rival.
For the quarter that ended June 30, earnings fell 46 percent, to $258 million, or 26 cents a diluted share, compared with $476 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, in the comparable period last year. The average forecast for the quarter by analysts was 33 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks corporate earnings estimates.
Boeing's revenue rose 9 percent, to $13.4 billion, from $12.3 billion in 1997. The company said it took a $78 million after-tax charge during the quarter to account for costs related to its previously announced decision to stop making the MD-11 jetliner and for penalties paid to airlines because of late deliveries of the new version of its single-aisle 737 jet.
Investors reacted by dumping Boeing shares, which fell $6.5625, to $41.1875, in New York Stock Exchange trading on volume that exceeded 28 million shares. During the day the share price touched $40.0625, a 52-week low.
Boeing has been struggling to right itself since last fall, when a surge in commercial airplane orders overwhelmed its assembly lines. The production difficulties have forced the company to take more than $3 billion in charges and delayed long-planned productivity improvements aimed at cutting costs.
In addition, the costs of merging with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which it purchased for $16.3 billion last year, have proved to be more than expected and the economic crisis in Asia has dampened the demand for new airplanes from some of Boeing's best customers.
As a result of these trials, Boeing's commercial airplane division, which represents about 60 percent of overall revenue, lost money in the first half of this year. The company predicted that the division's profit margins would be between zero and 1 percent this year, rising to between 2 and 4 percent in 1999 -- far lower than many analysts had expected.
Philip M. Condit, chairman and chief executive of the Seattle-based company, acknowledged that the company's performance had been weak. But he said that he was determined to transform Boeing from a company that focuses primarily on the performance of its products to one that is "financially driven."
He outlined a series of ambitious goals, including raising Boeing's annual return on sales to 7 percent from its current level of 2 percent. The company also aims to save money by turning over its inventory four times a year rather than just two.
Given Boeing's recent performance, even the company's short-term goals would appear beyond its grasp. Boeing plans to produce 620 planes next year, up from 546 in 1998. At the same time, it expects to reduce overall employment by the end of next year to between 210,000 and 220,000 from 238,000 today.
Mr. Condit acknowledged that consistently earning a 7 percent return on sales would not be easy, though he said it could be achieved by 2000. "This is clearly a difficult goal," he told analysts. "This is not one we have reached before. We have only come close at the peak."
Indeed, there are already warning signs that assurances from Mr. Condit earlier this month that Boeing's production difficulties were finally under control may have been premature. Yesterday Boeing said that expensive out-of-sequence work on its 747 production line had risen nearly 20 percent since July 1 and was above the company's plan.
"It's worrying, but it is not disastrous," said Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's president.
The situation in Asia also seems to be worsening. Boeing said it currently has 20 completed airplanes in storage waiting for final payment arrangements by Asian customers. Singapore Air said yesterday that it was deferring delivery of one 747, eight 777's and two Airbus A340's beyond 2000. Korean Air has also said that it will probably defer some 747's and 777's scheduled for delivery next year.
Nevertheless, Mr. Condit said that after seeing its cash reserves drop to $3.5 billion this quarter from $5.1 billion at the end of 1997, Boeing expects to begin generating a lot of cash next year.
Boyd Givan, the company's chief financial officer, said the money might be used for a share repurchase plan. Whether that will be enough to appease investors is unclear.
"I don't think they are particularly proud of what they handed everybody today," Mr. Rubel said. "At the same token, the hype is gone. The pieces on the board have moved back to Go. They now have to roll up their sleeves and work harder than they ever have before."

Auto Tariff Pact Eludes South Americans

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: USHUAIA, Argentina, July 23

 BODY:
In a potentially serious blow to the $15 billion auto industry in South America, Argentine and Brazilian officials have failed to complete a long-awaited agreement for common car tariffs that auto executives had hoped would be ready for signing at a regional economic summit meeting that opens here today.
Officials of the two countries said they might still be able to draw up a common auto trade policy by the end of the year, but independent analysts said presidential campaign politics in the two countries could stall progress until the end of 1999. 
 South American automobile executives expressed concern that companies including Volkswagen and Daimler-Benz might delay planned investments valued at more than $500 million until Argentina and Brazil ironed out their trade differences.
Argentina and Brazil, the two dominant countries in a four-nation South American common market called Mercosur, have come to a preliminary agreement that would set a tariff of 35 percent on cars produced outside the region. It would have gone into force in 2000. The tariff would represent a slight increase from the 33 percent tariff now levied by Argentina but a significant decrease from the 45 percent rate of Brazil, by far the largest market in South America.
The two countries would allow companies that currently have production plants in the region -- including Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen and Fiat -- to import cars from elsewhere at a rate of 17.5 percent. Brazil and Argentina have also agreed to drop all tariffs in 2000 for cars and parts produced in the Mercosur countries, which also include Uruguay and Paraguay.
But two major stumbling blocks remain before any agreement can be signed, officials said.
Argentina has called for Brazil to drop all subsidies granted to the local car industry by Brazilian state governments. Brazil has said that under its federal system, it cannot easily void agreements made by the states to attract companies to build plants in their jurisdictions.
The four Mercosur countries have also not agreed on a formula by which each country would be assured of producing components for autos assembled in the region.
Brazil, which has the most advanced car industry of the four, opposes any national content requirement as long as 60 percent of the components of cars receiving Mercosur free trade benefits are produced in any one of the four countries.
Jose Botafogo Goncalves, Brazil's Minister of Industry, told reporters this week that the four Presidents would sign a declaration at their meeting here listing general concepts they agreed on for a future auto tariff agreement. But he added that any elimination of local subsidies as demanded by Argentina would be, "juridically speaking, impossible."
Several analysts expressed skepticism that any significant progress on an auto agreement would be reached over the next two days here in Ushuaia, the world's southernmost town, in the Tierra del Fuego region.
"Mercosur is not moving as fast as it did in the early 1990's," said Ricardo Lopez Murphy, chief economist at the FIEL-Latin American Economic Research Foundation, an Argentine center. "The reform process is stagnant."
The impasse comes at a time when higher interest rates and declining economic growth have slowed what had been years of booming car production and sales in Argentina and Brazil. Manufacturers have estimated that car sales in Brazil this year will fall below 1.8 million, a 10 percent decline from 1997 levels.
The drop-off in sales has forced several temporary plant closings in Brazil, although both Ford and General Motors are building new assembly plants in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.

HEADLINE: An Expert at Trades;
N.A.S.D. Chief Makes Bold Moves as Markets Combine

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Frank G. Zarb is standing in his office, wielding his signature prop, a Louisville Slugger embossed with his name, and he's grinning one of his signature giant-killer grins.
Mr. Zarb is not a home-run hitter like Ken Griffey Jr. or Mark McGwire, but in his own way the 63-year-old chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent company of the Nasdaq stock market, has been slugging them out of the park this year and shaking up the financial markets in the process. 
 Earlier this year, Mr. Zarb reached deals to fold the American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange into the N.A.S.D. as companion exchanges to Nasdaq. And now he is thinking of going abroad, discussing an alliance with the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt.
Since arriving at the N.A.S.D. early last year as a kind of Mr. Fix-it, Mr. Zarb has been a man in perpetual motion, racing around the globe promoting a new Nasdaq, the "Next Nasdaq," as one slogan says.
The bold moves are aimed at creating what Mr. Zarb calls a "market of markets," a global financial network that will pose an even greater challenge to Nasdaq's chief rival, the richer and more prestigious New York Stock Exchange.
Bold as they are, though, the moves are just Mr. Zarb's attempt to ride a larger wave of change, one that is transforming trading worldwide. At a time when investors are increasingly turning to Internet trading and other low-fee electronic formats, pressure has been building on traditional exchanges not only to keep pace with technology but also to sharply lower costs.
"It's time to challenge the status quo," Mr. Zarb, a longtime Wall Street player, said in a recent interview in his office at the headquarters of the N.A.S.D. here. "I came to a very early conclusion that the velocity of change was going to be upon us and that we had to do something."
Looming over Mr. Zarb and his counterparts at other exchanges is the most sweeping makeover of financial markets in the last quarter- century, experts say. By the millennium, the result could be the initial stages of a global electronic marketplace. Not since "May Day" 1975, when the era of fixed commissions came to an end in the United States, has the structure of financial markets been put through such a flurry of activity.
The changes include a worldwide push toward consolidation. Overseas, the London, Frankfurt and Paris stock exchanges plan to form alliances aimed at creating a Pan-European exchange. Early in July, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange agreed to combine back-office operations.
 On Thursday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Pacific Exchange announced a merger.
"Most people don't understand that we're in the beginning of a revolutionary change in the U.S. market structure," said Douglas Atkin, who heads the international unit of Instinet, an electronic trading network owned by Reuters. "This is making the whole process from mutual fund management to settlement more efficient."
The driving forces behind all this change are technology and globalization. Computers and software are lowering costs and making trades faster and more efficient. And in a mature bull market, financial exchanges -- like the big companies they list -- are looking for global growth.
To the average American investor, the changes mean that buying shares of Coca-Cola, Microsoft or even Deutsche Telekom could be much easier and cheaper in the coming years. Global 24-hour trading is not far off, and dabbling in bonds, options and futures could come at the click of a mouse.
There are those who worry that the melding of exchanges could result in monopolistic tendencies and that regulatory and accounting issues will cloud a global financial network. Still, industry executives see the rapid pace of change lowering costs, driving a global surge in the sale of stocks and other financial products.
Mr. Zarb did not ignite the change, of course; he merely seized upon it. But perhaps more than any other market leader, he says he is willing to ride the frenzy to transform Nasdaq into a truly electronic marketplace with links to other exchanges.
Mr. Zarb is neither a commanding speaker nor a visionary, but colleagues say he has a fiery temperament and knows how to usher in change. And that is what is necessary for Nasdaq, which has been promising to revolutionize Wall Street since the early 1970's, when it arrived as an automated quotation system for the over-the-counter market. Even though it has landed high-technology giants like Intel and Microsoft, Nasdaq's image has been tarnished by a history of lax regulatory practices and a price-fixing scandal among its dealers that arose a few years ago.
One of Mr. Zarb's tasks is to change that image. Already, he says, the N.A.S.D. has tightened regulations, offered individuals better access to the market and laid the foundation for a group of financial exchanges that provide both auction trading, in which agents for buyers and sellers meet directly on crowded floors, and electronic systems that link dealers around the world. Nasdaq is even testing direct Internet trades.
The Big Board's answer? A big marketing effort to sustain its status as the premier marketplace, home to perennial all-stars like General Electric and AT&T. Its slogan is "The world puts its stock in us." And, for the most part, it does.
Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, has brought in dozens of major foreign listings in the last few years. And while the Big Board has not struck a deal with another large exchange and its leaders disagree over whether technology will lead to the demise of its trading floor, Mr. Grasso does not ignore the pressures. "This is the beauty of the American market landscape," he said. "You have alternatives, and that heightens our competitive focus."
Mr. Zarb is determined to be more than an alternative. He wants to establish Nasdaq as a superior model to the auction system. And he knows something about overcoming adversity.
He grew up in Brooklyn, the son of a refrigerator repairman, and studied nights to earn an M.B.A. at Hofstra University. Before long, he found himself at the investment firm of Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt, in the company of Sanford I. Weill, now the chief executive of Travelers Group, and Arthur Levitt Jr., now chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He left in the 1970's for a stint in the Labor Department under President Richard M. Nixon and became "energy czar" under President Gerald R. Ford after the Arab oil embargo.
But he has always come back to Wall Street, where he has made a fortune. In 1987, Mr. Weill asked Mr. Zarb to take over the "beleaguered Smith Barney," as he says it was known. He managed to raise its profile and its profitability. He also ran Alexander & Alexander Services, an insurance broker, in the 1990's. And then came the offer to head the N.A.S.D.
When Mr. Zarb arrived, Wall Street firms were pressing the exchanges to lower their costs because of the boom in Internet trading and the growth of alternative trading systems, such as the Electronic Communications Networks, an S.E.C.-approved system that matches buyers and sellers.
But the new competitive arena was international. "In Europe, there's a huge competitive race between the Big Board and the Nasdaq," said William C. Freund, an economics professor at Pace University. "Daimler-Benz, for instance, recognized you need a presence in the U.S. because if you're going to buy a company here, the currency is no longer cash, it's stock," he said. Daimler was the first German stock to list itself directly on the New York Stock Exchange.
For Nasdaq, the proposed marketing and listings alliance with the Deutsche Borse is one path to international glory. Nasdaq has also started a marketing campaign in Europe and continues to promote itself as a model for younger, growth-oriented exchanges like Easdaq, a kind of European Nasdaq, and Ausdaq in Australia.
Meanwhile, Europe is awash in speculation about other alliances. And there is talk, both in the United States and in Europe, about a global system that could offer unified trading in the world's 1,000 largest companies.
In this new world, however, competitive concerns are not limited to stock exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, faces a challenge from Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street brokerage firm that has teamed up with the New York Board of Trade to start an electronic futures exchange that promises to be cheaper. The Chicago exchange, which maintains a huge trading floor, plans to counter with its own electronic system, even though many members are reluctant to undermine their frenzied, face-to-face call-and-answer system.
"The competitive landscape is rapidly changing," Patrick Arbor, chairman of the Chicago exchange, said in a report in June. "And the rabbit that dawdles in complacency may indeed find itself losing the race to the perceived turtle."
Alfred R. Berkeley 3d, the president of Nasdaq and the man who heads Mr. Zarb's lineup against the Big Board, does not intend to dawdle. His vision is of a Nasdaq that will be linked to exchanges around the world as well as to private trading systems like Optimark, a new automated trading method that could eliminate layers of brokers and middlemen.
The Big Board, however, has not exactly embraced the electronic revolution. Technology, yes; electronic trading, no. The face-to-face auction system, Mr. Grasso says, is simply the best and most efficient model, and there are no plans to change that. "You never say never," Mr. Grasso said, "but I've yet to see a technology replicate it."
At the heart of the debate over the future of exchanges is just what they will look like. Some may resemble Nasdaq, which operates a huge computer center in Trumbull, Conn., with chilled rooms populated by mainframe computers and blinking screens but few people. For the Big Board, it will remain a cacophonous floor of traders and brokers, augmented by sophisticated technology.
William R. Harts, vice chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, says that there will always be a need for an exchange-like entity, if only to fulfill a regulatory function. "But the writing on the wall may mean an exchange is not a physical floor," he said. "All these exchanges are not merging for the fun of it -- they're merging because at some point the physical floors become less important."
Yet even as many Wall Street participants are skeptical about whether computers can replace the human touch, in Europe, Australia, Canada and even in the United States, technology appears to be winning the battle.
And Mr. Zarb is betting in that direction, even while hedging with auction trading on the American Exchange.
"Everything's going to be linked," he said. "Everything's going to be connected." And in the center of things, Mr. Zarb said with that same long-ball hitter's look in his eye, will be Nasdaq.

HEADLINE: Sales of Digital Copiers Bolster Results at Xerox

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., July 23

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation said today that earnings before a charge rose 17 percent in the second quarter as the company sold more service contracts and high-priced digital copiers while it cut costs.
The company is succeeding in convincing corporate customers to buy the more expensive digital machines instead of older and cheaper optical copiers. Xerox is also demonstrating that it can defend its profits from the Asian economic crisis, which has crimped sales at competitors including the Hewlett-Packard Company. 
 "Investors are going to start shifting out of these risky tech situations into the Xeroxes and Microsofts -- big stable companies -- and avoid these potential disasters," said Erick Lucera, an analyst at Independence Investment Associates.
Profit before a charge rose to $395 million, or $1.09 a diluted share, from $337 million, or 94 cents a share, in the second quarter a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.07 a share.
Xerox slipped $1.125, to $110.625, on the New York Stock Exchange today. The shares had risen more than 20 percent in the last five weeks in anticipation of higher profit.
Including the charge, of $1.11 billion for a restructuring that eliminated 9,000 jobs, Xerox had a net loss in the latest quarter of $712 million, or $2.19 a share.
Revenue rose 9 percent, to $4.74 billion from $4.35 billion.
Higher sales of digital copiers such as the Document Centre line, which can be connected to computer networks and used as printers, helped offset tougher business conditions in Asia and Brazil.
Without the effect of the rising dollar, revenue would have climbed 10 percent, Xerox said. A rising dollar hurts results by reducing the amount of American currency produced by sales denominated in other currencies.
Revenue from digital copiers and printers rose 39 percent and accounted for 43 percent of total sales. Sales of optical copiers fell 8 percent, also accounting for 43 percent of total sales. Sales of digital machines passed optical copiers by $35 million, marking the first time Xerox sold more digital than optical machines, the company said.
"Demand in a lot of the developed marketplaces -- Europe, the U.S. -- continues to be very robust," said Rebecca Runkle, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who has a "strong buy" rating on Xerox stock.

HEADLINE: New Spokesman Heeds Hard Lesson From 1988

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
As he recalls it a decade later, that summer of 1988 taught Joseph Lockhart a lesson he would never forget.
Mr. Lockhart, President Clinton's newly chosen press secretary, was then the deputy press secretary for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic nominee for President. Polls showed the Governor with a double-digit lead over Vice President George Bush, the presumptive Republican candidate. 
 Then came August.
Mr. Bush came to life, attacking the Democrats again and again. Mr. Dukakis remained almost eerily silent, telling those closest to him that Americans would not get interested in the campaign until Labor Day. His lead vanished.
"That was defining for a lot of people in the campaign," Mr. Lockhart said today. The lesson: "News goes on 24 hours a day. The assertion without a response quickly becomes conventional wisdom and then a fact."
It was a lesson he remembered in 1996, when he was national press secretary for President Clinton's re-election campaign and excelled in terse, sometimes snide ripostes.
When the President's Republican opponent, Bob Dole of Kansas, suggested in a speech that Mr. Clinton was naive in his dealings with the former Soviet Union, Mr. Clinton's aides countered that Mr. Dole had an outdated view of the world, one that failed to take account of Russia's declining influence. Or, as Mr. Lockhart said of Mr. Dole's address, "Right speech, wrong decade."
People familiar with Mr. Lockhart, who is 39, describe him as intense, even driven, yet patient and affable. But he clearly relishes the rough-and-tumble of politics, and those who know him expect him to take a more bare-knuckled approach to his job than his predecessor, Michael D. McCurry.
Joseph Patrick Lockhart was born July 13, 1959, in the Bronx and grew up in Suffern, N.Y. His father, Ray, a former vice president at NBC, and his mother, Ann, are deceased.
Mr. Lockhart graduated from Georgetown University, where he majored in European history. He was a regional press coordinator for President Jimmy Carter's 1980 campaign and an assistant press secretary for Walter F. Mondale's 1984 Presidential campaign.
Mr. Lockhart and his wife, Laura Logan, a former ABC producer, live in Northwest Washington and have a daughter, Clare, who is 4.
Before joining the White House in 1997 as the deputy press secretary, Mr. Lockhart worked in public relations, as a senior vice president for Robinson Lerer Sawyer Miller in New York City.
In the early 1990's, he worked for Sky Television News in London, where he reported on economics. He has also worked for the Cable News Network and for ABC. Mr. Lockhart was the producer for NBC News's Emmy Award-winning coverage of the revolution in Romania.
As for how he landed his latest job, Mr. Lockhart said today: "I often find that six months of begging is counterproductive. This time it worked."

HEADLINE: 3M Reports Decline in Its Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, July 23

 BODY:
Hurt by the strong dollar and weak Asian economies, the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said today that quarterly profit declined 7.7 percent and that it planned to cut at least 3,500 jobs.
The company, which makes consumer and industrial products, said most of the jobs, which will amount to 4.6 percent of its labor force, will be eliminated through attrition within the next two years. 
 Net income in the second quarter fell to $386 million, or 94 cents a diluted share, from $418 million, or 99 cents a share, a year ago. Still, the profit exceeded the figure of 92 cents a share that analysts had expected.
The company's stock declined $2.1875, to $78.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sales fell 1.2 percent, to $3.77 billion, from $3.82 billion.
The Asian economic turmoil caused the 3M Company to fall below its earnings targets in the region. Foreign-currency translation cut its profit about 12 percent, making the period the 11th consecutive quarter in which currencies hurt earnings. The strong dollar cut sales about 5 percent.
There is "clearly a lot of frustration with 3M stock performance and earnings relative to expectations," Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc., told executives of the 3M Company during a conference call today.

HEADLINE: Washington Casts Wary Eye at Missile Test

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
Iran's test of a medium-range missile on Wednesday apparently blew up in the later stages of the flight, American officials said today. But they said they did not know whether it had blown up on its own or whether the Iranians had detonated it on purpose before impact.
The missile traveled far enough and well enough, however, to sharpen concern in Washington, Israel and the Persian Gulf countries about Iran's growing capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction in an arc that encompasses Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and parts of Egypt and Russia. 
 President Clinton said the missile, if it becomes operational, could change the "stability dynamics" of the Middle East.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said, "The test is significant, because it shows that Iran's aggressive effort to develop missiles more capable than its existing shorter-range Scud missiles is making progress."
"It is a source of concern to us that they are pursuing a program of this nature," the Presidential spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said.
American officials also expressed concern about the technical help Iran has been receiving from Russian companies to improve the performance of the missile, which is largely based on the North Korean Rodong. Last week the United States placed trade restrictions on nine Russian companies for their secret help to the Iranian missile program, including help with guidance technology and materials.
But the American officials also said Iran had not chosen to buy and deploy a fleet of Rodongs, which it could do, much as Pakistan did "when it bought a Rodong, painted it green, called it the Ghauri and tested it," a senior American official said. Instead, Iran is trying to develop its own technology based on the Rodong, they said.
The officials saw the Iranian test of the Shahab-3, with an 800-mile range, as a political demonstration of prowess and strategic reach, noting that the shorter-range Scud-type missiles that Iran has long possessed can hit Baghdad, the capital of Iran's main rival, Iraq. "This is an anti-Saudi and anti-Israel weapon," one official said.
The officials also noted that the Central Intelligence Agency, in classified briefings to Congress this year, revised previous estimates that Iran was years away from developing a medium-range missile and said that it might reach that goal in months.
"Iran's success in gaining technology and materials from Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian advances, means that it could have a medium-range missile much sooner than I assessed last year," the Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, warned in unclassified testimony.
But some members of Congress had sharp criticism of the Administration, saying it should be less open to overtures from President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate whom they said clearly did not hold real power in Iran.
"Iranian words and deeds are not matching," said Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near East and South Asian affairs. "I think this test shows who has the power in Iran. We should be soft in our words toward the Iranian people, but harder in our actions. And we should not waive sanctions on Iran that just provide money to the people with the power, who are developing nuclear weapons and missiles."
Richard C. Shelby, the Arizona Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the test highlighted continuing proliferation problems that require America to develop and deploy its national missile defense system.
Israeli and American efforts to have North Korea to stop exporting missiles and missile technology have been unsuccessful, and officials say such exports are North Korea's largest source of hard currency. Last month North Korea said that it would continue to sell missiles overseas because of economic sanctions that the United States has imposed on it. But American officials said today that it was conceivable a deal could be made with the North Koreans to lift sanctions in return for a halt in missile exports.

HEADLINE: Large Surplus For Transit Could Mean More Service

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
For the second year in a row, New York City's mass transit system is on its way to running up a large surplus that, if it holds up, will probably be used to add bus and subway service, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said yesterday.
Last year's $189 million surplus helped pay for the unlimited-ride passes that went on sale July 4 -- a fare break that is expected to cause riders to take 100 million more trips a year, which in turn has prompted calls for more service from advocates for riders. 
 The surplus comes from increased ridership, a strong economy, lower expenses and conservative budget projections by the agency.
As of the end of May, New York City Transit, the authority's subway and bus subsidiary, was running a $40 million budget surplus, the same as it was in that period last year. In addition, according to an analysis released at the M.T.A.'s finance committee meeting yesterday, revenues from a tax on major corporations are flowing in at a rate that would yield $100 million more than expected. About 65 percent of those revenues go to New York City Transit.
The analysis cautioned, however, that the revenue numbers were preliminary and subject to correction.
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the transportation authority, said that given Gov. George E. Pataki's commitment to returning transit surpluses to bus and subway riders -- and given the completion, with the unlimited passes, of a series of fare discounts -- adding more service was the only alternative left.
"We did the passes, the free transfers and the 11-for-10 discount," Mr. Kelly said. "Anything else would go toward service."
Michael F. McKeon, a spokesman for the Governor, whose appointees control the authority, said that excess money could also be used to speed up subway station overhauls and other renovations.
According to the budget analysis, fare-box revenue, which accounts for most of the surplus, is running $25 million ahead of projections because, while bus and subway ridership is up by 10 percent over last year's, fewer riders than expected are taking advantage of the 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 bulk discount, which brings the $1.50 fare down to $1.36. Mr. Kelly said that estimates of how many people would use the new discounts might simply have been too high.
The impact of the unlimited passes, which the authority predicts will cost it $236 million a year, is not reflected in the January-to-May figures, the most recent available.
Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy group, said he was confident that the surplus would continue to grow, adding that the transportation authority had purposely overestimated the revenue loss that the discounts would cause.
Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., a monitoring group, said she hoped all the money would be used for long-term projects and debt service.
"You have tremendous needs for equipment and tremendous needs for infrastructure," she said, "and they're going to be really competing with each other. And I don't believe you can bond any more." The authority is in the process of borrowing $3.5 billion for capital projects, to be repaid out of riders' fares.
Barry L. Feinstein, a member of the M.T.A. board and its finance committee, said that because the surplus did not come from a permanent increase in revenue, it did not make sense to spend the money on more service, which is a recurring expense.
Mr. Russianoff, though, said that more-frequent service would insure that new riders attracted by the discounts would keep riding the system and guarantee its long-term health. And he said that with elections approaching, he doubted that Mr. Pataki would be able to resist granting a high-profile benefit to riders.
"Election years are years to press for more service," he said.

HEADLINE: TOP REPUBLICANS IN SENATE REJECT BIG TAX-CUT PUSH

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
Republican leaders in the Senate have decided that it would be futile to push for a big tax cut this year, infuriating conservatives in the House and the Senate who had hoped the prospect of huge Federal budget surpluses would lead to swift passage of sweeping tax reductions, members of Congress and aides said today.
The split within the party, which has been developing for months and reached a critical point in a private meeting of Republican leaders on Wednesday night, complicated and perhaps doomed efforts by the party's tax-cutting wing to ram through an election-year tax package that would set up a potent confrontation with Congressional Democrats and President Clinton. 
 Republican aides said Senate leaders saw no prospect of passing any big tax cut because doing so would require 60 votes, far more than the party, which holds 55 seats, has any chance of mustering. And they said the benefits of waging a symbolic fight were outweighed by the risks, including the certainty that Mr. Clinton would accuse them of risking Social Security's long-term health to give tax cuts to the wealthy.
House Republicans, who have been pushing for a tax cut of historic magnitude as the nation enters a new era of fiscal health, said today that they were intent on following through with plans to vote in September on a tax reduction of as much as $700 billion over the next decade.
Conservatives said a House vote might then force the Senate to reconsider before Congress adjourns in October, and they expressed optimism that Senate leaders might still change their minds. But they acknowledged that the current lack of support from Senate leaders clearly endangered their efforts.
"Unfortunately, the Senate's leadership is the weak link in the drive for real tax cuts this year," said Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, who has been pressing the leadership for a big tax cut.
Mr. Ashcroft said it would be "an egregious mistake" for the Senate to give up on a big tax cut this year. Doing so, he said, would lead to disillusionment among Republican voters and cast into doubt Republican efforts to keep control of the House.
Both parties have been struggling for months to adapt their politics and policies to the prospect of ever-larger budget surpluses. But the battle over taxes has heated up just in the last week, after the Congressional Budget Office more than doubled its estimate of the surplus over the next decade.
The budget office said the Federal Government would have a surplus of $1.55 trillion over the next decade. Of that amount, though, about $1.4 trillion would come from Social Security payroll tax revenue in excess of what Social Security needs to pay current benefits.
Republican leaders, including Senators William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, believe that it would be counterproductive to try to pass a big tax bill this year, aides said.
Any tax cut that dipped into the surplus would require Congress to waive its budget rules, a maneuver that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Republicans have no hope of overcoming that hurdle, aides said. And they said there was a strong sense in the Senate that dealing with Social Security should come ahead of any major tax-cutting package that relied on the surplus.
Indeed, they said, the $700 billion, 10-year tax cut being developed in the House by Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the Budget Committee, relies on changes in the way the Federal Government accounts for Social Security payroll tax revenue. The change, they said, would limit the interest paid to the Social Security trust fund, leaving Republicans all the more exposed to Democratic attacks. Mr. Clinton has stepped up his warnings to Republicans in the last week not to use any of the surplus for tax cuts until the two parties have settled on a plan to shore up Social Security for the coming retirement of the baby boom generation.
Senate Republicans said they had not ruled out a modest tax cut, of as much as $70 billion over five years, that would be paid for by raising other taxes and trimming spending. But many conservatives said that amount was far too little.
Congressional aides said Senate leaders during Wednesday night's meeting listed a series of reasons that Republicans should not push now for a large-scale tax cut.
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Mr. Kasich and other House leaders who were at the meeting have argued over the last week that the new surplus estimates make clear that the nation can save Social Security and still have plenty of money left for major tax reductions.
"Not a single senator spoke up in favor of what the House is doing," said a senior Republican aide who was at the meeting. "They're nervous."
Among the other Republicans attending the meeting were Senators Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, Connie Mack of Florida and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, and Representatives Dick Armey, Tom DeLay and Bill Archer, all of Texas.
Several House Republicans said they still believed that the Senate could be sold on the political and economic wisdom of a big tax cut, especially if the House took the lead and passed a bill.
Christina Martin, Mr. Gingrich's spokeswoman, said the House leadership viewed the meeting as just the beginning of a process that would lead to a major tax package. Mr. Gingrich has been pressing in recent days for a plan that would cut taxes for many two-income couples, reduce capital gains taxes and estate taxes and provide tax breaks for the elderly.
"There were plenty of colorful exchanges," Ms. Martin said in describing the meeting. But she added that Republicans were "making progress toward a big tax cut," and that the session was only "the first meeting in a series of meetings."
In an interview, Mr. Kasich defended his tax-cutting plan as protecting Social Security while returning the surplus to taxpayers and insuring that Washington does not use the excess money in coming years to increase the size of Government.
"I'm not surprised that some of my colleagues in the Senate are not enthusiastic about this," Mr. Kasich said. "This is the same U.S. Senate that's not able to pass a spending cut bill."
But Mr. Kasich said Congressional leaders were already on the verge of spending some of the surplus, and that he would continue to rally support from around the country to push through as big a tax cut as possible.
"To take the surplus and increase the size of Government defeats the whole reason we came to power," Mr. Kasich said.

HEADLINE: Political Briefing;
Basking in a Golden Glow, State Legislators Welcome More Responsibility

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., July 23

 BODY:
The 1,200 state legislators who gathered in this desert gambling mecca this week for the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures had the look of winners.
They were flush with money, their state treasuries overflowing with record tax receipts generated by the booming national economy. 
 They were happily exploring 1,001 ways to spend that money, either for new programs or, even better from a political standpoint, for tax cuts.
And they were basking in the results of a new survey that indicated the American public regards states as more able to govern than Washington is, a reversal in opinion from 25 years ago.
"I've been a legislator for 26 years and we've never had it so good, or had such great respect, or so many exciting challenges," said this year's conference president, State Senator Richard H. Finan of Ohio.
Mr. Finan, a Republican who is president of the Ohio Senate, added:
"A whole lot of the credit has to go to the economy. It's providing us with the climate and the resources to do things we previously couldn't do. But there's a lot more to do, too. Congress is steadily handing us more responsibility, especially where it hasn't been able to get the job done itself, or, worse, won't do the job. Also, the courts have come around to our position that a lot of these tasks have always been our job anyway."
The workshop agenda this week indicated the breadth of concerns before state legislatures on the eve of the 21st century -- and the aggressive willingness of the legislatures, given the buoyant economy, to grapple with those concerns rather than surrender and cry out for Federal help, as they have in tougher times.
There were the usual issues, like taxes, schools, roads and crime. But there were dozens of other issues that were previously handled mostly (or sometimes not handled or mishandled) by Congress: genetic testing, alternative medicine, fighting cancer and obesity, international trade and banking, archeological laws, transportation of hazardous materials, copyright law, disaster insurance, telecommunications law and, most recently and most prominently, health insurance, welfare reform, Internet law and tobacco regulation.
At one workshop that explored the changing relationship between Washington and the states, State Representative Lynn Lundquist, the Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives, said the new aggressiveness in state legislatures was long overdue. For too long, he said, the Federal Government had played the role of "Mom and Dad" and treated the states like children.
"There comes a time," Mr. Lundquist, a Republican, said, "when the children have to have a say over their lives."
Still, there was no escaping that much of the state aggressiveness, if not most of it, was attributable not so much to a profound philosophical shift as to simple economics.
According to a survey released here by conference officials, the states are in their best financial shape in almost two decades and will end 1998 with a combined budget surplus of almost 10 percent, or about $40 billion. The last time the surplus percentage was that big was in 1980.
Most fiscal experts recommend that states end their budget years with a 5 percent money surplus.
The conference survey found that over the past legislative year, because of the extra treasury revenue generated by the booming national economy, 19 states cut taxes, 23 had made deposits in their rainy-day reserve funds, 16 selected areas like schools and prisons for extra financing and 16 financed new projects, like roads and parks.
The past year was the fourth consecutive year in which a number of states cut taxes. In each of those years, the cut has amounted to about 1 percent of the previous year's tax take.
How much longer the states can maintain big budget surpluses and continue to cut taxes is obviously a guess. But there were plenty of warnings here that the good times might slow down or even end fairly soon and that legislative prudence should be exercised.
"If you enact persistent tax cuts in this economic atmosphere, you'd best make sure they're sustainable," State Representative Richard Davis, a Delaware Republican, cautioned at one revenue workshop. "You certainly don't want to have to turn around and do a tax increase."
There were also warnings that state legislators would be wise to keep a wary eye on possible negative effects of term limits and ballot initiatives.
"There's an overkill danger here," Mr. Finan said. "Term limits are bad if all they do is just chase some people over to the other legislative house or run off the most experienced hands and leave lobbyists and bureaucrats to fill the vacuum. Likewise, initiatives are good for keeping you on your toes, but not if it's so easy to get on the ballot that the whole legislative process is held captive. That's no way to govern and keep public trust."
According to a recent survey by the Pew Center for the People and the Press, 81 percent of the respondents said they trusted states either a "great deal" or a "fair amount" to take care of important governmental problems. The Federal Government got only a 60 percent rating on the same question.
A quarter of a century earlier, in a similar survey, the Federal Government came out on top with a 70 percent rating. The states got only a 63 percent rating.
William Pound, the executive director of the conference, credited part of the public's current good regard for state government to much improved performances by state legislators in recent years.
"As the country has grown and government everywhere has grown to keep up, state legislatures have become more professional than they ever were, especially their staffs," Mr. Pound said. "There's more competition between parties than almost ever before. That's healthy. And with Congress and the courts handing more responsibility to the states, the states have had no choice but to become better and more aggressive."

HEADLINE: Mark Hampton, Decorator And Style Expert, Dies at 58

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
Mark Hampton, the interior decorator whose relaxed traditionalism was embraced by America's stylish elite, making him a celebrated symbol of gracious living for decades, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center. He was 58 and had homes in Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y.
The cause was cardiac arrest brought on by liver cancer, his wife, Duane, said. 
 In recent years, Mr. Hampton was most closely associated with President and Mrs. George Bush, for whom he consulted on the decor of a half-dozen homes, including the White House; the Vice President's residence; Blair House, the official residence for guests of the President; the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.; the Bush family's seaside retreat in Kennebunkport, Me., and the couple's retirement home in Houston. He also decorated the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Tex.
More a distiller than an innovator, Mr. Hampton built his career on giving the public exactly the style it wanted at precisely the time it realized it wanted it. In the 1960's and 70's that meant discotheque modernism in primary colors, inspired by the work of his mentor, David Hicks, the flamboyant British decorator who died on March 29. It was crisp but comfortable traditionalism, however, that became Mr. Hampton's hallmark in the early 1980's, and that made him an icon of American style and one of the nation's most sought-after decorators.
His use of such upper-crust accouterments as 18th- and early 19th-century American and English antiques, flowery chintz and smartly tailored upholstery added up to a seductive atmosphere of low-key privilege that attracted eminent clients like Anne Bass, the dance patron; Brooke Astor, the philanthropist; Estee Lauder (for whom he decorated three houses); Mike Wallace; Carter Brown, the former director of the National Gallery; Susan Burden, the socialite, and her husband, Carter, the rare book collector; Senator H. John Heinz 3d of Pennsylvania and Lincoln Kirstein, the dance patron.
Like Sister Parish, the late doyenne of American interior design, and Mario Buatta, known as the Prince of Chintz, who worked with Mr. Hampton on Blair House, Mark Hampton was one of the few American decorators to become a household name. Part of his renown was due to his timing; he came to prominence in the 1980's, a decade in which fortunes were being made, interior design magazines were almost as avidly followed in some circles as the stock market, and the English country style that Mr. Hampton so successfully mined and refined was at its peak of popularity.
But that was only one aspect of Mr. Hampton's career, whose stylistic influences were much broader than his popular image would indicate.
"I have absolutely no interest in a trademark style," he once said. "Some would say, 'He has no style, no look.' Well, I don't get it. That isn't what I set out to do. I just set out to be a decorator, to do a good job and have fun. I've wondered with envy at people who like one thing and work at it and it becomes their realm. Those people who can say, 'I love Winterthur but I hate Lyndhurst,' people who have these enormous, refined senses of hate. I love Winterthur, Lyndhurst, Greek Revival and French houses. Of course, I daydream constantly about English houses, and those shingle-style American houses built in 1905 full of furniture from jillions of other periods."
Mr. Hampton's fame was aided, too, by his success in the retail and publishing worlds. In 1988, the decorator began an association with Hickory Chair, a leading furniture manufacturer in North Carolina, creating furnishings for the well-heeled consumer. Eventually, the Mark Hampton Collection grew to more than 250 pieces, some of them inspired by antiques found in the decorator's own apartment on Park Avenue and his weekend house, a remodeled gardener's cottage in Southhampton on Long Island. He also designed fabrics for Kravet and upholstery trimmings for Scalamandre.
A year after he signed a contract with Hickory Chair, Random House published "Mark Hampton on Decorating" a collection of refreshingly opinionated, sensible essays that were originally published in House and Garden, and later, in House Beautiful.
"He was that rare thing, an articulate decorator," said Louis Oliver Gropp, editor in chief of House Beautiful, who led House and Garden when Mr. Hampton's columns were a popular feature of the magazine. "He was a memorable speaker, a thoughtful speaker, and his writing had content as well as verve."
"Mark Hampton on Decorating" and a companion volume of essays that followed, "Legendary Decorators of the Twentieth Century" (1992, Doubleday), gave him a cult following, a rarity in the world of decor. The books were admired as much for their easy, conversational tone and generous, impeccable advice as for their illustrations: polychrome and grisaille watercolors from Mr. Hampton's own hand.
Magazine editors and friends had long looked forward to receiving personal notes from Mr. Hampton, whose neat calligraphy was often accompanied by comical drawings depicting, say, Madonna's cone-shaped bustier or the Buster Brown-bob wig of Madeleine Castaing, a Parisian decorator who was one of Mr. Hampton's idols.
But the public knew nothing of his artistic skills until 1980, when a one-man show of his artwork was held at Acquavella Galleries in Manhattan. A 40th-birthday gift from his wife, Duane, the show featured more than 400 items assembled from private collections, including a pair of corduroy pants that had been hand-decorated for a college classmate and a hand-painted Easter egg made for Edward Lee Cave, the real-estate broker.
After years of celebrity, Mr. Hampton's in-store promotional appearances began to attract many admirers, who would ask to be photographed with him as a souvenir. Stores came to expect crowds as enthusiastic as, though smaller than, those that awaited the arrival of rock stars.
In his appearances and lectures and in print, he imbued the study of design with a novelist's appreciation of a good story and an actor's skill in wryly telling it. He could keep his listeners enthralled with tales of Rose Cumming, an eccentric 1940's grande dame decorator, who began her career as a kept woman, all the while wondering aloud how Miss Cumming's romantic life might explain the louche, unconventional glamour of her interiors.
"His knowledge of the decorative arts was really unparalleled," said Paige Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest. "He loved teaching."
Mark Iredell Hampton Jr. was born in 1940 in Plainfield, Ind., a small town near Indianapolis that has been home to the Hamptons for seven generations. The only son of Mark Hampton, an undertaker, and the former Alice Burkert, he had an Andy Hardy-style childhood, passed in a white clapboard Colonial-style house with inky green shutters.
He spent his teen-age years driving a tractor and baling hay on the family's 380-acre farm. The first hint that Mr. Hampton would not grow old tilling the soil in rural Indiana was his first do-it-yourself decorating project at age 12: a set of shutters for his bedroom, which he refinished in his parents' basement and then installed on his own. "From that moment on, I considered myself a decorator," wrote Mr. Hampton, who went on to confound his parents by amassing a collection of back issues of House and Garden. The parents, however, had other career ideas for their only son.
Mr. Hampton graduated from DePauw University and dutifully attended the University of Michigan Law School. But his love of design was not to be forgotten. On the first day of school, he startled his law school roommate by unpacking an unlawyerly cache of objects from a footlocker: an obelisk, small antique boxes and a branch of rhododendron. So it was no surprise when Mr. Hampton abandoned law school in 1964 to pursue a degree in art history at Michigan's School of Fine Arts. He later earned a master's degree at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.
In 1967, Mr. Hampton, newly incorporated as a decorator, became the New York representative of David Hicks, the British designer whom he had met six years earlier during a junior year abroad at the London School of Economics.
Mr. Hicks was in his heyday, and Mr. Hampton was an eager acolyte. For the next decade, he turned out largely Hicksian interiors that had more to do with Studio 54 swagger than the country-club comforts for which he later became celebrated. They sported Op Art paintings, attenuated metal tables by Baron Albrizzi, white goatskin carpets and chrome-plated Italian lamps.
Mr. Hampton's one-bedroom apartment on East 63d Street, where he and his wife lived after their marriage in 1964, attracted the attention of House and Garden in 1968. Credited to Mr. Hampton and Mr. Hicks, the low-ceilinged living room featured reflective Mylar wallpaper with a herringbone motif, a Hicks-design wall-to-wall carpet of tiny interlocking black-and-white hexagons and a pair of Louis XV-style chairs from the Door Store.
After breaking with the famously temperamental Mr. Hicks, Mr. Hampton spent eight years with McMillen Inc. the New York society decorators. He left the company to start his own business in 1975.
In time he became one of America's leading decorators and among the few to call for important redesigns. He was part of the team in 1984 that restored a wing of Gracie Mansion, the residence of the mayor of New York. He also worked on the Governor's Mansion in Albany and the American Academy in Rome.
Though Mr. Hampton was an ardent preservationist and lover of history -- social, decorative and otherwise -- his clients occasionally did not share his sentiments.
The only project that the decorator ever regretted accepting, he once told a reporter, was the renovation of the Treaty Room of the White House. Decorated in a spirited High Victorian style during the Kennedy Administration by Stephane Boudin, the French decorator, it was redone at the request of President Bush, who was no fan of Victoriana, into a blandly traditional private office. Mr. Hampton later expressed disappointment in the previous decor's loss to the history of the decorative arts. The room's 19th-century theme was revived in a much awaited and then highly criticized redecoration for the Clintons in 1993 by Kaki Hockersmith, the Arkansas designer.
In addition to his wife of 23 years, the former Duane Flegel, and his sister, Rachel Hampton Blank of Winnetka, Ill., Mr. Hampton is survived by two daughters, Alexa and Kate, both of Manhattan.
To Mr. Hampton, decorating was not just a job, but an adventure. The pursuit of the beautiful for him rendered life endlessly promising. "Whether you are in Birmingham, England, or Birmingham, Ala., you cannot have a bad time because the food is awful or it's raining or you don't like the hotel," he once told Marilyn Bethany in The New York Times. "There is always something to see."

Power Plant Expansion

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Sithe Energies Inc., one of the largest builders and operators of power plants in the United States, said yesterday that it was planning a $400 million expansion at a power plant in upstate New York.
Sithe, a joint venture of Vivendi S.A., a French company, and the Marubeni Corporation, a Japanese trading company, said that it planned to increase capacity of the 1,040-megawatt Independence plant in Scriba, N.Y., by 750 megawatts. When the expansion is completed, the plant will provide enough electricity for 1.7 million homes. 
 Deregulation of the electric utility industry, coupled with the strength of the economy, is leading to an upsurge in new power-plant construction and expansion and sales of existing generators.
"America as a whole has underinvested in new and much- needed generating capacity over the past two decades," William Kriegel, Sithe's chief executive, said in a statement.
Sithe, which is based in Manhattan, said it expects regulatory approval of the expansion in 12 to 18 months. The project is expected to take three years.

Prices Retreat As Stocks Find Some Stability

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices declined yesterday, as the stock market steadied itself from the sharp fall of the day before.
Bonds were also held back by some cautious investors who speculated that with the election of Japan's Foreign Minister to president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the Government might take further action to pull the economy out of a slump. Any such effort would make United States Treasury securities less attractive as a haven for foreign investors fleeing Asia's crises. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32 , to 106 9/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.68 percent, from 5.66 percent on Thursday. A week ago, the yield was 5.74 percent.
"The bond market over the near-term is very likely to remain in its recent trading range as a slowing economy, subdued inflation and financial fragility abroad will keep the Fed from lifting interest rates, while at the same time, strong consumer spending and torrid housing activity clearly reduce the chance of any ease in monetary policy soon," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.
Investors will soon turn their attention to Tuesday's report on consumer confidence and the Government's first estimate of gross domestic product in the second quarter on Friday.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management, a Washington-investment firm, said he expected the G.D.P. report to show little in the quarter, compared with the first quarter's torrid rate of 5.4 percent.
"The notion that we may have a second quarter of little or no growth should lower bond yields to the 5.5 percent area and improve fixed-income market psychology to a substantial degree," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Edges Higher as Curtain Drops on a Troubled Week

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks seesawed yesterday to finish mixed, closing out the worst week for the market since January on investor concern that corporate profit growth is faltering.
Gateway led a decline in computer stocks after reporting unexpectedly weak earnings, while Pepsico gained after saying Thursday that it might spin off some bottling operations. Companies with steady earnings growth like General Electric and Merck helped prop up the market. 
 "People seem to be making a bet that the economy is slowing and that growth stocks are safe bets," said David Baker, chief of program trading at Deutsche Bank Securities.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.38 points, to 8,937.36, after swinging up as much as 69 points and down 65 points. For the week, the Dow lost 400.61 points, or 4.3 percent, from last Friday's record, though it is still up 13 percent for the year.
Toward the end of the day, the market retreated on news of gunfire in the Capitol building but recovered somewhat when it became clear that no political figures had been shot.
The broad market ended lower. Nine stocks fell for every five that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.05, to 1,140.80. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.23, to 1,930.99.
DuPont, Silicon Graphics, Callaway Golf and Hewlett-Packard were among the companies that warned this week about deteriorating profits. Quarterly earnings rose just 2.6 percent among the S.& P. companies that reported results, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks earnings. Profits rose 8.1 percent in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
Earnings concerns are evident in share prices. The S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq both lost 3.9 percent since records reached last Friday, the worst weekly losses since Jan. 5-9. But the S.& P. 500 is up nearly 18 percent for the year, and the Nasdaq is up 23 percent.
Paul Hennessey, head of trading at Boston Partners Asset Management L.P., said investors are worried that profits will deteriorate in the second half of 1998. "Maybe we've seen all the gains in stocks for the year," said Mr. Hennessey, whose firm oversees $18 billion.
Gateway, the second-largest direct seller of personal computers, fell 6 1/8, to 52 5/8, after reporting second-quarter earnings of 38 cents, 6 cents below forecasts. Gateway, formerly Gateway 2000, was hurt by weak demand and increased expenses. Its stock was downgraded by Lehman Brothers.
Silicon Graphics slumped 2 5/8, to 11 1/2, after the maker of computer work stations reported a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss on weak sales in Asia.
Pepsico gained 2 3/16 , to 39 3/4, after the No. 2 soft-drink maker said it might sell a stake in its bottling operations to the public, a move that could help it compete more effectively against Coca-Cola.
Shares of Oxford Health Plans fell 1 7/16 , to 9 1/8, and touched a 52-week low of 8 3/4 during the day on increased concern about its coming quarterly earnings report. Earlier this week, the once high-flying managed care company told doctors it might have to cut their fees and raise premiums to make money.
American depository receipts of Nokia soared 9, to 92, after the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker's earnings, helped by strong demand for its networks, beat analyst forecasts.

HEADLINE: Gore, Ending Moscow Visit, Is Confident About Reform

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 24

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore ended two days of talks here today by declaring his confidence that Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko will be able to carry out the fiscal reforms needed to make the Russian Government solvent.
Mr. Gore's statements came after two days of get-acquainted meetings with Mr. Kiriyenko, who has replaced former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as the senior official on a panel that coordinates the two Governments' work on major Russian-American issues.
At a news conference with Mr. Kiriyenko, Mr. Gore said his counterpart had "full command" of the economic issues "and a very impressive understanding of economic reform and what must be done in order to advance reform." 
 Financial experts and some Russian officials have said the Government has but three to five months to make major improvements in its tax system and budget or face another fiscal crisis like the one that nearly bankrupted the Government early this month.
Using political pressure and executive declarations, President Boris N. Yeltsin and Mr. Kiriyenko managed this month to put in place most of the laws needed to make financial reforms that have been demanded by Russia's creditors as the price for continued investment there. But persuading Russia's stubborn bureaucracy to carry out the laws is another matter, as is forcing powerful private interests to obey them.
Mr. Kiriyenko, who turns 36 on Sunday, seemed crisp and confident at today's meeting with reporters. He dismissed speculation that Russia's Communist-led Parliament would block reforms, saying Parliament's opposition to some of the more onerous tax laws is normal, considering that many members face re-election next year.
"If we do not pay too much attention to the inevitable political emotions," he said, "we'll find common approaches and agreed solutions together."
Mr. Gore's visit produced three agreements that had been prepared in advance for the trip. The most important commits the United States to spend $3.1 million to help Russian scientists in so-called closed cities -- towns devoted to nuclear weapons research and production -- start work on nonmilitary projects.
One goal of the programs is to prevent hostile nations from luring those scientists to work on clandestine nuclear programs.
Another agreement would open a new effort to convert plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons into fuel for nuclear reactors.

HEADLINE: A Makeover for the TV Dinner;
Swanson Is Being Upgraded to Restore Market Share

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL, N.J., July 21

 BODY:
Maybe it was the shifting cultural and demographic tides. Maybe it was corporate guilt over a badly neglected brand. Or maybe it was the phone call from the man who had spent his career in the poultry industry and was still confounded by a piece of fried chicken in his TV dinner that he could not trace to any particular part of the bird.
"Consumers like to be able to recognize what they're eating," observed Murray Kessler, president of the Swanson frozen foods division of Vlasic Foods International, which is based in this Philadelphia suburb. 
 Whatever finally forced the decision, this much is clear: after decades of inertia, the Swanson TV dinner, the archetypal frozen meal born during the Eisenhower Administration, is getting an overhaul.
That's what Swanson calls it, anyway. The company, after all, still features a menu that seems lost in a time warp, with main courses like fried chicken, Salisbury steak and roast turkey served with potatoes, corn and maybe some green beans. Some dinners still tuck a brownie into its own individual compartment, and the turkey still has a gooey cranberry concoction at its side. Swanson even acknowledges the stodginess of its product with a certain perverse pride.
"They have missed every single trend since the Korean War," said Jeffrey G. Kanter, an analyst with Prudential Securities. "It's one thing to miss the Thai food craze, but it's another to miss Italian."
But for an American icon like the TV dinner -- named and packaged that way when the first ones came out in 1954 to suggest the meals represented all that was modern and sophisticated at the time -- even modest tinkering can, perhaps credibly, be labeled an overhaul.
What Swanson is changing is that the fried chicken, its biggest seller even though it is now produced from fowl hacked into 19 illogical pieces, will be made from more appealing and at least recognizable cuts of meat.
There is also, in the Swanson saga, a note of corporate drama worthy of, say, "Dynasty" or "Dallas."
Robert F. Bernstock, now Vlasic's chief executive, lost a bid for the top job at the Campbell Soup Company last summer. And now that Vlasic has been spun off by Campbell, Mr. Bernstock wants badly to show his stuff. "The whole goal," he said of the latest changes, "was to do something significant and symbolic of how we could operate as a company."
It was high time Swanson did something. TV dinners -- the label has stuck, even though the industry years ago dropped that couch-potato term from its packaging -- are a $300 million business for the company. But competitors have proliferated, market share is plunging, and consumer complaints ("Need a microscope to find the chicken," one said) are at an all-time high.
Not surprisingly, the division was also losing money. The numbers are depressing: Vlasic has just 9 percent of the $4.5 billion frozen prepared-foods category, running fourth to Nestle, owner of the Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine brands, which has 26.4 percent, and Conagra, maker of Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's and other brands, which has 19.8 percent, and H. J. Heinz, with 9.3 percent, according to Information Resources Inc., which tracks sales in supermarkets and other large stores.
Vlasic is betting on the revamping of the TV dinner to become a benchmark success that could make the company seem a good bet for Wall Street, and set it on a path toward profitability and growth denied by its former handlers.
The company was created a year ago from what can best be described as leftovers. It was spun off as a hodgepodge of food businesses, including pickles, mushrooms and Argentine beef, that Campbell Soup decided it could get along better without. Mr. Bernstock is a kind of Campbell leftover, too, having lost his bid for the chief executive's job to Dale F. Morrison, an executive best known for producing impressive growth with Pepperidge Farm cookies and snacks.
While at Campbell, Mr. Bernstock headed the condensed-soup business, and he readily recalls what low priorities the businesses that now constitute Vlasic were. "It's a Statue of Liberty kind of analogy," he said. "Give us your tired, your poor."
Yet that set of circumstances begets a certain aggressiveness, a will to prove something, that some analysts predict could turn into healthy profits. "There's a lot of opportunity at Vlasic, because every one of these businesses was a forgotten child under the Campbell umbrella," said Mr. Kanter, the analyst. It might even outperform Campbell, he said, which is laboring mightily to increase profits and sales from soup.
Still, for Vlasic, that will take time, not to mention money. "After years of being neglected, you can't turn these businesses around overnight," said Erika Gritman Long, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. "It's going to take some significant, up-front investment that will hurt your earnings before you can turn them around." She projects Vlasic earnings for the current fiscal year, which closes at the end of the month, will total just 49 cents, down from an initial forecast of $1.29 made when the company was spun off.
The TV dinner emerged from the technological and societal changes of World War II, said Michael Stern, a columnist for Gourmet magazine and culinary historian. "During the war, there was a lot of promise that the techniques developed to feed the troops would spill over into civilian life and do what everyone seemed to want in the late 40's and 50's -- provide more leisure time," he said. "The TV dinner was a great step in the convenience revolution. It goes hand in hand with the move out to suburbia."
And by helping to do away with daylong cooking of elaborate family meals, he said, it contributed to "the unraveling of the nuclear family."
"The idea was not that people would eat them in front of the TV," he added, "but that they were as modern as television." They also had an element of sophistication, as upwardly mobile families served them to underscore the point that they did not have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.
As Mr. Stern pointed out, of course, it is the upwardly mobile people today who enjoy showing off their bread-baking and other old-fashioned skills.
The way the TV dinner was revised shows where Mr. Bernstock's business priorities lie. He chose Vlasic's best-known line and largest category, and rather than add one new product, he decided to work on everything at once. In the interest of saving money, some products, like an all-dark-meat dinner, were eliminated in favor of a mix of white and dark. A boneless white-meat dinner was added. New, slightly smaller chickens were tested and approved, because there would be less waste from discarded parts, and the company's plant in Fayetteville, Ark., was reconfigured to handle the changes.
Mr. Kessler, the Swanson president, recalled visiting factories around the country shortly after starting his new job in February. "When I got to the fried-chicken line, one of the people said to me, 'I'm not proud of our fried chicken right now,' " he said. "They weren't proud mostly because of the way we were cutting up the chicken."
Practices like "parts management," an effort to economically control how chicken was used, had failed, he added, and the elimination of ribs from breast meat, for example, made it difficult for people to tell what part they were getting. Complaints soared to 250 for each million unit sales, "and in this company, a red alert is about 10," he said. As profits fell the last five years, advertising was yanked away, and the stage was set for Swanson's big decline.
Once the chicken was reorganized, Mr. Bernstock ordered a new advertising campaign, one whose slogan will be "Make New Memories With Swanson," aimed directly at families. While one commercial from the 50's showed a mother swishing out the door in a fur stole, two commercials the company is now considering show parents enjoying TV dinners alongside their children. Ad spending, including the first TV commercials in a decade, will increase this year to $10 million from $5 million. In the 1980's, though, some $80 million was spent annually on advertising for Swanson and Vlasic's pickle brands. Executives are in the process of meeting with retailers around the country, to push orders of the dinners, and longtime distribution issues are being ironed out, Mr. Bernstock said.
"We all ate these things as kids, but we want to generate interest for a whole new generation of kids," he said, adding that his own four children, ages 14 to 21, eat their share of TV dinners. The typical frozen-dinner consumer is increasingly older, well beyond 21, though considered responsive to changes in packaging and product content.
"Heinz has seen benefits from revamping its Weight Watchers products," Ms. Long said. "Before they changed the products themselves, they changed the packaging and their volumes went up. You've got core users who need to feel there's some variety and some change there."
As for what else may be coming down the pike, Vlasic officials offer plenty of hints, but no details, about a new pickle product that is supposed to be unveiled in October. Analysts are puzzled about just what that may be, though Vlasic saw huge sales of its horizontally sliced pickles after it introduced them in 1995. "I don't know what they could do with a pickle," Mr. Kanter said. "I mean, Mother Nature grows cucumbers a certain way."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
With the Pound Up, Exports Suffer

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 24

 BODY:
What price the pound?
As the British currency has risen 30 percent in value against the German mark over the last two years, so, too, have British exporters bemoaned the pain they say this has caused. And nowhere has that been so apparent as at the Rover Group P.L.C., the money-losing British auto maker that BMW acquired four years ago. 
 Walter Hasselkus, the BMW-appointed chairman of Rover, on Thursday announced 1,500 job cuts among Rover's 39,500 workers, blaming the strength of the pound for hurting the export sales that account for 57 percent of the company's business. "Government, please note and understand: the pound is overvalued," Mr. Hasselkus told the BBC.
Rover's move has touched off a far wider debate over monetary policy and other issues, raising questions about the Government's decision last year to shift control of interest rates to the Bank of England, which in turn has raised rates to the highest level in more than five years.
Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain's equivalent of Treasury Secretary, attributed Rover's problems to deficient productivity.
Within the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, one committee member, DeAnne Julius, openly challenged the decision last month to again raise interest rates by a quarter-point, to 7.5 percent. She said the rate increases, intended to restrain inflation, might be contributing to an economic slowdown.
The higher rates, which make deposits denominated in sterling more attractive, are an important force driving the pound higher, particularly against the mark. It now costs nearly three marks to buy a pound, compared with about 2.1 marks to the pound in 1996.
"It's simply too high for industry to bear," said Nick Argent, a Rover spokesman. Mr. Argent acknowledged that, as Mr. Brown said in a published interview today, "productivity is an issue" for the Rover Group, which, along with Rover cars, produces the Mini, the MG and various models under the Land Rover line. But, Mr. Argent said, it was not the only issue.
Some commentators suggested that Rover, like other British exporters facing recession, was using arguments about the currency's strength to cloak its own failures to increase productivity. Others pointed out that Rover cars, over the years, have had a reputation for expensive maintenance.
Mr. Argent said that Rover's work force had improved its productivity by 18 percent in the last few years. But that improvement has been undermined, he said, by the pound's strength. This has not only made imported cars more affordable in Britain, he said, but Rover's cars more expensive abroad.
'The time has come when we must take action," said Mr. Hasselkus, the the Rover Group's chairman, who is also a member of the BMW board.
On Thursday, Rover announced that, apart from eliminating 1,500 jobs, it would move to a four-day workweek at some plants and increase purchases from less expensive foreign suppliers.
The jobs are to be shed initially through early retirement and attrition. But these 1,500 positions will not be the only casualties. The increase in foreign-made parts will cost British suppliers more than $1 billion in sales and thousands of jobs, contributing to a manufacturing malaise affecting roughly one-fifth of the British economy.
The main British labor union representing workers at Rover, the Transport and General Workers Union, said it would challenge the job cuts on the ground that it was unjust to penalize the work force for the strength of the pound.
At a time when Volkswagen A.G. is planning to enter the British car market through the purchase of Rolls-Royce, Rover's troubles highlighted the perils of sterling's strength for foreign investors as well as domestic exporters.
BMW's shares fell 6.3 percent on Thursday in Frankfurt, despite the parent company's announcement of an 18 percent increase in its first-half profit. Some analysts ascribed the drop to the problems at Rover, but Christopher Will, European auto analyst with Lehman Brothers here, said the slide reflected broader weakness in European auto shares. Today, BMW's stock regained a little of that loss, rising 14 marks to close at 1,719 marks, or $966.
BMW has said it does not expect to turn a profit at Rover until 2000. The first results of its investments in Rover are expected later this year with the introduction of two models developed fully under BMW tutelage -- a new Land Rover Discovery all-terrain vehicle and a luxury car.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Stumbles

 BODY:
It has not paid to have a sense of history on Wall Street for the past couple of years. Those who believed that traditional indicators of value mattered have sold stocks, only to see the stock market roar ahead. But this week Wall Street stumbled. Even with a mild recovery yesterday afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down more than 4 percent from the record level of just a week earlier.
The seers of Wall Street, whose crystal balls are still as cloudy as ever, have had a rough time figuring out the exact meaning of Asia's problems. There have been occasional panicky predictions that the Asian collapse would drag the rest of the world with it. But mostly the optimistic view has prevailed. 
 That view held that Asia's problems were relatively unimportant to this country's economy, and that the United States' financial markets would benefit as a rush of money from abroad sought safety, driving American stock and bond prices higher. In addition, it was hoped by many on Wall Street, the Federal Reserve would be sufficiently alarmed about Asia that it would push interest rates lower.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said little new when he testified in Congress this week. But from the point of view of the optimists, he sounded some discordant notes. He said he was still concerned about inflation, and sounded as if an interest rate hike remained possible. In addition, the man who first mentioned "irrational exuberance" in December 1996, when the Dow was 28 percent below the current level, again cautioned that prices seemed to be based on very optimistic profit expectations.
In fact, the Asian woes have begun to hurt the profits of many companies, both those that sell to Asian customers and those that compete with Asian companies whose sinking currencies have made price reductions possible. Poor profit reports, combined with Mr. Greenspan's comments, seem to explain the falling share prices.
For most of this decade, such selloffs have quickly been followed by recoveries as individual investors acted on the assumption that any decline was a buying opportunity. That may happen this time as well. But stock prices remain very high, and could be quite vulnerable to a decline if the American economy is unable to maintain its excellent performance in the face of the economic problems confronting much of the world.

HEADLINE: States Threaten Airlines With Antitrust Steps

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Attorneys General from 25 states voiced their support yesterday for a Clinton Administration proposal to promote more competition in the airline industry. If the initiative fails, however, the states may file an antitrust suit against the major carriers, the leader of the group said.
Tom Miller, the Attorney General of Iowa, who drafted the joint position paper, said the states would prefer to see the Administration enact the guidelines proposed in April, which were intended to prevent the large airlines from driving low-cost competitors out of major airports. If the Administration backed down, he said, the states might bring suit against the airlines for predatory pricing. 
 Earlier this month, Attorneys General from 20 states set up a task force focused on the airline industry and headed by Mr. Miller and Dennis C. Vacco, New York's Attorney General.
In addition to predatory pricing, the states also plan to examine the three alliances announced earlier this year that would pair off the country's six largest airlines. Other issues include the extent to which major carriers control gates and takeoff and landing rights at the country's most crowded airports.
Many of the same issues are also addressed in pending bills in Congress.
The states announced their support for the Administration on the last day of a four-month period of public comment on the guidelines. This week, both supporters and opponents held news conferences and presented experts to bolster their positions.
But the debate since April has been dominated by a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign financed by the major airlines that accuses the Clinton Administration of trying to "reregulate" the airline industry and hurt consumers.
One newspaper advertisement, for example, by the Air Transport Association, the industry's chief lobby in Washington, showed an overweight government official with his feet on his desk under the headline: Meet Your New Travel Agent.
Last week, Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater invited the chief executives of the major airlines to his office to talk about the proposed rules. One person at the meeting said Mr. Slater reminded the executives that they would have to work with the Administration on many aviation issues after the debate over the guidelines was over.
"We have an honest disagreement over how the situation ought to be handled," said Leo Mullin, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, who was at the meeting. "The Secretary asked us to come in and talk about it and create a better understanding. It was a good move on his part and I think we had a good dialogue."
Despite the industry charges, the Transportation Department has repeatedly voiced support for deregulation of the airline industry, which it says has reduced average air fares by 35 percent since 1978. But it adds that much of that benefit was a result of competition from low-cost competitors that are being driven out of many markets by larger carriers.
According to the Administration, the number of cities served by more than two airlines has fallen 41 percent since 1989. Meanwhile, air fares for last-minute travel have risen dramatically and the major airlines are reporting record high profits.
Small carriers complain that when they try to compete the major airlines match their lower prices and flood routes with so many new seats that they are forced to retreat.
The guidelines would put the airlines on notice that the Administration would order them to stop and might even assess fines if they responded to new competition by adding so many new seats that they lose money. The assumption is that the only rational reason for taking such action would be to drive the new competitor out of the market, leaving the major carrier free to raise prices.
In a draft position paper, the Transportation Department cites four recent examples of such predatory behavior based on its investigations of the major airlines.
In one example from early 1997, an incumbent airline responded to a new entrant by dropping its fare on one route to under $75 from between $351 and $425. The incumbent sold 46,000 tickets -- six times the number sold by the new entrant -- and saw its revenue decline 50 percent.
The major airlines respond that they are not responsible for the failure of small carriers and that the guidelines will ultimately hurt consumers by preventing the big airlines from lowering their prices to match new competitors.
As part of their lobbying campaign, the major carriers increased contributions to lawmakers in Washington in the 1998 election cycle by 66 percent, compared with 1995-96, to $2.2 million, according to a study by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Nevertheless, they were handed a defeat last month, when the House Transportation Committee refused to adopt a plan backed by the major airlines that would have forced the Transportation Department to study the issue for a year before putting the guidelines into force.
Instead, the bill states that the Administration must give Congress 12 weeks' notice before adopting the rules and must present the lawmakers with a study of airline deregulation. The proposed legislation, which is still awaiting passage by the full House, also gives the Transportation Department the right for the first time to review proposed airline alliances before they can take effect.
Administration officials say the final version of the guidelines could be in force by November.
Last week, Northwest Airlines released a paper, highly critical of the rules, that was written by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former head of President Clinton's National Economic Council, who left the White House in December.
In an interview, Ms. Tyson said the regulations would go beyond current antitrust laws and would put the Transportation Department in the impossible position of having to judge what constitutes fair competition. "There is no public policy case here for intervention," she added.
But Mr. Miller, Iowa's Attorney General, strongly disagreed. " I've been a consumer protector for a long time," he said. "I am really leery when the industry argues that they are helping consumers."

HEADLINE: Drug Czar Assails Mayor For Opposing Methadone

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
In an exchange of blunt language, the nation's drug policy chief said yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's call to end methadone programs conflicted with the best medical and scientific knowledge. City Hall then responded by accusing him of waging an ineffective war on drugs.
Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired four-star Army general who directs national drug policy for the Clinton Administration, said the Mayor's recent criticism of methadone programs flew in the face of a conviction held by scientific researchers and doctors: that methadone is the most effective treatment for heroin addiction. 
 Mayor Giuliani's office responded to General McCaffrey's statement with contempt. "Maybe the reason why our nation's war against drugs has stalled is because our vaunted drug czar favors massive increases in chemical dependency," Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota said.
The Mayor said on Monday that he wanted to do away with methadone programs in New York City within four years and make heroin addicts embrace the "moral" alternative of total abstinence. In reality, experts say, the Mayor can do little about the city's methadone programs because they are mostly financed with Federal and state dollars. But methadone's proponents fear that his criticism could prejudice people against the medication.
In a statement issued by his White House office, General McCaffrey did credit the Mayor with making New York City a safer, cleaner and more orderly community and with supporting the national strategy to control illegal drugs. "But his recent statements about methadone therapy are at odds with the conclusions of the nation's scientific and medical community," the general's statement said. "The problem isn't that there are too many methadone programs; it is that there are too few."
The United States has about 810,000 opiate addicts, General McCaffrey said, but only 115,000 of them are participating in methadone programs. "Clearly, many more persons could be freed from the slavery of addiction if only this proven effective therapy were more widely available," he said.
Mr. Lhota and Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, Colleen Roche, said that Mayor Giuliani had got his information about methadone from the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Department of Health and the heads of various drug treatment programs. But the Mayor's office would not name the people who had briefed Mr. Giuliani.
An estimated 40,000 recovering addicts in New York State take methadone, and 34,000 of them live in New York City, said Michael McAllister, chairman of the New York Committee of Methadone Program Administrators. The city is thought to have 250,000 heroin addicts, some of whom cite long waits for treatment slots.
"Methadone therapy helps keep over 100,000 addicts off welfare and on the tax rolls as law-abiding, productive citizens," General McCaffrey said in his statement. "Close down methadone programs and these individuals will be back on the streets, back on drugs and back on welfare, at enormous cost to society and to the safety of all of us."
Methadone, a synthetic drug developed as a painkiller in World War II, was subsequently discovered to block opiate cravings. It has been used for 34 years to treat heroin addicts, who have a high relapse rate. Methadone can also be addictive, but users say it does not make them feel high. And they say it helps them to resume normal lives.
The director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Alan I. Leshner, called methadone "the most effective medication we now have in the toolbox."
General McCaffrey, who called methadone therapy "a valuable and proven approach" to treating heroin addiction, cited a succession of scientific studies proving its efficacy.
In one such study by the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Adam Yarmolinsky and Dr. Richard A. Rettig concluded, "Methadone treatment helps heroin addicts free themselves from drug dependency, a life of crime in support of their habit and the risk of adding to the AIDS population by sharing dirty needles."
New York doctors and treatment specialists who believe in methadone object to the Mayor's characterization of it as one more drug. Dr. Edwin A. Salsitz, director of a pilot methadone medical maintenance program at Beth Israel Medical Center, said that the Mayor was confusing methadone maintenance with the social and economic destitution that leads some people to abuse drugs.
"If you come in destitute and are living in a box in the park," Dr. Salsitz said, "how is methadone going to make you want to go to work?"
Addicts with useful job skills resume work once they are on methadone, Dr. Salsitz said. Among his own patients, he listed lawyers, teachers, business owners, electricians, plumbers, a nurse and a pianist.
"My patients are very distraught about what the Mayor is saying," Dr. Salsitz said. "They wish they could call him and say, 'I am working, I am functioning, I am paying my own way and paying my taxes because I am on methadone.' "
Mr. McAllister, of the Committee of Methadone Program Administrators, said the number of employed methadone users in New York City ranged from 30 percent in Queens and Staten Island to 12 percent in a depressed area like the South Bronx.

HEADLINE: Accord Would Increase Cap on Visas for Skilled Workers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
House and Senate Republican leaders reached agreement today on a bill to increase the number of foreign computer programmers, engineers and other skilled workers who can be admitted to the United States to fill job openings at high-technology companies.
Under the agreement, the annual limit on the number of visas for such workers, now 65,000, would rise to 115,000 over three years, an increase of 77 percent. 
 High-tech companies and their chief executives, including William H. Gates of the Microsoft Corporation, have lobbied heavily for an increase in the quota, saying that their industry suffers from shortages of qualified employees and that they desperately need skilled foreign workers to help develop new products.
"This is a big victory for those who care about the critical high-tech sector of our economy," said Senator Spencer Abraham, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. "There is probably no more important legislation that Congress will pass this year to create jobs and continue the enormous growth of the high-tech and computer industries."
The Republican-led Senate passed a similar bill in May by a vote of 78 to 20, with support from many Democrats, including their floor leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. But the legislation bogged down in the House, prompting Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican leaders, from both chambers, to meet this week and help work out a compromise.
Senator Abraham said the situation was urgent. The 1998 cap on the visas for the skilled workers was reached on May 7, he said, and since then "no company, university or nonprofit organization in America has been able to hire these highly skilled professionals" from abroad.
Mr. Abraham said he expected the Senate and the House to approve the compromise before lawmakers leave town for their summer recess early next month.
Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who heads the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, had expressed skepticism that there were labor shortages in the computer industry. But today he said, "This agreement is good for business, good for workers, good for America."
President Clinton had threatened to veto the bill if it did not do enough to protect American workers. But Administration officials said they welcomed changes reflected in the compromise bill, which was written in part to address the President's concerns.
"There has clearly been some progress in our direction," said Gene Sperling, assistant to the President for economic policy, "but it's unclear at this point whether things have improved enough for us to support it. We need to see the details."
The compromise legislation would require a company to certify, before hiring a foreign worker, that it had tried to recruit an American worker for the opening and that it had not laid off an American to hire the foreigner. Congressional aides said this requirement would not apply to big companies like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems Inc., where foreign workers perform important jobs but account for a small proportion of the work force.
Aides to Senator Abraham said the agreement also included his proposal to provide training for unemployed American workers and college scholarships for low-income students, so that they could pursue careers in high-tech industries. The training and scholarships would be financed with fees to be collected from employers who use the foreign-worker program, but the amount has not been determined.
Whether there is in fact a shortage of high-tech workers is a hotly debated question. An industry group, the Information Technology Association of America, says there are 346,000 openings, amounting to 10 percent of all American jobs for computer programmers, engineers and systems analysts.
But the Labor Department, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and several groups representing American engineers say the high-tech industry, trying to hold down its labor costs by hiring from abroad, has overstated the problem.
India provides by far the largest number of skilled foreign workers under the special-visa program. Its citizens received 44 percent of the visas, known as H-1B visas, issued in the first half of the current fiscal year.
The next largest share went to China, with 9 percent, Britain (5 percent) and the Philippines and Canada (3 percent each). Japan, Germany, Pakistan and France each received 2 percent of the visas, with other countries getting 28 percent.
One person who may be affected by the legislation is Valenita Videva, 26, from Macedonia. She came to the United States in 1995 on a student visa and studied mechanical engineering at Norwich University in Vermont. She graduated at the top of her class and was hired by Texas Instruments Inc. after gaining a one-year work authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
But the authorization expired on June 1, leaving Ms. Videva unable to work and unsure whether she could stay in the country.
"I applied for an H-1B visa two months before my work permit was to expire," Ms. Videva said in a telephone interview from the Texas Instruments office in Attleboro, Mass. "I was told that the quota was reached for this year. Until today it was so deadlocked, I started losing hope. It meant that I would have packed my things and told my landlord I was going home, and that's not something I wanted to do."
The agreement would provide 20,000 additional visas this year, for a 1998 total of 85,000. It would raise the annual limit to 95,000 next year, 105,000 in 2000 and 115,000 in 2001.
Representative Ron Klink, a Democrat from a Pennsylvania district that has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years, criticized the agreement.
"This is a shame," Mr. Klink said. "This is a loophole for big companies to hire cheap indentured labor. It's a huge loss to American workers, especially young people who have made their educational decisions based on an expectation of jobs when they get out of school. Instead, these companies will be hiring cheaper foreigners."

HEADLINE: Man Carrying Fake Dynamite Spreads Panic in Newark

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 24

 BODY:
A man dressed partly in military fatigues carried what appeared to be seven sticks of dynamite attached to a timer into a downtown office building this morning, causing widespread panic and confusion. Although the device turned out to be fake, it was so realistic that it fooled police dogs trained to detect explosives.
More than 1,000 people were evacuated from the building at 18 Rector Street, which houses several local and Federal government agencies, and from about 15 other nearby buildings, including the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. There were no injuries, but traffic in downtown Newark was tangled for several hours as tense bomb squad technicians used a water cannon to break the device apart and defuse it. 
 In the end, the seven red tubes marked "dynamite" turned out to be filled with some other substance, possibly clay, Newark's Police Director, Joseph J. Santiago, said. The man who carried it, identified by the police as Gregory H. James, 43, of Irvington, was arrested and charged with possessing an explosive device, making terroristic threats and other related crimes, Mr. Santiago said.
Mr. James was charged with two counts of each crime, Mr. Santiago said, because investigators had determined that he had carried a similar device, or perhaps the same one, into a United States Army recruiting office in downtown Newark last Nov. 5 and had threatened workers there before escaping. Mr. James may also face Federal charges, Mr. Santiago said.
Today's drama began to unfold shortly before 11 A.M. when Mr. James rode into downtown Newark on the No. 25 public bus. He wore camouflage pants and a matching cap, and carried two black shoulder bags, witnesses told the police. His serviceman's demeanor was oddly offset by an aqua-colored golf shirt. He got off the bus at Market and Broad Streets, Newark's busiest intersection, witnesses and the police said.
What happened next, witnesses and investigators said, seemed to follow the script of a cloak-and-dagger thriller. A man who had been riding on the bus with Mr. James and who, the police said, might have known him learned of the bomb and, believing it to be real, began to follow Mr. James along the streets of downtown Newark, signaling for help along the way.
At first, Mr. James headed south on Broad Street, in the direction of City Hall and the United States District Courthouse. Then, he apparently changed his mind, turning back north and walking toward the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which has become the hallmark of Newark's downtown revival. By chance, as Mr. James walked toward 18 Rector Street, a police bomb truck drove by.
The man following Mr. James hailed the truck.
"It was like a one-in-a-million chance," said Detective William Tartis, a bomb squad expert who was in the truck. "Driving by, and someone says someone has a bomb walking down the street." Moments later, Detective Tartis and other officers confronted Mr. James as he was waiting for an elevator in the lobby of 18 Rector Street.
Investigators said they had not determined why Mr. James had chosen the building. It has two entrances and two addresses. The 18 Rector Street entrance is used mostly for Essex County social service and welfare offices, while the other entrance, at 10 Park Place, leads to several Federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, administrative courts and some offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Judge Joel Friedman, who hears Social Security benefits cases there, said the incident stirred thoughts of the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City.
"It crosses my mind," Judge Friedman said. "Now I guess people know we are here, too."
After Mr. James was detained, the police evacuated the building, diverted traffic and brought in police dogs. After sniffing the device that Mr. James had been carrying, both dogs immediately sat down, a signal to investigators that they had detected explosives. The bomb squad then used a water cannon to break the device apart.
Mr. Santiago and other investigators said tests were being conducted to determine the contents of the device and why the police dogs gave a positive response.
The police said they knew little about Mr. James other than that he had served in the United States Marines and had been discharged in the 1980's. They said they would continue to investigate whether he had been involved in other, similar incidents.
Yusuf Salaam, a security guard at O.K. Jewelry, near the spot where Mr. James got off the bus this morning, said that a man had shown him what looked like dynamite and a timer earlier this week. The man talked about a military takeover, he said. "I don't think it was real," Mr. Salaam said. "But maybe it was the same guy."
Neighbors in Irvington described Mr. James as an increasingly troubled man, who was dedicated to his wife and two children but had difficulty holding down a job. Mac Dodson, 52, who has been Mr. James's next-door neighbor for more than a decade, said that he sometimes gave Mr. James a ride to the unemployment office. He said Mr. James was intensely interested in computers but had been growing increasingly frustrated about being out of work. Mr. Dodson said that Mr. James had expressed some frustration with the government and the police but that he had not considered that frustration unusual.
Mr. Dodson said he thought his neighbor had acted not out of aggression but for attention. "I think he did it because he wants to get help," Mr. Dodson said.

Culture Fire Sale

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I would have felt sorry for Chelsea Clinton if I hadn't been so busy feeling sorry for myself.
Each of us, a couple of rows apart, was devoting the afternoon to one of the least fashionable pastimes in this company town -- the theater. The play, "Sweet Bird of Youth," was fast devolving into a farce Tennessee Williams did not intend. Fifteen minutes into the performance a fire alarm sent the cast and audience scrambling into the street. When it was determined that the cause of the alarm was an errant child pulling an alarm-box lever -- a future drama critic? -- we all went back inside to see a star performance (by Elizabeth Ashley) of the sort that's prized only in a city where the acting style is set by filibuster. 
 I wondered: Would the Secret Service agent in the seat in front of me rather be here or under interrogation by Kenneth Starr? Either way, he and the First Daughter were trapped, whereas I was able to exercise my constitutional rights and take a hike at intermission.
The Shakespeare Theater -- the site of "Sweet Bird" -- usually operates at a higher level. As I left the theater I was struck again by its bravery. Situated since 1992 in a redeveloped retail and residential building called the Lansburgh -- after its former occupant, a department store that died not long after the 1968 riots -- it is a flagship enterprise in an effort to revitalize downtown. Yet while the Shakespeare Theater is a critical and popular success, downtown Washington still seems as sleepy as it has been since 1968 -- if not before. Even back in 1951, a guidebook titled "Washington Confidential" described Washington as "Peoria on the Potomac" and said its "Main Drag," F Street, was "an insult" to the whole idea of urbanity: "Any night, Saturday included, the heart of America's heart is dark and quiet."
Though the Lansburgh is near the new MCI Center and such high-culture institutions as the National Portrait Gallery (housing a smartly done exhibit on "Celebrity Caricature in America") and the National Museum of American Art (with a revealing Stuart Davis retrospective), it would take perpetual fire drills at all of them to make the neighborhood pass for a lively urban environment. The abandoned hulks of F Street's other lost department stores, Hecht's and Woodward & Lothrop, still cast long shadows.
That's why the most pertinent cultural event here right now is a tiny, unsung exhibit at the National Building Museum, in the palatial old Pension Building at Fourth and F. Titled "Building Culture Downtown," the show features the architecture of six very new American cultural centers, from Newark's Performing Arts Center to the San Jose Repertory Theater, that represent "new ways of revitalizing the American city."
Will these revitalizations work? It's too early to tell, but some skepticism is called for. Beautiful cultural centers, no matter how architecturally splendid, do not in themselves mandate sophisticated culture: one new building featured in the exhibit, the just-opened Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, is currently hosting one of the aged road tours of "Phantom of the Opera." Nor does culture in itself and in a vacuum necessarily mandate downtown rebirth.
In their new book persuasively arguing for less grandiose, more indigenous urban renewal, "Cities Back From the Edge: New Life for Downtown," Roberta Brandes Gratz and Norman Mintz write that "a collection of visitor attractions does not add up to a city," whether those attractions are cultural centers, convention centers, aquariums, stadiums or enclosed malls. Their words were echoed by the entry of a visitor to the "Building Culture Downtown" exhibit's comment book: "Almost all these structures are built outside the life areas of the cities. They become isolated, dead architectural events. Cities are where the people are."
The fact is that each city has its own genes. What works in New York (where Times Square has been revitalized by the pop culture of Disney, not the high arts) won't work in Detroit. In Washington, there's talk of throwing still another cultural facility -- a National Music Museum -- into a downtown that lacks, among other urban amenities, a single movie theater. It's a chilling irony that one strolls out of this city's "Building Culture Downtown" exhibit into a downtown full of culture and all but devoid of life.

HEADLINE: Navajos Turning Hogans on Reservation Into B & B's

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF 

DATELINE: WINDOW ROCK, Ariz.

 BODY:
A FEW miles across the sagebrush from the Navajo Nation Inn, a standard roadside motel on the Navajo Reservation with wall-to-wall carpeting and remote-control television, lies a different kind of overnight lodge. It is built with pine logs, a red dirt floor and -- as tradition dictates -- a door that faces east toward the sunrise.
Instead of a parking lot outside, there is a sheep pasture and a sandstone canyon that cuts through a wooded plateau. Instead of table lamps and shower, there is a kerosene lantern and a sweat lodge dug a few feet into the parched earth. 
 Some residents here on the nation's largest Indian reservation, a territory as big as West Virginia in the remote Four Corners region, have created a business by transforming and, in many cases, building a traditional Navajo home to lodge tourists.
Called hogans (pronounced HOE-ons in Navajo), the homes are used as part of a cultural tourism package that can include guided hiking tours, storytelling, and lessons in cooking mutton stew on an open fire, for example.
This year, the tribe began encouraging Navajos to develop more of these so-called hogan bed-and-breakfasts by holding workshops and publishing a how-to booklet. The program is intended to stimulate the economy of the reservation by relieving a shortage of motel space and helping Navajos earn money to escape poverty.
"When I heard about the bed-and-breakfast idea I thought, 'I can do that, since I have a hogan and I can do cultural things like cooking and weaving,' " said Lorraine Nelson, a school teacher from near Window Rock, which is 160 miles west of Albuquerque, N.M.
She recently began accommodating tourists in a hogan on her ranch. "My main objective was to do some fund-raising to send my grandchildren to school," she said. "I also wanted my grandchildren to help so that they could learn the traditional ways that I was taught but, these days, are being lost."
On a recent afternoon, Ms. Nelson's hogan was comfortably warm and sturdy as a strong chilly wind whipped down the valley. That morning, a couple from Brazil had left after spending three days hiking among the red rocks, singing with a medicine man and learning Navajo customs.
"I'm beginning on a very small basis," said Ms. Nelson, who is limiting herself for now to a few guests a month during her summer vacation period. "I don't know what I'm getting myself into."
The cost of staying in one of several hogans on the reservation starts at about $70 per night for one person. But guests generally participate in a few activities, which can more than double the price.
By spending the night in a hogan, visitors experience how the Navajos have lived for centuries. Though relatively few Navajos live in hogans today, the structures are still important to the tribe as venues for many traditional religious ceremonies.
Despite encroachment of modernity, hogan building design has changed little over the years. They are built in the round, using cedar or pine logs, with mud and straw as insulation.
Ms. Nelson's is shaped like a tepee, with log poles (some streaked with white corn pollen from a blessing ceremony) that family members cut from the forest and walls made from wood planks. Her family originally built the hogan three years ago for a niece's wedding.
THE interior is luminous from two windows, and spacious with a peaked 15-foot-high ceiling. There is a wood-burning stove, two cots, a stack of mattresses, several chairs and a wood door where in previous times Navajos hung a blanket.
There is no electricity, telephone or running water. For now, the toilet is anywhere outside, though Ms. Nelson is considering building an outhouse.
While Ms. Nelson has had only a few guests so far, Loretta Nez and her husband, Ray Bedonie, a silversmith, have accommodated nearly a dozen since March after building two hogans near the red sandstone buttes of Monument Valley, made famous in several Western films directed by John Ford.
The couple call their business the Country of Many Hogan, and advertise with a brochure and on the Internet.
"The tourist dollars are very attractive out here," Ms. Nez said. "And a lot of people pass through the reservation without having face to face contact with indians."
One of their hogans is built similar to Ms. Nelson's, a style that Navajos refer to as male. The other is built with stacked logs and a domed roof, a design that is called female.
According to Ms. Nez, who works in the Navajo Attorney General's office and takes care of the money matters of the bed-and-breakfast, building a hogan requires months of hard labor. She said that Mr. Bedonie and several family members -- some paid in cash or jewelry -- cut the wood from the forest 300 miles away, shipped the lumber by truck and spent a lot of time shaping the logs and placing them just right.
For the Navajo Department of Tourism in Window Rock, which lists most of the hogans, the effort to create more is critical. This is because economic development is vital on a reservation where the average annual family income is $4,200 and unemployment hovers at 50 percent, according to the tribe.
The department also hopes that more hogans will alleviate crowding at the 12 motels on the reservation, which forces many tourists to spend the night -- and their money -- in towns just beyond the reservation's boundaries. "Each year, we have millions of people coming to our reservation, but they have no place to stay because everything fills," said John Largo, a planner with the tribal tourism department. "Cultural tourism is a big thing nowadays and we have a lot of inquiries from tourists about Navajo culture. They want to be with Indians."
But Mr. Largo cautions Navajos who are considering opening a hogan bed-and-breakfasts against "getting caught up with how much money they can make" and revealing too much of their culture. For example, he said, some traditional stories are supposed to stay just among tribal members or be told only during certain seasons.
"You can give the guests a touch," Mr. Largo said. "You tell them just so much, but you don't go in depth because it's taboo to tell everything."
Technically, reservation businesses like hogan bed-and-breakfasts are supposed to operate under a tribal license and, in certain areas, get approval from neighbors. However, regulation on the reservation is fairly lax and most owners have not bothered to apply for a license.
Whether there is enough demand on the reservation to support more than a dozen hogan bed-and-breakfasts is unknown. But that such businesses can be successful is demonstrated by Will Tsosie, who has operated the Coyote Pass Hospitality bed-and-breakfasts for nearly 15 years.
He welcomes visitors to one of a dozen hogans owned by family members near the town of Tsaile, 50 miles to the north of Window Rock near the Anasazi cliff ruins of Canyon de Chelly National Monument. Most of the guests are foreigners, which Mr. Tsosie takes as a sign that Americans are generally not interested in Indian culture.
Like many of the hogan bed-and-breakfast owners, Mr. Tsosie is selective in the visitors he accommodates. For example, he often rejects potential guests who do not seem interested in learning Indian ways and requires others to read up on the tribe before they arrive.
"You just don't call up and say you want to stay overnight," Mr. Tsosie said. "We take a few minutes by phone and inventory you and ask you questions.
"I determine whether we can be of service to you," he added. "This is not for everyone."

Making an Old I.B.M. Complex a High-Tech Center

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE HUDSON VALLEY as the next Silicon Valley? The area is better known as a recreational and scenic backyard for New York than as a hotbed of technology and entrepreneurship. But the area is also the home of I.B.M., which knows something about silicon, information technology and developing businesses.
Building on the legacy of I.B.M., and with the encouragement of state and local officials who are trying to promote the valley as a magnet for high technology and light manufacturing, a developer is offering as the centerpiece a 2.5 million square foot former I.B.M factory, testing center and office complex. 
 The 28-building complex, located in Ulster County, just west of the city of Kingston, has been renamed Tech City by the developer, Alan Ginsberg..
Closed by I.B.M. in the early 1990's as part of the company's large-scale cost cutting, the site was nevertheless maintained by the company in good condition. Now, Mr. Ginsberg is marketing the site as a place where smaller companies can take advantage of the infrastructure that Big Blue built for itself, as well as low costs and proximity to the metropolitan New York market.
"I.B.M. tested mainframes here in the 60's, 70's and 80's," Mr. Ginsberg said. "This was where I.B.M. engineers would work with their clients to customize the machines. With up to $1 billion in computers undergoing testing here at a time, the main requirement was that you never crash."
To prevent that from happening the company built an electrical power station connected to two separate grids, Consolidated Edison and Niagara Mohawk. This means that even if one of the grids has a blackout or brownout, Tech City can remain operating.
In the buildings that did the mainframe testing the floors and ceilings are dotted with electrical connections needed to supply the power-hungry machines. According to Tech City officials, one building in the complex is equipped to supply 30 watts of power per square foot, while another can provide 50 watts per square foot. This compares with 5 watts per square foot in Manhattan buildings that are considered to be technologically up to date.
Space that is so equipped rents annually for upward of $30 a square foot in Manhattan, Mr. Ginsberg asserts, while Tech City can provide it for high single digits.
Because mainframes converted some of that power into heat as well as computation, large volumes of water were needed to cool the machines internally and the air surrounding them. Once again the sources are redundant. The complex has a contract with the City of Kingston to supply up to 1 million gallons of water a day from the same watershed that feeds New York City. In the event that this source would be interrupted, the center has an eight-inch main connection to the Town of Ulster water system.
Additional water, 250,000 gallons of it, is stored on the site for quick response in firefighting.
Mr. Ginsberg said his company had worked with I.B.M. and Bell Atlantic to upgrade the center's telecommunications capacity to try to attract Wall Street's back-office operations and other operations that handle large amounts of data. A Bell Atlantic office at the edge of the property is crammed with high-capacity fiber and copper lines. There are seven T-3 fiber lines, 56 lesser-capacity T-1 lines on fiber, 50 more T-1 lines on copper and over 4,000 standard phone lines.
Mr. Ginsberg has not attracted anyone from Wall Street yet, but he does have Fleet Bank, which occupies a building that was once home to I.B.M.'s Global Services unit. All New York State income tax forms, as many as 300,000 envelopes a day in mid-April, come to Fleet for initial processing before the forms are scanned and the data is sent electronically to the state tax department.
Tax law played an important part in the purchase of the property, with negotiations stretching over three years. Financing this big a project was so difficult that Mr. Ginsberg divided the complex into 29 tax lots, much like a condominium. Each has its own financing, which is easier to arrange.
Fleet has leased 400,000 square feet, I.B.M. is leasing 200,000 square feet for a warehouse and Hunter Panels, a manufacturer of roofing insulation, recently occupied 168,000 square feet. That leaves about 1.7 million square feet to go.
"We are looking to rent the space to users of 50,000 to 500,000 square feet," he said. If demand for smaller space develops, one or more buildings will be divided into units of 5,000 square feet and above.
ALTHOUGH most of the buildings are connected, small side entrances will be enlarged so that every major tenant will have its own front door, Tech City executives said.
Mr. Ginsberg and others talk about it somewhat delicately, but there is another legacy of I.B.M. they see as an attraction to new technology companies: a big pool of trained workers dismissed by the company during its cutback.
"When I.B.M. imploded from 1990 to 1992, the Hudson Valley lost 13,000 I.B.M. jobs," said Linda Dickerson, president of Mid-Hudson Pattern for Progress, a private planning company. At it peak, the Kingston complex, which was built in the early 1950's to make computers to run an air defense system, employed over 7,000 people in white- and blue-collar jobs.
Many have moved away, of course, but Mr. Ginsberg said local officials had told him that many had stayed in the region, some working multiple jobs or commuting as far as New York City to maintain their lifestyle. The suggestion is that at least some of these people would be more than eager to bring their I.B.M. training to higher-paying jobs in new technology companies.
Ms. Dickerson said Mr. Ginsberg had actively pushed the regional development efforts. "I can't fill up Tech City without making the Hudson Valley a destination," Mr. Ginsberg said. "My competition is Silicon Valley, Route 128 and Research Triangle Park," he said referring to the technology-rich areas of California, Massachusetts and North Carolina.
The Hudson Valley's low costs could be an attraction for high technology workers tired of the high costs of more developed areas, he said. "In Silicon Valley, a $350,000, two-bedroom condo is considered cheap housing. You can get the same thing here for $120,000."
He conceded that the valley was not likely to lure the headquarters of California-based companies, but said he was seeking to attract subsidiary offices and laboratories when the companies consider establishing operations on the East Coast.
With the blessings of the Pataki administration, institutions in the valley are forming partnerships to market the region, rather than specific sites. In the fall of 1996, leaders of business and educational institutions began the formation of what has since become the Hudson Valley R & D Partnership. The partnership offers research and educational services to companies locating in the region.
One of its first successes was an agreement with MiCRUS, an $800 million microchip manufacturing operation that is a joint venture between I.B.M. and Cirrus Logic.
Ms. Dickerson said recent discussions had been held with the region's banks to provide capital for information technology companies thinking of coming into the area.
"We had been seen as New York City's playground and backyard," Ms. Dickerson said. "But we are on our way to becoming an economy as well. We want to be an information technology corridor."
In addition to bestowing its blessings, the state has designated the valley as an economic development zone, which means that substantial economic incentives are available.
Frank Cardinale, Tech City's vice president for government affairs, said that a company that moved into the region, rented 500,000 square feet of space and hired a substantial number of local people could qualify for investment tax credits of up to 19 percent a year. "On an investment of $20 million, that is almost $4 million a year," he said.
The complex is adjacent to a Conrail freight line, but a switch to route cars onto the site had been inactivated while the property was unused. Because Hunter Panels wanted to receive by rail car the chemicals it uses to make insulation, public incentives were used to pay to reactivate the siding and close the deal.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORTS: CO-OP CITY;
More Stores, More Traffic

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
For the nearly 40,000 residents of Co-op City, there's more shopping in the neighborhood than ever. But retail development nearby has created traffic tie-ups for people going in and out of the high-rise community, and with plans for even more development, residents are worried that the congestion will get worse.
"On weekends and evenings it takes me 15 minutes to go two blocks and three lights," said Arthur Taub, the chairman of a Co-op City civic group. Mr. Taub said community leaders had predicted the traffic jams a decade ago when plans were announced for Bay Plaza, a large shopping center just south of Co-op City and north of the intersection of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the New England Thruway. 
 With a multiscreen cinema, a giant supermarket and other stores, Bay Plaza has expanded in recent years to include a Kmart, a Nobody Beats the Wiz and a J. C. Penney. This month, an Old Navy and a Staples opened there. Published reports have said that construction is expected to start next spring on a $100 million enclosed shopping center, to be called the Mall at Bay Plaza, on an adjoining 21-acre site. The mall is to include a Sears, restaurants and 100 smaller shops. Calls to the developer last week were not returned.
Residents say the problem with the retail boom is that the roads have not been altered to handle the extra traffic. Cars on the northbound Thruway at times back up nearly a mile at Exit 11, which serves Co-op City and Bay Plaza.
Delays on local streets are bad, too. Girdled by the two highways and the Hutchinson River, the shopping center and the southern portion of Co-op City have few streets that drivers can use to enter or leave the area. Bartow Avenue, the main east-west route, is often tied up at Baychester and Edson Avenues.
"It's intolerable," said Representative Eliot L. Engel, a longtime resident of Co-op City. Last spring, he said, he secured $1 million in Federal funds to bolster a state study of traffic conditions in the area.
Mr. Engel criticized the Manhattan developer of Bay Plaza, Prestige Properties and Development, and its partner, Shopco Advisory Corporation, for not addressing increased traffic when it expanded the shopping center.
Last year, the city's Economic Development Corporation ended years of negotiations with Prestige and completed a deal to sell it nine acres of land abutting Bay Plaza. Charles Millard, president of the E.D.C., said that for Prestige to add retailers there, it must carry out several traffic improvements, among them widening Bartow Avenue, installing turning lanes and building new entrances. He would not provide a sale figure for the land.
But James Vacca, the district manager of Community Board 10, expressed doubts about the adjustments. "There is no timetable," he said, adding that the developer and the development corporation had discussed such improvements for years. "Meanwhile," he said, "construction continues unabated."

The Latest Asian Miracle: Chaos Without Coups

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
NO one is celebrating the first anniversary of Asia's financial crisis. With most of its economies shrinking, unemployment hitting new highs and recovery perhaps several years away, who would?
Yet in the 12 months since the Thai baht fell against the United States dollar and touched off currency devaluations and a slump in every major East Asian country, at least one of the region's stubborn old ghosts has been exorcised. There have been no military coups. 
 Thailand has led the way there, too. For the first time since the country adopted a parliamentary government 66 years ago, its army has stood by and allowed civilians to handle the economy. Behind the parapets of the elite 11th Army Command's headquarters in Bangkok, soldiers are teaching the jobless to knit and to type.
"The coup d'etat is outdated," said Gen. Chetta Thanajaro, Thailand's commander in chief of the army, in an interview in Bangkok. "The more time passes, the more it is obsolete. My soldiers must stay completely out of politics."
That attitude appears to be widespread, except for Indonesia, where the army played a quiet but important role in forcing former President Suharto from power in may. There have been no ominous ripples in the Philippines or in South Korea, countries where military intervention has been common. The sudden severity of the economic collapse, analysts say, has befuddled the military leaders as much as it has politicians and business executives. Even if Thai or Indonesian armies were predisposed to take power themselves, they might find global currency traders and democratically elected political leaders illusive scapegoats. They would also lack a clear-cut agenda after intervening.
"A decade ago, many of the region's militaries would likely have felt that they had the answers, and that might well have involved them taking over," said Harold Crouch, a military expert at Australia National University. "But these economic troubles are complex, global matters that are well beyond them. So they defer to the technocrats."
That back-seat role has helped politicians enact unpopular reforms, including high interest rates that punish borrowers in the name of monetary stability. Civilian leaders also have slashed military budgets, canceled new weapons purchases and forced military-backed companies to sink or swim in the marketplace. Opposition leaders in both Thailand and South Korea have come to power recently vowing to sever the cozy ties between government and business that have formed under military rule.
Many East Asian militaries -- those of Singapore and Malaysia are notable exceptions -- grew accustomed to aggressive political roles when fighting colonialism and communism. Those in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, which have been hardest hit during the latest economic crisis, once invoked martial control over everything. In the 1960's South Korea's generals designed an economic model centered on heavy industry, and it flourished during the 26 years of army rule that ended in 1987. Indonesia's military retains political and economic powers that rival those of the civilian Government, and has its hands in big business and trade monopolies. In Thailand, generals sit on the boards of many large publicly listed companies, and the military controls a leading bank and several television and radio stations.
Although communist North Korea is still a threat, most of the old enemies in Asia have been vanquished, which has forced the militaries to redefine their roles in a process that the economic crisis has only accelerated, analysts say. The result is a less exalted sense of purpose and a grudging acceptance of the non-political professionalism practiced in American and European militaries.
"The army is being treated as a servant instead of the master," said Panitan Wattanayagorn, a military affairs adviser to the Thai Prime Minister, Chuan Leekpai. "We ask them, 'Why do you need money for this or that?' They don't like it, but they are accepting it."
Few expected the once coup-happy Thai military to be so at ease. Almost as soon as Thailand's currency lost its grip against the dollar last summer, Bangkok filled with rumors of an imminent army takeover. It seemed almost predestined: The military has ousted civilian leaders and assumed power 17 times since 1932, most recently in 1991. Political or economic woes were usually given as the justification.
The military has not only accepted its diminished role, but also supported tough austerity measures. General Chetta said the army has already slimmed its ranks by about 10 percent. "But I could cut up to 30 percent of active troops," he said. "Even 50 percent if the Government needs me to." Similar retrenchment has hit the air force and the navy.
Army generals have marched through public parks in sneakers and sport shirts to lead the "Thai Help Thai" charity campaign. The effort has raised several million dollars by collecting gold and dollars. "We want to instill the feeling of sacrifice and responsibility in the Thai people -- let them know that these are problems they themselves must help solve," General Chetta said.
The Thai army's willingness to play a supporting role is not altruism. The disastrous 1991 coup caused a popular uprising in 1992, which troops brutally suppressed. The army has been struggling to improve its image ever since.
Similar debacles have befallen the South Korean and Filipino armies. In Seoul, two former army generals and Presidents, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, were convicted of murder and corruption charges. Their abuse of power and tolerance of endemic corruption are widely cited as leading to the current economic troubles.
Six coup attempts against Corazon Aquino, the former Philippines President, so embarrassed the military there that few predict it will try again soon. The current democratically elected President, Joseph Estrada, is a former B-movie star who must tackle the country's growing economic woes without any practical experience.
"Almost any recent military intervention you can name was a disaster," Mr. Crouch said. "The idea of army leadership has been discredited."
Still, Thailand's most powerful people do not all wear civvies. General Chetta has gained political clout by forswearing the military option, and he struts proudly on the public stage. Whether receiving the Finance Minister for an economic briefing, or supporting Thailand's new constitution, the general seems to relish a role as peacekeeping elder statesman.
And while General Chetta brushes off questions about his ambitions, his denial is short of Shermanesque. "It is not necessary for me to be a minister," he said, his eyes sparkling and a smile peaking through his stoic expression. "I will serve society however I can."
Army colleagues say the general covets public office. But it is a sign of change in Thailand that he seems determined to win it through the ballot box.

Paris to Peoria: The Runway Extends to the Living Room

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE C. R. WHITE 

 BODY:
IT was as if this were what John Galliano had always had in mind: an ABC-TV prime-time special, which would demand all his creativity to keep millions of Americans enthralled from 9 to 11 P.M. A runway show that could go toe-to-toe with "Seinfeld" reruns.
On Thursday, Mr. Galliano seized his moment. "The World Fashion Premiere From Paris," which featured the haute couture shows of last week, reached its zenith with Mr. Galliano's presentation for Christian Dior. To the throbbing beat typical of a Galliano orchestration, a train, carrying Pocahontas and handsome braves atop its engine, burst through a red scrim, and came to a halt inches from the audience. 
 ABC did an admirable job of bringing the elite haute couture to the masses. But anyone who has sat through a live 30-minute runway show knows that two hours is already too long. The producers, Anne Archer and her husband, Terry Jastrow, distinguished their program by eschewing the fast cutaways, chaotic behind-the-scenes footage and model mania that have become commonplace on cable. For the most part they kept the hammer right where it belonged, on the clothes.
But it is now a general assumption -- one that is close to calcifying into fact -- that fashion cannot stand on its own two feet. Each discourse must be cloaked in pop culture, here in images of Puff Daddy or the Princess of Wales, or in a cutaway shot of a stone-faced Peter Jennings announcing the murder of Gianni Versace a year ago. Travelogues were another unnecessary crutch. Do Americans watching a program on couture really need to know that the Champs-Elysees is the most important street in the world?
More informative would have been an excursion into the workrooms of Lesage, the legendary company that supplies much of the breathtaking embroidery for the couture.
The audience need not be pandered to. As this program proved, fashion represents itself well on its own, thank you, whether it is educating, prescribing or entertaining -- the thrust of "Paris Premiere."
There was far too much naivete in the commentary that accompanied the generous showcasing of designers' work. It was surprising given that the program was written by William Middleton, the former Paris bureau chief for W magazine. Where, for example, was that living legend of a couturier Yves Saint Laurent, as Isabella Rossellini, who was the co-host of the program with Ms. Archer, intoned that Mr. Gaultier was the "most French" of couturiers? Was this a cagey reference to the fact that almost half of the couturiers featured were not French?
The fashion professionals scattered throughout the program to provide commentary might have shed some light had they been asked challenging questions. Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, managed to shine by answering what might be seen as a basic question. Eyebrows across America must have shot up when Ms. Tilberis, when first asked, deemed it unprofessional to comment on her favorite couture shows. Unprofessional? Bad diplomacy, maybe. Boring television, definitely. Eventually, Ms. Tilberis allowed that she thought the best shows were Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel. Here a fashion expert might have noted that career fashion editors must be career diplomats.
A fatuous comment by Ms. Archer was also in need of deflation: "I think they all love to do a Chanel show because they love the clothes," she said, referring to the many supermodels on hand for Chanel. Viewers could probably have seen through that one. Earlier, Ms. Archer had started the puff ball rolling by saying that Donatella Versace's first couture show had gone well, it seemed, because the audience was applauding. Some perspective, please! Fashion audiences always applaud at the end of a show.
Clearly, the camera loved some collections more than others. The work of Mr. Gaultier and Valentino was breathtaking and accessible. And if the camera was lying, it did not matter, because fashion and its colorful personalities benefited from being in America's living rooms.
The program garnered an overnight Nielsen rating of 5.2 and a share of 9, according to ABC. (Each rating point represents 980,000 households.) It did better than programs like the canceled series "Prey" in the same time slot. "Seinfeld," even in reruns, still has nothing to fear.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Computer Associates' Drop Stuns Managers

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
ON Tuesday, Stephen Granoff, an analyst for the John Hancock family of mutual funds, was fairly confident that the stock of Computer Associates International would soon reach a record high.
Buoyed by good earnings prospects, the shares of the company, a giant in business software, had been sailing upward for months, and on Tuesday were trading in the high $50's. 
 But Mr. Granoff, like many investors, was stunned on Wednesday when the stock opened at a distressing $39.50. It had lost 31 percent of its value overnight after company executives warned that the Asian economic crisis was cutting into the earnings of its large multinational customers, which, in turn, would put a six-month brake on Computer Associates' earnings. Despite quarterly earnings that were slightly better than expected, investors fled, apparently alarmed by a warning that raised as many questions as it answered. The stock ended the week at $39.0625.
The selloff struck hardest at mutual funds with big bets on the company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y. Several large fund companies were major holders of Computer Associates stock when they most recently reported their portfolios, most notably John Hancock, Massachusetts Financial Services and Putnam Investments. Fund companies typically report holdings only twice a year, making it hard for investors to know which stocks their funds hold without calling the manager.
At the end of March, Putnam reported holding 38.2 million shares, scattered among a number of funds. If Putnam still holds that many, it has a bigger stake in the company -- 7 percent -- than Computer Associates' chairman, Charles B. Wang, who held 37.6 million shares on July 6, according to the company, including a controversial stock grant it made to him two months ago.
Putnam declined to discuss its interest in Computer Associates stock, as did MFS. But elsewhere, the ranks of big believers may be shrinking. Hancock, which has been a big investor in the company for at least 10 years, decided last week to trim its position slightly, Mr. Granoff said.
"We just weren't comfortable with the uncertainty surrounding the stock," Mr. Granoff said. "There's uncertainty as to who their largest customers are -- it's tough to get the names out of the company.
"And it's also very difficult to determine why they decided to come out with this information right now," he added, referring to the warning about Asia. "We're only three weeks into the new quarter."
And what of the stock grants that Mr. Wang and two other executives received in May -- together worth $1.1 billion at the time -- as a bonus for tripling the company's market capitalization in three years? Lingering investor resentment over the grants may have exacerbated last week's selloff.
But Mr. Granoff played down the resentment. Technology companies commonly hand executives lucrative stock and option packages early on, he pointed out, while Computer Associates postponed the rich reward until after the executives had achieved something specific, getting the stock price to meet or exceed a preset threshold over an extended period.
Still, exactly how the stock made it above the threshold has been the subject of recent speculation. A shareholder lawsuit filed on Thursday contended that the company had been issuing overly rosy statements about trends in its business. A Computer Associates spokesman said the company had no comment on the suit.
On the positive side, one Morgan Stanley analyst, Chuck Phillips, bucked the tide and raised his rating of the stock to "outperform" on Thursday, saying it looked cheap compared with those of competitors.

You, Too, Can Own A Bad Bank Loan

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Wall Street saw a darker strain of trickle-down economics last week as several companies with little to no direct exposure to the Asian malaise warned that their businesses were beginning to suffer.
Exhibit A was Computer Associates. A mere 5 percent of the software company's revenues come from Asian customers. But big multinational clients are not ordering as much of Computer Associates' mainframe software, apparently because the Asian decline is hurting their operations. 
 It is not hard to imagine the trend continuing, funneling down to outfits that depend on Computer Associates or on the spending of its employees -- the company that cleans its office buildings, for instance, or the guys that fix the copy machines, or even the corner coffee bar where employees stop in the morning.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, apparently agrees. "We have yet to see the full effects of the crisis in East Asia on U.S. employment and income," he told Congress last week.
Tucked into Mr. Greenspan's comments was a reprise of a recent Fed warning to banks that the loans they have eagerly been making to businesses could come back to haunt them if the economy slows, whatever the cause.
That problem could funnel down, too. Many banks have shrugged off the Fed's warning because they have unloaded one-quarter or more of their lower-quality loans onto "loan participation funds." Generally, those loans are considered below investment grade, meaning that they have been made to companies whose prospects raise doubts about their ability to repay. Moreover, the loans themselves are illiquid and cannot be resold easily.
But the funds, also known as "floating rate" or "prime rate" funds, have been snapped up by individuals seeking higher yields than those offered by short-term Treasuries or money market funds.
Last month, in the biggest such offering in a decade, Van Kampen American Capital raised $1.6 billion for a new fund that invests almost solely in floating-rate loans -- and, moreover, borrows money to leverage its bets. Most of the big mutual fund companies, like Franklin Templeton, Merrill Lynch, Eaton Vance and Aim, offer similar funds; others, including Fidelity Investments, are considering joining the fray.
The amount of loans held by these funds grew fivefold over the last three years, to $26 billion at the end of the first quarter, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation. Over the same period, the assets in equity mutual funds merely doubled, and the assets in bond funds rose just 25 percent.
Because the funds are not able to turn the loans quickly into cash when investors want to redeem their shares, most of the funds allow investors to withdraw money only periodically, generally once a quarter. In doing so, the funds offer to repurchase a certain number of shares -- say, 5 percent of the fund's total. If more investors want to cash out, too bad; each shareholder gets only a portion of his shares redeemed.
Making illiquid loans to companies with questionable ability to repay is not necessarily the best business to be in when a crisis hits. If the Asian malaise spreads more broadly in the United States, many of the loans held by these funds could turn sour. Panicky investors could have a difficult time getting their money out. And the pain will have trickled all the way down.

Baby, It's Hot Outside for Child Care Companies

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
FINGER paint, macaroni jewelry and circle time are among the fundamental building blocks that fill the days of preschoolers at child care centers.
For investors, a different set of fundamentals make the fragmented $30 billion child care industry an attractive growth sector, some analysts and institutional investors say. Those basics include favorable demographic, economic and political trends and a quickening pace of consolidation. 
 Demand for high-quality child care is booming among dual-income and single-parent families -- a fact that has not escaped the deep-pocketed investors who have recently bought three of the largest for-profit national child-care chains.
The latest deal, in March, was the $82 million buyout of Children's Discovery Center by Knowledge Universe, the privately held education investment empire being assembled by Michael R. Milken, the fallen junk-bond king; his brother Lowell, and Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of the Oracle Corporation.
Last year, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company bought Kindercare Learning Centers for $576 million, and Chase Manhattan acquired La Petite Academy, which had been privately held.
"I've never seen it this active before," said Richard L. Richards, a Chesterfield, Mo.-based broker of child care centers. "All the major chains are looking for acquisitions. The most efficient way to expand is to make a quality acquisition."
As a result, there may be opportunities for investors, particularly with almost the entire second tier of publicly traded child-care companies, trading below their 52-week highs, including New Horizons Kids Quest of Plymouth, Minn.; Childtime Learning Centers of Farmington Hills, Mich., and Bright Horizons of Boston and Corporate Family Solutions of Nashville, which have proposed merging to form the nation's fifth-largest provider, with 250 centers.
Recently, Childcare Network of Columbus, Ga., No. 14 among the for-profit providers, indicated in an S.E.C. filing that it intended to make an initial public offering.
THE child care companies have much room to grow, said Leslie A. Nelken, a managing director of ING Baring Furman Selz who tracks the industry.
"These are companies in their infancy," Mr. Nelken said. National for-profit chains operate only 6 percent of all centers, a share that has not increased since 1975, according to the Child Care Information Exchange, a monthly newsletter. Fewer than one-third of children under school age are now enrolled in organized centers, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
But trends in politics and commerce are working in the industry's favor, Mr. Nelken said. State and local political leaders are increasingly calling for more government spending on child care, especially as efforts to trim welfare rolls are pushing more single mothers into the labor force.
At the same time, the competition among employers for skilled workers is resulting in an expansion of child care benefits in the workplace. More employers will overcome their traditional reluctance to offer on-site child care once they read statistics showing that it reduces employee turnover, said Stephanie R. Leighton, a portfolio manager with Franklin Research in Boston, an asset manager that specializes in stocks of companies it sees as socially responsible.
As a result, Ms. Leighton likes Bright Horizons, whose niche is operating on-site child care centers for corporations.
But corporations without on-site centers are also asking the industry to help reduce worker absences by providing emergency child care -- a practice that is growing faster than on-site care, according to surveys by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultant. Among the largest players in this niche is Children First, a privately held Boston concern whose success is already drawing acquisition offers, said Rosemary Jordano, its president and founder.
A lackluster stock that has nevertheless attracted some institutional buying is Nobel Education Dynamics, a Media, Pa.-based company, which has staked out a niche that does not end with kindergarten; its programs continue through eighth grade.
"We think there is tremendous value that will start showing in the next year," said Edward F. Carroll, portfolio manager of Gintel Asset Management, a mutual fund manager in Greenwich, Conn., which owns 7 percent of Nobel's shares. That makes Gintel the second-largest holder, after Mr. Milken's Knowledge Universe, at 21 percent.
Nobel's stock, which now trades at $8.50, has moved in a narrow range in the last year as the company has spent heavily to hire managers and curriculum advisers for its ambitious expansion and acquisition plans, Mr. Carroll said. He expects Nobel's expansion to gear up this year and predicts that the market will reward his patience.
Some industry executives speculate that Nobel will be acquired by Knowledge Universe, based in Burlingame, Calif., at the end of a six-month stand-still agreement that began on June 2.
Mr. Nelken of Furman Selz is bullish on Nobel, as he is on Childtime, which now trades at $20.125. Both are good values because their share prices don't fully reflect earnings from recent acquisitions, Mr. Nelkin said.
Mr. Richards, the broker, said each niche in the child-care industry presented its own risks. Operators of conventional neighborhood centers, for example, avoid the insecurity of dealing with corporate clients that can terminate a contract more or less at will, he said. But it can be difficult and expensive to obtain suitable sites for new centers that can handle up to 150 children, pushing expansion into distant suburbs or unconventional properties. (The privately held Mulberry Child Care Center chain recently converted a former water pumping station in Boston.)
"The more difficult it is to build, the more likely it will take deep pockets to risk expansion," Mr. Richards said.

Buying Cheap in Asia, Betting on Recovery

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
THESE days, when a money manager tells an investment conference that he has almost half his portfolio in Asian stocks, his listeners are apt to snap to attention. Asian markets have been a minefield since the currency crisis began last summer. The market indexes for the region, excluding Japan, have fallen an average of 44.9 percent for the past year, and many investors are keeping their money elsewhere.
Thus, Mark H. Madden, manager of Pioneer Emerging Markets, commanded notice last month when he told a Morningstar Mutual Fund Conference in Chicago that 49 percent of his $175 million portfolio was allocated to Asian stocks. For most of the last three years, Mr. Madden has compiled an impressive record making big bets on these markets: At the end of 1997, his fund was ranked in the top 20 percent of all emerging-markets funds for each of the three previous years, with an average annual return of 9.86 percent, according to Morningstar. So far this year, the fund has fallen 11.4 percent. But that is still better than the 12.15 percent average decline for emerging-markets funds. 
 A prime reason for this year's tumble is that Mr. Madden has built up his position in Asia as the markets have continued to sell off. The fund's position in Asia is nearly double the 26 percent stake of the average fund in its peer group.
"We look to exploit political and economic crises in emerging markets," said Mr. Madden, who considers himself a value investor with a contrarian streak. "We buy cheap, and then we wait until the political situation turns positive or the economy recovers."
Another panelist at the conference, Joyce Cornell, lead manager of Scudder Emerging Markets Growth, expressed the more conventional view of the region, saying: "We feel the problems are deeply structural. Asia will survive, but the downturn is in no way over." Only 3 percent of her fund's holdings are in Asia.
Mr. Madden agrees that Asian economies are likely to be "flat on their backs" for the next two to three years, but based on research he conducted with colleagues at Pioneering Management in Boston, he contends that there is money to be made in such situations.
Mr. Madden studied 22 selloffs in individual emerging markets between 1981 and 1997. He found that once investors became convinced that a market had hit bottom, its stocks, often thinly traded, could move up rapidly as money began flowing back in and as investors who bet against the market were forced to cover those bets. He found that gains in this initial "confidence rally" averaged 93 percent. Markets then tended to consolidate and resumed rising once it became clear that the economy was rebounding or that a political crisis had passed. Gains averaged 251 percent in the 24 months after a bottom.
Mr. Madden expects Asian markets to hit bottom in the next six months, allowing him to begin selling into a confidence rally. "If we can continue to accumulate stock in Asia, we'll make a lot of money over the next three years," he said.
MR. MADDEN has played a deft hand in this game before. Early last year, while visiting Thailand, he became concerned about the combination of a strong currency, slowing exports, a growing current account deficit and a squeeze on corporate profit margins. He then pulled money out of Asia, reallocating large stakes to Brazil and Mexico, where the economies were beginning to grow again, and to Israel. Those markets rallied last year, while Asia's plunged.
Two years before that, he moved boldly into Mexico, where the market had bottomed after devaluation of the peso, and he sold out before the market faltered again in late 1995.
"My job is to constantly be repositioning the fund in countries and stocks that have substantial upside and minimal downside," Mr. Madden said. "When a market plunges 70 percent, the upside is much greater than the downside over the next 18 to 24 months.
"We almost seek out areas of high perceived risk. If we've analyzed the situation properly, when that risk premium declines, we profit."
Mr. Madden's approach certainly entails risk, said Bill Rocco, an analyst at Morningstar Mutual Funds. The Asian crisis could last longer than Mr. Madden expects, or he could dart into the wrong country at the wrong time, but, so far, he apparently has not done so. "It's too short a time horizon to judge his move into Asia," Mr. Rocco said. "Past history suggests he'll be right over time."
When Mr. Madden considers moving into a battered market, he looks first at government policy to see if steps have been taken to return the economy to solid footing. Generally, those include raising interest rates and devaluing the currency. Ultimately, he said, such painful medicine brings capital back and makes exports more competitive.
Most recently, he has been buying in South Korea and Thailand where, he said, governments are moving to recapitalize their economies. In April, he bought preferred stock of Samsung Display Devices of Korea, which makes color monitors and liquid-crystal displays for computers. The majority of its sales are overseas, and it has a solid balance sheet. It is selling at 2.2 times its 1998 earnings, a 10-year low.
Early this year, he bought K. R. Precision, a Thai maker of suspensions for hard-disk drives; its customers include Seagate Technology. In dollars, the stock is off 90 percent from its June 1997 high and is trading at three times 1998 earnings.
In June, he picked up Siam City Cement of Thailand. It costs $110 to $130 per ton of capacity to build a cement plant these days, Mr. Madden said, but the company's stock is trading at $40 per ton of capacity. "It really is the buying opportunity of a decade," he said.
Mr. Madden expects that his picks, which are traded only on foreign exchanges, will rise 150 percent to 300 percent over the next 18 months. "Five years down the road, people will look back and say, 'Gee, I should have bought in '98,' " he said.

Templeton Likes Prospects for Asia

BYLINE: By KALYANI VITTALA 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
WHILE many investors have reacted to the Asian financial crisis by moving their money to the high ground of Wall Street, money managers at the Franklin Templeton Group are thinking in the opposite way.
"We're very optimistic about the world, though not about America," said Mark Holowesko, lead portfolio manager for the Templeton Growth fund, as he outlined the the group's overall investment strategy on Thursday at the fund's 44th annual shareholder's meeting here. 
 Most funds' investors rarely get a chance to meet their managers face-to-face -- especially when world markets are in such turmoil. Some 2,500 shareholders took advantage of the opportunity at Templeton.
J. Mark Mobius, portfolio manager of the Templeton Developing Markets funds, who addressed the meeting via a fiber-optic link from Vancouver, said in response to a shareholder's question about investing in Asia: "After the peso crashed in '94, I told my sister-in-law to invest" in Mexico, "and she slammed the door in my face. Now I'm going to tell her the same thing about Asia."
Templeton Growth, founded in Canada in 1954, now has about $7 billion in net assets under management and has investments in 34 countries. In the United States, Templeton Growth I, has assets of $14.02 billion and has had a five-year annualized return of 15.59 percent, outperforming the average world stock fund by a half-percentage point, according to Morningstar Inc., but its return this year, through Thursday, has been only 4.23 percent, trailing its peers' 15.64 percent.
It still follows the investment strategy laid out by its founder, Sir John Templeton of Nassau, the Bahamas, of buying stocks at bargain-basement prices and hanging on to them for the long-term gain. His company merged with Franklin Resources of San Mateo, Calif., in 1992, forming Franklin Templeton, which now manages $235 billion for 5.30 million investors worldwide.
IN an interview before the meeting, Mr. Holowesko cited "extremes of valuation" between overvalued and undervalued companies in emerging markets. "It is huge and represents a phenomenal opportunity if you are willing to take a five-year view of investment," he said, adding that "value managers love volatility; investors don't."
Donald F. Reed, portfolio manager of the Templeton International Stock fund, agreed, saying, "Because of the situation in Asia, a lot of the markets have become basket cases, and it is our job to identify the survivors." Templeton fund managers say there are strong companies with low stock prices that will rebound in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Korea, but they declined to identify their new picks.
Once the conditions in those countries have stabilized, the devaluation of their currencies will bring in foreign exchange and the bear markets will eventually pass, Mr. Mobius predicted. "But if we anticipate a recovery in Asia," he said, "then we can expect the markets to anticipate a recovery as well."
That was the strategy the group used in Latin America after the peso fell in 1994, Mr. Mobius said, and their Latin American investments gave huge returns last year, although they have suffered this year as the Asian crises have made investors wary of emerging markets in general.
In contrast, Mr. Holowesko is becoming wary of the American markets. They are so overvalued, he said, that "it's difficult to find cheap stocks in the United States." It is time to unload some long-term American holdings, he added.
The group largely pulled out of Japan in 1987 when that market was overvalued. It now has just over 1 percent of its portfolio in the country -- in companies including Sony, Hitachi and Makita -- and now hopes to invest more there. "We're looking for ideas in Japan and finding some, mostly in the smaller companies," Mr. Holowesko said.

Women Entrepreneurs Attract New Financing

BYLINE: By NOELLE KNOX 

 BODY:
CELESTE M. JOHNSON had a dream of making gardening and landscaping products out of mixed recycled plastics. Raising the capital, however, has been a nightmare.
There was that meeting three years ago with consultants hired by Connecticut to advise start-up businesses. "They actually said to me that what I needed was a man in a white shirt sitting behind that desk because it's a factory and they needed a man to run a factory," she recalled. 
 Her company, Obex Inc., based in Stamford, Conn., has scraped by since 1990, making garden trellises, compost bins and a golf game for children. And despite her ability to get contracts with the Burpee Seed catalogue and 14 Home Depot stores in the New York area, Ms. Johnson, 44 -- formerly a business manager for Pitney Bowes Inc. and a securities analyst for Salomon Brothers -- has had little luck raising the $500,000 to $1 million that she needs to expand.
Welcome to the life of a woman entrepreneur. Despite the fact that women started businesses at twice the rate of men last year, they received just 2 percent of the institutional venture capital money, according to Women's Growth Capital Fund, a small venture capital firm in Washington.
And while women own more than 36 percent of the businesses in the country, they received just 22 percent of small-business loans. These numbers persist even though it has been illegal since the mid-1970's for lenders to discriminate on the basis of sex.
But what had been a glacial shift to parity may be picking up speed -- in part because, however gimmicky some might find it, a growing number of lenders and investors see women entrepreneurs as a market hitting its stride.
Last week, the Small Business Administration added six centers across the country to its Women's Business Center Program. And last month, a new venture capital firm in San Francisco and a new lender in Tennessee, both owned by women, started making loans and equity capital to other women-owned companies. At the same time, the BankBoston Corporation, joining other major lenders, began a loan program for women entrepreneurs.
Government programs have long been a haven for women-owned businesses. But private investors and lenders say their growing interest means just one thing: there's money to be made.
"Women-owned business is the largest emerging segment of the small-business market," said Teresa L. Cavanagh, director of the Woman Entrepreneurs' Connection at BankBoston. "Women-owned businesses are an economic force that no bank can afford to overlook."
As women have entered high-growth industries in the last five years, the financial picture has started to change markedly. The percentage of women who financed their businesses with their credit cards fell to 23 percent in 1996 from 52 percent in 1992, the most recent years for which data are available, according to the National Federation of Women Business Owners. Over the same period, the percentage of women who use business earnings to finance their growth rose to 72 percent from 38 percent.
Bank loans, however, were a declining source of capital, the study showed. Two years ago, 20 percent of women business owners relied on commercial or business loans, compared with 26 percent in 1992.
MORE of today's women entrepreneurs have already climbed the corporate ladder and have solid management or technical experience. These women are not content to run boutiques as tax write-offs for their husbands; they are starting companies in the Internet, computer software and health care industries.
Katrina Garnett, 36, wanted to make integration software, which helps programs from different manufacturers run together. So, in 1996, she cashed out a total of $500,000 in stock options from Sybase, where she was a vice president and general manager, and from Oracle, where she had been a manager, and founded Crossworlds Software Inc. in Burlingame, Calif.
Ms. Garnett and her husband, Terence, a venture capitalist, put in another $5 million. Then, using her connections in the computer industry, she raised $45 million from corporations like Intel and Compaq, in exchange for equity stakes.
Recently, Ms. Garnett made waves by running a company ad in business and consumer magazines in which she posed in a low-cut, black cocktail dress. Lost in the debate about the ad was Ms. Garnett's achievements as a businesswoman. Today, Crossworlds has 200 employees and is expected to go public next year.
"Everybody that's invested already knew me personally," Ms. Garnett said. "I couldn't have raised this without prior relationships and track records with these people.
"I don't know why more women don't tap that," she said. "You're not dealing with venture capitalists, who are 98 percent men and who don't have a good track record investing with women."
Indeed, to Patty Abramson, managing partner of the Women's Growth Capital Fund, which has $30 million under management, "venture capitalists are a classic old-boy network.
"Women don't have the contacts," she said. "They're not playing golf with these guys."
Not all women agree with that stereotype. In 1995 Laila J. Rubenstein, a former consultant in emerging technologies, started Greeting-Cards.com Inc. with her husband, Eugene. The New York company sells customized E-mail cards with music and animation over the Internet. Its sales have grown tenfold each of the last three years.
Last year, Ms. Rubenstein, 32, was turned down by 10 venture capital firms as she tried to raise $5 million in exchange for a 20 percent equity stake. But with the current fever over Internet stocks, she is ready to start knocking on doors again.
"I don't think being a woman stops me at the door," said Ms. Rubenstein, who is the company's chief executive. "No matter how you look, if you show them you can make money, and take the next step, I don't think they care that you're a woman."
Still, the Small Business Administration is doing more to make venture capital accessible to women. Last month, the agency designated Ms. Abramson's firm as a small-business investment corporation, which means that for every $1 she raises, the agency will give the firm $2 for investing.
The agency also granted the special capital-raising status to two new firms: Aurora, a $25 million venture capital firm in San Francisco, will focus on women-owned businesses in technology, communications and health care. Capital Across America, a lender in Tennessee, has $24 million in loans for women entrepreneurs in all fields.
Aida Alvarez, administrator for the S.B.A., has set an ambitious 18-month target to close the gap between the 22 percent of loans to women entrepreneurs and the 36 percent ownership of all businesses.
Ms. Alvarez dismisses the suggestion that women do not need special assistance.
"They have a harder time, and we still view them as a group that we have to make an extra effort to reach out to," she said.
Big banks are also making a stronger push to reach women entrepreneurs. In forming its women's banking division, BankBoston was following recent moves by Chase Manhattan, Nationsbank and First Union. BankBoston allocated $100 million for loans to women-owned businesses and said it would also provide counseling, access to information and advocacy for those businesses on the local and national levels.
EVEN as the money begins to hunt for the women-owned businesses with the biggest possible returns, many small companies still face a grind in qualifying for loans.
Carol Abizaid, who started the Abizaid Arts dance studio in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood last year, got a $50,000 revolving line of credit from Chase Manhattan Bank only after an investor agreed to be a co-signer. The Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, a government agency that lends to New York City businesses, lent Ms. Abizaid another $50,000.
Ms. Abizaid scraped together $25,000 of her own money and then charged about $60,000 on her credit cards, which she paid off by selling her apartment. Angel investors chipped in a total of $353,000.
Open almost a year, Abizaid Arts still needs $28,000 to cover the operating deficit, and Ms. Abizaid is running out of places to look. She doesn't want any more debt, and as for venture capital firms, she said, "I don't think it would be worth their while."
While there may be early signs that more money is flowing to women entrepreneurs, it may be 5 to 10 years before the trend is clear, Ms. Abramson said.
"When some of these companies do well, and you see a bunch of women C.E.O.'s of publicly owned companies," she said, "venture capitalists and lenders are going to take a look at them."

Good Times Are Bad For Interest Groups

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the past few years the Federal Government and private researchers have issued a number of reports depicting dramatic improvement in the quality of life for America's black population. High school completion rates have reached parity with those of whites. Birth rates among single black women have hit a 40-year low. Homicide rates have declined to the levels of the 1960's. Poverty rates have dipped below 30 percent of black households for the first time in the country's history. The home ownership rate is up. The jobless rate is down.
Somebody tell Julian Bond. 
 In his recent keynote address at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Mr. Bond, the group's chairman, sketched a portrait of black America wildly at odds with the research. "For those Americans whose skins are black or brown, their prospects are poorer and the gap is growing wider," he said. "The poverty rate has gone up while median family income went down. Poverty for black and Hispanic senior citizens went up, children who were poor got poorer, the numbers in poverty doubling, higher here than anywhere else."
Mr. Bond is not alone. From both the left and right of the political spectrum come dark assessments and dire warnings from advocacy groups about the current racial, moral, financial or social climate even as the country enjoys peace and prosperity and is arguably less sexist, less racist, less dangerous and less polluted than it has been in decades -- and perhaps, ever. The distance between dispassionate analysis and the advocates' oratory raises the question: How do groups that see their mission as correcting injustice handle good times?
"Most advocacy groups exist to deal with problems," said Charles O. Jones, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin. "That's what they're designed for. That's how they raise money. If the problems start to abate, they have a hell of a time in energizing their folks, in raising money and in trying to set policy."
Most advocacy groups -- from Greenpeace to the National Right to Life Committee -- depend on grass-roots support and are highly dependent on direct mail campaigns, raising money in bite-sized morsels from individuals rather than drawing large chunks of corporate dollars. To get the former, groups need to scare or anger potential donors. "There are two kinds of money," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative anti-tax organization. "There's sophisticated giving and there's emotional giving where you get $50 checks from people who say, 'Oh my goodness, aren't things terrible!' "
 
Sense of Urgency
Many advocacy groups also feel that without their voices the momentum of improvement might slow. "We've had five years of declines in teen birth rates, so we're always alert for signs of complacency," said Sarah Brown, director of the Campaign to End Teen Pregnancy. "I haven't seen any signs yet. But just on the off chance that the idea might flutter through someone's mind, we nail it right away."
Ms. Brown and her counterparts see a sense of urgency even in boom times. After all, they say, the income and wealth gap between whites and blacks and Hispanics has not evaporated. Teen-age pregnancy rates, though falling sharply, are still the highest in the industrial world. Millions of Americans have no health insurance. Taxes, especially the Social Security payroll tax, remain high and, some say, unfair. Given that more than 80,000 complaints pour annually into the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, no one will persuade civil rights advocates that discrimination has disappeared.
"In many ways it's the classic argument over whether the glass is half full or half empty," Mr. Bond said in an interview. "For us, it's half empty and we're determined to fill it."
But in pointing out problems these days the trick is not to come off as a kvetch. "The challenge for the advocacy groups is to raise alarms without doing so in a way that people just shrug their shoulders and say, are we living on the same planet?" said William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine.
Some critics of the doom-and-gloom philosophy also say that much of today's good news stems from specific government policies favored by advocacy groups, which later complain that things aren't improving fast enough. For these groups to continue to complain is to risk having their own cherished programs attacked as ineffective.
 
Wide Eyes
Gregg Easterbrook, whose book, "A Moment on the Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism" (Viking, 1995), angered many environmental groups by trumpeting the dramatic improvement in the world's ecology over the last 25 years, said, "I think the greatest argument for progressive government in my generation is the success of pollution controls."
The current political climate also adds to the sometimes shrill rhetoric of advocacy groups. With both political parties capturing institutions that had long been outside their grasp -- the White House for Democrats, the Congress for Republicans -- groups have felt it time to land even bigger fish. "When your team is winning, you ratchet up what you want," Mr. Norquist said.
Yet even as advocacy groups have raised the sights, the political system they lobby has barely responded. With divided government, a razor-slim Republican majority in the House and a generally satisfied electorate, Washington has responded with tinkering, rather than with the bold actions cried out for by the advocacy groups. "If you believe in a liberal or conservative agenda, you've got to have been disappointed in the past few years," Mr. Kristol said.
Disappointed though they may be, it is doubtful that advocacy groups will lower their voices. With the country's self-satisfaction expected to hold down voter turnout in midterm elections this fall, the influence of groups that can energize their core supporters may only grow. No one should expect sweetness and light any time soon.

Forget Microsoft. G.M. Is Still the Biggest Kid on the Block.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich.

 BODY:
TO appreciate the size of General Motors, consider this: If the Microsoft Corporation were a G.M. auto parts division, William H. Gates would be just another G.M. vice president that nobody has ever heard of.
A quarter-century of shrinking market share and periodic financial crises at G.M. have fed a popular image of the auto maker as a shadow of its former self. Yet G.M. remains the world's largest company in sales and share of global economic output, and is immense by any standard. Growth in the entire American economy has been slowed substantially by eight-week-old strikes here that have paralyzed the auto maker's North American operations. 
 In 1970, before rising gasoline prices and increased imports of Japanese cars began to take a toll, G.M.'s operations in the United States accounted for 2.3 percent of the nation's economic output, according to the Commerce Department. Last year, G.M. still produced about 1.5 percent of the nation's goods and services, dwarfing every other company except Ford, with about 1.2 percent. Microsoft, by comparison, accounted for about 0.1 percent.
G.M.'s North American automotive assembly and marketing division alone still has roughly the same annual revenues as the worldwide operations of all American passenger airlines combined.
Nonetheless, Microsoft has replaced G.M. as the titan that sometimes seems to tower over American industry. Computer software has replaced the car as the American product that captures the public's imagination here and around the world. Antitrust regulators now ignore G.M., with its 31 percent share of the American car market, and have sued Microsoft, challenging its 90 percent share of the much smaller market for operating software that makes computers run.
Microsoft's share price has also soared, seizing the attention of a public in love with the stock market. G.M.'s stock, on the other hand, has only recently returned to its price in the mid-1960's -- and has plunged if inflation is included. The combined value of Microsoft's shares is now nearly six times the value of G.M.'s shares. Yet G.M.'s 1997 revenue of $178 billion was 15 times greater than Microsoft's.
The stock market is captivated these days not by a company's size but by its expected future earnings. Trapped in a fiercely competitive market and fettered by expensive union contracts and costly strikes, G.M. seems less attractive than Microsoft, which faces little effective competition and little risk of strikes.
But a company's contribution to the economy is not determined by its share price. A country's economic output is calculated from total sales to the final users of goods and products. Microsoft's sales are tiny compared with those of G.M. because its most popular programs sell for about $90 apiece, while G.M.'s cars and light trucks sell for an average of $20,000 each.
Some companies have tried to argue that they play a greater role in the economy than their sales might suggest. Software companies contend that their products improve the productivity of millions of Americans. The United Parcel Service claimed during a strike last year that every day it delivered packages with a value equal to nearly 6 percent of the nation's daily economic output.
G.M. executives, living in a state where the auto industry's preeminence is taken for granted, do not even bother pointing out that cars and trucks also play a role in moving people and goods around. Having typically worked all their lives for a company that has led the world in sales through much of its 90-year history, the executives simply shrug and smile when other companies brag about their size.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "A Global Colossus That Is Richer Than Most Nations"
A troubled giant in an industry that has lost some of its glamour, General Motors receives less public attention than many smaller companies. Yet it remains the world's largest company in sales and share of global economic output. When strikes shut down its North American operations, as has happened for the past month, the entire American economy feels the blow. Graph shows the following: revenues of the world's biggest corporations and six other selected companies, with their global rank and number of employees, in 1997; G.M.'s revenue and the gross domestics product of 10 nations, ranked globally in 1997; the total value of the stock of the world's most valuable companies, as of Thursday; annual revenue of Microsoft and of several G.M. divisions.

HEADLINE: Famine: The Man-Made Disaster

 BODY:
The pictures from the Sudan are heartbreakingly familiar -- the sunken cheeks and spindly legs of famine, which could kill half a million people this year. In the past few years the world has improved its ability to spot famine and feed the starving. But in the Sudan and North Korea those efforts are not enough to prevent widespread death from hunger and its related diseases.
Nature causes floods and droughts, but most societies have found ways to get food to those afflicted most of the time. Human folly causes famine, which occurs when those ways are blocked. Amartya Sen, a Harvard economist, argued that there has never been a serious famine in a country -- even an impoverished one -- with a democratic government and a free press. The press acts as a warning system and the pressures of democracy dissuade rulers from famine-producing policies.
Both North Korea and the Sudan are suffering famine because devastating policies compounded natural disaster. North Korea's Stalinist regime at first refused to ask for help, and until recently would not accept donors' demands that food shipments be tracked. In the Sudan, the main culprit is a 15-year civil war. People must flee their farms and marauders loot stores of seed and burn crops. 
 Politics has also complicated the world's response. South Korea discouraged countries from giving food to the North. A new Government in South Korea has now stopped using food as a weapon. A consortium of United Nations-led groups has been flying food into the Sudan since 1989. But it underestimated this year's emergency, which worsened as the war intensified and Khartoum imposed a ban on food flights last spring.
Even the U.N.'s reduced appeal for help was only half-met, although more money has been raised with recent publicity. Food, however, must move through the Kenyan port of Mombasa and be trucked to an airfield to be flown to the Sudan, an expensive process hindered by floods and a truckers' strike. Earlier this month the warring sides agreed to a three-month cease-fire to allow food to come in.
The world's capacity to respond to famine has greatly improved in the last decade. Nineteen countries that received American emergency food this year have no famine. Prediction is more accurate with monitoring systems at the U.N. and the American Agency for International Development that use satellite data and commodity prices. But by the time donors are sure enough to begin aid, it can be too late. Large shipments from the United States to Africa take four to six months, mostly due to requirements that food come from American commodity surpluses and travel mainly on American ships. European Union aid, which can be bought near the emergency site, is quicker and cheaper.
Preventing famine requires more flexibility and planning. The failure to get corn seed into the Sudan in time for a July planting, for example, means the next harvest will also fail. Washington is experimenting with keeping foodstuffs stored in silos in the Philippines or Tanzania, which cuts two or three months off response time. In some cases, Washington can authorize private relief groups to buy a small amount of food near the emergency. These programs should be expanded.
The key to renewing the world's commitment to food aid is to accompany necessary food with programs that help countries become more self-sufficient, from small-scale farming projects to more rational economic policies, which are now helping raise food production in Africa. But in many cases of famine, the world's best investment is in peace negotiations.

EARNINGS
 
Bad Day at Boeing
The Boeing Company, hurt by production difficulties, the costs of its acquisition of McDonnell Douglas and payment problems with its Asian customers, reported earnings that shocked Wall Street and sent its shares 13 percent lower. Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, also said results for the rest of 1998 and for 1999 would be about 40 percent below Wall Street estimates. For the second quarter, earnings fell 46 percent, to $258 million, or 26 cents a diluted share, from $476 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. The average forecast was 33 cents a share. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $13.4 billion from $12.3 billion. Investors dumped the stock, and it fell $6.5625, to $41.1875, on Thursday, with more than 28 million shares traded. 

STOCKS
 
Bleak Week on Wall Street
Boeing, in fact, led Thursday's free fall in stocks, and accounted for 27.8 points of the day's rout of the Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 195.93 points, or 2.15 percent, to 8,932,98. Coming on top of smaller but significant drops in the three previous sessions, it was the Dow's third-largest drop this year and its first close below 9,000 since June 30. The blue-chip measure ended the week with a gain/loss of TK, to TK, more than TK points from its high of 9,337.97 at the end of the previous week. Boeing, though, is just one of a diverse group of companies, including Merck, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and DuPont, that have cautioned investors that earnings in the second half could falter, in part because of the economic crisis in Asia. Investors were also rattled by two days of Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who reiterated that inflation was still the central bank's biggest concern and warned that the Asian crisis was far from over.

BASEBALL
 
Star Power in St. Louis
Just look at the National League standings: the St. Louis Cardinals seem to be mired in mediocrity. With the baseball season nearly two-thirds completed, the Cardinals are barely managing to stay close to the .500 won-lost mark and are bringing up the rear of the Central Division. So is it lonely at the middle? Not in St. Louis, where the marketing clout of Mark McGwire's assault on Roger Maris's 37-year-old record of 61 home runs in a season is packing fans into Busch Stadium at a pace 17 percent ahead of last year. After 49 games at Busch, the Cardinals had the fifth-highest home attendance in the National League, and Mr. McGwire's drawing power was also pulling in an average of more than 33,000 fans on the road. The New York Yankees, meanwhile, were only 14 percent above last year's home attendance. While New York has by far the best record in baseball -- playing at a better than .700 clip -- and has led the American League's East Division for much of the season. it has no star home run attraction this year.
 
WALL STREET
 
Judgement on Jett
In the early 1990's, Joseph Jett was an impressive bond trader at Kidder, Peabody & Company, earning millions of dollars in bonuses and generating hundreds of millions of dollars in business. But in April 1994, Mr. Jett was dismissed by Kidder, which accused him of manufacturing $339 million of fictitious profits to hide trading losses and earn those large bonuses. On Tuesday, two years after an administrative court hearing, Mr. Jett was ordered to repay $8.2 million of bonuses, fined $200,000 and barred from the securities industry. In the first extensive review of the case, Carol Fox Foelak, an administrative law judge at the Securities and Exchange Commission, found that Mr. Jett had kept false books and records; she did not, however, find him guilty of securities fraud, ruling that his phony transactions did not involve the actual trading of real securities, so they could not constitute securities fraud. Mr. Jett plans to appeal the ruling, In an interview a day after the finding, Mr. Jett, who is black, proclaimed his innocence and strongly suggested that racism had added to his troubles.
 
SURPLUS
 
A Split Over Tax Cuts
Republican leaders in the Senate decided not to push for a big tax cut this year, widening a split within the party. The move by the leadership infuriated the party's conservative tax-cutting wing, especially those House Republicans who have been pushing for a cut of historic proportions as the fiscal health of the United States improves. Party aides said the Senate leaders saw no possibility of passing a big cut because they probably could not muster the votes required. The aides said that waging a symbolic battle with Congressional Democrats and the White House would have risked the likelihood that President Clinton would accuse Republicans of endangering Social Security's long-term health in order to give tax benefits to the rich. Nevertheless, House Republicans said they were intent on following through with plans to vote in September on a tax cut of as much as $700 billion over the next decade.
 
AUTOS
 
New Headache for G.M.
As an arbitrator is trying to sort out General Motors' claim that the United Automobile Workers union is violating a national contract by carrying out strikes -- now seven weeks old -- at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., the company is having other labor troubles -- and on an unexpected front. Workers at its Saturn division plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., once a model of cooperation between workers and management, authorized a strike to protest the company's moves this spring to buy more parts from outside suppliers. The Saturn factory is the only G.M. plant in the United States still producing vehicles; the others have been forced to shut down because of a lack of parts.
 
TECHNOLOGY
 
Microsoft's Rosy Blueprint
Microsoft executives outlined plans to increase R & D outlays to $3 billion from $2.5 billion a year and to add $200 million a year for technical support and customer service. But even as the executives in Washington State painted a bright picture for Microsoft and for the computer and software industries over all, the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, D.C., was hearing complaints from executives of competing software companies that Microsoft uses predatory marketing practices to squelch competition. At a time when the company's business practices are under attack by the Justice Department, several Congressional committees and 20 states and the District of Columbia -- and are under investigation by European governments, too -- Microsoft executives gave no indication of abandoning their aggressive strategies.
 
TIMES SQUARE
 
Adding Up the Losses
The long-term costs are becoming clearer after the collapse of a construction elevator tower at the Conde Nast construction site in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday. At least 600 people were left homeless, and many local businesses and some Broadway productions had to shut down. City officials hoped to reopen Broadway and some other streets in the Times Square area to vehicles and pedestrians over the weekend.

HEADLINE: For Every Puerto Rican, a Political Rally

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: GUANICA, P.R., July 25

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans came to this coastal town today, some to celebrate, others to condemn the landing of American troops here 100 years ago, while thousands more traveled to a historic fortress in San Juan to pay homage to the political status that has defined Puerto Rico's relationship to the United States for nearly half a century.
"Some Puerto Ricans greatly anticipated the arrival of U.S. troops, thinking they would liberate us from Spain and help us be free like Cuba," said Hector Zapata, a school teacher in Guanica who is the head of a town group collecting oral histories of the invasion passed down to residents from their ancestors. "Others were far more reserved, thinking that we would stay a colony with the same conditions but under a new power." 
 "And that's the way it is with us today," Mr. Zapata added. "It's the same situation as 100 years ago."
While Puerto Ricans remain deeply divided over which political course to take, everybody on the island had something to do today, regardless of whether they support the current commonwealth status, statehood or independence.
The pro-statehood administration of Gov. Pedro J. Rossello held a $400,000 celebration called "100 years of Progress and Union" in a park here. The event featured political speeches and entertainers.
The crowd at the rally included Elena Acosta, 48, of Juanadiaz. "I support statehood for progress for our grandchildren," she said. "I am here in Guanica to celebrate the Americans rescuing us from the Spanish 100 years ago."
At the same time, a coalition of pro-independence groups carried on a tradition begun in 1928 by Pedro Albizu Campos, the fiery founder of the Nationalist Party, of traveling each year to the harbor of this town to protest the invasion of United States troops after the Spanish-American War in 1898.
While a group of independentistas made the annual trek each year after the death of Mr. Albizu Campos in 1965, thousands of independence supporters showed up today.
"It's important for people in the United States to know that people here are still struggling for independence," said Marilyn Perez, 37, from Aguas Buenas, a mountain town outside San Juan, who camped overnight with her husband and two children.
The Puerto Rican Independence Party also gave a party, with protest singers and Puerto Rican rock groups performing on a stage set up on the harbor at the end of the 25 de Julio, Guanica's main street. Several delegates from the Socialist International and the Conference of Latin American Political Parties showed up, including Raul Alfonsin, the former president of Argentina; Jaime Paz Zamora, the former president of Bolivia, and Rodrigo Borja, the former president of Ecuador. They passed resolutions favoring self-determination for Puerto Rico.
Not to be outdone, the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party held its own rally at El Morro fortress in San Juan to celebrate the 46th anniversary of the creation of the commonwealth.
As many as 100,000 people were expected to show up in Guanica, a sleepy southern coast town renowned for its beautiful beaches and unusual dry forest, and merchants were expecting an economic bonanza from the centennial activities.
One of the pilgrims was Nelson Eddy Vega, a teacher at Brooklyn Technical High School, who attended the pro-independence rally. "I'm not sure if there is even one Puerto Rican who is sure what is going to happen in our political future over the next 20 years. That's why I went through so much trouble to get here," he said. "I believe progressive people should show the world that everything is not what Rossello and his people are saying. That not everything is a celebration."

HEADLINE: Candidates Scramble for Distinction in Washington Mayor's Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
With Marion S. Barry Jr. now a lame duck mayor, the District of Columbia appears headed toward a new political era as elections approach, with a primary in September.
Unlike in recent years, marked by financial turbulence and incessant finger pointing to ascribe blame, the city is on the rebound with a projected surplus this year of $231 million and municipal services that are rapidly improving. 
 That would suggest a certain comity among the five Democrats running to succeed Mr. Barry, whose remarkable victory in 1994 after a six-month prison term on a drug charge brought him a fourth four-year term.
But that is not necessarily the case. With scant differences among the leading candidates on such critical issues as public safety, economic development and education, they are devoting considerable energies arguing over what could become the central issue of the primary campaign: who played what role in the city's fall and rise?
As a question that touches on the ever-present issue of race in District politics, it has drawn a sharp distinction between the three members of the City Council who are running -- Harold Brazil, Kevin P. Chavous and Jack Evans -- and Anthony A. Williams, the former chief financial officer, all of whom are lawyers.
The fifth candidate, Jeffrey Gildenhorn, a businessman who has proposed some of the most radical ideas for the city, like legalizing drugs and prostitution, is not expected to mount much of a challenge.
As the apparent front-runners, Mr. Williams and Mr. Chavous present voters with the clearest choices.
Mr. Williams was directly accountable to the financial control board created by Congress three years ago to oversee the city until it balanced its budget four consecutive years. With another surplus projected for 1999, the board could shut down in 2001 unless Congress decides to extend it.
To many District residents, particularly blacks and low-wage earners who are sensitive to issues of self-rule and full representation in Congress, which the District does not have, the control board -- and Mr. Williams -- represent a disrespectful occupation force that has marginalized elected officials.
More than any of his Council colleagues, Mr. Chavous has exploited that perception, criticizing the control board for a heavy-handed approach to running the city and campaigning as a populist who would work to eliminate it even sooner than the law allows.
In that role, he is the mostly likely candidate to pick up former Barry supporters.
But for other residents, including many whites and middle-class people, the control board and Mr. Williams have been a salvation, implementing fiscal and management changes that elected officials have avoided or ignored. The initiatives included hiring a new police chief, installing a board of trustees to run the school system and hiring a city manager to run virtually all city agencies.
The reaction would appear to reflect at least grudging support for Mr. Williams. "I would have thought Tony would have had a much tougher time than he has," said Ron Walters, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland and an expert on the District. "You don't hear much outcry from citizens, like when the board took over the school system. There's a level of resignation to this place. People think it's necessary to have these changes even if they're hard to swallow."
And that appears to be working well for Mr. Williams, who steadfastly defends decisions he made as the financial officer as measures to save the city from insolvency. "Tough choices had to be made," he said at a candidates forum on Wednesday night. "But now that the budget's in balance, we're in a situation to invest and build."
Yet it also plays conveniently to the other challengers, allowing them to defend their own actions, which have often conflicted with the control board. At the forum, Mr. Chavous spoke proudly of his opposition to an economic plan approved by Congress and the White House that is saving the District millions by shifting its pension liability, courts and prisons and other functions to the Federal Government -- but at the cost of the Government's annual subsidy to the District.
"You really need to take a look at who has stood up to the control board and Congress," Mr. Chavous said. "I've stood up."
Mr. Williams, on the other hand, hailed the plan as a "wise commitment" by the Federal Government at a time the city could no longer afford such responsibilities.
While Mr. Chavous might have an easy time selling his differences with Mr. Williams, distinguishing himself from Mr. Brazil and Mr. Evans could prove more difficult. All three have outlined their visions for the city, but none is dramatically different from the others.
That, too, could work to Mr. Williams's advantage. If Mr. Chavous and Mr. Brazil split the black vote, said Mark Plotkin, a local political analyst, Mr. Williams, who is black, could win if he draws white voters from Mr. Evans, who is white.
The Democratic winner is likely to face another member of the City Council, Carol Schwartz, a white Republican who won 34 percent of the vote against Mr. Barry in 1986 and 42 percent against him in 1994.

HEADLINE: Election as Reproof: Japan Challenges the System

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 25

 BODY:
The last two weeks have seen a stunning revolt in Japanese politics.
True, it was quashed. The election of Keizo Obuchi as president of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, a position that all but guarantees he will become Prime Minister next week, was pure Japanese politics as usual. 
 But the election itself -- in which two party members openly challenged Mr. Obuchi -- was a condemnation of the party and its longstanding system of choosing leaders, under which heads of its powerful factions meet privately to select one of them to run the country for the next few years.
In the tactics of its participants, in its openness and in the loud, angry voices of voters that accompanied it, the election was a wake-up call to the party that has governed Japan for 41 of the last 43 years with little challenge.
"We are seeing the start of a real end to the L.D.P. period," said Shinichi Yoshida, a columnist and senior political correspondent for Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest papers.
Mr. Yoshida pointed out that the Liberal Democrats have not won a majority in an election since 1993, when an opposition coalition took power for 11 months. Since then, the party has governed either in coalition or by luring opposition members into its fold after an election to insure a majority.
"The voters have not given them a majority since 1993," he said. "With the voters, the L.D.P. is not popular."
Indeed, a poll taken last week by Yomiuri Shimbun, another large paper, showed support for the party slipping to an all-time low of 20.7 percent, a drop of 8 percentage points in one month.
Everything about the election pointed to the party's unpopularity. An unexpected upset in the upper house elections two weeks ago forced the party president, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, to resign. Plans to present a united front behind Mr. Obuchi fizzled when junior party members started clamoring for competition. Candidates were forced to discuss policy on television, and their neighbors found themselves being interviewed by reporters.
The party's loss of control was evident in the election's competitive nature, in the attention to public opinion about the race, in the voting across factional lines that determined the winner and in the edge-of-the-seat atmosphere that descended on Tokyo as party members cast their ballots Friday afternoon.
It all added up to what one analyst described as "the most open and democratic L.D.P. presidential election in history."
Only the outcome was predictable -- and that may further weaken the party.
As Glen Fukushima, the American Chamber of Commerce president, put it: "There was enough concern expressed in the media and among certain L.D.P. members that the choice of Obuchi could lead to a potential backlash in the future, but despite that warning the party leaders went ahead and did their own thing. They probably think people will forget, but I wonder."
Two things could work in the Liberal Democrats' favor, however. The righteous indignation that voters are expressing now may evaporate if the economy takes a turn for the better.
Also, the opposition may have an attractive leader in Naoto Kan, head of the Democratic Party, but the party is still torn by dissension. Although voters like Mr. Kan, it is doubtful whether he could put together a lasting coalition government.
Instability is the last thing that world leaders want to see in Japan, which must move quickly and without distraction to address the problems in its financial sector and to stimulate the economy. Should the party be forced into a coalition with the opposition, analysts fear a period in which very little would be accomplished.
"People have broken off from the party many times over the last two or three decades only to come back," a senior diplomat in Tokyo said. "It could happen again, I suppose, but there is certainly a lot of force in the party structure in the sense that its numbers put it in a position to offer a lot of rewards to its members." In fact, the 1993 voter revolt did not result in any lasting changes in party procedures or the Japanese system.
But Japanese voters are beginning to find their voices now, goaded by economic distress and changes in the electoral system five years ago that have given their votes more clout in the choice of district representatives.
One could not interview a legislator last week without hearing about how many of his constituents had faxed him in hopes of swaying his vote, and after the election last night, many were dreading their trips back to their districts. "I think a lot of people are going to be upset," said Taro Kono, a 35-year-old party member who had scheduled a series of meetings with constituents over the weekend in his district in Kanagawa prefecture. He said he had voted for Seiroku Kajiyama, one of Mr. Obuchi's challengers.
In particular city dwellers, who have never been big supporters of the Liberal Democrats, are angry. That was obvious in the upper house elections on July 12, when the party did not win a single seat in an urban area and thus lost its majority.
And since the recession has bitten harder in the conservative rural areas that are traditionally party strongholds, those voters are not feeling as friendly as they otherwise might.
"It doesn't matter whether they're from urban areas or the country, it's all Japan saying that Obuchi is the wrong choice," said Nobutero Ishihara, whose district is in central Tokyo and who supported Junichiro Koizumi, the crusading Health and Welfare Minister, in the party contest. "Unless the party understands that, I don't think the L.D.P. has a future."
Mr. Ishihara left his faction before the election, even though the faction was supporting his candidate, because, he said, his constituents do not like factional politics.
Now, he and other younger legislators are wondering whether their party affiliation is going to become a liability. About 20 junior party members representing urban districts threatened to leave the party on Friday should Mr. Obuchi win, although his strong victory has made them think twice.
"I'm going back and forth, I don't know what I'll do," said Shinichiro Kurimoto, a supporter of Mr. Koizumi, who was wildly popular with the public but received the fewest votes on Friday. "As only one person, I can't make a difference, but if I had 12 friends, we could all make a difference."
The party's grip on power relies on a 13-seat majority in the lower house of the legislature, and were elections held any time soon, it would almost certainly lose its control. The lower house election is scheduled for September 1999, although the opposition, hoping to seize the moment, is pushing for an immediate dissolution of the legislature.
That is not likely, since most junior party members are terrified of an early election and would almost certainly stay in the party long enough to guarantee its ability to squelch a no-confidence vote.
But some members are even worrying about their prospects a year from now. "If the party cannot resurrect the economy, if there isn't a recovery," said Hakubun Shimomura, a junior legislator from Tokyo, "some people who are L.D.P. members now won't run as L.D.P. members in the next general election."

HEADLINE: Rowland Is Renominated As G.O.P. Tests New Turf

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 25

 BODY:
Connecticut Republicans unanimously nominated Gov. John G. Rowland for a second term today at a convention that was carefully scripted to send a message very different from those of previous years: This is not your father's Republican Party.
In a marked departure from the 1994 convention, there was almost no talk of repealing the income tax that was enacted in 1991 or dismantling the state government, issues that caused deep splits among Connecticut Republicans in the past. 
 While speakers still touted tax cuts and spending restraints, they also dwelled on a host of other issues -- rebuilding the state's universities, expanding Medicaid and revitalizing cities -- that have often been considered Democratic turf.
And the ticket that Governor Rowland handpicked was emblematic of the change: four of the seven candidates for statewide office are either Hispanic or black. Republicans hope that the slate will attract minority voters who have traditionally shunned the party.
"We are not your father's Republican Party," Chris DePino, the state party chairman, told the crowd of more than 1,000 delegates at the Bushnell Auditorium here Friday night.
The Governor, he added, has transformed the party from a "tired old elephant to an energetic, powerful young elephant."
"It's the Rowland express," shouted Mr. DePino, who works part time as a train conductor and was Mr. Rowland's choice in 1996 to head the party. "All aboard!"
Polls show that Mr. Rowland, who at 41 is the nation's youngest governor, has a commanding lead over his Democratic opponent, United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, 62.
Several Republican state legislators said that if Mr. Rowland's success continues, riding on his coattails could help them regain a majority in the Senate, where Democrats now have a one-vote edge, and pick up seats in the Connecticut House of Representatives, where they are a small minority.
One Republican candidate for Congress, Mark Nielsen, started running radio commercials this week that describe him as a "John Rowland Republican."
In addition to Mr. Rowland, the party today nominated M. Jodi Rell for lieutenant governor, former United States Representative Gary A. Franks for the United States Senate, Santa Mendoza for attorney general, Ben F. Andrews Jr. for secretary of the state, Antonio Serbia for comptroller and Paul J. Sylvester for treasurer. Mrs. Rell and Mr. Sylvester are incumbents.
Politicians across the political spectrum agree that Mr. Rowland's popularity is due in large measure to the turnaround in the state's economy, which left the state with a record surplus for the fiscal year that ended June 30 and brought the lowest unemployment rate in at least 10 years.
But Republicans and Democrats differ sharply over whether Mr. Rowland's policy pronouncements of the last year, initiating a number of ambitious government programs, were a natural evolution in his thinking or political repositioning to win re-election.
"It's a crass attempt to embrace the values and principles of the Democratic Party," said Lisa Cutler, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Kennelly's campaign.
"John Rowland and the Republican Party take a poll, look where the electorate is at and adjust their program to fit it."
While Mr. Rowland, in his acceptance speech, boasted today of a new program to provide health coverage to 90,000 uninsured children, it was only four years ago that he was elected with the promise of dismantling the Great Society's war on poverty.
Although he vowed to eliminate the income tax in 1994 -- a move that would probably require huge cuts in state services -- Mr. Rowland did not mention such a goal today.
Such changes suggest an evolution in Mr. Rowland's approach, but in an interview Friday, he hinted that his wariness about government had not disappeared. "The word 'new program' is the scariest thought to anyone in this job," he said.
Still, Republicans say Mr. Rowland always wanted to pursue initiatives like increased aid to cities, preservation of open space and expansion of health insurance for the poor, but first had to improve the state's economy. The focus of his first few years in office, they maintain, had to be restraining spending and cutting taxes so that the state could afford to spend money in the future on new programs.
And while Mr. Rowland did not eliminate the income tax -- a goal several Republican lawmakers acknowledged he would never achieve -- he did reduce it.
In the interview Friday, Mr. Rowland blamed Democrats in the General Assembly for making it impossible to achieve that goal, and maintained that he had a better record on tax cuts than Mrs. Kennelly did.
Today, Mr. Rowland again brushed aside the criticism from Democrats that his initiatives of the last year were examples of political opportunism.
"Excuse me for saying so, but I have to chuckle when I hear from other members of the other party who say, 'Oh, my goodness, they've gotten out in front of us on our issues,' " he said in his acceptance speech. "Frankly, for the last eight years, there's been nothing to get out in front of."
Mr. Rowland also said that in Connecticut, there is a Republican legacy of concern about social issues. He cited the leadership of Stewart McKinney, a Congressman who died in 1987, in addressing homelessness, as well as Congresswoman Nancy Johnson's work on extending health care coverage.
"And please, please don't tell me or Jodi Rell that we're new to the issues that speak to the hopes and dreams of the people of this state," Mr. Rowland said.

HEADLINE: Show Nanny the Money;
As Economy Booms, Pay Rise for Child-Care Workers

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
It was upsetting enough when her nanny quit to go work for another family, but what shocked Carroll Bogert was the salary used as a lure: $800 a week, plus health insurance.
"I did think the sum was rather stunning," said Ms. Bogert, a Manhattan mother of two whose job as a spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch requires a lot of traveling. "She'd worked for us for two and a half years, and we paid what I thought was the rather princely sum of $550." 
 Stories like Ms. Bogert's are sending shivers down the spines of well-to-do parents in Manhattan and its pricier suburbs, where a nanny war has broken out among parents vying to find and keep the modern Mary Poppins.
Fueling the fight is the strong economy, which is giving some families more money to spend on nannies, housekeepers and other household workers while giving the workers more job options and higher wages.
The winners in the escalating nanny war appear to be millionaires -- like the ones Wall Street mints every minute -- who can afford to pay a nanny up to $1,000 a week after taxes. The deal often includes health insurance, a retirement plan, use of a BMW and perhaps a guest cottage behind the main mansion.
The losers are the merely prosperous, particularly single-parent and two-income families who consider a nanny a necessity. They say they are being priced out of the market for even an average nanny -- who, according to local employment agencies, now makes at least $400 a week, regardless of whether she receives room and board -- by the largess of the very rich.
"The problem is, they've set a standard that a lot of nannies have come to expect," said one Westchester County mother of two who works at a Manhattan consulting firm and who spoke on the condition that her name not be used. "Not everyone is worth a few billion or even several million."
In fact, most American parents cannot afford at-home child care, much less the expensive nannies who are hired through agencies and get paid on the books. The majority of women who work in at-home child care get paid under the table and are likely to earn less money than career nannies; some are illegal immigrants and others do not speak fluent English. Au pairs -- the foreign students who have traditionally provided inexpensive child care for American families under a program sponsored by the Federal Government -- have fallen out of favor with many families.
But wages for premium nannies -- college-educated women with experience and drivers' licenses -- have been rising for several years, according to executives at employment agencies. "We have definitely seen a step up in the cost of maternity nurses and nannies," said John P. Battaglia, owner of the Fox Agency in Manhattan, adding that since 1993, "the $600 range has come along; $500 range was the top at that point."
The women who work as nannies -- and they are almost entirely women -- say the increase is an overdue recognition of their long hours, grueling work and heavy responsibilities. "If a nanny is running the household, running the show, I don't think $600 should be balked at -- I don't think it is out of line at all," said Cathrine Weaver, a longtime nanny in Westchester who has just completed her nursing degree. "I feel for the families, but they made a choice."
The rise in nannies' wages appears to be a national phenomenon. A survey by Nanny News of 300 readers found that the median weekly wage is now $350. That's up from $250 two years ago, said Mary Clurman, who publishes the newsletter and runs Apple Pie U.S.A., a placement agency based in Cottonwood, Ariz.
Wages are much higher in New York, especially in Manhattan and the northern suburbs. "I get people calling from Long Island who pay $275, and they want to pay that or maybe $300 a week," said Leigh A. Tripathi, who stopped working as a nanny four months ago to open an agency, Real Kidz Care, in Tuckahoe, N.Y. She cannot help these families, she said, noting that nine years ago she made $325 a week, but her most recent job paid $600.
Nannies have become far more savvy about wages and benefits, thanks in part to the information that employment agencies post on the Internet. And given the hard work involved, many young women who might have gone into child care are finding other jobs, said Alan Friedman, co-owner of the Manhattan franchise of A Choice Nanny, a nationwide agency.
Demand for all household help is increasing, said Maurice Wingate, president of Best Domestic Services, a national employment agency. In addition to nannies, housekeepers and gardeners, he said, he is placing personal assistants, who for $700 a week help plan dinners, arrange entertainment and make travel plans.
In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the number of people working in homes as nannies, cooks, cleaners and drivers grew by about 7,000 between 1992, when the regional economy began to recover, and 1996, the most recent date for which figures are available, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That works out to an increase of 23 percent -- five times faster than private employment growth in the region, said John L. Wieting, regional commissioner of the bureau.
"This certainly is a very rapid growth industry," he said, "and there is no reason to expect that this kind of growth has not continued."
Though many people do not show up in the data, which are based on records for workers eligible for state unemployment insurance, Mr. Wieting said he thought the overall trend was similar.
Employers can suffer from sticker shock, especially families who move to New York from other areas or overseas. "In Europe, you can hire American nannies for half the price you pay here; you can get college-educated women for $200 a week," said Penelope McDonnell, a mother of four who moved two years ago from Belgium to Ridgefield, Conn. Mrs. McDonnell, who recently hired a nanny, said she had not had trouble finding applicants for the post, but used an agency because she worried about the quality of the applicants.
In the past, mothers like Mrs. McDonnell might have turned to au pairs. But many families have grown reluctant to sponsor au pairs because of Louise Woodward, the au pair from England who last year was convicted in the death of an infant in her care.
Au pairs have also become increasingly expensive. Under Federal guidelines, au pairs make $139.05 a week plus room and board, up from $100 in 1995. Additional costs like training, transportation and insurance can bring the cost to more than $200 a week, even though au pairs must attend school and work no more than 45 hours a week.
As a result, the number of au pairs, which in the mid-1990's reached 11,000, last year was about 3,000, according to estimates from the United States Information Agency, which oversees the program.
The rise in nannies' wages is so striking that one of Wall Street's most widely read investment gurus has cited it as a sign of the overheated stock market. Barton M. Biggs, chief global strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, described the situation in Greenwich, Conn., where he lives, in a July 6 report to his firm's clients, "Say 'Hi' to the Nanny Bubble."
"The latest escalation that has outraged Greenwich is that a family new to town enticed a nanny by buying her a new car (which she helped choose) with the proviso that if she sticks around for two years, it's hers," Mr. Biggs wrote. "Brilliant, except that now other nannies are demanding similar deals. I would bet you it will be a long time before that particular family gets into a country club."
While buying a car is unusual, nannies and parents agree, anxious or grateful employers have paid off their nannies' debts, financed their educations and covered their gasoline costs.
Nannies who work in some parts of Connecticut can make $600 to $800 a week, said Donna Levandoski, who until July 17 was a live-in nanny and the leader of a support group for her peers. "Fairfield County is such a freak of nature, it's not the norm," she said. Between the wealthy wives of corporate executives and the actresses and actors, she said, picking up the children from school is "a social event, a job in itself."
The situation in Manhattan can be even more extreme. One 30-year-old woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, worked until March as the third nanny for a very wealthy couple with one child. For being on call on nights and weekends for 30 hours a week, she received a bedroom and private bath in an apartment on the Upper West Side overlooking Central Park. When she was called on to work -- about 15 hours a week -- she was paid $14 an hour.
She left after more than a year, mostly to get more privacy, she said. Although the family she worked for lived in a separate apartment, she shared hers with the second nanny, and, during the day, other workers.
She also found the family's requirements were exacting, which is not uncommon among the very well-to-do, said Jackie Williams, president of I Love My Nanny Inc., a nationwide agency that specializes in live-in child care.
"They're willing to pay more, but they expect more," she said. "The expectation is, if their children wake up in the middle of the night, the nanny is going to get up."
As for Ms. Bogert, who lost her nanny to the high bidder, she found a new nanny for about $600 a week. "I remember when we used to pay $250, but those days are over," she said. "As well they should be."

HEADLINE: U.S. Cancels Plans For Raid on Bosnia To Capture 2 Serbs

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
After spending more than two years and tens of millions of dollars preparing missions, training commandos and gathering intelligence, the United States has dropped its secret plans to arrest Bosnia's two most wanted men accused of war crimes, senior Administration officials say.
Plans for clandestine missions to seize the men -- Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the wartime political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs -- have been scuttled by American commanders who fear a blood bath, by French officers who are reluctant to act and by American Government officials who share a growing sense that the mission could rekindle Serbian aggression, present and former American officials say. 
 Dr. Karadzic, a psychiatrist, and General Mladic were indicted three years ago today by an international criminal tribunal on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The United Nations court charged them with killing, persecuting, shelling and deporting civilians throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina; launching sniper attacks against civilians in Sarajevo, and taking United Nations peacekeepers hostage and using them as shields.
The court said all members of the United Nations had a legal obligation to try to arrest the men. Some United States officials felt they had a moral obligation as well. "There was a big effort to collect intelligence and to make plans" to arrest Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic in 1996 and 1997, said a former senior State Department official.
The National Security Agency, which conducts electronic eavesdropping for the United States, spent millions of dollars tracking the men. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and United States Marshals went to Bosnia, where they scouted the men's homes and hideouts.
A secret cell of United States and NATO military officers, code-named Amber Star, shared intelligence and developed ideas. The British favored a mission, but French officers, whose international peacekeepers control the zone where Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic have been living, were deeply skeptical. United States officers were reluctant to share intelligence with the French, fearing it would leak.
Still, two plans for an arrest operation took shape. The Central Intelligence Agency's Balkans Task Force supported those plans with fresh information on the targets' whereabouts, although senior United States intelligence officials were dubious about the missions.
Over two years, the cost of the intelligence-gathering, the planning and the training for an operation grew to tens of millions of dollars -- more than $100 million, by one estimate. At one point last summer, United States special operations soldiers were sent to Germany, ready to carry out a plan to swoop down on Dr. Karadzic. But it all came to nothing, in part because senior United States military officers found the plans too perilous.
Discussions about the mission echoed a recurring argument within the Clinton Administration: civilians calling for military operations in the murky territory between diplomacy and war, and military men wary of undertaking unorthodox, potentially controversial missions to police the world's unruly neighborhoods.
Unless American soldiers and their allies went in with overwhelming force, some of them might die trying to arrest Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic, the military argued. And even if they went in with overwhelming force, the commanders contended, the risks outweighed the potential political rewards.
The risks, one senior Administration official said, were that several hundred Serbs would die in such a military assault by United States and NATO troops. Those deaths, in turn, would galvanize the most violent and bitter elements among the Serbs. And that, he said, could reignite war fever in the Balkans.
"If you were to try, you've got to make some decisions about casualties -- and not just among NATO troops," this official said. "How many people do you want to take out on the way? If you don't care about taking out several hundred people, that would be one kind of operation. There would be a big political element to an operation of that scale. You make NATO safe by creating a lot of casualties."
Senior United States diplomats argued, to no avail, that no lasting peace is possible in Bosnia until Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic are brought to justice.
"You have to seize these guys," said Peter Galbraith, the former United States Ambassador to Croatia. "Justice isn't served unless they're dead or in the dock." Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the peace pact in Bosnia and has been nominated as representative to the United Nations, contends that their arrest is the most important unfinished business in the Balkans, and the biggest impediment to a lasting peace.
But White House officials -- including President Clinton -- could not convince the military that arresting the indicted men was a risk worth taking, present and former Administration officials said.
Opportunities to arrest them have not been lacking. "We could have captured them easily," but for resistance at the highest military levels, said a former senior Clinton Administration official. Evidence of the United States military's reluctance to use its power to arrest the men is replete in public and classified records, he said.
Finding the men would have been among the least-difficult aspects of the operation. One day in February 1996, for example, Dr. Karadzic drove unchallenged through four NATO checkpoints, two of them manned by Americans. Today, Dr. Karadzic is believed to have left his base in Pale, in the mountains above Sarajevo. He moves from town to town within Bosnia with an escort of loyal security officers, traveling freely. General Mladic, accused of overseeing the killing of thousands of Muslims from Srebrenica three years ago this month, is said to be living comfortably in Belgrade.
The decision to abandon plans for secret military operations to arrest the men now appears set in stone. With no deadline for the withdrawal of United States and NATO forces, the consensus within the Administration is that discretion is the better part of valor in the Balkans.
Now United States policy is to wait the men out, to reduce their economic, political and personal power. In time, the thinking goes, they will "drop like rotten fruit" into NATO's hands, another official said.
Though Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic remain at large, nearly half of the 62 men indicted on war-crimes charges by the international tribunal are now in custody, and the power base built by Dr. Karadzic is slowly but surely eroding, they said.
"The ice is getting thin, particularly under Karadzic," said a senior Administration official. "His ability to buy off the police, to pay for security guards, is heavily diminished. Some people think he might surrender someday." That, evidently, is the best hope American officials have of bringing him to justice.

HEADLINE: Marking a Puerto Rican Anniversary

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R.

 BODY:
In his 35 years with the Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Guillermo de la Paz has gone on strike more than 10 times, but the latest strike has been different. Strangers bring him coffee and honk their horns when they pass the picket line, he says. Buckets fill up with cash donations.
This month, dozens of other labor unions even went on strike themselves for two days to show their support. 
 "This is not a workers' strike," said Mr. de la Paz, 56, who handles reports of breakdowns for the phone company. "This is a strike of the people."
The five-week telephone workers' strike, which may end this week when striking unions vote on a proposed agreement, started as an effort to stop the sale of the publicly owned telephone company to a private consortium and prevent feared layoffs. But it quickly turned into an emotional cause as the workers portrayed the utility as a "national patrimony."
Now, the Puerto Rico Telephone Company has become a patriotic symbol, an embodiment of nationalistic sentiment not unlike Puerto Rico's Olympic team or Miss Universe contestant. As such, it may help explain how Puerto Rico sees itself 100 years since Spain ceded it to the United States -- a nation with a distinct identity despite its status as an American territory, and sharp divisions about what to become beyond that territorial status.
While Puerto Ricans have united in resisting American assimilation and holding on to the Spanish language and Latin American culture throughout the last century, they remain at odds over whether to cement their ties to the United States with statehood or seek more autonomy or even independence. So the centennial anniversary of the association with the United States has been met here with celebrations, protests or indifference.
"I celebrate our relationship with the United States, but what I celebrate the most is the current relationship," said Mayor Sila M. Calderon of San Juan. Ms. Calderon is a member of the Popular Democratic Party, which created the current commonwealth or free associated state status in 1952.
"I celebrate the evolution of an invasion, to a colonial state for 50 years, to our own government, our own constitution, our fiscal autonomy and the preservation of our identity," she said. "We've achieved a sui generis situation, a Hispanic country with ties of citizenship with the American nation."
But for Carlos Romero Barcelo, a former Puerto Rico governor and statehood proponent who now serves as the island's nonvoting member of Congress, the centennial is bittersweet. The invasion by United States troops under Gen. Nelson A. Miles on July 25, 1898, he said, was a welcome arrival that liberated Puerto Rico from neglect and poverty under 400 years of Spanish monarchical rule. But he said the promise of democracy remains only partly fulfilled because Puerto Ricans, compared with residents of the states, lack equal obligations and rights, like the right to elect a Congressional delegation.
"That to me is geographic discrimination," said Mr. Romero Barcelo, a member of the governing New Progressive Party. "We've stayed behind politically and economically."
Despite the diverse views, most Puerto Ricans find consensus in the defense of two products of their history: their culture, a blend of mostly Taino Indian, Spanish and African influences, and their American citizenship.
The strength of these feelings was in evidence in 1996 when, prompted by Gov. Pedro J. Rossello's argument that Puerto Rico was not a nation, a poll by El Nuevo Dia, the island's main daily newspaper, found that 62 percent of respondents considered Puerto Rico, not the United States, their nation.
When asked which citizenship they would prefer if forced to choose, however, 54 percent said American, not Puerto Rican, the poll found.
And as they ponder their political destiny and Congress debates a plebiscite bill that would allow a vote on political status, even Puerto Ricans who advocate statehood say language and culture are not negotiable. But most of those who prefer more autonomy and argue against "annexation" say neither is American citizenship.
Seemingly contradictory, and often confusing to outsiders, the feelings make perfect sense to a population that has fought American wars, held American democratic values and enjoyed American standards of living but insists on clinging to its roots and a sense of nationhood without sovereignty, a status that some here compare to that of groups like the Palestinians.
In Washington, Congress is facing its own divisions as it debates whether to allow Puerto Rico's 3.8 million residents self-determination. A bill was approved by the House last March by a one-vote margin and the Senate is grappling with its own version.
There are political concerns and economic ones for the United States if Puerto Ricans opt for statehood. Puerto Rico also confronts the United States with identity problems, some political analysts here say, because a 51st state would make the United States more ethnically and linguistically diverse.
"The essence of the debate in Congress is really a debate over a multicultural United States," said Juan Manuel Garcia Passalacqua, a longtime political analyst and newspaper columnist here.
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who supports statehood, plays down the cultural issue, arguing that Puerto Rico has more in common with New York than California might have with Mississippi. Already, 2.7 million Puerto Ricans live in the United States, according to 1995 census estimates.
Mr. Torricelli says it has taken this long for the debate to gain momentum in Washington because a territorial status that is increasingly regarded as unacceptable was once common around the world.
He views the 100-year anniversary with mixed feelings. There have been "elements of exploitation" of labor and resources in the early part of the century and denial of full rights to Puerto Ricans, he said, but also "a generosity of spirit" that has brought the island economic and social development beyond that enjoyed by most of Latin America.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican who as head of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is pushing a bill to at least define the alternatives Puerto Ricans could vote for, said that whether the centennial is cause for celebration or frustration, "it's an opportunity for Americans to focus on the reality that Puerto Ricans have been under the American flag and haven't been able to resolve the status."
The three Puerto Rican parties advocate different status options but all agree that change is needed to foster the island's economic development and reduce dependence on Federal subsidies. Even commonwealth supporters want an enhanced version of that status to give Puerto Rico increased powers, like the ability to strike its own foreign investment deals.
Statehood supporters, and particularly Governor Rossello, have tried to pave the way for acceptance into the United States by making the island less distinguishable from the states and pushing for such changes as increased English instruction in public schools and the privatization of government-owned industries.
Mr. Rossello has argued that the sale of a controlling interest of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company to a private consortium, led by Connecticut's GTE Corporation, is vital in a competitive telecommunications market, but the opposition to the sale stems partly from suspicions of a pro-statehood agenda behind it.
Those who dismiss both the commonwealth and statehood models include Ruben Berrios, a Senator in the Puerto Rican Legislature and president of the Puerto Rican Independence Party.
Mr. Berrios said 100 years under Federal rule, which he calls "100 years of colonialism," has left many Puerto Ricans bereft of self-confidence.
"There are people in Puerto Rico who have internalized colonialism so much that they don't believe they can govern themselves," he said.
In the United States, a Wirthlin Worldwide poll last May showed that 63 percent of Americans favored a plebiscite bill that would allow Puerto Ricans to choose their political status, and a majority also agreed with arguments in support of statehood, like the island's residents would pay Federal income taxes.
In Puerto Rico, the same pollsters found that 45 percent of residents favored the current commonwealth and 42 percent favored statehood, a statistical dead heat that mirrors the results of a 1993 nonbinding referendum vote here. Five percent favored independence and 8 percent were undecided.
Despite the mutual reluctance to commit after 100 years of courtship, support for statehood has steadily risen with the passage of time.
Sandra Gonzalez, 39, a resident of Paterson, N.J., supports statehood, regards the island's ties with the United States as "a blessing" and has two children who were born in the United States. But she, like many others, calls herself and her family Puerto Rican first and American second.
"My roots and my culture are Puerto Rican," said Ms. Gonzalez, a department store assistant manager who has lived in the United States for the last 19 years. "It doesn't matter that we live here. Our heart is over there."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
New Parks From The Grass Roots

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
THE idea of a national park as a wilderness set aside for recreation for everyone began with Yellowstone in 1872, before there was a National Park Service. Now, 126 years later, the service has jurisdiction over 376 places -- memorials and monuments, land and houses, historic sites and the like -- embracing over 83 million acres. But in the last 15 years, in an "ambitious experiment," as the Park Service calls it, Congress has given the service a vastly different task: Helping grass-roots groups preserve history, landscape, canals and rivers or anything else that seems to them to embody the special qualities of where they live and work.
Designated Heritage Areas or Corridors, or in one case, a Heritage Route, these 15 places can contain active industrial artifacts -- working steel mills, for example -- and historic buildings adapted to new uses, like a cotton mill being used to store apples. Except where an existing Federal site falls within the area's boundaries, the Federal Government does not own or manage any of these sites. They remain private or public -- whatever they were before Congress accorded them heritage status. 
 "Each National Heritage Area is a settled landscape that tells the story of its residents," the Park Service says. "Over time the land and local environment have shaped traditions and cultural values in the people who live there. The residents' use of the land has in turn created and sustained a landscape that reflects their culture."
These areas are mostly east of the Mississippi; the farthest west are the Cane River Creole National Heritage Area in Louisiana and the Silos and Smokestacks Agricultural Heritage Partnership in northeast Iowa. To a large degree, they document the industrial revolution in the United States, but they cover a wide spectrum of national life, from the Civil War and the Creole culture in the Louisiana Purchase to the demise of the China trade in New England.
In describing what common thread links such diverse places -- some ready for tourists and others preparing -- David Barna, a Park Service spokesman, said: "The park system has preserved natural areas, Indian history, sites from the Revolution, the War of 1812 and the Civil War. But from the late 1800's forward, most historic sites are not part of the Park Service. From the vantage point of 2050, citizens might well ask us, 'Why didn't you save significant sites of the Industrial Revolution?' "
Designation as a heritage area, Mr. Barna said, helps save more recent examples of the national history, plus recreational features like boat landings, without throwing vast tracts into Park Service custody.
 
Midwest Canal
Congress began the effort in 1984, when it gave heritage-corridor status to the Illinois and Michigan Canal, built in the 1830's and 40's over the Indian portage route between Lake Michigan and the Illinois River. This venture turned Chicago from a crossroads into Carl Sandburg's "stormy, husky, brawling city of big shoulders." The 61-mile canal strip is the most established of the heritage areas, with recreational facilities and brochures. Congress added to the list in 1986, 1988 and 1994. In 1996, in an omnibus bill, it designated nine new areas. Two of these, the Tennessee Civil War area and the coal history area in West Virginia, while authorized and outlined, are not ready to provide guidance for tourists.
Little about a heritage area is tidy. Judy Hart of the National Park Service, program leader for the heritage areas, said they are "too broad and too rich" to be made into national parks. Dr. James K. Huhta of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who testified in Congress for the Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area, said there were many advantages to examining a heritage through large regional themes rather than in a battlefield or individual houses or parks. Dr. Huhta said that his project divided Tennessee into five areas where major themes could be demonstrated. For example: the lives of blacks from 1850 to 1870, including slavery; the Underground Railroad; the Civil War and emancipation and the women whom the Civil War left as widows, or with disabled husbands and sons.
The Coal History area in 13 counties in West Virginia was also designated in 1996, but work continues to establish it.
The South Carolina corridor, a string of 14 counties in the west, another from the class of '96, is open for business. The corridor, estimated by its administrators to include a quarter of the state, starts in the mountains and runs down along the Savannah and Edisto Rivers to the Low Country. The area includes a salt marsh, horse farms, potteries, craft shops and Boone Hall plantation, with slave cabins still standing. Boone Hall, north of Mount Pleasant, began operating as a plantation in the 17th century. The main house was replaced in 1935, but the slave cabins, of handmade brick, date from the late 18th to early 19th century. The "slave street" is one of the few identified in the state. Boone Hall opened as house museum in 1956.
Part of what drives people to organize and seek Congressional authorization is the possibility that heritage tourism will strengthen the local economy by bringing in travelers and possibly new businesses. These days, designation brings modest financial help. Ms. Hart said each of the areas designated in 1996 was able to request $1 million a year allocated by Congress, up to $10 million over 15 years. Not all have received money, she said, and some will never present plans that will enable them to draw their full portion.
The sites all get counsel and information on organization. Those areas that have brochures, for example, have usually designed one to match National Park fliers, with color maps and pictures, although local organizations have paid the bill.
The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley in eastern Connecticut, authorized in 1994, encompasses 850 square miles, more than a sixth of the state's total of 4,845. With 25 "hill and mill" towns, it likes to style itself "the last green valley" in the megalopolis between Boston and Washington. The area includes the 1776 Nathan Hale Homestead and the Prudence Crandall Museum, which was the first New England school for black American girls in 1833.
The idea of tracing American history through this valley developed in the mind of one woman, Marjorie L. Hoskin, before 1980.
Ms. Hart of the National Park Service said typically the heritage process began with two people at a kitchen table, and grew exponentially until a working group had formed. Carol Davidge, a volunteer for Quinebaug-Shetucket, said that at first she had never seen many rivers in her own area because they were behind mills or in very deep cuts. Cargill Falls, she said, drops 55 feet, creating huge water power. Looking at it, she said, "you can see why the textile industry moved from England to New England."
Quinebaug-Shetucket has been disbursing small grants to applicants. An example is the Mill Re-use Initiative. These projects must be endorsed by the towns where the mills are. The owner of the Morse Cotton Mill in Putnam, built around 1846, got $10,000 to restore the stucco exterior. This building, now known as Quinebaug Apple Storage, rents space to orchards to store fruit. The owners of the Fitness Factory, a gym in one building of the 1920's Prym Mills, got $10,000 for a new roof.
It's not all hammers and nails. Sally Rogers, a singer in Pomfret, got $15,000 to create songs based on oral histories in the area, write a curriculum guide and carry out other musical projects. One song, "The Airline Route," was based on advertisements for the New England Limited, which once crossed the state. A piece of the line's route has been converted to the Air Line State Park Trail, running northeast from Willimantic to Thompson.
The valley's annual walking weekend coincides with Columbus Day, with dozens of guided walks and tours throughout the area.
 
Iron and Sea
The Essex Heritage Area in eastern Massachusetts enfolded two existing Federal sites, the Salem Maritime National Historic Site and the Saugus Ironworks. The former includes the Custom House, wharves, homes and other maritime buildings. The latter is on the site of the first integrated ironworks in North America, dating from 1646-68. A reconstructed blast furnace, a forge and a rolling mill are part of the works.
Three main themes are developed in the area: the early settlement of America by Europeans, the rise and decline of maritime industries and early development of the shoe and textile industries. Annie Harris, director of the heritage area, which is defined by the Essex County lines, said that the 500-square-mile county was one of the oldest in the country.
Often those answering the information phones at heritage areas can provide guidance not available in print. August Carlino, the executive director of the Rivers of Steel area around Pittsburgh, said that his area included working steel mills. Carnegie's first mill, the Edgar Thomson Mill, is still operating, Mr. Carlino said, turning out sheet steel for household appliances. The working mills, he said, are usually reluctant to offer tours, but sometimes these can be arranged through the heritage area office.
The National Parks Index for 1997-99 includes a list of the heritage areas and their mailing addresses. The index, an illustrated 128-page paperback, is available for $6.50 from the Government Printing Office, Post Office Box 371954, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15250; Web site gpo.gov; stock number 024-005-01182-0.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
No Time for Losers

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman; Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at M.I.T., is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
Does anyone still remember the economic summit meeting that Bill Clinton convened in December 1992? Politically, it was another universe -- one in which the President-elect's personal hijinks were behind him, in which fundamental health-care reform was a vote-winner, in which Ira Magaziner was a genius and Newt Gingrich a comical figure. (Well, some things never change.) The central theme of the conference was the urgent need for America to get its act together to cope with powerful competition from other advanced countries -- above all, that economic juggernaut, Japan. And the heroes who were going to save us were the visionaries of high technology -- most prominent among them the lead speaker, John Sculley, the chief executive of Apple Computer.
But "sic transit gloria mundi" isn't my theme in this column. Instead, I want to point out a peculiarity in public attitudes toward business success and failure, both for countries and for companies. You see, as far as the buyers of business books are concerned, not only John Sculley but also Apple itself has more or less disappeared from view. And, despite the occasional headline about the plunging yen, so has Japan. Americans, it seems, are fascinated by success stories but have little appetite for tales of failure. 
 The disappearance of Japan is even more astonishing than the disappearance of Apple. In 1992, Lester Thurow's "Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, America and Europe," spent months on The New York Times best-seller list. Michael Crichton's "Rising Sun" -- a fictional account of imminent Japanese takeover that included an earnest afterword explaining that it was all based on solid research -- not only ruled the bookstores for months but was snapped up and made into a movie. In those years, you couldn't walk into an airport bookstore without confronting rank upon rank of books with samurai warriors and ideograms on their covers.
Then Japan stumbled, and everyone lost interest. The last time I saw a book about that country on display, it was a shopworn copy of Eamonn Fingleton's 1995 "Blindside," which claimed that thanks to the then ever-rising yen, Japan's economic dominance was still growing and its apparent recession was only a ruse intended to lull Westerners into complacency. (As Dave Barry would say, I am not making this up.) I guess they forgot to take it off the shelf.
America's business-book buyers, in short, have no time for losers. As putatively successful investors, the Beardstown Ladies sold more than a million of their investment guides. For all I know, someone is writing their true story right now -- but if I were a publisher, I wouldn't pay much of an advance.
What's funny is that when it comes to general nonfiction, Americans love a good disaster, whether tales of drowned sailors or doomed mountain climbers. Why is it that when it comes to business, we're only interested in success?
One possible answer is that we rely too heavily on sports metaphors. If you think you could be a contender, you want to know about the strengths and weaknesses of your rivals; you want to know the secrets of others' success. You don't have time to listen to stories about teams that haven't a prayer of making it to the post-season.
Another answer is that people may feel, probably unconsciously, that too much emotional depth gets in the way of a business career. An ironic attitude or a tragic sense of life may make you a more interesting person. But it might also undermine the positive outlook you need to be a successful executive or entrepreneur.
Still, the business reader who wants to hear only about the positive is missing a lot. When you come down to it, business isn't much like sports. Every touchdown in football is achieved at a rival's expense; but while a business may have a few major competitors, most of the time an extra dollar in profits is earned not by taking business from a rival, but by creating value where none existed before. This is even more true of nations. Most economists will tell you that the whole idea of national "competitiveness" is a fallacy, that world trade is not a zero-sum game. And, conversely, when a business or a country stumbles and falls, usually the culprit is not a superior rival but the victim's own mistakes. The enemy is indeed usually us.
That's why it is important to understand how success turns to failure -- because next time it could be you. Surely, any entrepreneur with a potentially winning technology has a lot to learn from Apple's missteps. Here was a company with a massive technological lead -- friends who used to use Macs say the slogan "Windows 95 is Macintosh 89" was right on the mark -- that somehow blew it. Wouldn't you like to avoid repeating that sort of history?
And while a lot of Americans used to be frightened by Japanese success, I am much more frightened by their current malaise. Here is a modern, advanced nation with a stable government and no foreign debt to speak of -- yet the Japanese seem to have lost control of their economy, and to be sliding into the kind of slump we haven't seen since the 1930's. I think we'd better figure out what's happening to them and why; otherwise, who's to say it can't happen to us?
Many people have said that America's worship of success hurts our souls, because we care only about getting ahead. I have no expertise in such matters. But I am sure that our unwillingness to hear about anything but success makes us especially vulnerable to the failure we fear.

Watch On the Rind

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill 

 BODY:
Melons are the borderline personality of fruit. Go to the bin where last summer you bought a pale green watermelon shaped like a football, and this summer it might be a dark green soccer ball with chartreuse pin stripes.
Fashions in melon are not about shifting public taste; they're about the melons themselves and their endless perversity. Melons rival the gods in their pathological disguises. They are self-contained and secretive, and their exteriors change as they migrate from turf to turf, dooming those who love their sweet ripe flesh to moments of grave doubt and indecision. 
 Thanks to the global economy, exotic new melons have appeared in the market this year, and many of the newcomers are now being cultivated in California. This includes the Cavaillon, a luscious orange-fleshed melon, native to the south of France; the European Piel del Sapo, a dark green, pink-fleshed fruit; the vivid yellow Amarelo, which tastes vaguely like pineapple, and the spicy Galia from Southeast Asia, which is being grown hydroponically all across the country.
Persian and Spanish melons are becoming more familiar to Americans with each passing year and may one day rival the cantaloupe in popularity. This doesn't mean that as they adapt to our soil and we grow accustomed to their idiosyncratic charms they won't mutate like the Crenshaw did from a goldish green to a light yellow. (Writing in 1929, a Frenchman named Jules Belleudy decried the change in appearance of the Cavaillon: " It used to be elongated, with a greenish skin and pale green flesh.. . .The flavor was very sweet, and the melon was as juicy as a sorbet.")
And while it may seem that the cantaloupe is imperturbable, the truth is that America's most common melon has its inconsistencies -- the netting growing looser or denser, depending upon the point of origin. In fact, the only things you can rely on when buying a melon are certain generic prerequsites, like size (you want a "full slip" melon, a melon that has grown so heavy it has fallen from its natal vine) and bellybuttons (perfect melons always have innies). After that, you can shake and thump and incant ancient spells over its dome, but a melon will remain implacable.
Real nuts invest in refractometers, devices that measure a melon's sugar content. I find the $200 investment hard to justify, given the specter of cruising the produce department with a Goliath-like piece of equipment. Besides, technology usually falls short of the human senses. Either you know your produce manager as you would (depending on your worldview) your rabbi, or you smell the wound a given melon sustained when it slipped from the mother lode. If it smells as sweet as honey with hints of flowers, musk, lemon and other things that cause you to flush, grab it.
Then celebrate it quickly, before it changes to mealy mush in your hands.
 
Savory Melon Salad in Honeydew Vinaigrette
 
 For the salad:
 1 cup cantaloupe, julienned
 1 cup honeydew, julienned
 1 cup Crenshaw, julienned
 2 bunches (4 cups) mizuna or baby Chinese mustard greens, washed and chopped
 1 head frisee lettuce, washed and chopped
 1 bulb fennel, quartered lengthwise and sliced crosswise into 1/8-inch slices.
 1/4 pound thinly sliced prosciutto, fat removed, cut crosswise in 1/4-inch ribbons
 
 For the vinaigrette:
 4 cups honeydew chunks, or enough to make 2 cups strained puree
 1/2 cup, plus 2 tablespoons, hazelnut oil
 3 tablespoons lime juice
 Zest from 1 lime
 1 teaspoon kosher salt
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste
 1/2 cup hazelnut pieces.
1. For the salad, place the melon on sheets of parchment paper and place in the freezer until very cold and slightly crunchy, 25 to 30 minutes. Place the mizuna, lettuce, fennel and prosciutto in a large bowl.
2. For the vinaigrette, pass the honeydew chunks through a food mill, or puree them in a food processor and pass the puree through a mesh strainer to make 2 cups. Place the juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Reduce until 1/2 cup of liquid remains, about 25 minutes.
3. Place the reduced liquid in a blender set on low. Drizzle in the oil and lime juice; then add the zest and salt. Adjust seasoning with pepper, more salt, lime juice and lime zest.
4. Add cup of the vinaigrette to the bowl and toss well. Add the melon pieces and toss lightly. Adjust to taste with more dressing. Serve immediately in separate bowls, drizzling around the edge of each bowl with a teaspoon of hazelnut oil. Garnish with the nuts.
Yield: 6 servings.
 
Juan Canary Granite
 
 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
 1/2 cup sugar
 1/8 teaspoon almond extract
 4 teaspoons fresh coriander, minced, plus a few sprigs left whole for garnish
 4 cups Juan Canary melon chunks.
1. Crack the coriander seeds by pressing on them with the bottom of a cast-iron skillet. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, almond extract, the fresh coriander and the seeds. Add the melon and stir thoroughly. Macerate for 1 hour, refrigerated.
2. Pass the melon and juice through a food mill, or puree in a food processor and then pass through a mesh sieve. Discard the solids.
3. Add the remaining teaspoon of minced coriander to the liquid and stir. Pour the liquid into 2 pie dishes and place in the freezer for 4 hours. Using a fork, scrape the ice out of the pan, mashing large chunks as necessary. Mound a spoonful on each of 4 plates, garnish with a leaf or two of coriander and serve.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
Crescents of Melon on Fresh Ricotta
 
 For the syrups:
 2 cups blueberries, washed and sorted
 1 1/2 cups sugar
 2 cups raspberries
 
 For the fresh ricotta:
 7 1/2 cups fresh whole milk
 1/2 cup heavy cream
 1 cup yogurt
 1/2 cantaloupe, sliced into 16 crescents, rinds removed
 1/2 honeydew, sliced into 16 crescents, rinds removed
 1/2 Crenshaw, sliced into 16 crescents, rinds removed
 8 edible blossoms.
1. To make the syrups, puree the blueberries in a food processor or blender and put them in a small pot. Add half the sugar and cup water, bring to a boil, then simmer for 2 minutes. Let cool before running the syrup through a fine- mesh strainer. Discard the solids. Then repeat the same process with the raspberries.
3. To make the ricotta, line a mesh sieve with a double-layered square of cheesecloth, with plenty to overlap the sieve. Meanwhile, combine the milk, cream and yogurt in a pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture begins to curdle, about 2 minutes.
4. When the milk is curdled, pour it into the cheesecloth and allow it to drain about 5 minutes. Gather up the four corners of the cheesecloth, tie a stick into it as if for a satchel and prop the stick on the edges of a bowl and allow it to drain until firm, about 1 hour.
5. When ready to serve, assemble 8 plates. Paint half of each plate with the blueberry syrup and half with the raspberry syrup. Mound 1/4 cup of the ricotta on the center of each plate. Stack 6 alternating slices of melon together and place on the plate so that the inside of their crescent shape faces the cheese; then fan them slightly. Garnish with an edible blossom. Repeat with the remaining 7 servings.
Yield: 8 servings.
 
Honeydew Sorbet With Vanilla And Honey
 
 1/4 cup thyme honey
 1 vanilla bean, split in half
 4 cups honeydew chunks
 2 tablespoons lemon juice.
1. In a small pot, combine the honey with 1/3 cup water and the vanilla bean. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Scrape the vanilla seeds into the pot and stir well. Discard the shell.
2. Pass the melon chunks through a food mill, or puree them in a food processor and pass them through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard the solids.
3. Stir all the ingredients together in a bowl. Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions.
Yield: 6 servings.
 
Crenshaw Soup
 
 3 cups scooped-out pieces of Crenshaw or Juan Canary melon, to make 2 cups juice
 2 cups clear chicken stock
 1 packet unflavored gelatin
 1 1/2 cups Crenshaw or Juan Canary melon in 1-inch dice
 2 cucumbers, peeled, seeded and cut in 1/4-inch dice
 1 Vidalia onion, diced
 2 yellow sweet peppers, diced
 1 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
 4 scallions, white part only, julienned.
1. Pass the scooped-out melon through a food mill, or puree it in a food processor and pass it through a fine mesh sieve to make 2 cups. Discard the solids.
2. In a small pot, bring half of the chicken stock to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, sprinkle the gelatin over the remaining stock. Add the boiling stock and stir until the gelatin is dissolved. Allow to cool.
3. Add the remaining ingredients, except the scallions, to a large serving bowl; stir in the melon juice, chicken stock, salt and pepper and top with the scallions. Refrigerate. Serve in chilled bowls.
Yield: 6 servings.
 
Melon Salsa
 
 3 1/3 cups honeydew, in 1 inch dice
 3/4cup chopped peanuts
 1 to 4 fresh red and green Thai chilies, stems removed and minced
 3/4cup fresh mint leaves, larger stems removed, chopped
 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, minced
 2 teaspoons kosher salt.
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Serve as a condiment for tortillas, corn bread, fish or chicken.
Yield: 4 cups.

Art That's Alive With the Meanings Of Military Junk

BYLINE: By RUTH LOPEZ; Ruth Lopez, a former journalism fellow at Columbia University in the arts, is an editor at the The New Mexican in Santa Fe.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
ON June 22, three days before Woody Vasulka's work was to be shipped to Japan for an exhibition, he stood in his cluttered studio amid packing crates, huge rolls of bubble wrap, cable of all sorts, dismantled computers and tables covered with tools going over last-minute details. Mr. Vasulka is a media artist, combining video, computer technology and traditional machinery in his work. It had taken him months to put everything together and relatively little time to take it apart. Something was amiss, but Mr. Vasulka appeared calm.
"The machines want to work," he said. "They just have to overcome human frailty." 
 The machines, six interactive constructions fabricated as a series of tables, are made from discarded military equipment found near Los Alamos, N.M., where the nuclear bombs that fell on Japan were created. They turn, they twist, they reach out, they reach back, often eerily in response to motions of viewers. Each is accompanied by a system of projectors, speakers, screens, lights and sensors through which each type of behavior is controlled. The result, titled "The Brotherhood," carries overtones of the destruction the Japanese experienced from American raids at the end of World War II, although nothing was made of that point in the planning of the show or the catalogue that accompanies it.
The show, Mr. Vasulka's first on his own, opened at the Intercommunication Center in Tokyo on July 17 and runs through August. The media museum was established in 1997 by the Japanese telephone giant, N.T.T. Visitors to "The Brotherhood" Web site, www.concentric.net/tables, will be able to view the show.
Choosing Mr. Vasulka for the gallery's first major show was in the mind of the curator, Gogota Hisanori, from the moment he stepped into his post two years ago and began planning exhibitions. Mr. Hisanori said he had been following the career of Mr. Vasulka, as well as Mr. Vasulka's partner in life and art, Steina Vasulka, after seeing their installations at the Whitney Biennial in 1989. The Intercommunications Center commissioned three new pieces to accompany earlier work.
During the chaotic week before an 18-foot-long truck arrived to take away 20 huge crates for overseas shipping, Mr. Hisanori was in New Mexico for the final push, preparing the text in Japanese to accompany the exhibition. Because of the scale of the project, "The Brotherhood" had spilled out of its studio to a work space at the College of Santa Fe several miles away. Mr. Vasulka spent long days split between two locations.
"These are blue-collar artists," Mr. Hisanori said. "Sometimes media artists will do nothing by themselves. They have engineers and special staff to do everything."
While it is true that the bulk of the creation of "The Brotherhood" stayed in Mr. Vasulka's hands, he would be the first to point out that he was hardly alone.
"This is no longer something I can claim as a private work," he said. "This is the first time I've reached beyond my individual capacity. One always thinks that one can do it all, but that's not true." Mr. Vasulka had to bring in experts, for instance, after he enlarged his concept by incorporating MIDI (musical instrument digital interface), a communications system that enables electronic musical instruments to interact with one another.
"There were so many walls we had to crash through," said Ms. Vasulka, explaining that the project included several computer languages. "In the old days, Woody could go in with a soldering iron and fix the problem." she said. "But if a code breaks, we are defenseless."
The Vasulkas, leading figures in the history of video art, were co-founders in 1971 of the Kitchen, the experimental media space in downtown Manhattan. Their collaboration started in the early 60's when they met in Prague, where Woody was studying film and Steina the violin. They married and moved to the United States in 1965.
In those days, Mr. Vasulka was scavenging industrial scraps off city streets. When the couple moved to New Mexico in 1980, their explorations continued, but Mr. Vasulka was now picking through the junk piles near Los Alamos National Laboratory. His installations began to take on a more sinister tone inspired by the machinery of war. He also turned away from making only video images and began exploring the relationships between objects and space.
For Mr. Vasulka, "The Brotherhood" is the expansion of an idea that began in 1990 with a construction called the "Theater of Hybrid Automata" (now "Table II"). That installation explored both actual and virtual space. The device at the heart of this construction is a celestial navigator, a piece of military hardware originally designed to deliver a deadly bomb load somewhere off in the heavens.
The two installations that followed began to take on the structural military intentions of the original machine, but benignly: for Mr. Vasulka it was a way to examine the mind of the military designer or, as he put it, "the male idea" of the machine's destructive power. The original "Brotherhood" (now "Table III") was built in 1994, and its main component was a plotting device that once charted air interception. This sprawling installation is an interactive, computer-driven construction surrounded by five large screens. Mr. Vasulka repositioned the circuits to project computer-generated imagery onto the screens, which are driven by the plotter.
Over the last year, Mr. Vasulka has been preparing the new tables for Tokyo. He calls "Stealth" ("Table IV"), a flashback to the 60's when he became bored with the cinematic frame. "The Scribe" ("Table V") is a code-breaking network for transferring linguistic data from one medium to another. Using a pneumatic device designed by a studio assistant, it consists of a video camera that locates words in a book. A robotic arm turns the pages.
"The Maiden With Fans" ("Table VI") is probably Mr. Vasulka's most intriguing construction. A long metal creature, a cross between a giant praying mantis and a dinosaur skeleton, rises out of the base of a hospital operating table. Ms. Vasulka will direct the "Maiden" with a computerized violin on opening night.
In his artist's statement, Mr. Vasulka says that the theme of his installation is male identity and mankind's compulsion to reorganize nature. " 'The Brotherhood' neither argues for a reformist agenda nor defends a male strategy," he wrote. Later, he added, "I think art should be as far away from life as possible."
Mr. Vasulka's intentions are far-ranging. He is fascinated by the "discreet antagonism" between art and science and continues to examine objects in space that have "some self or independent sort of expression."
But as "The Brotherhood" neared completion, what seemed to concern the artist was the strange situation with, as he put it, the show business aspect of art. His bigger commissions will come with bigger expectations.
"I never believed art should be expensive," he said, clearly overwhelmed by the cost of resources during the last few months. "I seem to be facing an industrial involvement with logistics of organization, machines, tools. I don't think that's the right direction. If I could find an articulate group of Luddites, I would be interested in joining them."
But that could have just been fatigue talking. For now, Mr. Vasulka will have a show in Tokyo at a time when many galleries in Japan have closed. How the economic situation in Japan has affected the art world there was very relevant during that last hectic week in the Vasulka studio in New Mexico. Mr. Vasulka was weighing where to trim costs, at the request of the Intercommunications Center, and decided that the packing material for the delicate equipment was not the place to do so. Despite all the pressures, Mr. Hisanori said he was pleased with the project. His biggest concern was moving the crates through customs.
"Media art is not yet popular in Japan," Mr. Hisanori said, adding that the Government thinks machine imports should be taxed. Each time it is a small battle to convince the officials that the material is for artistic, not commerical, use. That the material being used is military scrap will only complicate things.
Mr. Hisanori said that to the Japanese viewer, Mr. Vasulka's works might seem like "grotesque handmade machines" and he hoped that the exhibit would challenge the notion that technology is always good.
That the show might disturb viewers would please Mr. Vasulka. "Art should not provide a kind of comfort," he said. "Art should be draining you and drenching you."
Mr. Vasulka and his team of five assistants will remain in Tokyo for the length of the exhibition. Between all the systems -- computer, pneumatic, optical, mechanical -- there is plenty of room for trouble.
"We have to kind of sit around and watch it," Mr. Vasulka said. "It is now complicated enough to fail, and since this was all engineered on the kitchen table, one has to be aware that it's not like you put a picture on the wall and just go home. The whole exhibit lives with you. It is part of your nervous system."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE;
Trying to Save an Old Way of Life From Progress

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
OLD Order Amish families hold church services in their homes. They rarely invite outsiders to attend. But you can't drive more than a mile through Lancaster County's rolling farmland without thinking you've already entered one of the world's great sacred spaces, a landscape consecrated over the centuries to a peaceful way of life. If this view is no more than a day-tripper's idle projection, it is not alien to a place that was settled in the 17th century in William Penn's spirit of religious tolerance.
But the sanctuary is getting smaller, thanks in part to the car that conveys you into a part of the world that retained its serenity until the postwar years. In the last three years, more than 1,000 acres of farmland in Lancaster County have vanished. The car culture has gulped down big chunks of a landscape long associated with the horse-drawn carriage. Open land has been turned into sites for suburban subdivisions, big-box discount outlets and strip malls. 
 So what else is new? This is a story that has been repeated, again and again, in urban and rural sites across America since the end of World War II.
What's new is that for good reasons, people no longer believe, as they did in 1945, in global progress. Progress now has credibility only on the local level: the curing of a disease, the healing of a family, the advance of a particular subculture or form of art within the turbulence of cultural and economic globalization. Progress often consists of redefining earlier forms of progress as contemporary forces of retrogression.
In response to the pressures of suburban development, last year the entire county was placed on the World Monument Fund's annual list of 100 Most Endangered Sites. Dairy cows and corn and tobacco fields thus took their place with the domes of Hagia Sofia, the temple sculptures of the Angkor Wat. This is the first time the Monuments Fund has explicitly designated a way of life, not just a building or historic district, and it makes for a challenging problem.
Action plans for endangered sites typically call for work like restoring decaying mosaics, erecting a new roof or building a new road to divert trucks. For Lancaster County, the action plan is pitched well above the material plane. It acknowledges that Pennsylvania and Lancaster County already have some of the best land-use plans in the country.
But quoting the anthropologist John A. Hostetler, the plan advises: "Nothing except a catastrophic intervention or spiritual reversal can restrain the corrosive greed which spawns affluence and insatiable growth. The key to preserving Lancaster lies in a return to the very ideals that created it."
I won't hold my breath for that one. But I do hope for the emergence of others like Randy Harris and Karen Weiss, two local heroes who have been driving efforts to preserve the county's historic way of life. Mr. Harris, executive director of the Historic Preservation Trust of Landcaster, has worked mainly to preserve buildings in the city of Lancaster, the county's historic urban core. (This is the first time an entire American city has been on the Monuments Fund's list, too.)
Ms. Weiss, land preservation director of the Lancaster Farmland Trust, has worked tirelessly to convince farmers to accept property easements, a deed restriction that, in exchange for payment by donors, limits the use of their land to agricultural purposes. The easements secured by the Farmland Trust in the past 10 years have not quite kept pace with the forces of commercial development, yet they represent far more than a respectable show of resistance.
Lancaster used to be a frontier town. This is where pioneers purchased their Conestoga wagons and filled them with provisions before heading west. Later, it was the site of F. W. Woolworth's first five and ten. Today, it has many beautifully restored old buildings, including an opera house, several former market halls and the Hamilton Watch factory, now converted to apartments.
The city's most recent preservation success is the scheduled renovation of the old Watt & Shand building, an old department store on Penn Square, an iconically grand civic center in the heart of town. In a sad, familiar story, the store closed shortly after its owners opened a branch as the anchor tenant in a shopping mall on the city's outskirts. In addition to restoring the four-story building, the plan calls for a mixed-use office and retail tenants.
What can never be restored is the simple binary relationship between town and country -- distinct but mutually supportive -- that Ms. Weiss and Mr. Harris themselves personify. Much of Lancaster county has been irretrievably splintered into what Peter Rowe calls the "middle landscape," the car culture's decentralized realm. This fragmentation lies beyond the repair of any action plan.
 STILL, there is another binary concept that might prove useful in managing change: the cultural and economic shift from production to consumption that is driving the transformation of urban and rural environments nationwide.
J.B. Jackson, the great landscape writer, once wrote that he didn't favor historical preservation on what he called the "small town, middle-class scale."
Would he have made an exception for the Amish? They don't look like the middle-class people you see at the shopping mall just outside downtown Lancaster. They're not big consumers. They're producers. This marks them off from us as much as their religious belief. Production and consumption are not just economic terms. They are cultural terms as well. Indeed, the shift from one to the other is momentous, rivaling the car as the century's most powerful force for cultural change.
It's not easy to exchange one set of connotations for another. Production evokes work, the work ethic, work as a form of prayer; work on the land seems especially divine given its association with the New Golden Land, the new Eden, where paradise might be regained. Consumption, on the other hand, is inevitably tainted with Veblenesque associations. The word conspicuous need not be spoken to be heard.
On the moral scale, the difference between production and consumption is the difference between need and desire. And what is going on in Lancaster County is essentially a reclassification from one category to the next. It's a painful transition, precisely because Lancaster County has lagged so far behind other parts of the country in making it, and because throughout American history the Amish have represented the continuity of some of our earliest ideals. Much of the drive for development has come from within the local community.
The ugliest blot on the landscape is a gigantic theater that will be used for biblical spectaculars. The second ugliest blot on the landscape is an unfinished section of a highway, the Route 23 corridor, which, if completed, would run through several miles of farmland, disrupting the Amish way of life even more. They got as far as building some earth rampways before running out of funds, and the project is undergoing what I hope will be a lengthy and ultimately futile process of environmental review. Unattractive as it is, I halfway hope that this piece of cultural distortion can itself be designated a landmark, included on tours as a monument to the value of turning things around.

HEADLINE: Elected Bodies With Hardly a Cultured Bone

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr.; R.W. Apple Jr. is a former Washington bureau chief of The New York Times and now its chief correspondent.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ON most nights when opera is the attraction at the Kennedy Center, the Presidential box is either empty or filled by low-level staff members or their friends. The faces everyone recognizes turn out mainly for musicals.
Not many senators or representatives show up, either, for Washington's choice concerts and recitals or at big exhibitions at the National Gallery, the Phillips Collection and the Corcoran Gallery, or even at most plays at the city's award-winning Arena Stage. High culture is about as popular a diversion in official Washington as stock-car racing in the Ivy League. 
 On the other hand, successive owners of the Washington Redskins -- George Preston Marshall, Edward Bennett Williams, Jack Kent Cooke and now his son, John Kent Cooke -- have never had any trouble filling their box on autumn Sunday afternoons with politicians, high-voltage lawyers and media luminaries.
During working hours, some of the pols plot ways to cut Federal spending on the arts and to keep the remaining dollars -- pathetically few by the standards of most advanced countries -- out of the hands of artists whose work is deemed offensive to "general standards of decency and respect for the diverse trends and values of the American public," to quote the legislative formulation whose constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court last month.
The artists, understandably, feel beleaguered. When William Bolcom's new Sixth Symphony, with a movement aggressively titled "Marche II Contre les Philistins," was given its premiere in Washington earlier this year by the National Symphony Orchestra, the composer said in a program note that it was a protest against "the increasingly hostile climate for the arts in our current society."
There are exceptions, of course. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Representative Sidney Yates of Illinois champion the arts even in today's chilly climate. In the not yet distant past, Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court was a devotee of classical music, not only as a listener but as a performer. A violinist, he played chamber music for guests at home.
But not since 1968, when Eugene J. McCarthy flew to Chicago for the doomed Democratic National Convention with the poet Robert Lowell and the novelist William Styron on his private plane, has a high-profile American politician, at least in my memory, so publicly associated himself with symbols of Art.
It is a Republican-controlled Congress that has most visibly and most recently been trying "to drive a stake into the heart of Federal funding for the arts," as the departing chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, Jane Alexander, complained when she left the capital recently to return to acting.
But today as yesterday and the day before, with Republicans as well as Democrats in control of the White House, with Democratic as well as Republican majorities on Capitol Hill, the arts and intellectual activity in general are often bashed and seldom boosted by political Washington, left or right.
Bill Clinton, though no worse than the run of American Presidents, is not much better, and Presidents set the tone in this as in so many other aspects of American public life. Hillary Rodham Clinton, unlike Jacqueline Kennedy, appears disinclined to compensate for her husband in this area. During their triumphal tour of China, neither uttered a word of protest in public (or, so far as is known, in private) about the Shanghai Bureau of Culture's refusal to allow a production of "The Peony Pavilion," a classic Chinese opera, to appear at this year's Lincoln Center Festival.
The Clintons' tastes run to rock-and-roll, television sitcoms and Hollywood yard goods, if their guest lists are any guide. Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the creators of chunks of television bubble gum, were the first people invited by the Clintons to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. True, they are longtime Arkansas friends. But Barbra Streisand, who slept there too, is not, and at the big White House bash last winter for the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the featured entertainers were Elton John and Stevie Wonder, neither of whom has any links to the First Family or to Arkansas. Setting the cultural table for the press that evening, the actor James Brolin said of Mr. Clinton: "He's the most fun President we've ever had. I think we can all agree about that."
 
A Philistine Tradition
 So why is it that most American politicians care so little about the arts or intellectual life in general? Why do many who do hide it? Why do others go out of their way to pillory culture? Is a philistine climate in Washington, often reflected in statehouses, an accident or a historical inevitability?
I think we set ourselves on the road to a philistine political tradition long ago, when we resolutely turned our backs on the old aristocratic cultures of Europe, setting up what Tocqueville identified as a lasting tension between elitism and egalitarianism -- tension very likely to be resolved in favor of the egalitarians, he said, given "the ever-increasing despotism of the majority."
At first, New England brahmins and Virginia planters like Adams and Jefferson and Madison gave the young United States something approaching an aristocratic tradition in politics. All of them were cultivated men. But in 1828 the nation took a fateful turn against the Eastern elite with the election of Andrew Jackson, the quintessential backwoodsman, who became the first American President without a trace of the aristocrat in his lineage.
Having established the primacy of the frontier in American politics, his supporters crowded into the White House to celebrate, leaving muddy footprints on the chairs and carpets.
Eight years later, William Henry Harrison beat Martin Van Buren, campaigning as the "log cabin and cider" candidate and ridiculing Van Buren as an Easterner so effete that he actually had a bathtub in the White House. Harrison's victory provided a corollary precedent to Jackson's: if you aren't a man of the people, pretend to be. Like his running mate, John Tyler, he was a Virginia aristocrat, but he ignored that and ran instead on his exploits in the western wars: "Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too," said the campaign handbills.
Ever since, the great mass of American politicians have shied away from identification with things artistic and intellectual. "Elite" is one of the dirtiest words in the lexicon of American politics, and those who are suspected of having a mansion instead of a log cabin lurking in their backgrounds feel the need to hide it with ostentatious symbols of the common touch. Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Hudson River squire, served hot dogs to the King and Queen of England, and George Bush, an upper-crust Connecticut Yankee, made a show of nibbling pork rinds. Talking about the tables down at Mory's would have projected the wrong image.
The frontier style in American politics, as it might be called, is related to the scarcely concealed notion that there is something unmanly about the arts; John Wayne didn't talk about Rembrandt or listen to Callas. Traditionally, American men have admired (and aspired to be) tough guys, denizens of bars and smokers of cigars. The more genteel side of life, in this stereotype, is left to the women, twittering away at card parties. Arts-loving men have often been derided as homosexual or at least limp. For politicians, it is safer not to run the risk.
In this as in other things, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York is an exception, an opera lover since childhood who turns up not only in the audience at the Met but onstage, to make some sort of presentation or other. But then, he is the Mayor of a city where high culture is a multimillion-dollar business, and business, unlike the arts, has long been seen as a proper preoccupation of politicians.
F.D.R. wrote one of the noble chapters in governmental financing of the arts with the Works Progress Administration's support of artists who painted murals and frescoes on public buildings and writers who created a series of historical guides to the then 48 states. No one objected very much; artists were on the bread lines just as much as assembly-line workers and haberdashers.
Influenced by his arts-loving, saxophone-playing legal aide, Leonard Garment, Richard Nixon financed the National Endowment more generously than any of his successors, although he himself had no particular artistic leanings.
And John F. Kennedy and his culture-vulture wife, Jacqueline, created Camelot, disdained today by the revisionists but astonishing at the time. Not only were the intellectually lively like Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and John Kenneth Galbraith recruited for key places in the Administration (Hannah Arendt said that Kennedy had "emptied the Harvard faculty"), but the artistically distinguished were invited to state occasions, from Robert Lowell and Robert Frost to Pablo Casals.
Like President Nixon, President Kennedy may have had pedestrian tastes; indeed, Richard Reeves says in his book about the Kennedy Presidency that J.F.K. cracked jokes behind his wife's back about the soirees she arranged. But Kennedy had keen enough political antennae to know that high style sold well for the two of them -- our own version of royalty -- however much an exception that represented from the usual rules of American public life.
Most politicians have dreaded seeming out of touch with the mainstream of American culture, especially its more populist elements. They take it as a given that refined sensibilities play badly "out there." Cowed by polls, fearful of retribution at the ballot box by voters whose instincts they habitually underestimate, they attend prayer breakfasts even if not very religious and surround themselves with movie and television stars.
To borrow from H. L. Mencken, they have turned the nation's political culture into a Sahara of the Bozart, where eggheads are punished unless they keep their heads down, as Adlai E. Stevenson and Eugene McCarthy both learned; where the yahoos thrive and where few voices are raised in celebration of the arts.
If American politicians have little interest in traditional arts -- or seem actually scared of them -- one can imagine their lack of interest in defending truly controversial art. If they would just as soon stay away from Mozart and Renoir and Shakespeare, shock art makes them squirm. And especially in the last century and a half, much of avant-garde painting, music and literature has been adversarial and difficult to access by the uninitiated. The homoerotic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano's cross submerged in urine not only offended members of the religious right but doubtless upset many in the mainstream as well.
In recent years, this kind of work has ignited a political bonfire that came close to consuming the whole idea of Federal arts subsidies. While such art is part of a long tradition of esthetic radicalism, it also marks a departure, not only shocking the artistic sensibilities of some of those who experience them but also offending the religious beliefs of millions at a time when religion and politics are unusually closely linked in this country.
"At the moment," Senator Moynihan commented, "it seems to me that there is an unusually assertive desire to shock. Maybe that's because artists feel that they live on the margins of a materialistic culture, or maybe it's just my age. At any rate, when you get shocked audiences, you're going to get shocked people in Congress too, because Congress as a whole -- the Senate, at least -- has a range of dispositions, talents and tastes not very different from the country's."
For every Pat Moynihan who reflects the values of the faculty lounge, in other words, there are a lot more Jesse Helmses who reflect those of the Bible Belt, where the crabbed spirit of the Puritans still shines. And artists, as Mr. Mencken observed, "are never Puritan and seldom even ordinarily respectable."
Mr. Yates, who has been fighting these battles for decades, said that few Presidents, in his view, had put their hearts into the arts, settling instead for "fine-sounding words of support for worthy ideals." Presidents operate within limits, he suggested, "and some artists always go beyond the limits -- they operate out on the edge, and that is what they are supposed to do."
 
The European Way
 A big part of the difference between Europe and America is history.
For centuries, European monarchs, including popes, took it upon themselves to support the arts, as did nobles and aristocrats. Popes hired Michelangelo and Raphael, the Esterhazys employed Haydn, and Frederick the Great, a composer of repute himself, brought Voltaire to Potsdam for philosophical discourses.
As the power of the absolutists waned, the obligations of cultural patrons passed to democratically elected politicians, along with the remaining aristocrats. A deference to cultural elites persisted. I once asked Herbert von Karajan in the days when he dominated the Salzburg Festival what he did when a production ran over budget. He looked at me as if I had yet to learn the facts of life and answered, "I call Vienna, and the ministry sends money" -- an exaggeration, no doubt, but an accurate depiction of lavish Austrian spending on music.
Many British and French and other European politicians are patrons of the arts in both senses, not only regularly voting for large subventions but regularly attending plays and concerts. Some are cultural figures themselves, whether full-time politicians with artistic avocations (like Denis Healey, the former British foreign secretary, a music lover who writes serious books and takes photographs good enough to merit exhibitions) or full-time artists with political avocations (like Andre Malraux, a minister under de Gaulle, or Vaclav Havel, the president of the Czech Republic, or Kurt Masur, a leader of the Leipzig revolt against the old East German regime). The most successful French Ambassador to Washington since World War II, Emmanuel de Margerie, had previously headed France's most distinguished art museums.
Since London, Paris and Helsinki are their countries' cultural as well as political capitals, the political classes there may be more naturally friendly to the arts than in our country, where the economic and cultural capital, New York, is an hour's flight away from the halls of Congress. The political capitals of the largest American states, which control arts budgets of their own, are also distant from their cultural and intellectual capitals. Those who control the government money bags are in Albany, Austin, Springfield and Sacramento, not New York, Houston, Chicago and Los Angeles.
But even if the worlds of government and the arts lived in close proximity to each other, the antagonism might persist, unless the politicians could stop worrying about looking like elitists in their constituents' suspicious eyes. Cultural capitals are almost by definition elitist places.
A more serious drawback in the United States must be the lack of a core cultural tradition, accepted by all, which the politicians can foster with tax dollars. In a country as heterogeneous as this, it is hard to imagine the almost universal love of serious music that possesses Italy, for example. I remember hailing a cab in Milan on the night of a Sviatoslav Richter concert many years ago and learning that the driver was going, too.
Here, the multicultural, egalitarian tradition weighs heavy. Politicians and the rest of us are encouraged to believe that all artistic traditions have equal merit. The result is a fragmented view of the arts, a world where the politicians pander rather than lead, resting content with their philistinism instead of championing art -- any art -- at the risk of their political necks.

HEADLINE: In Port Washington, an Eyesore Becomes a Golfer's Delight

BYLINE: By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
FOR more than a century, the Port Washington sand pits provided the raw material for the cement that helped build Manhattan skyscrapers. Its canyons served as desert backdrops for filmmakers. Now a new sports complex has risen from the sands, turning an abandoned eyesore into an oasis.
Long Island golfers will begin play Tuesday on the North Hempstead Town's Harbor Links Golf Course, part of a long-awaited improvement of a 460-acre piece of land last used for sand mining. Once littered with decaying digging equipment, conveyor belts and buried under a sea of old truck tires, the Morewood property, named for its early owners, has been resurrected into an 18-hole championship links-style layout, a nine-hole executive course, a driving range, multi-purpose playing fields and a site for senior housing. 
"This was a ravaged piece of land and we transformed it," said the North Hempstead Town Supervisor, May W. Newburger. "We made champagne out of that lemon, not lemonade."
Since most of the original land had been stripped bare over the years by sand mining companies, the course designer, Dr. Michael Hurdzan, a noted authority on golf course environmental issues, had little to work with. "There was no topsoil at all," he said. "There was sand, rock and gravel. They mined it as close to the groundwater as they could."
The $20 million construction restored more than 50 acres of wetlands to provide a renewed habitat for wildlife, and its design included the natural features of the original property, including native fescue grasses and plantings. Dr. Hurdzan, whose firm, Hurdzan/Fry of Columbus, Ohio, has designed 225 courses throughout North America, planted reeds, sedges and sweet flag in and around the course. Instead of topsoil the designer used 60,000 cubic yards of more expensive compost, which he said helps grass fight diseases and allows grass to grow with less pesticide, fertilizer and water.
"We wanted to build a golf course with as low an environmental impact as possible," said Dr. Hurdzan. The grasses used on the course are the latest in high-tech turf building. The fine fescue, bluegrass on the fairways and a disease-resistant bent grass on the greens are all low maintenance and result in less impact to the environment, according to the designer.
"This will become a model for newer golf courses," he said. "It shows that by combining old techniques with new technology you can produce a more sustainable golf course."
Port Washington sand mining began in the 1860's, and was for many years Nassau County's largest industry. Millions of tons of sand were dug, washed then shipped on barges out of Hempstead Harbor to New York City, where it was mixed into cement and used in all types of construction. The mining stopped in the early 1990's, when the sand was used up.
The huge cliffs created by the years of sand dredging were a threat to collapse, endangering nearby homes. So before any work on the golf course could be done, the bluffs, which reach up to 200 feet high, were stabilized at a cost of $4 million. Besides cleaning up the Morewood property, the town spent $42 million to clean up an adjacent 120-acre defunct landfill, part of which was designated as a superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency, according to town officials. The state reimbursed the town for 75 percent of that cleanup cost.
The Morewood property was bought by the town 10 years ago for $33 million and earmarked for a refuse incinerator project. But community opposition forced the town to scrap the plans, and the land remained unused while local residents fought over what to do with it. Environmental and civic groups formed the Morewood Coalition to help decide the parcel's fate, and after a series of meetings and public hearings, the town opted to build a golf course and senior housing.
"This was a huge burden to the taxpayers," said Ms. Newburger. "We kept refinancing the debt. By 1994 the debt was over $66 million. Taxpayers were paying a debt service of $2 to $3 million a year and getting nothing for it."
The town sold 42 acres of the Morewood property to North Shore Associates of Great Neck for $26.9 million to build 675 residential units for people 55 and older. The housing, which is still awaiting final approval from the New York State Life Care Council, will be a mix of detached, semi-attached and townhouse residences. It will also combine unassisted and assisted living with medical care.
A group called Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington has proposed the construction of a trail system that would run through the Morewood property and connect the eastern and western shores of the Port Washington peninsula. However, finding an acceptable route for the trail has met with opposition from the supervisor, who maintained that any route on top of the slopes surrounding the property could jeopardize their stability. There is also strong opposition from residents whose property abuts the proposed trail site, many fearing it will pose a security issue. Petitions opposing the trail are being collected by the Park Civic Association, which covers a good deal of the area above the bluffs.
"We had a commitment from the town for a trail system," said Kurt Trinko, a vice president of the organization. "But they put the golf course right into the cliffs so that you can't put trails around it." Mr. Trinko said the top of the bluffs have been used for trails for many decades, and although the sides of the slopes need to be stabilized, there is room for trails between the houses and the cliff edges.
The 30-year-old environmental watchdog group, which is made up of about 1,800 Port Washington residents, supports the new golf course, but would like to see the park land opened up to more people. "This is a good use of open space," said Mr. Trinko. "But a trail system allows people who don't golf access to the property."
The town is building a trail along the water at Hempstead Harbor that will connect Bar Beach with Roslyn Village. The 2.8-mile trail is partially funded by a state grant and should be completed in two years. But town officials are wary of trails through Morewood Park that might threaten the golf course and the cliffs above it.
"It's a safety and security issue," said the supervisor. "I'm committed to trails. We're building a harbor trail right now. But we will not compromise the safety of hikers who could be falling off the cliffs. We cannot allow access to the cliffs. The people who live there can't even walk there."
Many of the techniques used in building Harbor Links were taken from an earlier project, according to Dr. Hurdzan. The Widow's Walk Golf Course, opened last year in Scituate, Mass., won the National Stewardship Award from the Golf Course Superintendent's Association of America and the Golf Digest Award for Environmental Leadership. "What we learned at Widow's Walk we brought to North Hempstead and cranked it up a notch," the designer said.
Although part of the course is visible from West Shore Road, most of the bowl-shaped park is hidden and framed by the bluffs behind it like a giant amphitheater. "I think when people play this course they will be enchanted by the isolation of it," said Dr. Hurdzan. "It's like a Brigadoon. A little magical kingdom."
The Harbor Links project took 15 months from start to finish, and although it would normally take up to three years for a course to mature, its compost base has speeded up the process. "It's ready to play right now," said Dr. Hurdzan.
The par-72, 18-hole course, which will play over 7,000 yards from the back tees, is ready for business, but the nine-hole course won't be open for another month. Four modular trailers will serve as a temporary clubhouse, including a snack bar and restrooms, until a permanent clubhouse is built. A huge tent houses the golf carts.
The golf operations at Harbor Links will be managed by Arnold Palmer Golf Management of Orlando, Fla., which runs 35 other courses around the country. The town will incur all course expenses and collect all course revenue, and town officials said the course will be economically self-sustaining. "This will be one of the finest courses on Long Island," said Tom Napola, a regional director for Arnold Palmer Golf. "The town spared no expense in building it."
Greens fees for the 18-hole course will range from $15 for junior golfers 16 and under to $75 for non-residents on weekends. Residents will pay $37 on weekdays and $41 on weekends. Fees for the nine-hole course will range from $10 to $24. A $50 annual membership card will allow golfers to reserve tee times before they are made available to the general public.
Considering Long Island golfers' continuous search for a place to play the game, Mr. Napola is expecting a big crowd on opening day. "I think we're going to be swamped," he said.

HEADLINE: Island Receives Its First Heritage Trail

BYLINE: By VIVIEN KELLERMAN 

 BODY:
A 50-mile swath of the North Shore, from Great Neck to Port Jefferson and bounded by Route 25 north to Long Island Sound, has just received state designation as the Long Island Heritage Trail.
There are 15 other heritage areas in New York, but the new area is the state's second largest and the first on Long Island. 
 The legislation, which puts the heritage trail into a state Parks Department system of Heritage Areas, was signed by Governor Pataki on July 14.
"Until now, the island has been promoted individually," said Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Tourism Board. "This allows us to put a label on the Heritage Area. It implies something to a lot of people."
The action means the state has recognized that the designated area has significant cultural, historical and natural resources. The legislation does not provide any funding to help develop and promote the area, but the area does become eligible for matching state grants and other types of funding.
Over the past decade, said Marcia Ousterhout Kees, program administrator for the state Heritage Areas program, grants totalling almost $24 million have spurred public and private investment in recipient communities totalling nearly $75 million.
Originally named the Urban Cultural Park System, the program was created by the State Legislature in 1982, when the first 14 urban cultural parks were designated. In 1994, the legislation was amended to add regional heritage areas, at which time the eight-county Mohawk Valley Heritage Corridor joined the system.
The Heritage Area designation is the culmination of a campaign by the North Shore Promotion Alliance, the group that lobbied for the designation, developed the L.I. Heritage Trail theme, roughly following the northern leg of George Washington's 1790 five-day carriage tour of Long Island, when he visited the North Shore villages of Roslyn, Oyster Bay, Huntington, Smithtown and Setauket. He traveled along what is now Route 25A. Originally an Indian trail, the road is the oldest on the North Shore and is the main artery of the new Heritage Area.
Led by Gloria Rocchio, director of the Ward Melville Heritage Organization in Stony Brook, the North Shore Alliance united communities from Great Neck to Port Jefferson in a zone including 36 museums, 11 Gold Coast mansions, 6 science and nature centers, 2 state parks, 2 major performing arts centers and 2 arboretums. About 80 local and municipal groups joined forces to lobby the State Legislature and publish brochures listing points of interest in the area.
"People only think about Long Island as the Hamptons," said Ms. Rocchio. "This was disturbing to a lot of North Shore organizations. We decided it was time to bring the North Shore from behind the shadow."
Among those working for the legislation was Lisa Tyson, project coordinator for the Campaign to Save 25A. Concerned that road improvements would eventually produce a long four-lane highway changing the character of the road and the properties lining it, this group also helped to unite the various communities.
Ms. Tyson said she hopes the Heritage Area designation will ultimately help preserve Route 25A from overdevelopment.
"Now that the Parks Department has a stronger role over the area," she said, "it can tell the Transportation Department that it doesn't want widening because it doesn't conform to the plan. There's a mechanism in place."
Bernadette Castro, the State Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said that Heritage Areas have the potential to increase tourism and thereby expand the economic base. She said they draw quaint shops, lodging, restaurants, and in general elevate the quality of life.
Ms. Castro conceded that funding for the program has shrunk over the years, and with more Heritage Areas seeking to share in the same pie, much of their success depends on local initiative.
"This is a pretty big commitment by the community," she said. "The success or failure is up to the people in the area."
In the late 1970's, Seneca Falls, a small Finger Lakes community feeling the tug of economic decline, sought solutions for the present by turning to its past. The American women's rights movement started there in 1848, when Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other early suffragists gathered to issue the "Declaration of Sentiments" that first proclaimed women's right to equal treatment, including the right to vote.
The village lobbied Federal and state parks departments, which were both in the process of recognizing heritage areas, to be included. In 1980, the Women's Rights National Historical Park came under the auspices of the National Park Service and in 1982, the entire village received state heritage designation.
Later, a Heritage Area grant spurred a partnership between the Village and a private sector developer for the renovation of an old downtown building for use as a visitor center and retail/office complex. Renovation of this structure has in turn helped to revitalize Seneca Falls' downtown.
Francis Taraccilo, director of the heritage area program in Seneca Falls since 1986, said that in 1984 the village had about 10,000 visitors a year. Last year, he said, there were more than 35,000.
While funding is always a problem, he said, Seneca Falls is faring pretty well.
"What really makes the system work," he said, "is the identity, the linking up with other heritage areas in the state."
Anne Conable, coordinator of the Buffalo program since 1990, said that $1.5 million was invested into the Buffalo Heritage Area by the state parks department. Of this amount, $1.9 million has been invested in the Market Arcade Complex, a mixed-use development and the site of the visitor center. These grants, along with $15 million in public- and private-sector investment, is helping to drive revitalization of its once-renowned theater district, which in vaudeville days included 60 establishments.
Ms. Conable said that the Heritage program has helped Buffalo's economy, but that shrinking funding will make it harder to go forward.
"It's a challenge to find resources and I think that we are, in some ways, faltering a little bit," she said.
Assemblyman Steven Englebright, Democrat of Setauket, a co-sponsor of the legislation along with State Senator James J. Lack, Republican of St. James, said that the first challenge for Long Island is to develop a detailed plan including more than just the "Washington slept here" sites. The Gold Coast mansions, Sagamore Hill in Oyster Bay and the Walt Whitman home in Huntington are obvious candidates.
Mr. Englebright said a state-appointed committee including county, town, and municipal representatives will inventory the designated area to identify the areas of cultural, environmental, and historical significance. This information will be gathered into a single document to be adopted and used as a guideline for the future.
Ultimately, Mr. Englebright predicted, the designation will elevate the North Shore into a major tourist attraction. "Our harbors, bays, historic villages, define the American experience," he said. "People will spend money in our restaurants, stay in our hotels, shop in our stores. We are supporting our history in the most elegant way, without destroying the environment."
But there is no state funding for this project, which is expected to take about three years. And this cost, Mr. Englebright said, is a reminder that the program is indeed a partnership.

HEADLINE: Cash It Is, With a Local Cachet

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
IN Willimantic, some people deal in paper money that definitely didn't come from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Others ask, "Is that legal?"
Donna Nicolino tells them that yes, it's entirely legal to print and use a local currency, and doing so can improve the local economy and foster community ties. She says that's why local currencies have recently caught on in some 40 cities and towns around the country, and why she and other interested people introduced a currency called Thread City Bread in Willimantic. 
 It's printed right in town, in denominations of One Hour (meaning an hour's labor, worth $10) and Quarter-Hour ($2.50), with serial numbers on textured paper. "Hard to counterfeit," said Ms. Nicolino -- and anyway, it can't be put in banks or spent just anywhere. Like other such currencies, it's a means for people to eat, shop, get work or pay bills without anybody -- or any money -- leaving the local scene.
"We live here. We thought it was a good idea to give it a try," said Ms. Nicolino, program director for a local arts council. She noted that Willimantic has problems all too familiar wherever business and industry aren't what they used to be. "Many local businesses close after a year or so; it's hard for them to compete with malls and big stores," she said. "Many people here are unemployed or underemployed."
She and several others had read of local currencies like the Ithaca Hours of Ithaca, N.Y. They figured that local scrip -- essentially, a means of barter -- could encourage people to turn to one another, or stop downtown, for goods and services.
 As founding members of what came to be called the Thread City Bread Committee, they worked for more than a year at fundraising (getting a grant, holding tag sales). Last summer they brought out the Bread, with 74 participants and about 200 Hours -- the rough equivalent of $2,000. Now about 100 people and businesses participate, with some 320 Hours circulating. It's "not a huge amount," acknowledged John Schwenk, a committee member. But the Bread -- apparently, Connecticut's only local currency these days -- is slowly attracting attention.
The committee is readying its third issue of the Thread City Bread Directory, which lists people and businesses that will accept Hours for at least part of their regular fees. Those listing for four issues pay $5 and receive three Hours ($30); those listing for two issues pay $3 and receive 1.5 Hours ($15).
People can spend their Hours with anybody who accepts them, listed or not, decide what fraction of their fees they'll accept in Hours and at what valuation for an Hour -- in theory, the value of one hour of an individual's labor. (People can also buy the Bread, at $10 an Hour.)
So far goods and services listed have included accounting, book repairs, electrical work, food, golf lessons, house painting, Internet service, legal advice, massage therapy, storytelling, toys, word processing and yard cleaning.
 The directories -- along with brochures printed in English and Spanish -- are packed with other relevant information as well. They note that the committee's monthly meetings are open to all, with all decisions reached by consensus, not by vote. They remind people that local currencies are taxable just as cash is -- that is, tax must be paid on professional services and retail goods, but not on exchanges between individuals (like those of yard sales).
One issue of the directory described other local currencies and included an advertisement for Local Currency News, published in Great Barrington, Mass. The literature also points out that local currencies weren't uncommon in the past -- before 1913, when the Federal Reserve Act created a single national currency, or during the Depression and World War II.
The new Thread City Bread, depicting local scenes like the old thread mill that gave Willimantic its nickname, is the work of the Hall and Bill Printing Company, the same company that printed a wartime currency for the Windham area.
 From the beginning, Cindy and David Wollner, who own the combined Willimantic Brewing Company and Main Street Cafe, have accepted Thread City Bread in full payment.
"We feel it's as good as money," said Mr. Wollner, who added that he likes the way the Bread works for artists, landscapers and other people "who may not have a way to market their resources."
He's thinking of hiring a landscaper who takes payment in Bread; he already pays the Hosmer Mountain Bottling Company, which supplies soda to his restaurant, in Bread. "And they come in and pay for dinner with it," he said. "That's the whole point; it keeps the money in the community."
Another point, he said, is that since the Bread can't be deposited in a bank, "You have to spend it."
 Bill Potvin, a partner in Hosmer Mountain -- which has been making soda in Willimantic for some 80 years -- is also a fan of local currencies. "People used to shop at local stores and put money in local banks," he noted. "Chains have sucked money from our communities. When you buy in a chain, where does the money go? With Thread City Bread, you know. The money stays here."
Besides doing dinner with Hours, Mr. Potvin thinks he'll visit a fellow in the directory who sells used televisions. "I've never owned a TV in my life," he said.
 Bruce Carver Jr., co-chairman of the Windham-Willimantic Business Council, said, "A lot of people on the business council want this to succeed -- to get people to shop locally and avoid the money vaccuums, those huge, mega-mart stores."
Mr. Carver, who owns With a Wink and a Smile, a downtown toy store, will usually take 20 percent of a purchase in Hours, and sometimes more. He's ready to spend some Hours "on a killer massage."
 Bryan O'Hara, who owns Tobacco Road Farm in nearby Lebanon, will take Hours in full payment for his produce. "I produce something right off the land here," said Mr. O' Hara. "I'm interested in trying to keep money as localized as possible."
He welcomes a new Thread City Bread participant, the Willimantic Food Co-Op, which last month began accepting Hours as partial payment. "I sell a lot to the co-op and buy most of my food there," he said.
 Bruce Oscar, assistant manager, said that the co-op started conservatively, taking only about 10 percent of each purchase in Hours, to be sure that Hours taken in can be used, to pay staff and vendors, among others. He added that outside the co-op, he gets Hours for masonry and carpentry work that he does, then spends them at "barbers, restaurants and the soda company."
 Supporters hope that Thread City Bread will gain wider acceptance and use. "Promotion is the really big thing now that we've gotten the nuts and bolts worked out," said Ms. Nicolino. "We need to get more people using it." Committee members would like to see the Bread aid low-income people. They'd also like to attract more of Willimantic's Spanish-speaking residents (the Hours are printed in English and Spanish).
 All this presents challenges. "We're all volunteers," said Mr. Schwenk. "The big problems is lack of time and energy to go out and do door-to-door recruiting." Committee members point out that some larger local-currency projects are staffed through programs like Vista. They also find it's a bit difficult to get people used to the idea of looking in the directory, then calling somebody offering the goods or services they need. But, said Mr. Carver, of the toy store, "When you see a Quarter-Hour come back crumpled and torn, you know it's working."

HEADLINE: Yonkers Teachers Study Diversity

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
ONE recent morning, as the humidity soared along with the July temperature, hundreds of teachers here returned to the classroom -- only this time as students.
Like Carla Shapiro, a prekindergarten teacher, and Ron Strolovitz, a high school special education teacher, it was back to basics for educators at all levels while students bellyflopped in local pools. 
 Five hundred and seventy Yonkers teachers are taking part this summer at Saunders Trades and Technical High School and other schools in the district in the long-awaited start-up of the second phase of a federally mandated school desegregation program, which could cost more than $1.1 billion over the next eight years.
"I'm carrying a lot on my shoulders these days," said Lillian Mean, executive director for the implementation of what is officially known as Yonkers's Educational Improvement Plan, Part 2, a program intended to close a wide scholastic achievement gap between white and minority students.
As participants in a desegregation program being closely monitored by educators across the United States, elementary schoolteachers like Mrs. Shapiro as well as secondary schoolteachers like Mr. Strolovitz have come back to the classroom during their summer vacations to consider, among other things, the different learning styles and backgrounds of multicultural student bodies.
"Diversity is an important word in this city," Mrs. Shapiro observed. "Sometimes we don't realize what the children don't know. Many know their colors, but some don't. Some can't even tell me their name or where they live."
Ms. Mean said that in addition to redesigning its curriculum, the district is also reducing class size, instituting summer remedial programs, building schools, expanding psychological and social services for children, setting new achievement standards and increasing opportunities for parental involvement.
"It's a bold and risky venture," said Joseph M. Pastore Jr., the court appointed monitor in the desegregation case. The start of the second phase of the integration plan follows a Federal Court finding two years ago that the state and not just this city of 200,000, was liable for the cost of desegregating the schools, a process that began 12 years ago after findings in a Federal lawsuit.
In 1980, city officials and the Board of Education were accused by the Justice Department and later by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of intentionally maintaining racially segregated schools and housing.
After being found guilty of keeping white and minority students separate, the school district put its desegregation plan into effect. In the fall of 1986, black, Hispanic and white students boarded school buses, which crisscrossed the city to newly developed magnet schools designed to attract white students from the wealthier east side of the city to the predominantly minority districts on the west side, and vice versa.
At the same time, the court ordered the city to build public housing for members of minority groups in white neighborhoods.
And while implementation of the housing portion of the case is continuing and still under the scrutiny of the courts, school desegregation here was quickly deemed successful by most standards -- even those of Justice Leonard B. Sand, who presided over both the housing and education phases of the desegregation lawsuit in United States District Court in Manhattan.
The magnet school concept worked, officials agreed, as one by one, Yonkers schools were declared racially balanced, and resources like books and audiovisual materials were equitably distributed.
But another problem continued -- the unequal performance of minority students and white students on standardized achievement tests. Findings showed that in some grades, the gap between black and Hispanic students and all others (whites and a small percentage of Asians) actually widened on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests in the years since desegregation began.
Also, while white students represented only about 30 percent of district entrollment, they received about 76 percent of high school Regents diplomas.
The statistics also showed that black and Hispanic students were suspended at a disproportionately high rate. For example, of the 5,641 suspensions in the 1994-95 school year, 2,500 were of black students and 2,134 were of Hispanic students.
At the same time, the school population became poorer as the racial makeup changed. In 1985, just before the desegregation plan took effect, 21 percent of district children qualified for subsidized lunches. More recently, those figures reached 54 percent.
"There have been some bright spots," Lawrence W. Thomas, the Board of Education's lawyer, said, "but overall, little or no change."
Indeed, black and Hispanic students still score nearly two grade levels behind white students on standardized tests, just as they did in the early days of the desegregation drive, he said.
Burdened with the cost of desegregation, the Yonkers school board originally sued in 1987, hoping to get the state to pay part of the cost for remedying "vestiges of segregation" like the gaping disparity in test scores.
Bound by precedent-setting cases, Justice Sand found in 1993 that the state was not liable for those vestiges, in effect sending the case to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Appeals Court in 1996 ruled in the city's favor.
In this first year of the Phase 2 program, the state will pay $57 million and the city $28 million to narrow the gap between white and minority students.
On another front, some educators worry that prosperous white families, frustrated with the slow improvement of the public school system here, have moved -- or at the very least, kept their homes in the city but sent their children to mostly white private or parochial schools.
The worry is that desegregation of the Yonkers schools has contributed to a massive exodus of white parents. Minority enrollment, which represented 45 percent in 1986, has grown to 70 percent.
Contrary to what was believed several years ago, the latest research indicates that the numbers reflect predicted migration trends and not so-called white flight, Mr. Pastore, the court-appointed monitor, said.
"We knew that would happen," he said. "More than anything, the numbers reflect birth patterns and general demographic changes."
Whites who came to Yonkers from Queens and the Bronx several decades ago have moved north in the county, and they have been followed by blacks and people of Hispanic background leaving New York City and struggling up the socio-economic scale, he said.
Meanwhile, the district is placing much of its faith in the future of Yonkers' education system and the retention of students in its new Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Andre J. Hornsby, who is to begin his duties next Saturday. The Superintendent was chosen earlier this month after a nationwide search.
Dr. Hornsby was most recently Superintendent of the South Central District in Houston, which like Yonkers is a racially diverse school district. He also opened a laboratory school, along with Texas South University, in a public housing project. In both efforts, student achievement scores soared.
Dr. Hornsby "has an outstanding record of turning low-performing struggling schools into highly rated ones," Ellis B. Cousens, president of the Yonkers school board, said last week in announcing the appointment.
Dr. Hornsby, who is black, replaces Reginald F. Marra, who is white and who resigned after five years under pressure from the school board and Mayor John D. Spencer. The Mayor said he wanted a schools chief "with a fire in his belly."
As Mr. Thomas, the schools' lawyer, observed: "No longer do we have the luxury to say we can live in isolation. We need to get rid of this cultural and racial baggage that we've created in the past." The next phase of the educational program "is the best chance we've had to see if we can make a difference," he said.
How, though, does a school system measure success? Part of the answer will most likely come from Metis Associates, a Manhattan-based consulting firm hired to evaluate the Yonkers schools in the coming years. "The bottom line," said Dr. Alan Simon, vice president of the company, "will be to see if what is proposed will, in fact, happen and how the test scores will change. All eyes will be on Yonkers. Dr. Simon said cities where school desegregation has also been federally mandated will be closely following the new Yonkers' program. "It will serve as a prototype," he said.
Meanwhile, for Gladys Pack, the Assistant Superintendent for Restructuring in Yonkers and one of the architects of the second phase of the school-integration program, failure is not an option.
"Is our program going to make a difference?" Dr. Pack, who has been with the school system for 40 years, asked. "It has to."

Silhouettes at Boscobel
 Sally Newcomb has been cutting silhouette profiles of visitors to Boscobel in Garrison for a dozen years, but she has been a silhouette artist for more than 40 years. She will make her 13th appearance at Boscobel from Thursday through next Sunday, sketching and snipping from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
Ms. Newcomb, one of the rare practitioners of the silhouette, has helped create a contemporary market for an old-fashioned art. She can sketch a head in about 5 minutes, a full figure in 10 minutes and spend a few more minutes cutting out the portrait and cementing it to acid-free paper, ready for framing. 
 She works with pets as well as people and may charge extra to represent abundant fur and other details. In Edouart's day the cost of a silhouette was 25 cents. It has risen considerably, in step with inflation, but it hardly approaches the cost of a painted portrait. Heads are $20, and copies are $8; full figures are $35, copies $15, and optional frames range from $20 to $35.
Reservations for sittings must be made in advance by calling 265-3638, extension 15. There is no admission charge for people who go to Boscobel solely for a silhouette, but those who stay to roam the mansion and grounds or take one of the guided tours conducted from 10 A.M. to 4:15 P.M. are charged $7, $6 for people 65 and older and $4 for children 6 through 14. Children under 6 are admitted free.
To get there, follow Route 9D eight miles north of the Bear Mountain Bridge.
 
'Fame' in Mamaroneck
 "I'm gonna live forever," the first words of the title song in the film "Fame," expressed the exuberance of young students at the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan in the 1980's. The film and the television series developed from it were a refreshing shower of energy, exceptional talent and dedication to the arts.
La-Ma, the Larchmont-Mamaroneck Summer Musical Theater, has chosen "Fame" for its 21st season's major production, with a cast and crew of more than 30 teen-agers. La-Ma was founded by the village of Larchmont's Committee on the Arts for the purpose of giving young people an opportunity to work on every aspect of producing a musical.
Performances at the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck are scheduled on Friday at 8 P.M., next Saturday at 2 and 8 P.M. and next Sunday at 1 and 7 P.M. Tickets from $10 to $13 can be obtained by calling 833-3185 until Friday. From Friday through Sunday, prices will be $10 to $15 and the number to call is 698-0098.
 
Figurative Exhibition
 Two bronzes by the Art Deco sculptor John Manship, who created the figure of Prometheus overlooking the skating rink in Rockefeller Center, and a large work by George Segal are among five pieces in a figurative exhibition at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers through Sept. 20. A second exhibition closing on the same day is a display of paintings representing the Hudson River and its environs. All the works are in the museum's permanent collection.
"Diana" and "Acteon," the Manship works, were commissioned by Samuel Untermeyer for the gardens of his Yonkers estate, Greystone. When he died in 1940 the city inherited the estate and donated the sculptures to the museum. They are considered prime examples of Manship's style.
Mr. Segal's "Man Leaning Against a Wall of Doors" is equally typical of his technique of using plaster casts of live models rather than sculptured figures. Pop Art assemblages by Red Grooms, a Surrealist box construction by Joseph Cornell and a series of plaster casts by Rigoberto Torres of some of his students complete the display.
Included in the exhibition of 25 paintings are works by the Hudson River School artist Jasper Cropsey, aquatints dating from 1821 to 1825 and an oil of the Hudson River Steamboat Francis Skiddy by James Bard. Examples of Barbizon, Tonalism and Modernism accompany the mostly Hudson River School paintings.
The museum, at 511 Warburton Avenue, is open Wednesdays through Sundays from noon to 5 P.M., Fridays from noon to 9 P.M. Admission is $3, $1.50 for children younger than 13 and adults older than 64. Call 963-4550 for more information.
 
Cajun Food and Music
Anyone with a yen for Cajun food and music to go with it might stop by the Bayou in Mount Vernon, open seven days a week from 11:30 A.M. for lunch to midnight. Music is offered on Thursday through Saturday evenings, on alternate Monday evenings and during a gospel brunch on Sundays. Tuesday evenings are devoted to All-You-Can-Eat specials at $13.95, and Wednesday is Voodoo Night, featuring spiritual readings and free voodoo dolls.
Tomorrow night Kim Simmonds's Savoy Brown Blues Band, formed in London two years ago, will perform at 7:30 and 9:30. The group specializes in juke joint blues with rock influences. Seating at the bar carries a cover charge of $15; seating at a table with dinner is $30.
Jambalaya, crawfish etuvee, shrimp gris-gris and red beans and rice with andouille sausage are some of the entrees, priced for takeout from $11.95 to $17.95. The crawfish are flown in from Louisiana, and some of them escape the boiling pot temporarily while engaged in crawfish races. A crawfish-eating contest is held on Thursdays, and a two-pound bucket to take home costs $10, or $20 for five pounds.
The address is 580 Gramatan Avenue, and the phone number is 668-2634. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Horse Power

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
AN equine census undertaken a decade ago by the state Department of Agriculture counted 60,000 horses, divided roughly evenly between pleasure horses and racers, living on genteel estates of northwestern New Jersey, in hardscrabble urban hideaways along the Hudson River and in the Wild West expanses in the southern counties. That was an astonishingly high number for a state better known for its oil refineries. "More horses per square mile than Kentucky," local horse people began saying with pride and amazement.
A new census is now underway, with the results due in January. But crunched numbers, however illuminating for policy questions, provide only part of the picture of the state's horses and riders: a chaotic posse of aristocratic types, self-made multimillionaires, hard-working Cuban immigrants, proud African-Americans reclaiming their cowboy heritage and even a major elected official here and there. 
 In the end, of course, policy questions are important to all of them. The last census, by identifying the equine industry as a major component of the state's economy, gave it some clout. For instance, horse owners and horse farms were spending some $631 million in the state in 1986; the value of horse-related properties was over $3 billion. That information helped in passing a law allowing more tax breaks for horse farms.
Horse lovers and industry insiders say the new census should show more growth, especially in breeding. Declines are possible in the amount of acreage devoted to horses -- 120,000 acres of the state's dwindling open space -- because of the suburban sprawl that eats farms and drives out stables. More horses are expected on farmettes, those little two- and three-acre estates that will rarely, if ever, sell $1,000 worth of agricultural products, the minimum requirement to be considered a farm.
A few major changes are likely even before the census is completed. This fall's ballot features a referendum on whether to allow the Legislature to approve off-track betting. The track at Atlantic City closed this year, and a Pennsylvania OTB operator has struck a deal to buy the Freehold Raceway in September and to lease Garden State Park, in Cherry Hill, with an option to buy.
Still, at the bottom of all the policies and economics, there is a human experience, an experience that was clearly evident in rides and chats with a handful of the state's horse owners.
 
The Harness Racer
On a Tuesday at 9 A.M., Malvern Burroughs, 57, drifts into the red barn on Malabar Farm, his 90-acre spread near Flemington, in Hunterdon County. He is dressed to drive, in simple black boots and a short-sleeved blue nylon workout suit.
George Millar, the stable master, puts the harness on elegant, graceful Malabar Lady, and then Mr. Burroughs takes over, hooking the leather straps at her sides to a sleek new training cart. "I thought she could have even been faster than Malabar Man," he says, the horse with which he won the $1 million Hambletonian Stakes at the Meadowlands last year. "But her knee went."
Harness racing is mushrooming in the state, as is the breeding of the horses that do it, called Standardbreds. (Standardbreds have some bloodlines intermixed with Thoroughbreds, the kind of horses that race with jockeys on their backs).
During serious training, Mr. Burroughs drives his horses four hours a day. But today's drive is for pleasure: one loop on the two-mile dirt track laid out along the South Branch of the Raritan River. Mr. Burroughs is taking this year off. His doctors told him to do that two years ago, after quintuple-bypass surgery, but he wouldn't. Malabar Man was ready to race. This year, after Mr. Burroughs had surgery again, he decided to take a break from racing and simply focus on breeding. "Two years from now, you're going to know us by heart," says Mr. Burroughs's son Gary.
"C'mon honey, c'mon sweetheart," Mr. Burroughs says, wiggling the reins. "She's saying, 'Oh, daddy, you gonna make me pull this up the hill?' " Malabar Lady starts moving and before long, is trotting easily, the wind gently curling her black mane.
Mr. Burroughs is an anomaly in the rarefied world of harness racing. Born in Jersey City, son of an editor at The Daily News in New York, he had never met a horse. He worked. As a child, he shined shoes. As a young man, he greased trucks. He branched out into construction, and then bought up celery farms in Paramus and built office buildings there. And he won the contract to put the racing surface on the tracks at the state's new sports center, the Meadowlands. That's when he started seeing horses.
"I said, that looks like it could be fun," he recalls. "I'm 41 years old. My wife says, 'You're nuts.' "
He went to an auction, bought his first horse, taught himself to drive and started winning. Then he started breeding, and ended up with the likes of Malabar Man. "I guess I've got an eye for a horse," he says. "I guess it must be a natural ability. My grandparents must have been horse thieves in Ireland."
Mr. Burroughs believes in work, but he also believes in something else. "A lot of guys worked hard, and they never got out of Jersey City," he says, shaking his head. "I don't think I did all this by myself. Somebody more powerful than me was working on this, too."
 
The Urban Riders
In the middle of a tangle of highway ramps at the border of Jersey City and Bayonne, traffic heading to the Bayonne Bridge or onto the New Jersey Turnpike drones in the background. In the foreground, roosters crow, seven puppies yelp, uncountable cats and kittens scrabble in the hay, a pig roots in the mud, a bearded goat chews away on something or other, a dog chases a chicken just for fun. And about 30 horses snort, stamp and whinny in the wooden stalls of Campisi Stables, the last known bastion of horsedom in Hudson County.
The stable in Secaucus closed a year ago, and some of the Cuban immigrants who kept their horses there moved her. Among them are Ivan Rodriguez, who owns the Antique Bakery in Hoboken, and his 85-year-old stable mate, Evelio Hernandez.
There is also Jose Morales Jr., 17, the son of a Cuban emigre who runs a garage in North Bergen.
"Horses have been in my life since I was 5 years old," Mr. Morales said. "My dad bought me one. I said, 'What's that? That's not a dog!' "
He heads out with Angela Zapella, the 21-year-old college student who manages the stable with her husband, Frank. He is riding his jumpy palomino, Thunder, and she is on her huge, showoff draft horse, Bubba. A couple more riders join them, and the caravan heads out. Hooves crunch through the gravel along the railroad track as the horses plod under the turnpike and past the construction site of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail. It's slow going, but after an hour, they've made it the two miles to their destination: a green swath at the edge of Liberty State Park.
The horses open up: Bubba goes into a comfortable run, but Thunder shoots past with a huge noise, galloping like a movie horse till Mr. Morales has had enough and pulls the reins in tight. "Whoa! Whoa, stupid," he yells, adding a few other, less printable names in Spanish.
The horses get a few good runs in Big Skyline Country before the heat finally gets to the riders. They turn their horses to Grand Street, riding on the sidewalk, passing the used car lot and the Boy's Club. Ms. Zapella ties Bubba up at a chain-link fence and goes off to buy a soda. A van stops, and the driver stares at the horses, then gets out and follows Ms. Zapella into the store. "Can I ask you something?" she says. "This may sound odd, but . . . "
Ms. Zapella already knows; the woman has a mole on her face. "You want a horsehair? No problem." She heads outside, runs hand through Buddy's mane and hands the woman enough horsehair for a small pillow. "They tie the hair around the mole and it comes off, they say," she explains to a curious observer. "I get this all the time."
 
Black Heritage Rider
Miles Dean, 48, gets up in his tidy Piscataway ranch house around 6 A.M. and heads over to the corral he built 10 years ago. Stable work for his four horses can take a dreamy, distractable cowboy a couple of hours, and then there's a morning ride. Then lunch, followed by several hours of application to the project of the moment: trying to map the horseback ride across America he'll start in April, if he can get financial backers. The idea is to draw attention to the plight of the wild mustangs, which are being corralled and sold off at auction as sprawl removes their Western habitat.
Then the reward: the afternoon ride to visit his stallion, Tuesday's Rebel. In true studly fashion, Tuesday must be kept separately from other male horses, even geldings, or he will, in Mr. Dean's words, "assert himself."
Mr. Dean gears himself up: black suede chaps over his bluejeans, a white 10-gallon hat shading his sunglasses. He swings into the carved Western saddle he girded on Tiny Taboo, a dark bay gelding. With the reins in one relaxed hand, he and the horse walk off into another world.
"Did you know that one out of four cowboys was black?" he said. "And the cattle wrestling and other rodeo games, those were slave chores." Mr. Dean, who grew up with Western movies dancing in his head, started riding horses 20 years ago, after a road accident at the very start of the Alaskan Highway interrupted his motorcycle tour of the country. He got serious about it a few years later, he said.
He rode in shows, started the Black Heritage Riders of New Jersey, and put together a 4-H program that brought inner-city children out to Horse Heaven, as he calls his ranch. "Right away, I started taking the toughest kids," he said. He could see the change in them, as they developed a respect first for horses, and then for nature, and for other people.
When he could no longer afford to subsidize the whole effort, he returned to teaching, in Irvington, but he still gives riding lessons. In the decade he's lived here, he said, the area has changed. "Stables disappear, houses appear," he said. "Farms disappear, houses appear."
Now, he rides through the briar-lined paths behind his house, across a few suburban streets with shiny cars that often don't slow down enough, through a Rutgers parking lot and more briar-lined trails.
A sudden thunderstorm forces Mr. Dean and Tiny to take shelter under spreading trees in front of an anonymous suburban office building. Two women appear, marveling at the sight. "You can come in if you want to," one calls out. "Me or the horse?" Mr. Dean calls back, smiling.
When he gets to the friend's yard where Tuesday lives, he halts Tiny and waits. "I know he can sense us," he says. And sure enough, after a calm of a few moments, out steps the stallion, a young, bright-eyed giant. He stops at the fence, stamping and whinnying, and finally Mr. Dean dismounts, walks up, and holds his face out. Tuesday's Rebel stretches his neck, and gives Mr. Dean a gentle, horsy kiss on the chin.
 
The Governor
At the opening ceremonies of the Cowtown Rodeo in Salem County last month, the guest of honor's mount got a bit feisty.
"He wanted to get out there and do his thing," said Governor Whitman, laughing. "And that was barrel riding. It was the first time I'd been on him."
The edgy horse could have been frightening, not funny. But New Jersey has a Governor who grew up in the saddle.
"I think my first ribbon was when I was 1 and a half years old, on a lead line with a tiny little Western saddle," said Mrs. Whitman, now 51 and so busy with weightier matters that her riding occurs mainly in preparation for, and at, ceremonial events where she can draw attention to the little-known state treasures. "I love any excuse to ride," she said. "And who thinks of New Jersey as being a state with a rodeo?" And quite a rodeo, too: The event is on the national professional rodeo circuit, and dates back to 1929.
Her next appearance on horseback is Aug. 9, at the state's horsing showcase: the Festival of Horses, at the Horse Park of New Jersey in Stone Tavern, Monmouth County. The festival is a daylong celebration of the state's equine diversity: Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds will race, and riding and driving demonstrations will take place. Niatross, a world-famous Standardbred who stands stud in Cream Ridge, will also make an hourlong appearance.
Governor Whitman will ride a borrowed horse and to do some cutting, a skill that "cuts off" a cow's exit and allows the rider to control its route. Child of a monied family and inheritor of a farm in Oldwick, she rode mostly English-style growing up, but now switches easily to Western.
"The Governor is an excellent horsewoman," judged Lynn B. Mathews, the equine programs specialist at the state's Department of Agriculture. Ms. Mathews said she usually checks out the borrowed horses the Governor rides.
"You can't have horses if you can't exercise them regularly," Mrs. Whitman said.
 
The Show Jumper
The horses wear burnished saddles and padded braces around their ankles. Some have manes that are tightly braided and tails that are cropped at knee level. World-class show jumpers generally cost a million dollars or more. They almost look it, too.
Their riders wear tall, black boots, white jodhpurs and formal jackets, even when the heat is blistering, as on a Sunday when 18 riders gather to try to clinch a spot on the United State's Equestrian Team for the coming World Equestrian Games in Rome.
Nona Garson, 38, is riding three different horses, but everyone is talking about Rhythmical, the great jumper with a dramatic past, having been traded out of Russia for 150 used washing machines.
With a Diet Coke in her left hand, Ms. Garson walks intently around the 11-jump course laid out in the arena at woodsy Hamilton Farm, the Equestrian Team's home in Bedminster, in northwestern Somerset County. The riders get to look at the course, but the horses don't. That is part of the sport's peculiar challenge. So Ms. Garson is measuring: four of her strides mean one horse stride. She has to lay out her ride mentally, and then convey it with no mistakes to her horse while they ride.
To support her sport, Ms. Garson depends not on family money but on fees she earns as a trainer and operator of Ridge Farm, in Lebanon. She won her first show jumping competition in 1995, earning a spot on the United States Team at the Pan American Games in Buenos Aires, and rode for the team again in the World Cup final last year. But she has yet to represent the United States at the World Equestrian Games.
And today there are problems. Rhythmical stops dead at a fence in the first of the two rounds of competition. Known as a "refusal," that kind of flaw normally costs the rider more points, for performance and time, than knocking down a rail. But Ms. Garson remains calm and is able to retake the jump in almost no time.
That leaves one more ride. A clean ride -- no refusals, no downed rails, all within the 70-some seconds allowed -- can bring her in first, or close. She canters down the arena. A timer automatically trips when she rides into the first jump. Another jump. Turn the horse. Two jumps in quick succession. And then -- a rail down. Ms. Garson rides on, clearing every other jump perfectly.
It will take the judges more than an hour to do all the math to figure out that Ms. Garson has come in second and has made the team. But Ms. Garson's supporters know right away that she is headed to Rome. Donna Marki, one of her students, runs over to give her mentor a congratulatory hug. "Arrivederci, Nona!" she said.
For the rest of the afternoon, a smile keeps welling up on Ms. Garson's face. From the age of 5, she had loved horses, and had managed to convince her father to buy a horse farm. She has been working there since she was a teen-ager.
"Every day has been a dream come true," she says. "But I would say, this is the most exciting thing I've ever done."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Taking a Deep Breath Before Debate on Emissions

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Anyone who tried to breathe during last week's hot spell is unlikely to quarrel with the need to begin imposing tougher auto-emissions testing.
New Jersey has the second worst air pollution problem in the nation. Our air is unhealthy at least once every three days during the summer. While much of the problem is caused by pollution drifting east from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest, public health experts say that at least one-third of the state's pollution problems are caused by emissions from its five million cars. 
 For years, the Federal Government has been warning that it will impose costly sanctions unless the state adopts a stricter auto-emissions testing program. At risk is $1 billion in Federal highway funds if the state does not have a new inspection system up and running by December 1999.
New Jersey has lagged, in part because state officials bowed to political and public pressure over concern about cars failing the test and requiring costly repairs. Critics say the test means that 30 percent of the vehicles will fail. State officials say they expect the failure rate to remain closer to 15 percent.
Now, after years of setbacks and delays, the Whitman administration has announced plans to award a contract to the lone bidder for the tougher inspection system.
Under the contract, Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, a division of Parsons Inc., based in Pasadena, Calif., would add the test at 35 motor vehicle inspection stations across the state that are now operated by 402 state employees. Over the next seven years, Parsons could earn as much as $559 million from the deal.
The proposed contract has drawn criticism from some lawmakers and union officials, who oppose the plan to turn the state-operated inspection stations over to a private contractor. And some lawmakers are raising questions about Parson's decision to subcontract part of the work to politically connected New Jersey companies.
Next week, state senators have scheduled a hearing to address these questions.
"We need to ask questions about the implementation of the program, the privatization, the cost, all the issues that have been raised, " said Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican and Senate President. "It certainly deserves a new look. It's a new program with a lot of money. There has been one bid, and people have raised questions."
Among the questions are why Parsons was the only company to bid on the project. Democrats have also pointed out that Parsons awarded a $63 million engineering contract to Anthony Sartor, who is a longtime supporter and friend of Mr. DiFrancesco. Also, Parsons gave a public relations firm that employs Carl Golden, a former chief spokesman for Governor Whitman, the contract to run a public information campaign about the new testing program. The Whitman administration insists that politics did not play a role in its decision.
Although it's important to consider the role of politically connected firms at the hearing, the most pressing concern for lawmakers and taxpayers needs to be how much all of this is going to cost and whether it will cost more to turn the operation of the system over to a private contractor.
What lawmakers have not pointed out during this debate is that they cleared the way for the Whitman administration to award such a lucrative contract. It was a bill, approved in the Assembly and the Senate three years ago, that allowed the Governor to award the job of operating the new program to a private firm. The legislation gave the Whitman administration the choice of finding a contractor who would just construct the new testing system or finding a contractor who could build it and also run it. The administration, citing a cost savings of $4 million annually, accepted the proposal from Parsons to do both.
Union officials dispute the administration's analysis. Alan Kaufman, a representative of the Communications Workers of America, said that it will cost $11.7 million more annually to have Parsons, rather than state workers, run the operation.
That is a question that needs to be closely examined by lawmakers next week. Is this privatization effort going to cost the state more money than having state employees operate the lanes?
While the state contends it will save $2.07 on each inspection, the contract allows Parsons automatically to raise its inspection fee every year to match the rate of inflation in the region. That could quickly erase any projected savings.
It is unclear what lawmakers will do, if anything, after the hearing.
So why are they even bothering to hold it? Some suggest that the hearing is nothing more than an effort to provide some political cover for lawmakers should the new auto inspection program turn into a major headache for New Jersey drivers.
Mr. DiFrancesco has made it clear that he is running for governor when Mrs. Whitman's term expires. And after voter anger over auto insurance nearly toppled Mrs. Whitman last fall, he and other New Jersey politicians know that they have to be careful when it comes to imposing new programs that have anything to do with cars.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Garrard R. Beeney;
Liaison in the Irvington Waterfront Effort

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
IF politics is the art of compromise, Garrard R. Beeney, Deputy Mayor and a Village Trustee of Irvington, has had a lot of practice honing his skills the last three years. Mr. Beeney is the village's liaison on its waterfront project and as such, he has had to help bring together village, county and state officials, property owners, businesses, environmentalists and taxpayers.
 If things go as planned, by 2000 slightly more than 12 acres of waterfront property, once owned by various entities including Human-i-tees Inc. and optioned by the Tishman Speyer Development Corporation, that had sought to develop the acreage, will be a park to be used by village and nonvillage residents alike. There will be ball fields, a canoe and kayak launching site, a passive recreational area and -- most important to Mr. Beeney -- a promenade meandering along the waterfront.
 
 In helping to bring various factions together and obtain outside financing for this project, Mr. Beeney used some of the same negotiating skills he uses regularly as a partner with the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell in New York -- the firm representing Bill Gates in his current antitrust case. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Beeney:
 Q. Do you like politics?
 A. Certainly on this level I find it enormously rewarding. I think it's a nice counterbalance to my law practice in that a small initiative in a small village can really yield disproportionate, positive results.
 Q. What does it take to be a good negotiator, to bring different factions that are miles away into something?
 A. I think there are very few issues that don't have two sides to them. There are many people who think they are best heard by shouting and refusing to see whatever validity there may be in the other side's position.
 I think that is overwhelmingly wrong. I think that in order to bring two sides together you have to really put yourself in your opponent's place, do your best to solve the problems of the party you're negotiating with, without actually sacrificing your ultimate goal.
 At the same time, you have to set limits on how far you can compromise and make those limits clear, never step over them because you'll lose your credibility, and I think you have to maintain your credibility in order to bring the two parties close together. And I think you have to make clear what the other side has to lose if the project doesn't proceed.
 Q. In Irvington, on the waterfront project, there were more than two sides, correct?
A. Yes. Ultimately, we had to negotiate with two property owners who had different goals because the 12 acres down there were owned in two parts. We had to deal with the Tishman Speyer Corporation, which had an option to build condominiums at the site.
We had to deal with the county. We had to deal with the state. We had to deal with village residents. We had to deal with the environmental issues and, of course, all the residents who were interested in the project, who each wanted to see something slightly different out there. So it was really quite a project.
Q. What was the village's goal going into this?
A. I think to open up access to our waterfront. The Hudson River is a spectacular sight, and our waterfront is a spectacular piece of property. This particular site is just slightly over 12 acres, which is more than half of our waterfront. We wanted to allow our residents to enjoy it and to increase our park space, which was already quite wonderful.
Q. What was your role?
A. My official title was village liaison to the project. But this was by no means a one-man show. Our Mayor, Dennis Flood, had a lot to do with it, so, too, the administrator and the trustees. Really a lot of people had a role.
Q. What happened? You started with different parcels, different owners and lots of different opinions on what to do with the land. How did you get from there to here, where you have a proposal approved and plans starting to be implemented?
A. We spent a lot of time negotiating with the individual property owners to see if we could acquire the properties directly, but that did not work out.
But it turned out fortuitously that both of the property owners wanted to sell essentially at the same time. We didn't have the resources to purchase it outright, so we started looking for outside funding sources. And we came across the Scenic Hudson Land Trust, which agreed to put down the $5.4 million to acquire the property as long as we would do the work. The next step was to look for how to finance the rest of that.
But in the meanwhile, the two property owners had sold an option to Tishman Speyer to build residential units on the property. So while we thought we had someone who would buy the property for us, we still had to deal with someone who had very different ideas on how the property should be used.
Much to its credit, after some very extensive negotiations, Tishman Speyer agreed to step aside, and they gave us 90 days to put together a deal that was enormously complicated.
Q. Did Tishman have the zoning it needed? If not, did you still have some clout over them?
A. Exactly. And no one who was a party to the very extended negotiations with Tishman was unaware of that fact. It wasn't something that had to be hammered on the table. They realized that they had to come through us ultimately in order to do what they wanted there, and I think to a certain extent they may have seen this 90-day window as something to allow us to take a shot at.
Q. And maybe fail?
A. Yes. I don't think many people would have bet on success, frankly. But we did negotiate the deal with the landowners, and we did negotiate with them to come up with some money on their own. And fortuitously, the New York State voters had just passed the Clean Air/Clean Water Bond Act, and we've gotten a substantial chunk from that.
The whole project is about a $13 million project. Scenic Hudson put down $5.4 million, and the state has so far come up with $4.6 million; Westchester County, $265,000, and the previous owners contributed $200,000. So the village residents will end up only spending 30 cents on the dollar for the park.
Q. So what will this be?
A. It will be 12.1 acres of green park. It's going to be developed probably in four phases, although we're only committed to the first phase. In the first phase, we're going to have soccer, football, baseball and Little League fields, a kayak-canoe launch into the Hudson River, passive lawn recreation in the southern part of the park, which really has the nicest views, a new senior citizens center and, I think most significantly, a really lovely promenade that will meander along the Hudson River.
About 1,700 feet runs along the Hudson River, and we've designed the walkway so that it both goes along the river and then steps back so people can also sit and enjoy the river.
Q. Irvington is a pretty homogenous community, racially and economically. Did that help you obtain the strong taxpayer support you needed for the project?
A. What you said is half true. It is racially homogenous, but economically not by any means. We have a number of large rental buildings and some condominiums in the village, so that the village is quite disparate. When you talk about this project increasing taxes by 2.75 percent for the years that we have to issue the bonds, you have to take very seriously that while it may be $80 or $90 a year for the average village resident, that does have a significant impact on a significant portion of our population.
I'm lucky enough to be probably an overcompensated practicing lawyer on Wall Street, but I think you have to understand other people's views and their other walks of life. This is a significant issue to people.

HEADLINE: The Precarious Future of the Baltic Mill

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
SINCE the looms producing cotton fell silent in 1967, the capacious floors of the Baltic Mill in the town of Sprague have echoed with little but the sound of rain and wind sluicing through its leaking roof or cracked windows -- and speculation about the future of the old mill on the Shetucket River.
Will it be demolished, the granite from its majestic facade harvested, its asbestos roof cleared away? Will it be preserved as a museum, a faded yet fiercely beautiful reminder of the industrial age? Or will its 230,000 square feet be rehabilitated somehow? 
 There is no answer yet. Just a few things are certain: The estimated cost of tearing it down -- $300,000 to $600,000 -- or the cost of rehabilitating it -- $5 million to $10 million -- have thus far exceeded the budget of any interested parties. In addition, the town is owed some $190,000 in back taxes. Each day it sits vacant, what was briefly the largest cotton producing mill in the Western hemisphere suffers a bit more.
To Roger Hunt, who sees the mill's past as halcyon and its ideal future as rehabilitated, further deterioration is particularly painful. Mr. Hunt, age 67, is the sole remaining member of the Baltic Village Viancy, a nonprofit group that bought the mill for $2,400 in 1994 to prevent its destruction. It is he who spends enormous time and energy as a self-described "Jack Straw," patching up its most egregious damage and brainstorming to preserve it.
A slight, bespectacled man whose commitment to the mill is strikingly devoid of sentiment, Mr. Hunt is a retired engineer who lives in Worcester, Mass. His relationship with the Baltic Mill began with a position on the board of the Quinebaug-Shetucket Heritage Corridor, an organization dedicated to preserving the landscape and character of some 25 hill and mill towns in eastern Connecticut that border the two rivers for which the group is named.
The other members of the Baltic Village Viancy dropped out when asbestos was discovered on the mill roof; asbestos fall-outs at other mills have yielded clean-up bills of more that $1.5 million.
Mr. Hunt was not deterred. "I wasn't really that much worried it would bother me financially because I live on a shoestring," he said, standing near his small, rusted car.
Still, he regrets that addressing safety issues at the mill has diverted his attention from securing state or Federal grants (the mill and the village of Baltic are National Historic Register Sites) or finding a suitable developer.
No one disputes that the mill is a strong symbol of industry's heyday and an architectural pleasure. Sprague, a town of 8,448 acres, is composed largely of three villages: Baltic, Versailles and Hanover. Today about 3,000 people live in Sprague; when the mill flourished some 3,000 lived in the village of Baltic alone.
Built with random-square granite, the mill's hundred-feet-high tower is flanked by five floors with close to 1,000 paned windows. The first mill on the site, which employed some 1,400 people, was built in 1856. It burned down 31 years later and was rebuilt by Frederick Sayles of Rhode Island in 1895. At one time, the mill supplied electric power to a few towns, the Taftville Mill and the Norwich Street Railway Company as well as 1,600 looms.
The Sprague Town Historian, Dennis Delaney, said a company store sold everything from hardware to food to the mostly French and Irish mill workers. Many of the houses in Baltic were owned by the mill, rented to its employees until they were sold at public auction in 1939.
Although he acknowledged the financial magnitude of preserving it, Mr. Delaney said if and when the mill is razed, Baltic will lose its identity. "Here you have all these mill houses and no mill," he said.
"When I was a young kid, 8, 10 years old, I used to live on the hill across the way," said the Sprague First Selectman, Stephen J. Papineau. "When the 6 o'clock whistle blew I would look out my window and see the blue-tinted glass on top of the building and know the workers were heading in. It was very beautiful."
Yet pragmatism reigns in his response to rehabilitation. A museum? "That's not going to bring me any tax dollars," he said. He is also concerned about the threat to trespassers and the entire community should the mill collapse or a fire release environmental toxins in the air. "There are more people who want to tear it down than rehabilitate it," he said in summary.
Mr. Papineau echoes other town officials when he says the best hope would be the mill's destruction to make way for development of the 17-acre site. Alawyer assessing a tax foreclosure action -- a few were instituted in the past and ultimately expired -- hints a new action may be imminent. With the right proposal, the town might forgive the tax lien, said Richard Cody, the Mystic lawyer handling the case.
The footbridge to the mill is now rusted and knee-high grass covers the path workers once took to the eight-foot-high pair of entry doors. They then proceeded up a 16-foot-wide staircase, which Mr. Hunt removed after its collapse. Inside, ceiling heights range from 14 to 18 feet. But the wooden floors, warped by rain, are buckled. Broken glass crunches underfoot. An orange cat emerges from a crack in the staircase and trails Mr. Hunt on a tour. Keeping the curious or foolhardy out is nearly impossible.
Mr. Hunt has marked off particularly dangerous areas with yellow tape and has tacked up warning signs. He has spoken with the children who like to race mountain bikes on its stretches of rain-puddled floor.
"In the beginning, kids would bust windows, but once I spoke to them about it, they stopped," he said.
It was competition from Southern and overseas mills that ultimately shut down the Baltic Mill. It functioned as a mail-order house in the 1970's, then languished, briefly housing a fiberglass boat manufacturer who left mysteriously and abruptly, leaving behind dozens of kayak shells.
The hope of Mr. Hunt to preserve the mill burns brightest in the nebulous darkness of the hydropower room. Here one can still see the 40-foot-long penwheel that carried water from the Shetucket River to power the turbines, two of which remain. "We thought of having wine and cheese parties in here," he smiled.
Other mills in eastern Connecticut have received the support and attention necessary to rehabilitates them. For instance, the River Mill in North Grosvernordale was reinvented as space for manufacturing, warehousing and an aquaculture enterprise that recycles water from fish farming. The Dayville Mill is now a fitness center and the Belding Mill Complex in Putnam houses two light-manufacturing companies and offices.
Charlene Perkins Cutler, executive director of the Quinebaug-Shetucket Heritage Corridor, which awarded $10,000 grants to these mills and others, and whose great-grandfather was superintendent of the Baltic Mill, speculated as to why Sprague was passed over: enormous size, out-of-the way location and environmental issues. In addition, a comprehensive plan for its future seemed to take a back seat to the concern of what tax dollars the site would yield, she said. "They lacked a vision," she summed up. "They never came up with a clear concept of what to do with the property."
But Tom McAvoy, First Selectman of Sprague from 1989 through 1996, and current chairman of its economic development commission said it was money, not vision, the town lacked. He estimated a 30 percent increase in taxes would be necessary to pay the bonded debt necessary to preserve the mill.
The latest proposal being considered is from a company with a history of razing old mills and clearing environmental hazards, Mr. McAvoy said. Neither town officials nor Mr. Hunt would name the developer.
Bruce Clouette, who photographed and studied the mill's history as a project for the state historical commission, suggested the town consider saving at least a component of the mill, such as its eight-story tower. "It is the predominant feature of Sprague and for 130 years the town's existence was defined by the mill," he pointed out.
Certainly the life of Lawrence Arpin was defined by the Baltic Mill. Now 79 years old and retired for 20 years -- he served as an electrician in the Navy -- Mr. Arpin still lives in the house where he was raised with five siblings. In the 1930's, his father, an electrician for the Baltic Mill, rented it from the mill for $2.20 a week; his weekly pay was $18.
"We weren't rich," Mr. Arpin said. But, he added, "Big families were raised in the two- and three-bedroom houses."

HEADLINE: Fairness and the Fed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is concerned that a tight labor market might lead confident workers "to place gradually escalating pressures on wages and costs, which would eventually feed through to prices" (Business Day, July 22). Let me get it straight: A robust economy has failed to make an impact on the real wages of workers, while a spectacular stock market has showered the most privileged with ever greater wealth. Now that wages are starting to catch up, the Fed thinks it might be necessary to apply the brakes to dampen inflation. 
 By what concept of equity must those at the bottom of the ladder bear the burden of protecting the economic well-being of the most advantaged?
