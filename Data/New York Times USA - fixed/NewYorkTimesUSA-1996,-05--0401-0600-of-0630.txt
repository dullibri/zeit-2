HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
And in the Long Run We Should Win

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. KOPPES; Richard H. Koppes is deputy executive officer and general counsel of the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public employee pension fund with $98.5 billion in assets.

 BODY:
LAST Thursday, President Clinton put the spotlight on excessive corporate profits and exorbitant layoffs by holding a party at the White House to congratulate those companies that "do well" by their employees and their shareholders.
The Administration, however, may want to take to the woodshed the real culprits of corporate greed: the boards of directors that have allowed "the hollowing out" of America's corporations to obtain short-term increases in stock prices. 
 That statement may be surprising, coming from the nation's largest public pension fund and one of this country's strongest advocates for good performance. But contrary to assumptions being made in some board rooms of the United States, Calpers, the California Public Employees Retirement System, is not pushing to bump up short-term stock prices. We are a company's long-term patient capital and are troubled when companies sell out to short-term Wall Street traders.
So let me set the record straight: Calpers opposes layoffs to lift stock prices in the near term. This is wrong and will not work to create wealth over the long run. One public pension fund official put it best recently when he said, "You can shrink your way to profitability in the short term, but it isn't the road to greatness in the long run."
Calpers doesn't condone what's going on. We won't participate in that kind of greed. And we intend to be a constructive voice to change it, by demanding high-quality, independent directors.
How did America's corporations get to this point? To understand, we need only examine the evolution of the balance of corporate power over the last decade.
When investors began to zero in on corporate governance issues in the early 1980's, management held most of the power that might rightfully have belonged to the company's directors and its share owners.
As corporate governance activism grew, share owners, from the short-term Wall Street traders to the long-term investors like Calpers, became increasingly influential, and managers began to heed their share owners' bidding. Some managements overresponded to the point that they were willing to slash human assets to improve stock prices.
Either way, the balance of power is out of whack, this time having swung too far toward share owners. Institutional investors recognize it is not their role to govern the company. That is the responsibility of the board. Only the directors can insure that neither management nor share owners hold an unequal share of the power.
How do they do that? They can learn a lot from the Chrysler Corporation and what transpired when Kirk Kerkorian vigorously sought to distribute more of Chrysler's $7.5 billion in cash to shareholders last year.
Chrysler is led by a strong, independent board that is strategically focused and knows the business. It could resist Mr. Kerkorian's proposal because it engaged its directors, managers and investors in debating what was best for the company. "None of our institutional owners asked us to change directions," Chrysler's chairman, Robert J. Eaton, said in a recent speech to the Economic Club of Detroit. "Not one of them told us to compromise the future for the sake of today." In the last five years, Chrysler has added more than 15,000 hourly workers while creating impressive share-owner value. At its own pace, it has moved to give share owners more money, including another dividend increase last week.

THE approach taken by Chrysler's board thus serves as a model for how to remedy the needless "hollowing out" of the corporation. Strong, independent boards must be formed with directors who will individually and collectively ask questions about proposed layoffs to satisfy themselves that the layoffs are motivated by a strategic plan for long-term growth, not a desire to increase the stock price.
What critics of public pension fund investors do not realize is that we don't care about next quarter's stock price or even this year's stock price. As the company's patient capital, we hold our positions for a decade or longer.
Therein lies Calpers's next stage of corporate governance activism. We will be looking for measures of performance that are based not simply on quarterly earnings and the most recent rise in the stock price.
We will be examining how a corporation is positioned for the long term. Part of that screen will be an evaluation, for example, of whether executive compensation is rewarding short-termism and whether the company has placed true value on its workers.
Calpers will continue its focus on board structural issues with an expansion into board performance, evaluating directors individually and collectively. Among the key questions it will ask is whether the position of board chairman or chairwoman is separate from that of the chief executive. If the positions are combined, is there an independent director as lead outside director to act as a counterbalance to the power of the chief executive? We will also want to know if directors own enough stock to make themselves meaningful owners.
When we meet with directors, we'll be asking them what they have done to add value to their company. We will look at issues that affect their own objectivity and their ability to devote sufficient time to board work: the number of boards they serve on and whether they represent cross-directorships, for example.
We shouldn't let the underperformers with bloated payrolls off the hook. But Calpers and many other institutional investors will continue to advocate real long-term growth and recognize, as Mr. Clinton did on Thursday, those who resist short-termism. We will listen to quality boards that commit to actively pursue long-term growth.
With this structure in place, America will see an end to what's been called the "looting of corporate America's human capital." It can't happen soon enough.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Inflation Bonds: Now Is Not The Time

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Indexing bonds to inflation is, to hear the advocates tell it, a win-win situation for everybody. The buyers of bonds get inflation protection, while the sellers -- the Government -- get lower financing costs and a needed incentive to hold down inflation.
Don't bet on it. The chances are that such bonds, which Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin says will be issued by the Government, will prove a better deal for the buyers than for the Government, which will benefit in the short term, but suffer later. 
 There should be nothing surprising about that. Individuals are concerned with what happens 10 or 20 years out. That is why you save for retirement; if you don't, you'll be the one who suffers. But mayors, governors and presidents come and go. They do care about long-term issues, but they are primarily concerned with the current budget and the next election.
That helps to explain why Governments of all levels are in such fiscal trouble. Decades ago, mayors and governors across the land cut deals that saved money on salaries then by inflating pension benefits later. As the bills come in now, those mayors and governors have long since retired. Similarly, the Reagan fiscal excesses now constrain the Federal Government.
Here's what might happen after inflation-indexed bonds are introduced: First, the Treasury's apparent borrowing costs will fall. That is because the bonds will have a stated interest rate of 3 or 4 percent. The coupon payments will rise over time, but it will be years -- and administrations -- before they start to bite. That will free up a little space in near-term budgets.
At the same time, investors given protection against inflation may be less bothered by it. Not everyone is really against inflation. It benefits borrowers (at fixed rates) and those who own assets that are appreciating, like real estate in the 1970's. It hurts those living on fixed incomes. But not if those incomes are no longer fixed.
Then there is the impact on the stock market. It has risen with the flood of money from baby boomers worrying about retirement. They could be attracted by the promise of assured purchasing power without the risks of a speculative stock market.
Mr. Rubin argues that these bonds have an added value -- inflation protection -- for which buyers will pay. "We are offering a unique and very valuable investment vehicle," he said when asked if a future Treasury Secretary might rue the day such bonds were issued. "We should get a price that lowers our cost of capital." On average and over time, he has a good point.
But averages can deceive, and this may be the worst possible time to introduce these bonds. In 1981, when Britain took the step, inflation fears were high and interest rates were soaring. It was a clever move for the British Government, which saved a lot of money as inflation fell.
Now, however, inflation is low. "That makes it a good time for the Government to show confidence, because the confidence will be justified," says Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. More likely, it will be seen as an indication of overconfidence near the bottom of the inflation cycle.
That said, this does not have to be too damaging to the Government, even if the bonds do prove to be great investments for the buyers. If the Government issues them as alternatives to short-term borrowing (whose rates will rise with inflation anyway), the fiscal harm will not be great.
But it is still bad timing.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
A Bear on Stocks Who's Outrunning the Bulls

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
ONE week, inflation fears grab the stock market by the throat. The next week, they all but dissipate.
Amid the jolts, stock investors keep scoring solid gains. But a select group of investors, those most concerned about rising prices, have done extraordinarily well this year. They have flocked to precious metals, commodities and natural resources. Such assets, they say, represent the best opportunity because inflationary pressures are building in the economy. 
 Whether prices really soar in coming months -- something much in dispute -- money managers who espouse this theory are enjoying at least a short stay in the sun.
One of them is Richard H. Fontaine, who started a group of funds under his own name after many years at T. Rowe Price, the fund company in Baltimore. After five lean years, the bounty is sweet.
A superstar at the helm of T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation fund in the late 1980's, Mr. Fontaine anticipated the 1987 market crash and bought aggressively afterward, delivering average annual returns of nearly 40 percent.
But his record cooled shortly after he opened his own company in Towson, Md., in 1989. He contended that equities were experiencing a speculative bubble, though the stock market persistently defied him by rising ever higher. He acknowledges that he was at least five years early. "Let's face it," Mr. Fontaine said recently, "I'm a bear."
Because of lackluster returns, his total assets under management have shriveled to $100 million from four times that amount at their peak. His three no-load funds remain far too small to be listed in most newspapers and magazines. The best of his funds this year has been Fontaine Global Growth, also the smallest, with a gain approaching 50 percent through May 7. Fontaine Capital Appreciation, the biggest and the only one listed on Nasdaq, has gained nearly 30 percent this year, and Fontaine Global Income is up nearly 20 percent (800 247-1550).
One thing is for sure: Mr. Fontaine puts his own money behind his predictions. As of April 1, he and his wife owned 44.6 percent of Fontaine Global Growth. The fund had only $1.3 million in assets on May 6 but has since swelled to $1.8 million.
Since its inception, the fund has an annualized return of 13.31 percent, compared with 11.62 percent for world stock funds on average. In truth, though, it is less a global fund than a natural resources fund. Mr. Fontaine, 44, continues to believe that financial assets like stocks and bonds are grossly overvalued and concentrates on defensive positions in gold mining and similar stocks.
"I've long thought that if things went the way I expected, the last thing to go up before the market goes down is inflation-related stocks, especially gold," he said. "If you inflation adjusted the price of gold back to 1934, the current price should be about $470 to $490 an ounce, and I believe it will go to that level and beyond." Despite a run-up this year, gold is trading at less than $400.
Chuck Zender, managing director of the Leuthold Group, an institutional research firm in Minneapolis, says Mr. Fontaine has been quite consistent in his outlook and that the market has simply come around to him.
Right now, about 65 percent of the global fund's assets are invested in mining and exploration companies, and 5 percent are in international oil companies. Rounding out the portfolio is a handful of retailers, insurers and others with depressed prices -- all favorites of the value-oriented stock picker. In terms of foreign exposure, more than half the fund's assets are in Canadian mining and exploration companies, with just 25 percent in the United States. Cash has risen to 15 percent because of new money.
The fund has an extremely permissive charter, meaning it can concentrate on a few stocks, a few countries or even cash if the manager desires. "Have I left myself a lot of latitude?" Mr. Fontaine asked. "Yeah. I've been doing this a long time, and the last thing you want to do is get caught up in your own restrictions."
Still, to meet the requirements for diversified stock funds, Fontaine Global cannot have more than 25 percent of its assets in one industry. For that reason, Mr. Fontaine has had to reduce some positions recently. Last week, he said, he finished selling his stake in Black Swan, a Vancouver-based mining company with interests in Australia. He bought the stock, traded in Toronto, for 24 cents a share and sold on Thursday for about $1.40. Stocks like that hint at the fund's risk level.
Much of the fund's return this year can be attributed to Golden Star Resources, a gold and diamond exploration company based in Denver. Golden Star's shares, traded on the American Stock Exchange, represent about 12 percent of the fund.
Even though the stock soared last week to $17, from the $5 Mr. Fontaine paid last year, Golden Star remains much more promise than reality. It has negligible earnings and operates in the Indiana Jones end of the gold business. Its geologists slash their way through rain forests from Africa to South America in search of a big deposit. When they find it, they negotiate mineral rights with local governments and then sell interests to mining companies, who put up the capital for development but share up to half of the profits with Golden Star.
The company's shares plunged last year after cyanide-laced water spilled in an accident at the Omai gold mine, the largest in Guyana, of which Golden Star owns 30 percent, Mr. Fontaine said.
The stock's price has risen sharply this year because of a discovery of diamonds in nearby French Guiana. Though Mr. Fontaine puts the chance of successful development at less than 20 percent -- it can take years to determine if diamond deposits are dense enough, and of sufficient quality, to make mining profitable -- he said the mine's value could be billions of dollars.
At the other end of the mining spectrum is Inco Limited, a Toronto company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Inco, one of the Fontaine fund's biggest holdings, is a producer rather than an explorer and specializes in base metals rather than precious metals. It is the largest producer of nickel, used in stainless steel.
Late this month, Inco is scheduled to acquire Diamond Fields, which burst onto the scene a year and a half ago with the discovery of a spectacular deposit of nickel in Newfoundland. The ore is unusually pure, located near the surface and easily accessible to ocean-going vessels.
The acquisition will greatly dilute earnings for Inco shareholders, and the stock price has suffered. The shares traded at $33.125 on Friday, compared with more than $40 last year.
Mr. Fontaine continues to add to his Inco position, however, and supports the company's management. "I think they will use cash flow to buy back a lot of the shares issued to buy Diamond Fields," he said, "Here is a big blue chip that will probably be a 50 percent performer over the next year or two. So even if you think the market is overvalued, as I do, this company is not."
Companies out of favor are manna for value investors, and Mr. Fontaine has a few plays outside the mining world. One favorite is Wal-Mart, the retailer whose stock is trading at half its $42 peak three years ago.
While examining mining properties in Brazil recently, Mr. Fontaine noticed that the chief topic of local conversation was the opening of a Wal-Mart. "They were talking like they did in New England three or four years ago," he said.
In just a few years, foreign sales have risen from nothing to 4 percent of Wal-Mart's total. "We expect that they'll be able to double that percentage over the next five years," Mr. Fontaine said.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Lessons of Flying in a Free Market

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
HOURS after the Valujet crash last weekend, the airline's president and the Transportation Secretary closed ranks, guarding each other's backs from an onslaught of questions about the safety of Valujet and other airlines overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration.
"The F.A.A. has been highly complimentary of the steps that we have taken," said Lewis H. Jordan, Valujet's president. Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena repeated time and again that Valujet and other start-up airlines were safe: "They have been responsive. They have been very cooperative. Valujet is a safe airline, as is our entire aviation system." 
 The script had played out in previous crashes involving other airlines. But it did not work so well this time.
Aviation experts found ready audiences for their concerns about Valujet and other budget airlines. The Transportation Department's inspector general, Mary F. Schiavo, embarked on dawn-to-dusk tours of news programs to suggest that the F.A.A. was to blame for the crash because of holes in its safety net. Travelers canceled bookings not only on Valujet, but also on other airlines with less familiar pedigrees.
The public response was not unjustified. The F.A.A. released an internal report on Friday that showed it had had ongoing concerns about Valujet's safety and its own ability to oversee the airline.
But consumers' sharp reaction also illustrated a paradox: The critics scolding Valujet and the F.A.A. were, in a broad sense, the same travelers whose demands for low fares and less government have prodded the airline and the agency to strain to be all things to all people.
Before Flight 592, from Miami to Atlanta, crashed into the Everglades last Saturday killing all 110 people aboard, Valujet and the F.A.A. appeared, in many respects, to be succeeding.
In fact, Valujet's rapid rise has been unequaled in modern aviation. When it started almost three years ago, it made a splash as a fun airline, with a cartoon plane painted on the side of its aircraft. Its double-digit fares earned the airline even more free publicity than the games its flight attendants used to entertain passengers -- win a prize if you guess the number of sheets of toilet paper rolled out along the aisle!
Valujet had the formula for economy: It bought used DC-9's, with an average age of 26 years, from airlines around the world. With each new plane, its stock soared higher in anticipation of even more profitable growth. Cities on the East Coast and in the South wooed the airline with offers of marketing dollars. Its DC-9's were filled with bargain hunters; a Miami-to-Atlanta ticket that cost at least $200 on larger airlines, for example, could be had for $59 on Valujet.
Signs of trouble caused no great alarm; an accident last June, when a plane caught fire on a runway in Atlanta, injuring four passengers, did little damage to business.
But amid the second-guessing of last week, doubts about the Valujet formula suddenly abounded. Questions piled on about whether the inexpensive fleet was in fact a liability.
"Was it responsible of you to grow this airline at such a remarkable rate?" Mr. Jordan was asked at a news conference. "We never grew the airline faster than we could be sure that we were operating safely and reliably," he replied.
But rapid growth takes its toll in the airline business, said Bob Iverson, a founder and former chairman of Kiwi Airlines. "The faster you grow," Mr. Iverson said, "the more difficult it is to keep up with managing the ever-expanding problems."
In hindsight, he said, increasing Kiwi's fleet to 15 planes in two years now seems too fast. In a little more than two and a half years, Valujet's fleet grew to 51 planes.
Those planes added to the F.A.A.'s mushrooming portfolio of responsibilities, which include certifying pilots and the private planes and jets they fly, airlines, repair stations, and pilot training and maintenance schools. The effects of industry deregulation in 1978 are still being felt, with new airlines starting all the time. Worldwide passenger traffic climbs every year, and the F.A.A. is increasingly playing the role of watchdog over its counterparts in foreign countries to insure that their aviation systems are safe for Americans.
 
 
 
Baked-In Problems
 The agency has at times been hampered by some baked-in management problems -- like a lack of accountability among its 2,600 front-line inspectors -- that have been described by Government oversight agencies and news reports, as well as in recent Congressional hearings. But the F.A.A., in taking its share of broad Federal budget cuts, has been left with antiquated technology. When it has had money to invest in new equipment, arcane Government procurement rules have contributed to misguided investments.
On most days, the constraints do not appear to anyone outside the organization as a problem. Flying, after all, is statistically the safest form of transportation, and the F.A.A. regularly takes some credit for that fact. So the agency never complains publicly that its resources are stretched too thin, which would suggest that it can't do its job.
But what is its job? Very often, top managers spend more time on public relations than much else, explaining to the media, politicians and oversight agencies what its statistics and regulations mean, why something is not as troubling as it might appear, and why it cannot simply shut down an airline unless it has a reason that it can defend in a court of law.
"Who in the F.A.A.'s senior management has time for improving safety?" said Clark Onstad, a former F.A.A. chief counsel.
The F.A.A. was defending itself last week against criticisms about the safety of Valujet and other airlines. It had a similar week only last month, when it tried to explain why it was not partly to blame for allowing 7-year-old Jessica Dubroff to fly the plane in which she was trying to cross the country when she crashed, along with her father and an instructor. In the F.A.A.'s eyes, Jessica was not technically piloting the aircraft, since the agency had not licensed her to be a pilot.
The logic was difficult to get across, and an angry public was not satisfied. So the F.A.A. once again pledged to review its rules.

TREASURY BONDS
 
Inflation? Let It Rain
When the Treasury announced those inflation-proof bonds last week, it voiced a lofty goal: to get Americans, notorious spendthrifts, to save more. Well, O.K. But it surely also had its eye on that juicy $675 billion sitting in 401(k) plans -- money that, given inflation fears, rarely finds its way into Treasury bonds. It would love a chunk of that to help with its own spendthrift ways. And what of the impact on inflation? It's a proven fact that if you take an umbrella, it won't rain. But could it be that the opposite is true here? Say you take out that umbrella, buying bonds that give you peace of mind, inflation or not. But then, with people less worried about inflation, there might be less pressure to fight it, allowing inflation to creep in more easily.
 
HEALTH CARE
 
Doctors Strike Back
Today's episode of the health care mini-series is called "The Doctors Strike Back." Doctors haven't been happy about all this new managed-care stuff, this H.M.O. stuff, this cost-cutting stuff -- because, of course, it's their income that's being squeezed. When these changes started emerging, doctors were scattered about, alone, clinging to their independence. But gradually they started to band together, often by selling their practices to emerging companies that manage their affairs -- and, more to the point, beef up their bargaining power. That trend reached the big time last week as one such company, Medpartners/Mullikin, agreed to buy another, Caremark, in a $2.3 billion deal. The result: a giant among doctor-office managers, strength in numbers for doctors.
 
AUTO MAKERS
 
G.M.'s Hometown Bet
Busy times in Detroit last week. General Motors, in a stroke, tilted the city's map by buying the 73-story Renaissance Center, planning to move its base camp there. The landmark, built in 1977 at a cost of $350 million, had since plummeted in value in a shaky city, but G.M.'s move sent hopes soaring for a revitalized downtown. An added bonus: whenever any rude person rubs G.M.'s nose in how well Ford is doing, G.M. can respond: "Ford? Oh, that's just one of our tenants." Ford, you see, occupies one tower at the center. And the third Detroit heavyweight was also in the news, as Chrysler -- feeling peppy with its wallet full and its stock price high -- spread the wealth a bit, splitting its stock and lifting its dividend.
 
TOBACCO WARS
 
Advertise No Evil?
Philip Morris and U.S. Tobacco said last week that to reduce teen-age smoking they wanted legislation to ban vending-machine sales, giveaways and sports advertising. Their condition: that the F.D.A. back off from more stringent regulations, which among other things would make alluring figures like the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel far less visible. That's a free-speech issue, they say. So, should the Government try to shield people from things that, though legal, are bad for them? As it happens, the Supreme Court just gave a strong hint of its thinking. "The First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical" of such limits, Justice John Paul Stevens said as the Court struck down a Rhode Island ban on advertising liquor prices -- a ban aimed at reducing consumption by discouraging price wars.
 
CAMPAIGN CASH
 
Mr. Dole's Thin Wallet
Some ungenerous souls have been known to suggest that money buys votes. Shocking, yes, but if it's true, Bob Dole won't be able to go on much of a shopping spree for voters until the Republican Convention. Federal rules say you can spend only $37 million before being nominated, and Senator Dole has gone through nearly all that, while Bill Clinton has more than $20 million to go. As a Senator, of course, Bob Dole makes news just by coughing, and he can use things like the Capitol steps or Newt Gingrich as photo props. But part of his gamble last week -- to downsize himself to mere Mr. Dole -- is that he's giving up all that nice free coverage. And he's doing it just when the Government -- the Government he's distancing himself from -- is keeping him from paying to get his message out.
 
GAMES KIDS PLAY
 
Did Nintendo Get Devoured?
Remember Nintendo? Not long ago, if preteen-agers were sitting in front of a screen playing games, it was a good bet that Nintendo was there. But while Nintendo was slow to get out spiffed-up machines, computers have been learning all sorts of new tricks. So when it previewed its latest game machine last week -- well behind schedule -- it ran the real risk of being a year late and a modem short. The coming thing, analysts say, is multiplayer games over the Internet. So "progress" continues: from children playing with friends in the backyard, to having a solitary basement game staring at a TV screen, to playing, say, Command and Control with some faceless person in Montana.
 
ACCIDENTS
 
Plane Safety: The Age Issue
Plane crashes, like the gallows, tend to focus the mind -- and the media. True, more people probably died in car accidents the day 109 people were killed in the Valujet crash. But the 109 died all at once, and they died on a fledgling airline, so safety was instantly a big topic. There may have been risky cargo, but what about the age of planes? A lot of airlines fly old planes -- and experts say age is no handicap as long as they're maintained properly. But the fact remains that Valujet has, on average, the oldest fleet in the air. And the doomed plane had been forced to return to airports seven times in the last two years for safety problems.
 
GLITZ
 
Times Square Tunes Out
What price civilization? As Times Square paints its porch, tidies up its flower bed and clears the garbage off its front lawn, one can't help wondering if the place will still feel like home -- home sweet garish home. Will New Yorkers be deprived of such basics as that giant TV screen shouting its images at the passing throng? Well, for now, yes. Sony is turning off the Jumbotron on June 1, when its six-year lease expires. But don't despair. Though Sony said it was a cost-cutting move, the true reason might be that the technology for these huge screens has leaped ahead since 1990, as technologies tend to do. Maybe something bigger and better and sharper is on the way. Maybe they can even get cable.
 
MUTUAL FUNDS
 
Magellan's Detour
Fidelity Magellan. The very name used to make other mutual funds tremble. Magellan's spectacular returns drew so many investors that it came to dominate the fund landscape. This year the giant has stumbled, though, with returns far behind the curve. Why? Because Jeffrey Vinik, Magellan's manager, got nervous late last year and put a lot of fund money into bonds and cash. And in Magellan's annual report, just out, Mr. Vinik goes public about his thinking, saying he saw mounting speculation in the vast sums flowing into funds. While he expects no crash, he called stocks "expensive" and said he was "cautious." So if stocks fall, he's a hero; if they don't, he's a nervous Nellie. It's a fickle world.

HEADLINE: The World;
This One Just Might Be a Real Trade War

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE UNITED STATES took on China over a pirating of America's intellectual property for the first time in 1903, when trademarked foreign products first started flowing out of Chinese factories. The Chinese figured that if they signed an agreement and ignored it, Washington would soon forget about the whole thing. They were right.
Ninety-two years later China's leaders signed another accord, this time promising to keep their hands off Winnie-the-Pooh videotapes and Windows 95 CD-ROM's. Then, figuring that some strategies work as well at the end of the century as they did in the beginning, they permitted all but a few of their illicit factories to keep generating hundreds of millions of dollars in profits for provincial officials, the military and the entrepreneurial elite. This time, they miscalculated. 
 In a nutshell, that's how the United States and China descended into another tape-for-tat trade war last week, with Washington threatening billions of dollars in sanctions against China's state-owned industries -- mostly clothing, silk and electronics -- and China shooting back that it will meet tariff with tariff.
It sounds like a lot of bravado, and by the time the two countries hit a June 17 deadline to strike a deal or invoke the sanctions, that's all it may prove to be. But behind the make-my-day threats are two very different calculations of national economic power.
America figures that it is still too big to mess with and that China -- faced with the choice of closing plants or finding their products locked out of Walmart -- will fold. In Beijing, the guess is that American industry is far more divided than President Clinton would like to admit -- and that Hollywood can be pitted against Boeing (which sends one in seven planes to China) and that Microsoft will be arm-wrestling Ford and G.M., which are in delicate talks over joint-venture factories.
Those divisions in American industry are very real and help explain why China's back seems to stiffen a bit more with each annual cycle of American threats and counter-threats. Every year, China gets a little richer, a little more nationalistic, and a little better equipped to resist America's seemingly endless demands. And it's getting better at the divide-and-conquer techniques that its longtime Asian rival, Japan, has used so effectively to stiff-arm the whining barbarians across the Pacific.
 
 
 
Learning From Japan
 "China learned a lot watching the Japanese handle American trade negotiators," said William P. Alford, a Harvard law professor and author of "To Steal a Book Is an Elegant Offense," (Stanford University Press, 1995), a study of Chinese views of intellectual property. And Washington's standard technique -- draft a highly specific agreement, then demand enforcement -- "doesn't translate so well in a country like China that doesn't have much of a legal infrastructure and views this all as deal-making," he added.
Clinton Administration officials say their case is straightforward: Last year, under the threat of $1 billion in sanctions, Beijing agreed to a tight schedule for closing its pirate factories or turning them into legitimate operations. But illegal production has surged.
"We're not asking to negotiate new agreements," Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States Trade Representative, said. "We have the agreements. They are clear. The question is one of enforcement. And that is a question of political will, not ability."
Ms. Barshefsky is, at first glance, in an admirable negotiating position. United States-China trade accounts for more than 8 percent of China's gross national product, but less than 1 percent of America's. So China has a lot more to lose in a trade war.
Beijing's strategy centers not only on its economic power, but on the political advantage that comes from playing competing American and other Western interests off against each other. So when America steamed the Seventh Fleet off Taiwan this year, Li Peng, China's Premier, ostentatiously used a trip to Paris to sign a few contracts with Airbus Industries that Boeing had desperately wanted. And when China published its "counter-retaliation list" 20 minutes after Ms. Barshefsky left the podium on Wednesday, Beijing said it would not hesitate to suspend American investment in its market.
 
 
 
Rattling Ford's Cage
 That's probably a bluff. But it rattled a few cages in Detroit: Ford Motor Company turned out a statement declaring that while "the protection of intellectual property rights is a key to open and successful trade and trust between trading partners, we do not believe that unilateral sanctions by either country are constructive or likely to lead to a solution of the problem." Many other companies, from electronics makers to oil companies, turned out equally fence-straddling statements.
America's allies, especially Japan, the Philippines and others who live in China's shadow, were a lot clearer: Conduct exercises with the Seventh Fleet wherever you want, but don't start messing with trade weapons; someone could get hurt.
Much as the Chinese enjoy hearing such a chorus, they know -- or Ms. Barshefsky thinks they know -- that there are risks in overplaying their hand. Congress is about to begin the annual ritual of debating whether to withdraw China's overall trade benefits, a step so drastic Congress has always shrunk from it before. So far, President Clinton and Bob Dole have both favored renewal, giving China a good chance to squeak through again. If a real trade war starts in mid-June, though, all bets are off.

HEADLINE: Who'll Win Russia?;
For America, Uncertainty Wraps the Riddle

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN divining the Clinton Administration's thinking about the presidential election in Russia next month, consider this: Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's first draft of a major analysis of Russia policy last January omitted any discussion of what to expect if the Communists won. Only after colleagues drew the omission to Mr. Talbott's attention did he insert a "what if" section in the final version.
The possibility that the Communists will win is the West's worst foreign policy nightmare, and why Mr. Talbott initially left it out is unclear. Some of his colleagues say he simply preferred not to speculate about it -- on the premise that any suggestion from official Washington that President Boris N. Yeltsin could lose would only hurt his chances. Others point to Mr. Talbott's inclination to look on the bright side when it comes to Russia. Mr. Talbott himself isn't talking. 
 But the omission underscores just how little is known in Washington about what will happen in the Russian election next month -- and, more important, how that uncertainty limits the Administration's ability to plan for the outcome. Despite a flood of analytical reporting from the American Embassy in Moscow, no one in the Clinton Administration is willing to be predictive. Even the Central Intelligence Agency, which Administration officials say was betting two months ago that there was no way Mr. Yeltsin could win, is now giving him an even chance of pulling it out.
"Nobody -- believe me, nobody -- can tell you what is going to happen in this vote," said James F. Collins, the State Department's special adviser on the former Soviet countries. "Nobody knows what Russian voters are going to do," he added. "It's an imponderable."
Who will be the victor is not the only imponderable. If the Communist challenger, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, wins, there is the issue of just what sort of Communists he will put in his Cabinet and how soon and how much they will change things. No matter who wins, there is the future course of the endlessly brutal war in Chechnya. Above all, there is the anxiety of the people and the pessimism of the military.
Which makes it particularly hard to identify specific new threats and challenges that may confront the United States after the election -- how the vote might affect Russia's attitude toward democracy, the rule of law, economic integration with the West, stability around Russia and its place in the world.
 
 
 
What to Do
 So with the course of events in Russia beyond prediction, how does a policy maker respond? The quandary is reminiscent of other moments when events of enormous sweep unfolded too rapidly for the United States to be more than a bystander: the revolution in Iran, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet state after the failed coup of 1991.
In such a situation, of course, good policy makers try to make decisions that will help produce favorable outcomes. But when it comes to another country's elections, meddling too blatantly is never a good way to do it. Planning for the worst, hoping for the best and doing no harm may be the only prudent course of action.
Thus the importance of the Talbott paper. Those officials who read it say it was less remarkable for what it said than for what it did to energize the bureaucratic process: It helped prompt President Clinton to call his first (and so far only) formal National Security Council meeting on Russia, in February. And that produced a clear redefinition of America's two overriding national interests in dealing with Russia: promoting American national security and pushing the continued integration of Russia into the social, political and economic life of the West. Not that the Administration changed its view of the national interests; rather, this wasan opportunity to spell out what was most important in a way that wouldn't leave the United States trapped if the Communists won.
 
 
 
What to Say
 Just as important, the Administration also came up with a way to talk about the Russian election publicly: first, to say that the United States does not have a vote in it and therefore has no candidate (even though every senior official from the President on down is rooting for Mr. Yeltsin); second, to stick to fixed talking points to avoid the impression that the United States is panicking.
"We leave it to the Russian people to judge him in his capacity for re-election," Mr. Talbott said of Mr. Yeltsin in a speech at Amherst College three weeks ago.
That doesn't mean there have been no missteps. During last month's summit meeting in Moscow, Mr. Clinton cast Mr. Yeltsin as a Slavic version of Abraham Lincoln, equating Russia's war to subdue the Chechens to the Great Emancipator's battle against slavery. Even Mr. Clinton's aides were appalled by the off-the-cuff remark, in which Mr. Clinton broke one of the cardinal rules of diplomacy: never make comparisons to America's history.
And other officials seem unable to resist saying just how much they want the Communists to lose. "These people are not benign Euro-Communists," said Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman and a Russia specialist. "Their policies, if they are implemented, would roll back the economic and political reforms of the last four and a half years."
Even if Mr. Zyuganov wins, what is important for the United States is what he does and how fast he does it. The last time the Communists held the keys to the Kremlin, they were free to do things like arbitrarily fix the value of the ruble and weed out budding capitalists. Russia now seems firmly established in the international marketplace, and the Communists may have only limited room to maneuver in it.
 
 
 
What to Care About
 If the United States has drawn up a list of what it will not tolerate from a Communist regime, it is not saying what those acts are. Privately, however, Secretary of Defense William Perry has said that the only critical national interest in Russia is American security, and that this begins with strict adherence to arms control agreements. How far Washington would be willing to go to punish a Russia that reneged on those pledges is another matter.
Other issues are even more murky. Just about every internal Government analysis agrees that Russia's military, which is too poor to pay even its electric bills, is unlikely to directly threaten the United States. But how far would America be willing to go if a President Zyuganov used his military to put pressure on a neighbor?
Paradoxically, Administration officials feel they know more about what the reaction to a Communist victory would be in Washington than in Moscow. Officials are predicting that the Republicans would immediately seize on it to blame the Democrats for Mr. Yeltsin's defeat, push through funding for a "Star Wars" space-based missile defense and back away from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential candidate, has criticized the Administration for embracing Mr. Yeltsin too tightly, but has yet to articulate his own strategy for dealing with a Communist President. His first Russia speech could be one in which he accuses Mr. Clinton of having lost Russia.

Germany's Anguish: History, Identity and Shopping

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
IT'S early evening and you forgot to buy the milk, so what do you do? In New York or London, you go to the corner store. If it's Rome and not too late, you try the local alimentari or the neighborhood bar.
In Germany, you keep the refrigerator well stocked.
Among the wealthy lands of the West, Germany has the stingiest shopping hours of all. Stores, nearly all stores, close most nights at 6:30 P.M., and on most Saturdays at 2 P.M. Sundays, they are closed all day -- as they are, for that matter, between 1 P.M. and 2:30 P.M. on any weekday afternoon. 
 The reason? Germany has regulated shopping hours to suit the store owners' associations, not the customers. According to the newspaper commentator Josef Joffe, Germans have become "slaves to a culture of guilds and brotherhoods," not to mention a "curiosity" to the world.
"The whole world is laughing at us," said Gunter Rexrodt, the Economics Minister.
Now, though, the once-unthinkable is happening: in Parliament this month, Chancellor Helmut Kohl introduced legislation to permit stores to remain open later, until 8 P.M. on weekdays and part of Saturday afternoons, and -- heaven forbid -- to allow bakers to sell fresh bread for three hours on Sundays. The current laws only permit, but do not oblige, storekeepers to stay open later on Thursdays (until 8:30 P.M.) and on the first Saturday of each month (until 4 P.M., or 6 P.M. in the summer).
Mr. Kohl has not won friends in the process. As a measure of the furor he caused, some 50,000 people -- a big crowd by any standards -- gathered in Bonn last month to oppose the idea of changing the current rules.
To be sure, Germany is not alone in regulating shopping hours, which are laid out by laws that strike Americans as bizarre.
 
 
 
No Clothes on Monday
 In Rome, clothing stores close on Monday mornings and food stores don't do business on Thursday afternoons. In Greece, the charts that decree pharmacy hours resemble those of a medieval astrologer. In Italy, France, Britain and elsewhere, Sunday shopping -- now permitted in Britain and creeping into Italy -- has been debated, heatedly, for years.
Here, though, the issue is not so much the hours themselves as their meaning: what Chancellor Kohl is suggesting, his critics assert, is an assault on the very essence of modern German-ness with its twin totems of capitalist gain and socialist security.
Scrap the shopping hours, the labor unions maintain, and you open the door to part-time workers deprived of full social security rights, who, in turn, threaten the position of full-time workers and their hefty packages of pensions, health and job security benefits.
 
 
 
Fear of Mammon
 Liberalize trading hours, the argument runs, and watch the mom-and-pop corner stores fall easy prey to the Mammon-driven super-stores. "Only the big businesses will profit from this," said Margareta Wolf from the opposition Greens, who are lining up with the opposition Social Democrats against the changes.
Open up the stores to late trading, opponents say, and watch the traditional German family go under: no more Saturday afternoon strolls in the park, because everyone will be at the mall; no more family dinners, at least for storekeepers, because Mom and Pop will be glued to the cash register.
Restrictive shopping hours do, in fact, condition much of the way Germans live.
Families really do take to the parks to stroll and bicycle on Sunday, their urge to consume held lawfully in check, in a way that many other countries have forgotten.
Moreover, many women stay home to tend Kinder, Kuche and Kirche (children, kitchen and church), which allows family shopping on a schedule that accommodates the shopkeepers, not to mention school hours that end sometimes at 12:30 P.M.
Millions of German women do work, of course, which increases the pressure for longer shopping hours; gone are the days, said Mr. Joffe, the commentator, "when Mom strolled through the market every day, buying a little wurst here, three pounds of apples there." But a recent survey said 73 percent of German women are still wholly or partly economically dependent on husbands or social security checks.
The shopping rules, first formulated in 1956, reflect a hankering for cartels and protective regulations that has deepened with the growth of postwar wealth. At the same time, though, things have changed. The last few years in particular have brought the upheavals of German reunification, ingrained unemployment, and, most of all, new economic challenges from distant lands where people are prepared to work late and spend late.
Jobs are moving out of the country because of high labor costs. And what Germany now needs, Chancellor Kohl insists, is a dose of the same flexibility that distinguishes its global competition.
Liberalized shopping hours, by this argument, will mean not only more jobs and more profits -- and an injection of nocturnal life into moribund city centers -- but also a shift in the attitudes that breed perilous complacency.
The shopkeepers may demur, but the challenge facing them is not only from Mr. Kohl.
Germany's gas stations, for example, operating under more liberal regulations, already stay open till all hours, and many of them now sell bread, coffee, cigarettes, soft drinks, beer and candies -- just about everything, in fact, that you might need when you forget to stock the refrigerator.

HEADLINE: What If?;
An Election-Year Forecast: Surprise, Surprise.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF he accomplished anything last week in his extraordinary decision to quit the Senate, Bob Dole jolted the capital, and maybe even the great electorate beyond, with a reminder that, yes, there is a Presidential race this year, and a lot still can happen between now and the Election Day so far off.
White House naysayers contend that Mr. Dole's announcement will give him a shortlived lift in the polls that won't last much past Memorial Day, and a lot of people would be inclined to agree with them if Mr. Dole were to do nothing further to galvanize his campaign. It could be that the conventional wisdom and the polls are right, that President Clinton will win re-election as Republicans hang on to the House and Senate. 
 But as Mr. Dole's maneuver last week underscored, unpredictability and quantum shifts have been defining characteristics of American politics in recent years. Only a few months ago the Republican national chairman was bragging that the Democrats were "running from Bill Clinton like scalded dogs." Now it is the Republicans who are running -- from Speaker Newt Gingrich. In this spirit of volatility, consider some permutations for how it could all shake out on Nov. 5:
 
 
 
Scenario 1: the Status Quo
 Despite the reincarnation of Bob Dole as Every-American rather than frustrated Senate Majority Leader, Mr. Clinton could solidify his comfortable lead in the polls to the point where not even Colin L. Powell's presence on the Republican ticket could erode it.
Under this scenario, the House would stay Republican, if for no other reason than there is no groundswell for another upheaval. The Republicans have done exceedingly well in fund-raising; they have recruited a batch of aggressive candidates for seats being vacated by incumbents, and have far fewer such seats to defend than the Democrats (19 as opposed to the Democrats' 28). The Senate, where Republicans have a six seat edge, appears even more difficult for Democrats to reclaim because of numerous Democratic retirements and because many of those races are in states that are disposed to Republicans.
If voters grant Mr. Clinton a second term, it might not be out of fondness for him, but because they see him as countering extreme elements of the Republican Congress. That equation could change if voters turn on the Republicans in Congress.
"There's a trap here," said former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. "As the Democrats become more likely winners in the House or the Senate, you have this curious perverse effect. What I'm afraid will happen is when people perceive that the Congress might become more Democratic, they might want Clinton less."
But for now, Mr. Clinton has so positioned himself as a moderate that it may be a breeze for him to win over independents and some Republicans on issues like welfare and the budget. In a nod to conservatives, he has said he would oppose gay marriages. All the while, though, Mr. Clinton has tended to his base with pronouncements on health care, education and the environment.
Besides grabbing Republican issues, the Democrats are already stoking the Republican ferment on abortion, as well as concerns that at 72 Mr. Dole is too old. They also hope that Ross Perot will enter the fray with his third party and siphon votes from Mr. Dole.
Because Mr. Clinton seems to be behaving almost as a Republican, it may be too much for Democratic Congressional candidates to expect him to do them much good. "You just don't see a lot of coattails," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster.
 
 
 
Scenario 2: G.O.P. Sweeps
 Charles E. Cooke Jr., a non-partisan analyst, said if the election were held today, Mr. Clinton would draw 290 electoral votes (270 are needed to get elected) because polls show he has leads of 20 points of more in nearly every large state except Ohio, Florida and Texas. The biggest prize of all, California, is leaning so much toward Mr. Clinton that many Republicans feared that Mr. Dole would abandon them.
Despite those intimidating statistics, Republicans can take solace in their party's traditional advantage in the Electoral College. An analysis by Richard Bond, a former Republican national chairman, shows that 12 states, with 73 electoral votes, went for the Republican in the last 7 elections. Another 12 states, with 165 electoral votes, did so in 6 of the last 7 elections.
Many Democrats concede that they are not likely to win many states in the Rocky Mountains or the South, and those regions -- with a few other traditionally Republican strongholds -- make it possible for a truly reinvigorated Dole campaign to lay claim to nearly 200 electoral votes with little effort.
Mr. Dole's aides said they recently conducted surveys of focus groups that found that most voters know very little about the Republican candidate, and were surprisingly clueless that he was a wounded veteran of World War II. The campaign plans to make much of Mr. Dole's biography as it hits hard on the character issue against Mr. Clinton.
"For Dole to win, he has to create a contrast of ideology and of character," said John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster. "He has to flip that age factor into an integrity factor. And then he has to go out and get some Democrat votes."
Mr. Dole's biggest advantage may be that he is not Bill Clinton; Presidential elections often become referendums on the sitting President. "Clinton has an opportunity to lose in a variety of ways," said Alan Secrest, a Democratic pollster. "Let's say something of a smoking-gun nature emerges out of one of these hearings or trials." Another sure-fire spoiler for a President, of course, is a downturn in the economy.
 
 
 
Scenario 3: All Democrat
 Not even the most optimistic Democrats predict that their party will capture the White House and both houses of Congress. They are particularly doubtful about the Senate. The House offers greater opportunities because the Republicans' 39-seat advantage is the narrowest any party has held since 1958.
But given Mr. Clinton's high poll numbers -- and nationwide surveys showing people are more inclined to vote for Democratic members of Congress than Republicans -- some Democrats paint a scenario in which the Republicans will be so villified that Democrats will sweep the elections much like the Republicans seized Congress in 1994. The party could be helped along by newly enacted "motor voter" laws which make it easier for people to register.
 
 
 
Switcheroo No. 1
 For all the conventional wisdom that the Presidential contest drives the races down the line, there is the prospect, however remote now, that Mr. Clinton will be ousted even as Democrats reclaim the House or the Senate or both.
Two separate dynamics would have to be at play: one is that Mr. Clinton's support would be devastated by an unknown huge scandal that would make Whitewater as we now know it look like child's play, or by the bungling of a major national or international crisis (like, for argument's sake, one that develops in Russia after its presidential election). At the same time, Democrats in Congress could prevail by distancing themselves from Mr. Clinton and turning their own elections into a referendum on Mr. Gingrich.
"It would have to be a pretty severe personal setback for Clinton for that to happen," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The fact of the matter is that chances for a Democratic takeover of Congress depends on Clinton doing well."
 
 
 
Switcheroo No. 2
 In his zeal to put distance between himself and the Capitol, where he has worked for 35 years, perhaps Mr. Dole will go too far for his former colleagues' liking. Negativity about the Gingrich Congress could become so strong that moderate Republican defectors vote moderate or conservative Democrats into the House while installing Mr. Dole in the Oval Office to keep his eye on the things.
"I could argue arithmetically that the Democrats could take over the House while the President loses by one point," said Mark A. Siegel, a former executive director of the Democratic Party.
But while he said he has been "programmed by the White House" to dampen expectations and predict a close race, Mr. Siegel said he was confident about Mr. Clinton's chances. "The margin of victory could be around 10 points," he said, "which I'm not supposed to say!"

The New Slogan: Buy Inflation-Buster Bonds!

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
In announcing that it would issue a new type of Government bond -- an "inflation-indexed" bond -- the United States Treasury last week moved to accomplish a lot of goals: protect the savings of ordinary Americans from inflation, encourage Americans to save more and cut the Government's borrowing costs.
The new bonds -- whose returns would be pegged to inflation, though the exact terms haven't been worked out -- are meant to give the Government a chance to compete for the huge amounts of money flowing into 401(k) plans, the self-directed retirement accounts that now have $675 billion in assets. Since they would have the inflation hedge, the bonds are to be issued at rates lower than those of the fixed-rate bonds that the Government now sells -- a provision intended to save the Government money. 
 For consumers, the appeal would be added security for retirement plans from bonds backed by the "full faith and credit" of the Government.
"This is a good example of a common-sense approach to better serve citizens," said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, himself a former bond salesman on Wall Street, "and to bring down the cost of capital for the Government." LESLIE WAYNE

HEADLINE: A Breakthrough in Bonds

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's decision to issue indexed bonds -- Government bonds that protect the purchaser from inflation -- is welcome news for investors, taxpayers and the overall health of the economy. The Administration deserves credit for overcoming obstacles that have blocked this good idea for years.
Indexed bonds would, in effect, pay an investor a fixed rate of return, probably around 3 percent, above the rate of inflation. As obligations of the Federal Government, they would not carry the risk of default. Held to maturity, these bonds would be a risk-free way for investors to save for retirement. The bonds will be especially attractive to unsophisticated investors who wish to avoid buying stocks. 
 Taxpayers would gain from indexed bonds because Government borrowing costs, and therefore the need to raise taxes, would likely fall. The Government now pays owners of non-indexed bonds an interest rate that compensates them for the risk that future inflation will erode the value of the principal and interest payments. With indexed bonds, bondholder risk is eliminated and the Government can pay lower interest rates.
Indexed bonds will make it easier for the Federal Reserve Board to control the economy by giving it a good barometer of investor expectations about inflation. If, for example, investors begin expecting higher inflation rates, the Fed might want to counter with a tighter monetary policy. The Fed now has no reliable way to measure those expectations, and may adjust monetary policy based on mistaken assumptions. The difference in interest rates on indexed and non-indexed Government bonds will show how high investors expect inflation to be. Indexed bonds will also give the Government added impetus to control inflation. Otherwise, it would be required to funnel extra payments to bondholders.
Bureaucratic inertia and opposition by Wall Street dealers have blocked the issuance of indexed bonds in the past. The dealers fear, with some justification, that purchasers are likely to hold onto these bonds rather than continually trade them, reducing commissions for bond sellers. It took a former investment banker, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, to blow the whistle on his former colleagues. Indexed bonds are a victory for good government.

HEADLINE: The Keys to the Spy Kingdom

 BODY:
The management of America's intelligence agencies has long suffered from an awkward power-sharing arrangement between the Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense. The director is nominally in charge, but the Secretary of Defense actually controls most of the agencies, people and money. Over the years the two have sometimes tripped over each other, resulting in lax management and a shortage of accountability.
The latest example is $4 billion that was lost and then found by the National Reconnaissance Office, a Pentagon agency that operates spy satellites. Because no one was clearly accountable for running the agency, the office, through incompetent bookkeeping and obsessive secrecy, lost track of enough money to run a small country before the Director of Central Intelligence and Secretary of Defense realized there was a problem. 
 Arlen Specter and Bob Kerrey, the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have proposed a reasonable remedy. They would give the Director of Central Intelligence an enhanced role in selecting the chiefs of the intelligence services within the Pentagon and greater authority in managing their budgets and operations.
Under the current system, which evolved without a coherent blueprint during the cold war, the Director of Central Intelligence is the country's top spy official. But he possesses final operational and financial authority over just one organization -- the Central Intelligence Agency. The rest of the Government's main espionage agencies reside within the Department of Defense, including the Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency, which monitors international communications. Further, while the director helps set spending goals for all the spy agencies, he directly controls only about $3 billion of the $26 billion annual intelligence budget, and employs only a fraction of the work force.
Real power over the Pentagon spy agencies resides mainly with the Deputy Secretary of Defense. But in the vast universe of Pentagon activities and spending that pivot around this post, the work of the spy agencies can easily be overlooked.
The Pentagon agencies produce two broad categories of intelligence information. One, known as national intelligence, consists largely of information on political, arms control and economic issues that goes to the White House, State Department and civilian leadership at the Pentagon. The other category is military intelligence, including data on foreign forces, weapons and tactics. This information flows primarily to the armed forces and is especially vital in wartime.
The Senate plan would provide more exacting management by giving the Director of Central Intelligence greater control over the national-intelligence operations of the Pentagon spy agencies. Those activities properly belong under the director, who is supposed to guide national intelligence programs. It would leave the Pentagon responsible for running the military intelligence side of the same agencies, which is appropriate.
John Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence, seems content to leave operational and budget matters unchanged, but does endorse a greater role for himself in the selection of spy agency heads. Yet as a former Deputy Secretary of Defense, he well knows that the Pentagon cannot provide the close oversight needed to keep an organization like the Reconnaissance Office in line.
The Senate Armed Services Committee, reflecting the Pentagon's opposition, has blocked the Specter-Kerrey bill. The two Senators have retaliated by delaying approval of the defense budget. With the House already moving toward reform, Congress will squander an opportunity to put the intelligence services under tighter control if the committee does not budge. Does another $4 billion have to be misplaced before Congress acts?

HEADLINE: Military Strives to Reduce a Relatively Low Suicide Rate

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the Navy's highest-ranking officer, took his life this week at a time when the military is striving, with considerable success, to reduce suicide in the ranks.
Despite some spectacular instances -- in 1994, a Marine drill sergeant shot himself in front of 40 recruits at boot camp at Parris Island, S.C. -- military personnel have committed suicide far less frequently than civilians of the same age and sex, Government statisticians say. In addition, the Navy has the lowest suicide rate of the armed services. 
 In recent years, the Pentagon has been trying to prevent suicide by identifying service members who are at risk of killing themselves and providing them help. Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for health affairs, said in an interview that a major thrust of the campaign had been to emphasize that seeking help for mental illness is not a sign of weakness.
"We pay a great deal of attention to making sure people are aware that it's O.K. to look for help," Dr. Joseph said. "It's O.K. to seek support and not keep your problems within yourself." He said commanders were instructed to make clear that nobody would suffer professionally by seeking help, a message that he acknowledged ran counter to a centuries-old military culture in which strength is prized and anything that could be perceived as weakness is concealed.
Dr. Joseph said particular attention was paid to situations of great potential stress, like combat. But there are a variety of other factors that can lead to depression and suicide among military people. The invasion of Haiti in 1994 was virtually free of combat, but within one week three American servicemen there took their lives.
Dr. Joseph would not comment on Admiral Boorda's death or how it might affect the message of encouraging requests for help. But the Boorda suicide is not a typical one for the military. The overwhelming majority of military suicides, officials say, involve young men who are depressed because of a number of problems, such as being rejected by a girlfriend when things are going badly on the job.
As in the civilian population, men in uniform commit suicide far more frequently than their female counterparts. The suicide rate is also far higher among low-ranking service members than among officers.
Although news accounts about military personnel who kill themselves may leave the impression that the stress and the occasional isolation of military life produce a higher rate of suicides than among civilians, the opposite is true. A young man in the military, for example, is only about 60 percent as likely to take his life as a young man in the civilian population, said Dr. Joseph Rothberg, who has studied suicide in the military for more than two decades.
Dr. Rothberg, a civilian employee of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington, said that in recent years there had been little statistical difference between the military and civilian populations in the crude rate of suicide. That rate, which does not account for age, race or sex, has ranged from about 10 suicides per 100,000 people to 14 per 100,000.
But a detailed report of a study by Dr. Rothberg and others, published by The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1990, showed that when age, race and sex were taken into account, the rate of suicide in the military was significantly lower than in the civilian population. Dr. Rothberg said in an interview that this disparity had remained in recent years.
"The reasons for this are fairly simple," he said. "Among those in the civilian community who commit suicide, there are some typical features: the person may be unemployed, have health problems and lack a meaningful religion or philosophy, all of which may lead to depression."
In the military, he said, a person is employed, usually in good health and almost certainly drug-free because of mandatory testing, and has the structure of the military to serve as a belief system.
Dr. Rothberg said that while it was difficult to generalize about suicide in the military, there were two common patterns. The far more frequent one involves a young man for whom the breakup with a girlfriend is the last of a series of setbacks. Dr. Rothberg said the suicide of such a man typically occurred after a bout of heavy drinking.
The other pattern, he said, typically occurs among men who have served 15 to 20 years and who find they are not advancing and may be forced out of the service.
Prof. Douglas G. Jacobs of Harvard Medical School, an authority on suicide, said in an interview that it often occurred after a sudden drop in self-esteem. While Dr. Jacobs, the executive director of the National Mental Illness Screening Project, would not comment directly on Admiral Boorda's suicide, he said failure might create an extraordinary psychological burden for a public person.
"Everyone has failures," he said, "but the stakes rise the more one is in the public eye."
Admiral Boorda shot himself on Thursday after learning that journalists were preparing an article suggesting that he was not entitled to two combat decorations that he had worn until last year. Such a public humiliation would be felt more keenly by a military person than a civilian, Dr. Jacobs said.
"In the Navy," he said, "if you lose your honor, I don't know if you can recover it."

The Silly Season

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I have a confession to make: Even before the old Bob Dole became the new Bob Dole, our family station wagon wasn't exactly plastered with his bumper stickers. But last week I returned from an overseas trip to find that Mr. Dole was proposing to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, and I've changed my mind about the old guy. Yes, sir, scrapping the gasoline tax. That's the sort of leadership America needs; that's the sort of spirit of sacrifice the country's been missing: a President who's ready to sacrifice the budget, to sacrifice the environment, to sacrifice energy conservation, to sacrifice oil reserves in order to save the American people 4.3 cents a gallon. And when Mr. Dole's sidekick Dick Armey, the House majority leader, suggested that we consider cutting the education budget to make up for the lost gas-tax revenue, well, then and there I knew I was a Dole man. I mean, cutting education to save Americans a few pennies a gallon at a time when their gas is already the cheapest in the world -- that's the kind of thinking that will keep us the world's most competitive nation in the 21st century. I sure hope the Japanese don't get that idea.
Are we out of our minds? Raising the gas tax has been one of the few smart things we've done in recent years. It promotes energy conservation, it helps protect the air, it encourages development of alternative energies, it promotes national security by reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies -- and it reduces the budget deficit. That 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax raises $5 billion a year. It is one of the reasons the deficit has been cut in half since 1993. 
 Any proposal to repeal the gas tax should be hooted out of Congress with scorn. Unfortunately, that's not what President Clinton did. Instead he's trying to trade his support for this idiotic gas-tax repeal for a Republican endorsement of his proposal to raise the minimum wage -- the worst sort of election-year poker. Mr. Clinton is saying to Mr. Dole: "I see your foolishness and I raise you one."
It is hard to believe that the Dole proposal for repeal of the gas tax is effective even as political pandering. How many people are really going to change their votes from Clinton to Dole over 4.3 cents a gallon? Moreover, how can Republicans argue that a balanced budget and deficit reduction are the two most urgent priorities in American politics and then, when gas prices go up a bit due to seasonal factors, simply discard the gas tax without regard for the long-term budget implications? "It only makes sense politically if it is part of a broader Dole strategy for lowering taxes," says Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard. And then for Mr. Armey to even hint that we might pay for this giveaway by cutting education -- that takes your breath away. For a cheap political high with the shelf life of a dead fish, a House Republican leader is ready to cut $5 billion a year from education? How could such a thought even cross Mr. Armey's mind? Forget about what a Dole Presidency would be like; if this keeps up I'm not sure we can afford a Dole candidacy.
The truth is we shouldn't be lowering our gas taxes. We should be raising them. Gasoline is probably the best bargain commodity in the U.S. marketplace. The latest blip aside, the real price of gasoline in the U.S. has been falling for 15 years (and if the Iraqi oil sanctions are eased by the U.N. soon, gas prices in the U.S. will likely resume that downward trend). In France and Italy, gas goes for $4.50 a gallon; in Japan it costs $3.75. Most of the difference between their prices and ours is taxes that those Governments use to finance public services. We could put a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on U.S. gasoline, get rid of the deficit and still have a huge competitive edge over the Europeans and Japanese. "This is one of the easiest and most attractive ways of raising tax revenue, and we're just giving it away," says the oil economist Vahan Zanoyan, of the Petroleum Finance Company.
In his speech announcing his resignation from the Senate, Mr. Dole insisted that: "My campaign for the President is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is right."
If that's true, then I can't wait for the Dole campaign to begin.

HEADLINE: Out of the Cradle and Right Into the N.B.A. Draft

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
Spencer Haywood has seen some of the faces on television, young faces of nervous college players as they carefully read or recited that awkward phrase, declaring their intention to apply for the National Basketball Association draft. A quarter-century ago, after an extended and highly publicized legal struggle that took place long before Kobe Bryant was born, Haywood won the right to play in the N.B.A. before his college class graduated. Now, as Bryant and two other high school players, as well as three college freshmen and nine sophomores, wait for the moment their names may or may not be called on draft day, Haywood is one of many voices questioning a system his legal victory helped create.
"I see a very big danger coming on the horizon," Haywood said. "It's not working the way it should be working. When I go to speak at junior high schools and elementary schools, everyone is so focused on the dream, the basketball dream. It's, 'I want to be a basketball player, and if I'm not a basketball player I want to be a rap star.' " 
 The growing exodus of young, high-profile players to professional basketball has led the N.B.A. Players Association to seek a meeting with league and National Collegiate Athletic Association officials in the next month. "We want it to be a nonpolitical meeting," said Alex English, the acting executive director of the players association. "We should all sit down and think about the welfare of the kids, and then think about what is happening to the college game and the N.B.A. game."
Leading college officials, who have long been criticized for a structure that was called "almost prehistoric" by Georgetown Coach John Thompson, have shown a willingness to consider a dramatic liberalization of their current system.
"Do we need to rethink some of these rules relative to amateurism, the way the Olympics have?" said Dr. William E. Kirwan, president of the University of Maryland and chairman of the N.C.A.A. committee on agents and amateurism. "Do we want to make some adjustments in our own thinking? There is really no consensus yet on the committee. But there is a determination to do something. We do not want this to end with a bland recommendation. The problem is real and harmful."
By the deadline last Sunday, 42 players -- more than double the previous high total of early candidates -- had applied to the league for an early entry. More than one-third of them are college sophomores and freshmen and high school students.
"I'm waiting for the day when 9th or 10th graders are considering it," Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino said with a laugh. This year's list ranges from Marcus Camby of Massachusetts, the consensus national player of the year, to obscure players from small schools.
The number of early entrants may eventually shrink because the N.C.A.A. allows players who do not hire agents to change their minds and regain their college eligibility up to 30 days after the draft. Other measures at the pro and college levels have also addressed the departure of underclassmen, including the introduction of three-year contracts with dramatically reduced salaries linked to draft positions for first-round choices.
Still, younger players continue to leave college early. Their aspirations have been supported by the successful progress of Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves, drafted in1995 out of high school.
College teams face difficult personnel decisions as the top players consider leaving even as potential replacements reach the end of the high school recruiting process. Pro teams must now consider making substantial investments in athletes whose physical and emotional skills may be far from fully developed.
"We probably wouldn't draft one of them," said Phil Jackson, the coach of the Chicago Bulls, of the younger players. "I don't think I want a 20-year-old on this team. Eighteen? Out of the question."
Haywood, who works in real estate and oversees a foundation in Detroit, plans to complete his degree requirements at the University of Detroit next spring, 28 years after he signed with the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association. When Haywood entered school, the N.B.A. operated under what was called the "four-year rule," in which a player could not be drafted until his class was graduating. By the time Haywood's class at Detroit was leaving school, he had signed three contracts with two teams in two leagues. His decision to join the Seattle SuperSonics in December 1970 was then considered the N.B.A.'s most serious internal conflict in its history.
Haywood is not critical of players' leaving school early if their ability has become apparent before their senior season -- as his was on the 1968 United States Olympic team and at Detroit -- or if their decisions have to do with serious economic problems at home, a central factor in Haywood's legal struggle.
Haywood's concern, one he shares with N.B.A and N.C.A.A. officials, has more to do with inexperienced players, unrealistic expectations and an increased emphasis on earning N.B.A. dollars at a younger and younger age.
"For the African-American community, it may look like it's a dream," Haywood said, "but that's going to hurt us like rap music has hurt us."
Few agree where the problems are most severe.
"I don't think this is a big business problem for the N.B.A.," said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. "To me the real issue is kids coming out of high school or after one year of college who really don't know how good a player they are -- and no one else does either -- and aren't ready to go through the social rigors of the N.B.A. If you get two or three players in that category each year, we'll find a way to deal with them positively.
"But you're going to have several players who make a big mistake and are going to fail. That is my concern. I think Kevin Garnett is going to prove to be an exception."
Cedric Dempsey, executive director of the N.C.A.A., believes the pro teams will feel more of the consequences when they are forced to deal with unfinished projects. "The concern I personally have is for the athletes who may or may not be ready to take that jump," Dempsey said. "It should be a strong concern of the N.B.A. College programs have served as a developmental system, and I don't mean only physical development. There's a social and emotional development."
Several players cited economic needs of their families as a reason for exiting early. John Calipari, Camby's coach, remembered telling the junior that in each of the eight years he has stayed at UMass he declined offers of more money. "He came right back with, 'You make a lot of money,' " Calipari said. "Basically, he has nothing."
Colleges are discussing changes that would have to be based on a new model of amateurism. But N.C.A.A. legislation to ease such an economic burden would conflict with two basic principles of the association's structure and the recent reforms of college presidents: a need to limit costs and the philosophy that players should not receive extra benefits based on their athletic ability.
The N.C.A.A. recently increased athletes' access to a special assistance fund covering costs not included in scholarships such as medical and emergency expenses. The association also increased the budgets of programs designed to help former college athletes gain their undergraduate degrees and receive post-graduate scholarships.
Legislation at the N.C.A.A. convention next January may include more radical proposals. Kirwan has asked members of his committee on agents and amateurism to consider two models, one that would tighten existing rules and another that would liberalize them while creating more severe punishments. One approach could be a loan structure, possibly offered through the N.C.A.A., that could make it less tempting for players to accept payments from agents.
"Suppose a student athlete could borrow some money," Kirwan said. "Five thousand. Ten thousand. That would be so small in comparison with signing a contract. Would it really make any difference? Is it really an incentive to stay in school? The committee is trying to grapple with, what do we do now?"

HEADLINE: A POLITICAL LIFE: The Kansas Years;
On the Kansas Prairie, the Window to Dole

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: RUSSELL, Kan.

 BODY:
Harry Truman had Independence, Bill Clinton had Hope, and Jimmy Carter had the almost too-folksy town of Plains. All traded on their small-town origins, much as politicians of a previous era used to campaign on the basis of being born in a log cabin.
Rarely, though, has a campaign paid so much homage to a small town as Bob Dole's pays to his hometown of Russell. 
 To an unusual extent, Mr. Dole is running for President on the strength of his biography. The hopes of his candidacy are built less on a bright vision of the future, or on any soaring rhetoric of the present, than on the character-defining events of his own past. And it is in Russell, an unlovely town flat in the center of Kansas, that most of these events took place.
It is here that Mr. Dole grew up, poor but determined, during the Dust Bowl. It is here that he returned after being grievously injured and almost left for dead in Italy. It is here that, with the help of local women who dubbed themselves "Dolls for Dole," he launched his political career.
Mr. Dole frequently insists on the primacy of his years in Russell, referring to the town half as memory, half metaphor. "I have never forgotten where I came from," he likes to say. "Or where I go home to."
Russell certainly returns the favor. Even though he has not really lived here since the 1960's, people have never forgotten Bob Dole. And how could they? He has been running for national office off and on for the last 20 years, and every time he embarks on a new campaign, he returns here, national reporters in tow.
Those who are still left in Russell from Mr. Dole's youth -- and every year the number dwindles -- remember him, to a significant extent, as he remembers himself. They remember a serious boy from a hardworking family, a shy teen-ager who loved sports, a wounded veteran whose fierce resolve prompted the entire town to rally around him.
But people also remember aspects of his early years that are, understandably, left out of Mr. Dole's official biography. They recall a competitive young man who became a fiercely partisan politician. They recall a campaigner who ran what were, by the standards of the place and time, some memorably rough races. And they recall a man who from his earliest campaigns, was already relying heavily on his biography.

Russell, Kan.
Future Senator Born in a Boomtown
If things had turned out differently and Bob Dole were still living in this town of 4,700 people, odds are one could find him at 8 A.M. sipping watery coffee at the Mecca Mall downtown, or at 10 A.M. sipping equally watery coffee at Meridy's over on the highway, or at 3 P.M. at the Russell's Inn. Russell has three all-male kaffeeklatsches that meet religiously for an hour or so of gossip and ribbing to break up the day.
There are not that many new stories in Russell to go around, so old stories tend to get a lot of play. The crowd at Meridy's is still talking, for example, about the time, years ago, when some of its members went to what they delicately refer to as a "girlie show." Everett Dumler was mistakenly hailed as "Emmett" by one of the women, and every now and then he is still called "Emmett," just for the fun of it. At the end of the hour, the men settle the tab according to an elaborate guessing game over the serial numbers on a dollar bill.
The daily kaffeeklatsch is just one of the many rituals that make up social life in Russell. Practically every noontime some function is on the calendar -- a Kiwanis Club meeting, or a men's church luncheon. And if you are, say, a reporter looking for the retired editor of the local paper, people in town can advise you what lunch (Rotary) he regularly attends.
According to Mr. Dole's old friends, this is how Russell has always been except, of course, for the Prohibition years, when there was a lot more liquor. If anything has changed, it is that the town has grown sleepier, and perhaps shabbier. Certainly the yellow stone building where Mr. Dole's father worked weighing wheat is still there, and one can still find the sidewalk where decades ago, in a childish hand, young Bob mischievously etched his name in wet cement. (Mr. Dumler, the former head of Russell's Chamber of Commerce, claims it is the "worst thing" Bob Dole ever did.) Even the old Dole house on Maple Street is still standing -- Mr. Dole, in fact, owns it -- but it has been added to and faced with brick since he left home.
When Bob Dole says he still thinks of himself as a Russell boy, he is implicitly laying claim to the stability, order and community spirit that small-town America is supposed to represent. And these are indeed important qualities of Russell, even if the town is canny enough to play up its heartland simplicity for reporters. (At Dole homecomings, Russell folks have been known to set up the barbecue grills strategically upwind from the out-of-town press.)
But Russell is not a town that could, by any stretch of the imagination, be said to represent America's future, nor is it even a town that most Americans would probably feel comfortable inhabiting.
It is strikingly homogenous -- virtually all white, very largely Protestant and solidly Republican. It lies almost 200 miles from the nearest mid-sized city, in a region so treeless and flat that an Easterner can find it downright unnerving. Its small town-ness, while quaint, is also deeply anachronistic.
Like much of the rural Midwest, Russell has, in fact, been losing population steadily since about the time Mr. Dole graduated from high school; all of Russell County now has fewer than 8,000 residents, just a little more than half as many as it had in 1940.
In retrospect, it is clear that the years Mr. Dole lived in Russell were as close as the town has ever come to enjoying a boom. The same year Mr. Dole was born -- 1923 -- oil was discovered out in the wheat fields. The oil made a small group of local residents, known as "the Lucky Seven," very rich, and they built themselves incongruously oversized houses in the midst of Russell's modest one-story homes.
Oil is still an important part of the local economy, and pumping jacks still rhythmically peck at the wheat fields. But with the price of oil so low, no one in Russell calls himself lucky anymore. Years ago, when the price of oil was higher, the stakes of the morning guessing game were also higher, and covered the cost of an entire breakfast.

The Early Years
Back From War, A Turn to Politics
In his eulogy for Richard Nixon, Mr. Dole described the former President as "a boy who heard the train whistle in the night and dreamed of all the distant places at the end of the track." The line was widely interpreted as a reference to himself, too.
But if Mr. Dole had dreams of distant places as a boy, no one in Russell, or at least no one who is left, seems to have heard about them. Indeed, there isn't much out-of-the-ordinary that is remembered about Bob Dole until his dramatic return as a war veteran with a ruined right arm.
Mr. Dole grew up on the north side of Russell, quite literally the wrong side of the tracks, in a little white house with two bedrooms. For years, the four Dole children shared one bedroom until as teen-agers Mr. Dole and his younger brother, Kenny, fixed up a room for themselves in the basement. The family had to struggle to make ends meet, but, so, it seems, did most everyone in Russell during the Depression.
"Everybody was poor," said G. B. (Bub) Dawson, whose father ran the drugstore where Mr. Dole worked as a soda jerk. "We didn't know any better."
Schoolmates of Mr. Dole remember him as a handsome and popular young man, but not one who seemed destined for leadership. He was, by all accounts, a responsible student, but not a brilliant one, a devoted and competitive athlete, but not a naturally gifted one. Ralph Resley, a retired postal worker who went to high school with Mr. Dole, has kept a copy of the school paper from their graduation; in the Class of 1941's last will and testament, Mr. Dole is noted mainly for his shyness around girls.
Nor is there any trace of an early interest in politics. Mr. Dole's sisters, Gloria Nelson and Norma Jean Steele, who both live in Russell, say that politics was not a big topic of conversation in the Dole house while they were growing up, nor were Mr. Dole's parents politically active. They were registered as Democrats, out of friendship, Mrs. Nelson said, for a local Democratic politician.
The Bob Dole who is sharply remembered in Russell -- and whom townspeople recall as something of a hero -- is the emaciated, nearly paralyzed soldier who returned here in 1945, his right arm locked at a 45-degree angle. Russell, according to his old friends, adopted Mr. Dole at that point, rallying around him during his long convalescence.
Some of the boys who had gone off to war from the town had not come back at all, including Mr. Dole's good friend Bud Smith. But of those who survived he was the most gravely injured, and he spent three years in and out of hospitals, twice suffering infections that nearly killed him. When he was away, townspeople would follow his progress. And when he was home, they would stop by to play cards; someone had rigged up a cardholder so that he could play with one hand.
Mr. Dawson recalled that it was his brother, Chet, who started the collection in a cigar box down at the family drugstore when Mr. Dole went off to have surgery in Chicago. Pretty soon, others started collections, and eventually the town raised $1,800, a significant sum in 1947. The operations -- there were three of them -- did allow the arm, at last, to hang straight by his side. But it became clear that he would never regain its use, and Mr. Dole, who had dreamed of becoming a doctor, decided to go to law school instead.
Many in Russell see Mr. Dole's injury and his rise as a politician as inseparable. They recall his successful first campaign for County Attorney, when he ran in a primary against another young lawyer and World War II veteran, Dean Ostrum. No one can remember any real issues in that campaign, except that Mr. Ostrum came from a relatively prosperous family, and Mr. Dole was partly disabled. The race became a contest not so much over who would do the job best as who needed it most. And Mr. Dole, some people say, did his best to encourage that kind of thinking.
"He's always been able to get great mileage out of his injury," said John Woelk, a Russell lawyer who helped get Mr. Dole started in Republican politics. "He learned to do a very good job of drawing sympathy."
 
The 6th District
Candidate Shaped By Constituency
When Mr. Dole got started in politics, Russell was part of Kansas's Sixth Congressional District, which stretched across the state's sparsely populated northwest quarter. Even in staunchly conservative Kansas, the Sixth District's conservatism stood out. When Kansas Republicans gathered, for example, to pick delegates to the national convention in 1952, the year Mr. Dole became County Attorney, the other five districts backed Kansas's favorite son, Dwight D. Eisenhower. But Eisenhower was too moderate for the Sixth District, which instead backed Robert A. Taft.
In those days, the Sixth District's conservatism was the traditional, agrarian sort founded on a belief in local self-determination and an almost instinctive opposition to government intervention. And to a large extent this is still the case, though the Sixth District is now part of a much larger district, known here as the Big First. As a new strain of social conservatism has come to dominate the national Republican Party, western Kansas has continued to cling to its own brand of libertarian politics. These politics are now considered somewhat out-of-date even in Kansas, where the state Republican Party is currently controlled by members of the Christian right.
People who knew Mr. Dole in his early years say they are not sure how his own political philosophy was formed. Mr. Dole met his first wife, nee Phyllis Holden, in 1948 during one of his hospital stays; she was an occupational therapist in the psychiatric ward. Now remarried and living in Topeka, Phyllis Macey said that she can recall warning Mr. Dole to make sure voters knew that he was never one of her "psych" patients. But she cannot recall talking to him about his political beliefs.
"We didn't talk about politics," she said simply.
Mr. Woelk, the Russell lawyer who first approached Mr. Dole about running for office, recalled that in their first discussions not even Mr. Dole's party affiliation was clear. Mr. Woelk says he urged Mr. Dole to register as a Republican, using the argument: "If you want to get anywhere in politics in Kansas, you better be a Republican." Mr. Dole, he said, appeared convinced.
But whatever its origins, Mr. Dole's political thinking eventually developed very much in line with his constituents'.
Norbert Dreiling, a lawyer from the neighboring town of Hays who is the former chairman of the Kansas Democratic Party and a contemporary of Mr. Dole's, said: "I think Bob Dole reflects his constituency. When he's County Attorney of Russell County, he takes care of the county people. When he gets to Congress, he represents the west half of Kansas. It's a rural, provincial area, heavily anti-Communist -- they saw Communists under every rock. When he gets to be a Senator, then he begins to moderate. While he's still conservative, he isn't ultra-conservative."
Mr. Dreiling added: "I don't think you could ever describe him as embedded with an ideology he'll live and die with. If his constituency changes, he'll change."
 
Out of Russell
Washington Bound, Rooted in Kansas
Mr. Dole served as Russell County Attorney for eight years. People involved in local politics at the time, though, say it was clear from early on that he had larger ambitions.
He became active in a half-dozen local organizations -- Kiwanis, Elks, V.F.W. -- and became friendly with the Sixth District's Congressman, Wint Smith. He also earned local notoriety through a case he took to the Kansas Supreme Court challenging a severance tax on oil production on a technicality. (As people here remember it, Mr. Dole argued there was something wrong with the tax's title.) He won the case, and with it, the gratitude of the western Kansas oil industry, which would later become a major source of campaign contributions for him.
Mr. Smith's decision to retire in 1960 provided Mr. Dole with his first chance to move up the ladder. Of all Mr. Dole's many political campaigns, it is this first run for Congress that people in Russell recall most vividly. It is also this race that, in some quarters at least, first earned him a reputation as a tough, do-whatever-it-takes sort of campaigner.
Because the district was so heavily Republican, the primary was the race that counted. Friends recall that Mr. Dole campaigned tirelessly for the nomination and, swept along by his energy, they did, too. Morris Krug, a Russell rancher who worked on the campaign, remembers one weekend when he and Kenny Dole drove around the district, nailing posters to telephone poles for 24 hours straight. At 2 A.M., the pair was nearly arrested for making a racket in Bird City, a town near the Colorado border some 200 miles away.
Mr. Dole's main opponent in the primary was a State Senator, Keith Sebelius. But there was another opponent, too, Phil Doyle, who posed a problem because of his name. Someone in the Dole camp came up with the idea of handing out Dole pineapple juice as a mnemonic device. Someone else came up with the idea of "Dolls for Dole." Mr. Dole's wife sewed red felt skirts for them, with applique elephants holding "Dole for Congress" signs in their trunks.
She also designed a little card listing Mr. Dole's qualifications, which were, in effect, his biography. The card showed a picture of a wheel and the slogan "Roll with Dole"; along the spokes were phrases like "Russell native" and "Twice wounded Vet."
Publicly, the race seems to have proceeded amicably enough; once again, no one seems to be able to remember any significant political differences among the candidates. But privately, people here recall, the word was being spread that Mr. Sebelius had a drinking problem, and a letter was even sent out to this effect, bearing a Washington State postmark. The accusation was particularly explosive in Kansas, which was still dry until 1948 and still had a Prohibition Party in 1960. ("Beer taverns, as well as liquor stores, are a disgrace to the STATE," the party platform that year read.)
Mr. Dole has always denied any ties to those spreading the rumor, but to this day, many people in the district still hold him at least indirectly responsible.
"That was a mean campaign," Mr. Dreiling said. "You can't put your finger on it directly, but the Dole people were putting out the word. Dole in his younger years fought and fought hard."
Mr. Dole beat Mr. Sebelius and went on to face William A. Davis, a self-described "dirt farmer," in the general election. Mr. Davis, too, complained about Mr. Dole's campaign tactics; Mr. Dole, his opponent argued in late October, was "trying to scare the daylights out of the Sixth District voters" with "the same old pitch that no one but his gang is sufficiently patriotic to stave off Communism." But Mr. Davis's complaints apparently had little impact on the Republican electorate, and Mr. Dole defeated him handily in November. At the same time, Kansas voted overwhelmingly for Richard M. Nixon over John F. Kennedy.
In the winter of 1961, Mr. Dole and his wife and young daughter, Robin, moved to Washington. For several years after that, they returned to Russell every summer, making the long drive in a car crammed with luggage and pets. (Mr. Dole's former wife, Mrs. Macey, recalls that during one of these dusty trips, the family dog died from the heat.)
Then in the late 1960's the ties to Russell began to attenuate. Mr. Dole was running for the Senate -- Mr. Sebelius would eventually win the House seat he was vacating -- and he needed to campaign in the eastern half of Kansas, where most of the state's voters live. His trips to Kansas tended toward Wichita, or Kansas City, rather than to Russell.
Nowadays, Mr. Dole's visits to his hometown are almost always in the context of a national election. He returned last year to announce his candidacy for the Presidency, and then again this spring once he had clinched the nomination.
After the rallies and speeches are over, he usually goes back to the old family house on Maple Street. The little house is just the way his mother left it when she died 13 years ago. There he comes back, literally, to an image of himself as his campaign would have him portrayed; there are "Dolls for Dole" skirts hanging in the closet, his varsity letters tucked into a drawer and up on the bedroom wall a big framed photograph of a serious young man wearing a military uniform, his dark eyes staring seemingly full of purpose.

HEADLINE: His Art Trashed, He Sues City Hall

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
For two and a half years Jan R. Martin spent his weekends and vacations building a dream, an abstract outdoor sculpture here in his hometown.
"I thought it would be something that would be good for the city," said Mr. Martin, who moved back to Indianapolis to join the family business after a stint as a shivering, starving artist in the TriBeCa neighborhood of lower Manhattan. He erected the sculpture in 1987 on land next to the family business in a rundown neighborhood northwest of downtown. 
 But the city bought the land in 1993, and, without telling Mr. Martin, had the sculpture torn down last July, with an eye toward sprucing up the area. Ten months after the removal, the only additions to the spot where the sculpture had stood are dandelions and fresh spring grass. The site remains a vacant lot.
The artist has sued the city, contending that Indianapolis violated a Federal law, passed in 1990, that is intended to prevent the desecration or destruction of art. The Visual Artists Rights Act was meant to clear up confusion about who decides the fate of public art.
Had it passed earlier, it might have prevented the removals of two prominent sculptures in New York City, an aluminum rhomboid by Isamu Noguchi, which was dismembered in 1980, and a steel work, "Tilted Arc," by Richard Serra, which was carted from the Federal Plaza in 1989.
Mr. Martin's suit is one of a handful under the statute. Lawyers who specialize in art law said it was perhaps the strongest challenge so far.
"The City of Indianapolis better have insurance," said Daniel H. Weiner, a partner specializing in art law at the New York firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed.
Other artists were appalled to hear of the sculpture's fate. "Morally or esthetically, the art belongs always to the artist," said Christo, who with his wife and partner, Jeanne-Claude, is known for his large-scale works that have included wrapping the Reichstag in Berlin in fabric last year. Jeanne-Claude added, "We find it outrageous that some people can destroy art."
Mr. Martin, 48, is a part-time artist. He is an executive and part-owner of the Tarpenning-LaFollete Company here, a manufacturer of ornamental and industrial metal objects -- from toilets on Amtrak trains to stainless-steel skylight frames for the new World Bank building in Washington.
He studied fine arts at Purdue University and earned a master's from the Art Institute of Chicago. Mr. Martin most often works in the same metals that he uses at Tarpenning-LaFollete, and has created metal murals with abstract designs, whimsical, cast-bronze frogs for a fountain and a 15-foot-tall sculpture with undulating steel leaves that decorates the front of a hospital.
But in his eyes, the 45-foot-long sculpture of stainless steel, "Symphony #1," was his masterpiece. It had columns, each about 14 feet tall, representing the movements of a symphony. Cables connected its irregularly shaped slabs of steel, recalling the strings of a violin. The work weighed 8,500 pounds, and the materials cost $23,000.
In an interview Mayor Steve Goldsmith said he was unaware that the sculpture had been destroyed. Mr. Goldsmith then called the city's top litigator, Mary Ann Oldham and asked, "What did we do?"
The Mayor listened and then looked dismayed. Apparently having been told that his city had indeed demolished the sculpture, he let Ms. Oldham speak. She insisted that the city had notified Mr. Martin that it was buying the land under the sculpture and offered him the chance to move it.
"He was very definitely told that," Ms. Oldham said. "And if he wanted it he could remove it."
But Mr. Martin's lawyer, Scott Hodes, a senior partner at the firm of Ross & Hardies in Chicago, said, "We wouldn't be in dispute with them if they would have acted in a reasonable manner and just given him a chance to take the piece away."
Asked why the sculpture had been torn down, Ms. Oldham said, "They had to move it to do whatever we needed to do" at the site.
The artist said he believed that he knew its disposition. "I think they sold it for scrap," Mr. Martin said. Scrap steel sells for 28 cents a pound.
Mr. Martin said that he knew of the sale of the land but that he had never been told that the city was planning to destroy the sculpture. He said he would have moved it had he known about that decision.
Brian W. Welch, a partner at the Indianapolis law firm McHale, Cook & Welch, which the city hired to defend itself in the case, said he did not know whether Mr. Martin had been notified that the sculpture would be torn down. Mr. Welch added that in the lengthy discussions about the land sale "the city was real clear about its lack of a need for the sculpture or desire to keep it."
The misunderstanding seems to stem from the city's view that after buying the land, it had the right to do what it wanted with anything on it.
A prominent art dealer in New York, Richard L. Feigen, said he believed that art should not be used to prevent development. But he sided with Mr. Martin, saying, "Certainly, an artist ought to be given time to remove a work of art" before it is destroyed.
Mr. Goldsmith said he wished that the city had searched for a better solution. He pointed to the fate of "Snowplow" by Mark di Suvero as evidence that the city supports the arts.
When the city needed to move Mr. di Suvero's outdoor sculpture, it arranged an innovative deal with the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The museum paid the city $200,000 for the right to move the work to an honored spot near the museum entrance. Indianapolis promised to use the proceeds to support public art created by local artists.
Mr. Martin has sued for at least $100,000. But whatever the outcome of the case, he said, he knows that it will not bring back his vision. He comforts himself with reminders of other important elements in his life. "I've still got my children," Mr. Martin said. "I've still got my family."

HEADLINE: URBAN PARALYSIS -- A special report.;
While a Dying City Languishes, A State Battles to Take Control

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
On a recent Friday morning, the Mayor of this remnant of a city summoned local officials, supporters and members of news organizations to City Hall to inform them that he was declaring war. "Enough is enough," began Arnold W. Webster, pounding his fist on a lectern in the city's scuffed-up Council chambers. "We're going to fight back."
The battle that Mr. Webster vowed to take on has nothing to do with the drug dealers who have seized control of more than 100 street corners in this city in southwestern New Jersey. Nor is it connected with the city's dubious reputation as the murder capital of the Northeast, a reputation that seems to have eclipsed the image of Camden as the home to Campbell's Soup. 
 Instead, the targets of the Mayor's salvos are economic development groups and the state government -- the very entities trying to assist Camden, one of the nation's most downtrodden cities. Since the first of the year, state officials have issued a scathing audit, accusing the city of mismanagement. They have threatened to seize control of $21 million in Federal money intended to spur economic development.
[On May 17, the state appointed a full-time monitor to oversee all Camden's municipal spending.]
At the same time, the Cooper's Ferry Development Association, a nonprofit corporation that for 12 years has led efforts to develop the city's waterfront, is battling Mr. Webster for control of major projects. "Look around you; your enemy is not hard to find," Mr. Webster told the group. "Everyone who claims they are our friends really are not."
Camden is a city that could use a few friends. Once a proud symbol of American industrial might, it has unraveled economically over the last three decades, as companies shut down, jobs departed by the tens of thousands, and despair moved in. Several plans to revitalize the city have been offered. But a struggle among local, state and business leaders has paralyzed Camden and left its 87,000 residents languishing.
As Mr. Webster conceded in an interview: "We have enough problems ourselves with the violence and the unemployment, and then you compound that with the confusion over who's running the shop and it looks like complete chaos. Nobody suffers more than the community."
Although Philadelphia and Camden are separated only by the Delaware River, the two seem worlds apart. There are so few jobs here that a rush hour is hardly detectable. Neighborhood parks are buried in weeds, mud and trash, and in some yards chickens peck at garbage piled outside ragged houses. Every movie theater, restaurant, hotel and department store closed down years ago, and with only one remaining supermarket, most residents must travel out of the city or depend on small corner stores for food.
Camden is 56 percent black and 31 percent Hispanic. Half the city's population is under age 25, and by most estimates the unemployment rate is about 20 percent, three times the state average and nearly four times the national rate. The per capita income for residents is less than $7,500 annually, according to a state study. More than half receive some form of government assistance, and the infant mortality rate among black residents -- 27 deaths for every 1,000 births -- is as high as that of many developing nations.
"Camden is a much more difficult case than any other city," said Mark M. Murphy, executive director of the Fund for New Jersey, a private Ford Foundation initiative that is financing community development in the city. "It has every urban ill and the level of intensity is such that the issues are much more stark."
The desperation in Camden often plays out through lawlessness. While most other cities have shown a drop in crime over the last few years, Camden's trend continues upward. Violent crimes, like murder, rape and robbery, increased 8.8 percent in Camden from 1994 to 1995, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data. In the same period, the nationwide rate dropped 4 percent. Officials in Pennsauken, just northeast of Camden, became so fearful that they recently set up police checkpoints to monitor the flow of Camden residents into their township. But it was halted several months ago after irate Camden officials complained.
Illegal drugs easily exact the biggest human toll. According to the police, one dominant street gang that has controlled much of the city's cocaine and heroin trade made it a requirement for new members to murder someone -- anyone -- as part of its initiation.
"These young folks involved in the killings don't have jobs, so the drug dealers give them jobs and they give them a Glock to protect the job," said Albert S. Driggins, a longtime Camden resident. "That's their way of creating economic development."
The city's homicide rate is one of the highest in the country, and the 60 murders last year were a city record. There are 140 reported crimes per 1,000 residents in Camden each year, the highest rate in New Jersey, according to state police figures. And the city's police force of about 335 officers is so outmanned that the state was forced to assign troopers to assist in patrolling the city.
The homicide rate has dropped this year and arrests have increased since the state troopers arrived, the Camden police say. But two weeks after the troopers arrived on the scene in January, one was murdered.
"It's tragedy after tragedy after tragedy," said Kevin G. Halpern, who is Cooper's Ferry's chairman as well as chief executive at the city's largest health care provider, Cooper Hospital and University Medical Center. "The place is like an armed camp," he added. "There's an underworld that has taken over."
This is all light years removed from the Camden that helped shape the prose of its most famous resident, Walt Whitman. Like many of Whitman's poems, this city was once a metaphor for a young, muscular nation.
Just nine square miles, Camden was once known as "the biggest little city in the world." From the Navy ships that were built at its bustling waterfront, to the development of recorded sound at the Victor Talking Machine Company (later known as RCA) and the creation of condensed canned soup at the Campbell's Soup Company, Camden spawned industries that had an impact on the world. Mr. Driggins said, "This was a place where you could get fired or quit a job at 10 in the morning, and have a new job by noon."
But the shipyard closed in the late 1950's, and both RCA's surviving operations, now a unit of Martin Marietta, and Campbell's have only small administrative offices in Camden. Many of the two companies' manufacturing buildings are abandoned, and the neighborhoods where their employees once lived are daunting, skeletal remains.
The Terrace, one neighborhood near the old shipyard in South Camden, is now just four narrow, trash-strewn streets of dilapidated houses -- some abandoned, some occupied by squatters. On a recent day in the Terrace, young men sat on porches and stood in doorways without doors, holding cellular telephones to their ears and gazing warily at each car that passed.
"I get so angry when I see what's happened to this beautiful city," said Mario J. Ferrari, a retired chief of police in Camden. Mr. Ferrari, 66, was born and reared in Camden, and as a police officer he says he "walked every beat" in the city. "What this city used to be and what it has become makes me sick to my stomach," he said. "And now some people are fighting over how to resurrect it."
 
Local Politics
A Patronage Pie For County Leaders
To understand these tumultuous times in Camden, one must understand the city's political underpinnings. The affluent suburban communities in Camden County have built a powerful Democratic machine under leaders like former Gov. Jim Florio and the county's chief Democratic fund raiser, George E. Norcross 3d. As the suburbs prospered and the city declined, county political leaders were able to dominate city jobs, services and contracts.
Because the city qualified for a range of grants for the needy, the patronage machine grew stronger. "We meet every criteria for poverty, so we always received grants," explained Rosemary Jackson, the president of Camden's school board. "All it did was create a social service organization bigger than any Fortune 500 company. The money never trickled down to the people. It just created a bureaucracy and allowed the party bosses to control this plantation."
Ms. Jackson is a member of Young Leadership for Change, a new coalition of black and Hispanic Democratic politicians seeking to upend the old Democratic machine. They have already scored a string of election upsets. "We're challenging the old way things have been done," Ms. Jackson said. After she became head of the school board last year, one of the first things she did was cancel a $1 million insurance contract with a company owned by Mr. Norcross.
In its audit of the city, the state's departments of the Treasury and Community Affairs reported that many of the city's 1,400 workers were beholden to politicians who helped them get their jobs and that a large number of them were inexperienced or unqualified. The report cited numerous instances of mismanagement, including shoddy purchasing practices, improper contract bidding and unethical business relationships between current and former city and county officials.
The report urged city officials to take action "before the city falls into a further state of decay from which it cannot recover," adding, "It is dangerously close to that now."
[As a result of the audit, the state hired a certified public accountant on May 17 and appointed him a full-time monitor of Camden's fiscal affairs. It is also requiring Mr. Webster and the entire City Council to take courses on purchasing procedures and internal controls.]
In the last two years, the state has seized control of the city's parking authority and housing authority. Both were being used to dole out patronage jobs, state officials charged. The parking authority, which in most cities is self-sustaining and earns a profit for the city's coffers, was losing over $1 million annually, mainly, the state said, because of poor management.
 
The State's Role
Trying to Watch Where the Aid Goes
While some city officials say the state is being heavy-handed in its dealings with Camden, state officials say that the amount of money they send into Camden gives them the right to control city affairs, when necessary.
The city hardly fends for itself. Camden's tax base is so small that only $25 million is collected through municipal taxes. To balance an annual budget of $96 million, city officials count on the state for an additional $50 million. The rest comes from fees and grants.
Mr. Webster initially welcomed the state audit because he believed it would add weight to some of his own criticism of the city government, since many of the problems began long before he took office. But he says he now believes that the state has used the audit to "scandalize" the city. "It was used to address a political agenda instead of addressing the hard-core problems of the city," Mr. Webster said.
Moreover, the Mayor has grown even more incensed with the state for refusing to hand over Camden's share of Federal Empowerment Zone dollars. Under the program, which is President Clinton's main urban initiative, Camden and Philadelphia are jointly one of six nationwide zones designated to receive $100 million each over a 10-year period. Camden's share is $21 million.
State officials say that before they release the money to Camden, they want to be sure that mechanisms for accountability are in place and that the money is properly used to stimulate development.
"Based on our experience in Camden, we're not comfortable with this yet," said Robert W. Friant, public information officer for the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. "We don't want to see this $21 million wasted."
In the meantime, businesses interested in moving into the empowerment zone and taking advantage of the tax incentives it offers are losing their patience. Sylvia's, the renowned Harlem soul food restaurant, had been planning to open a new restaurant in the zone, providing 50 to 75 jobs. But after a frustrating year of unsuccessfully trying to secure various approvals from city boards, the restaurant has put off its plans to move to Camden.
"The incentives were attractive, and people in Camden said they really wanted us," recalled Van Woods, chief executive of the family-owned restaurant. "So we announced that we were going to open up in Camden. We figured it would happen in about two weeks. That was in January '95."
 
Control
An Obstinate Mayor And a Silent Partner
Many people blame the city's stalled progress solely on Mr. Webster. A former superintendent of Camden's public schools, Mr. Webster has become notorious, since he came into office two years ago, for moving slowly on city business and being obstinate in negotiations over development projects. Among business executives, stories of unanswered telephone calls and letters to the Mayor abound.
Often the only way to communicate with Mr. Webster is through his closest confidant, James Ricks, who has no official role or title but is universally described as having Rasputin-like control over the Mayor's affairs.
In its audit report, the state expressed concern about Mr. Ricks.
"The person who appears to function as a special assistant, according to widespread allegations, wields considerable authority and control over city operations," the report stated. Although he receives no salary from the city, Mr. Ricks has "at least at one time, had an interest in a variety of corporations that have done or are doing business with the city in violation of the city's conflict of interest policy," the report went on to note.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has seen, first hand, the power entrusted to Mr. Ricks. Last year, when the Governor convened a meeting to discuss Camden's future with Mayor Webster and other officials at the State House in Trenton, Mr. Webster did not show up. He sent Mr. Ricks instead.
There was "total shock" in the Governor's office, Mr. Friant of the Department of Community Affairs recalled. "Here's a guy who has no official standing in the state showing up for the Mayor," he said. "To say it was unprofessional is the understatement of the century."
Mr. Ricks, a social service entrepreneur who has been involved in city affairs for many years and has been a consultant to previous mayors, refused to comment on his current role. Mr. Webster, however, defended his relationship with Mr. Ricks.
"I desire to have him here," the Mayor said during an interview in his office, where Mr. Ricks stood silently by his side. "He has more institutional knowledge of what has gone on in this city than anybody I know."
In its audit, the state asked the city to clarify Mr. Ricks's role.
Although Mr. Webster was elected with the backing of the county Democratic machine, he has said he wants to dethrone the city's traditional power brokers. This desire, the Mayor asserted, has led to his current struggle with Cooper's Ferry, which has close ties to Democratic Party leaders. Established by the major landowners on Camden's waterfront -- RCA, Campbell's and the city -- Cooper's Ferry over the last decade has assembled public and private dollars and built a new state aquarium, a music and entertainment center and a ferry pier along the river.
Although some of the projects have struggled financially, they were necessary to jump-start development, said Thomas P. Corcoran, the Cooper's Ferry chief executive. "This waterfront development is not a panacea, but it's a critical element," he said.
But Mr. Webster criticizes the projects, contending that they have created only seasonal, minimum-wage jobs and that the tax breaks that Cooper's Ferry offers private companies are too lucrative.
The Mayor has dug in his heels over a Cooper's Ferry plan to build a 175-room waterfront hotel and conference center. Instead, Mr. Webster announced a competing plan in May 1995 to build a hotel, and has brought in his own developer. The plan, which would bring small businesses to inner-city neighborhoods away from the waterfront, has barely budged forward a year later.
Undeterred, Mr. Webster says he plans more aggressive responses to unfavorable publicity like that generated by the state audit. The Mayor conceded that he also needed to reorganize his own office. "Does the responsibility for some of this stuff rest on my shoulders?" he said. "Absolutely."
And for those who have resigned themselves to just waiting out the remaining two years of Mr. Webster's term, the Mayor has already announced his plans to seek re-election.
Despite the turmoil, there are signs of hope in the city, like the handful of community development groups that have started to stabilize small pockets of their neighborhoods. So far this year, the murder rate is down slightly.
And during a snowstorm this winter, it became clear just how much the people of Camden want to work.
Instead of hiring a professional plow service to clear the snow from Camden's school grounds, Ms. Jackson, the school board president, put the word out for people interested in working to report to City Hall. The next morning, she saw a picture that was like a contemporary version of "American Gothic."
"There were 500 men and women of all ages standing there with shovels in their hands," she recalled. "Tears came to my eyes. These people want to work and need to work."

HEADLINE: H.M.O.'s Cope With a Backlash on Cost Cutting

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
With much of the country shifting to managed care, a backlash of criticism by doctors, nurses and consumers -- and the legislative response -- is forcing health plans to abandon a range of cost-cutting practices that reward doctors and hospitals for limiting care.
Over the last 18 months, at least 34 states have outlawed or curtailed methods that many health maintenance organizations have used to shorten some types of hospital stays, discipline physicians or keep patients in the dark about the incentives and ground rules of managed care. 
 Fueled by horror stories of care denied and physicians' rancor at losing their freedom to treat patients without second-guessing, 400 bills affecting managed-care practices have been introduced in state legislatures this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.
In Congress, meanwhile, members of both parties are also pushing managed-care legislation, though business groups have in the past deflected such assaults.
Now that so many people have experience with managed care -- 53 million in H.M.O.'s and at least 70 million in other types of plans -- the nation's attention appears to have shifted from concern about getting runaway costs under control to questions about whether managed care has gone too far.
"We believe the whole concept of managed care is spurious," said Dr. Carl Weber, a surgeon in White Plains who heads a group of doctors pressing the State Department of Health to take a tougher stance on industry practices. "It is predicated on financial incentives to restrict care and access to care."
In California, "we see the human wreckage every day," added Kit Costello, a Sacramento nurse who heads the state nurses association, which has collected more than 800,000 signatures to put an initiative on the November ballot that would restrict the use of financial incentives for denying or delaying appropriate care.
The managed-care industry discounts the flurry of legislation and grass-roots protest, though state and national trade groups have lobbied furiously against many of the changes.
They are the product of "individuals who have a vested interest in maintaining the old style of health care," said Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, a trade group based in Washington.
Ms. Ignagni said that managed care plans had grown rapidly and that few members had been dissatisfied enough to leave them. "People are voting with their feet," she said, adding that a number of independent studies have found that H.M.O.'s match or exceed traditional fee-for-service medicine in the quality of several kinds of care.
Critics of managed care, on the other hand, say employers -- even as they increasingly demand independent appraisals of health organization quality -- often make it difficult for workers to change health plans. And many force employees to pay more of the costs to see doctors outside the managed-care network.
The most sweeping attacks on managed care have been aimed at the array of economic incentives and penalties that the industry directs at doctors, aiming to reverse what the industry says has been a tradition of excessive testing and referral to specialists.
For example, reacting to complaints that some health maintenance organizations exclude or expel doctors for ordering tests or consultations the health plans deem unnecessary, half a dozen states -- including Illinois and Georgia -- have required them to include any physician who has the appropriate credentials.
Maryland has been one of the most active states in regulating managed care. Last year it prohibited "withholds" -- the H.M.O. practice of holding back a portion of a physician's annual pay until the end of the year as an incentive to keep costs below certain targets. Last week Maryland extended the ban to physicians in fee-for-service discount networks. But the state continues to allow health organizations to pay doctors much of their income in the form of bonuses for keeping costs down -- an example of how managed-care companies, through alliances with consumer and physician groups, have been able to sustain their cost-cutting impetus.
Groups in several states are taking aim at "capitation," the practice of paying physicians a set amount -- the so-called capitation fee -- for each health-plan member who enrolls as their patient. Under many health-organization contracts, the cost of tests or specialist treatment comes out of the primary physician's fee.
While the earliest H.M.O.'s were essentially clinics with salaried doctors, most H.M.O.'s now are networks of physicians who follow a set of rules and typically get a monthly per-person payment. Some of the most respected H.M.O.'s pay bonuses to reward good medical results.
About half of the nation's 560 H.M.O.'s have capitation contracts with primary-care physicians, according to Interstudy, a Minnesota managed-care research center. And specialist groups, especially cardiologists, radiologists and psychiatrists, are also increasingly paid this way, said Marsha R. Gold, a senior fellow with Mathematica Policy Research, which recently studied capitation for Congress.
Although managed-care companies insist that capitation is not designed to deny medically necessary care, the practice stirs strong emotions. In Oregon, Dr. Gordon Miller, a Salem ophthalmologist, is gathering signatures for a voter initiative seeking to outlaw capitation.
The backlash against capitation also has reached the New York region. Physicians Health Services, a health maintenance organization based in Trumbull, Conn., is eliminating capitation fees for individual physicians and resuming fee-for-service payments. "We did not want to deal with the perception of an inducement to withhold necessary care," said Michael E. Herbert, the company's president.
But Physicians Health Services continues to give its doctors an incentive to control costs. The health group has "always tucked away 20 percent of what we paid doctors into a risk pool," Mr. Herbert said. "They get it back at the end of the year if they stay within budget," he added -- and they almost always do so.
Two groups of New York physicians, meanwhile, are fighting a shift to capitation by Aetna Health Plans. In March the doctors sued in Manhattan Supreme Court, contending that Aetna's payment systems give doctors an economic incentive to deny patient care.
An Aetna spokesman, Tom Greaney, said the lawsuit was "without merit."
"Aetna," he said, "is paying a fair level of compensation, and the payments are perfectly legal."
In California, most big medical groups seek to take on the risks created by capitation, hoping to pocket any profits from slashing costs. In that climate, the California Nurses Association has tiptoed around the issue in its initiative drive, which would ban bonuses and incentives for denying or delaying care, but not prohibit capitation.
On another front, at least 27 states recently enacted laws limiting managed-care practices that second-guess doctors or withhold payment for certain types of care.
Addressing one of the most politically charged issues, at least 18 states have banned so-called drive-through maternity care, in which hospitals send mothers home less than 48 hours after they give birth. They include New York and New Jersey, and Gov. John G. Rowland is expected to sign a recently passed measure in Connecticut.
But managed-care lobbyists persuaded 12 states, including New York and Connecticut (but not New Jersey), to add a loophole that removes the 48-hour requirement -- if the mother and her doctor give their consent and the health plan sends a nurse to visit the infant at home.
In Congress, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee also passed a 48-hours bill last month over opposition from the managed-care industry and business lobbyists. Calling on Congress to pass the measure, President Clinton said recently, "No insurance company should be free to make the final judgment about what is medically best for newborns and their mothers."
Only action at the Federal level could affect the thousands of self-insured employers that are exempt from state insurance laws.
Meanwhile, 14 states have barred insurers from refusing to pay for what turn out to be "unnecessary" emergency room visits, when chest pains, for example, are traced to heartburn, not a life-threatening heart attack. And 12 states guarantee a patient's right to go directly to certain types of specialists without first getting approval from a primary care physician, who insurers call a "gatekeeper."
Finally, a number of states are requiring managed-care companies and their doctors to tell patients about financial incentives and rules that may affect their care.
At least six states have outlawed gag rules under which some health maintenance organizations threaten to dismiss doctors if they inform patients about alternative care that might add to costs. Gov. George E. Pataki of New York included a gag-rule prohibition in a recent proposal that would seek to protect patients and physicians from abuses by managed-care organizations. Similarly, in California, the State Assembly unanimously approved a gag-rule ban last Monday.
The California Nurses Association's ballot proposal and a separate initiative sponsored by the Service Employees International Union would prohibit rules that prevent doctors from criticizing health maintenance organizations.
And in an action that officials said should set a standard for the entire health care industry, the Federal Government in March announced rules requiring managed health plans under Medicare and Medicaid to disclose financial arrangements for physicians to the Government and patients.
 Two other maps with the article, reflecting the prevalence of other types of restriction, erroneously omitted Georgia. The state prohibits health plans from restricting what doctors can tell patients about care choices; it also requires disclosure of financial incentives that health plans offer practitioners.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article last Sunday, about efforts by states to restrict health plans' cost-cutting practices, referred incorrectly to such laws in Georgia. And a map with the article, summarizing such restrictions nationwide, reflected the error. Georgia's requirement that health plans accept any physician with appropriate credentials applies only to insurer-based "preferred provider" organizations; it does not apply to all health networks.

THE GOOD SOCIETY
 The Humane Agenda.
 By John Kenneth Galbraith.
 152 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $21.95.
Newt Gingrich and company say they're on the side of history. John Kenneth Galbraith is here to tell the right they're wrong. Anyone who knows the difference between a propagandist and a professor won't be surprised to learn that Mr. Galbraith, a longtime eminence of the economics department at Harvard, wins the argument. In articulating his ideal of "the good society," though, his slim new volume -- synthesizing decades of reflection -- displays both the best and the worst of modern liberalism. It's one thing to assert government's indispensable role in helping give every citizen "access to a rewarding life"; it's another to pretend the bromides of the left aren't themselves ripe for rethinking. 
 The fundamental error made by Republicans out to roll back the welfare state, Mr. Galbraith contends, is that they think politicians and their actions drive history. In fact, he argues persuasively, it's the reverse. Liberals didn't create big government; history did. The social upheavals attending our shift from an agrarian economy to urban industrialization and mass production called forth popular demands for Social Security, medical and unemployment insurance, workplace and product safety regulation and more.
Liberals may have led government's accommodation to these larger trends, but they didn't cause them. Nor, rhetoric aside, can they be substantially reversed, as Newt Gingrich is learning the hard way, just as Ronald Reagan learned before him.
Still, if the welfare state is destined to be with us, Mr. Galbraith says, it could stand much improvement. His charge that America is a "democracy of the fortunate" is hard to dispute. The poor, who don't vote, have little voice. Even Democrats seem poised to end minimal guarantees of health and income support for the needy while leaving subsidies for the well-off untouched. Worse, as Mr. Galbraith shrewdly observes, since the affluent are typically hurt more by inflation than by unemployment, there's a perverse but powerful constituency for economic policies that dampen growth but preserve wealth.
For Mr. Galbraith, the guiding principle is that the good society not deny citizens, merely by accident of birth, the opportunity to rise as far as talent and temperament can take them. Against the current tide, this translates into urgent action on behalf of America's 15 million poor children, especially to improve the dismal education most get today.
In addition, Mr. Galbraith urges further cuts in military spending in the wake of the cold war's demise, to free up money for pressing domestic needs as well as for aid to fledgling East European democracies, in whose success he believes we have a huge stake. This isn't just a liberal's lament. With both parties agreed that the Pentagon should get 90 percent of its average cold-war funding a decade after the Russians' defense spending has dropped by two-thirds, Mr. Galbraith is right that people of all stripes should be asking questions.
As you might expect, "The Good Society" reprises a host of Mr. Galbraith's vintage cultural complaints. He denounces the equation of wealth with intelligence; the role of advertising in ginning up consumer desire; the injustice of private affluence alongside public squalor (why such expensively produced children's television, he asks, and such shoddy public schools?); and, of course, the perils of bureaucracy.
The only fault Mr. Galbraith seems to find with today's liberals is that they're occasionally not liberal enough. He thus lends regrettable authority to their complacency on budget deficits, and to Democrats' related reluctance to control costs in Medicare and Social Security, which as the baby boom nears retirement will gobble up resources for all the other public purposes liberals like Mr. Galbraith claim to cherish.
These blind spots aside, however, we're not likely to find as elegant a little restatement of the liberal creed, or its call to conscience.

HEADLINE: How to Succeed in Business (for Women)

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
ARE female business owners different from male owners?
No and yes. 
 All owners take risks, meet payrolls, worry about the bottom line and, yes, female owners also have to be good jugglers.
"Juggling home, family and business is what most of us do," said Valerie Maitland-Smith, president of the Westchester Association of Women Business Owners.
The association, which began 17 years ago as a forum and support group, has more than 200 members, including new entrepreneurs and longtime businesswomen.
"All we ask is that members be bona fide women business owners, which we define as a sole proprietor, working partner or nonsalaried agent, broker, contractor or any other individual whose earnings are derived principally from her work,"Ms. Maitland-Smith said. "I'm always amazed at the range of businesses our members are involved in.
"Our directory lists every occupation from accounting to topography. Although the majority of us run small businesses, 10 percent of our members run businesses that generate well over $1 million in sales annually, and two of us have megabusinesses, in the $50 million category."
Ms. Maitland-Smith, formerly a member of a KLM management team, left the airline to strike out on her own 25 years and five businesses ago.
"I've always harbored an adventuresome entrepreneurial streak," she said. "I came to the United States as a tourist and I liked it so much that I changed my visa and stayed on and became a citizen. I've started five businesses of my own since then. Only the first, a tour-operating company sending groups to Israel, begun just before the Six-Day War, was a disaster. The others have been successful."
Ms. Maitland-Smith is now president of the Success Connection in Pound Ridge, a consultant company that specializes in business and management development.
"I joined the Westchester Association of Women Business Owners, which we call Wawbo, on the advice of a friend," she said, "and it was wonderful for me. Not only was I struck by the feeling of camaraderie and support and the opportunity for networking at meetings but the programs were of a practical nature that helped me in my business."
Two years ago, for its 15th anniversary, the association started a fund to provide female owners with educational opportunities to improve their skills.
The director of the fund, Donna Goldman, said: "I.B.M. gave us the seed money, and with other corporate donations from Chase Manhattan, Smith Barney and the proceeds from our dinner-dance the education fund has grown to $40,000. We're using some of it to sponsor Wawbo's first conference ever, Women in Charge, which will be held on Friday, May 31, at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains. Pepsico paid for our mailing.
"It's an all-day event open to all women, 10 hours packed with information, exhibits, seminars, round-table chats and a dozen breakout sessions focused on showing women how to make it in the business world."
Ms. Goldman, a vice president at the Smith Barney branch in Mount Kisco and a certified financial adviser, said subjects of the 14 seminars at the conference had been chosen after a membership survey.
"Seminars totally reflect what our members deem most important," she said, adding that the topics would include starting a business and evaluating opportunities, understanding financial statements, retirement planning, marketing and sales plans, identifying techniques for specific businesses, computers, hardware and software and transition management, which entails how businesses grow.
"We feel we have something of value for everyone," she said.
Eileen Fisher, a fashion designer who in 12 years expanded her business from a $35 investment to one with 1996 projected sales of more than $50 million, will be the keynote speaker at a luncheon, Ms. Goldman said, adding that the morning keynote speaker will be District Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
"And Rich All, manager of Internet services for I.B.M., will be speaking about the Internet," she said. "There'll even be job opportunities at the conference. I know Smith Barney, for one, is hiring now, and they are willing to talk to anyone who might be looking for a career change."
Another member of the association, Joan Goodman, president of Glatzer Industries in New Rochelle, manufacturer of Emergency Beacon search and rescue products for the aviation industry, will conduct a round-table session. "My subject is Building a $1 Million Business, which I have managed to do with my company," Ms. Goodman said.
She had been special assistant to the president of the company, her husband, Stephen, who founded the company in 1968. "When my husband died in 1988," Ms. Goodman said, "I moved into the presidency. It was fortunate that I knew the business. Our products are marketed to private aircraft owners of small recreational planes and owners of business planes, and the recession was taking its toll. One of the first things I had to do was install a computer system and redo our marketing material and reorganize the finances of the company.
"I managed to accomplish it all without losing a customer. But I felt isolated and pretty much alone, because when it comes to business, men and women really do have different styles."
Three years ago Ms. Goodman read about the women's group and became a member. "As president of my company I was lonely at the top. I needed someone to talk to, to share experiences with," she said. "When I joined the club I immediately connected with other business owners. They were easy to talk to and they understood where I was coming from. We had the same frame of reference."
Ms. Goodman said another advantage is that members buy goods and services from one another.
"When I wanted to buy health insurance for my employees," she recounted, "I got a better understanding of what was needed and better service from a fellow member than I ever received from an outside insurance agent."
Women own 18 percent of businesses in the county, Ms. Maitland-Smith, and that number is growing. "What has happened is that women, as well as men, have become veterans of corporate downsizing," she said. "Many of those who have been terminated are exploring ways to start their own businesses. Women need two incomes today. We hope to see many of them at our Women in Charge conference."
The fees for the conference are $85 for members and $110 for nonmembers. Additional information is at 682-2113.
 
Membership Profile
 Fifty-seven percent of the more than 200 members of the Westchester Association of Women Business Owners work from home. They have owned their businesses for an average of six years and have 12.2 years' experience.
The association says the average sales are $130,000 a year, with 10 percent exceeding $1 million. Fifty-one percent operate service businesses, and 18 percent are consultants. Seventy-five percent run their businesses full time, averaging 36 hours a week. Seventy-seven percent are married. The average age of members is 43.
The areas of most interest to members are promotional and marketing techniques, business planning and expansion and customer service.
The dues are $95 a year. Business people who do not own their own businesses may join as associate members. PENNY SINGER
 The article also referred imprecisely to Donna Goldman of the Westchester Association of Women Business Owners Education Fund. She is its president; it has two directors besides her.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 19 about women who own businesses misspelled the surname of the manager of Internet services for International Business Machines. He is Rich Wall, not All.
The article also misstated the initial investment of Eileen Fisher, a fashion designer. She started her business with $350, not $35.

GOD HAS NINETY-NINE NAMES
Reporting From a Militant Middle East
By Judith Miller
574 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
On the eve of the heady 1960's, the sociologist Daniel Bell pointed to "the end of ideology." In watershed 1989, which brought the end of the cold war, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama foresaw "the end of history." Yet, in ways neither Mr. Bell nor Mr. Fukuyama ever imagined, the odd product of history and ideology we have learned to call religious fundamentalism may yet turn out to be the real measure of our times. 
 In fact, from St. Petersburg, Fla., to St. Petersburg, Russia, and Tripoli, Iowa, to Tripoli, Libya, and Lebanon, the new political religion -- or religious politics -- has now taken root nearly everywhere but Western Europe and the surviving Communist states. Judith Miller, a 19-year veteran of The New York Times and the paper's former Cairo bureau chief, prefers to call its predominant Middle Eastern form "Islamism." Whatever its name, the phenomenon has flourished like kudzu among the ruins and crevices left by liberalism, socialism, nationalism and the crash of rising expectations.
 But the Islamic Middle East seems to be its happy hunting ground. In Lebanon, Ms. Miller has watched 5-year-olds march under the burning eyes of bearded kindergarten teachers who get their lessons from Iran. In Egypt, one of her sources, a columnist and critic of the militants, was gunned down after reporting that senior clerics promised martyrs an eternity of blissful pederasty. Such things can make life difficult for people in the region. But the bombs and bombers they inspire are also at least a potential threat to the rest of us.
"The Middle East is not the Middle West," the Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens once observed. Under most other circumstances, the dour Mr. Arens is probably not Ms. Miller's kind of guy. But on this, at least, she is all but certain to agree. What distinguishes her from Mr. Arens is her determination to understand as well as to master the differences, and to make sure we understand them too.
"I am not a scholar and this is not a scholarly book," she declares preemptively before she even reaches Chapter I. This is true. While generally accurate, Ms. Miller's history comes out of the can. She openly acknowledges her reliance on translators. Like most smart journalists, Ms. Miller piggybacks on scholars, in this case including such familiar suspects as Fouad Ajami, Bernard Lewis, Ghassam Salameh and Emmanuel Sivan.
But her reporting is its own reward. Like such now-forgotten giants of the correspondent's art as Dorothy Thompson, John Gunther and Vincent Sheehan, Ms. Miller is at her best at point-blank range: the interview, the street scene, the face in the crowd, which distinguish a place and a moment from all others. An amateur in the best sense, she is equally good at explaining why the Middle East has captured her imagination since she was a student at Barnard in 1971.
Her subsequent adventures are the kind that make an editor's day. En route with the author through 10 countries and a very big book, the reader visits Lebanese Baalbek in jeans and a T-shirt and an Iranian Persepolis covered from head to toe, attends a Sudanese execution and an Israeli interrogation, just barely escapes a pass by Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi of Libya, enjoys a lift and repeated dinner invitations from King Hussein of Jordan, is issued a Saudi affidavit certifying that the bearer is not a prostitute and watches Iran's theocracy fray and corrode like the Shah's regime 20 years ago.
Along the way, there are the conversations with the men in charge and the man on the street that all good reporters exist to report. But at every stop, there are also the conversations with decent, smart, tough and troubled women that only a good female reporter can deliver.
Fair-minded to her fingertips, Ms. Miller offers sensible thoughts and afterthoughts on a part of the world Americans find intermittently fascinating, sometimes scary, but invariably baffling. No reader of Ms. Miller is ever again likely to think that Arabs are closer to one another, let alone Iranians, than Sicilians are to Finns.
But her real comparative advantages are focus and nuance. The former allows her to note evenhandedly how the people she so plausibly likes have consistently been their own worst enemy, while Americans and Israelis too have done their part to create the golems that now haunt them. Her sense of nuance not only allows her to see such unexpected change as an American-financed birth control clinic in Egypt that actually works. It even allows a feminist case for what the author herself sees as the inhibiting and discriminatory conventions of Islamic modesty. The veil, Ms. Miller observes, can also be a social buffer. It can express generational revolt. It can be a passport to hitherto inaccessible jobs, a cultural analgesic, even a way to save on cosmetics. The argument would not occur to most men.
Ms. Miller's bad news is that Middle Easterners suffer from what is arguably the world's highest ratio of discontent to civilization. As recently as the early 1960's, the seven most prosperous Arab states were no poorer, even slightly richer, than their Asian rim counterparts. Today the same countries are already lengths behind the Asian tigers, not to mention Israel.
In a globalized economy where markets vote daily with their software, 58 percent of foreign investment now goes to Asia, 3 percent to the Middle East. From Algeria to the Sudan, from Syria to Saudi Arabia, rampaging population growth has left economic development in the dust. Yet the region buys half of all arms sold to what we still call the third world, and several Islamic sources not only confirm but volunteer that the Koran is no barrier to nuclear fantasies.
Ms. Miller's good news, if relative, is that Islamists are not inevitable winners, that they can be as pragmatic as anyone else and that Israel, Lebanon and Jordan have all had some success containing and domesticating them. Their own contentiousness is a natural obstacle to any "Khomeintern." They can be a threat to individual states, to the regional status quo, perhaps to economic stability and certainly to our own sense of security. But they are not Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.
Her argument stops here. But what it suggests about the appropriateness, likely efficacy, even rationality of our current national energy habits, defense priorities, special relationships and cultural blind spots, already demands another book. With luck, Ms. Miller herself is now working on the sequel. If not, we should at least hope someone else is.

HEADLINE: Pataki Needs to Rethink Plan on Juvenile Crime

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The May 9 Metro Matters column calls attention to a troubling conundrum -- how to prevent as well as punish juvenile crime -- that needs to be addressed by Gov. George E. Pataki's budget proposal now before both houses in Albany. 
 Proven preventive services and constructive community development projects are more effective and economical than mandatory sentencing and more prisons.
While appropriate sentences should be meted out to offenders, even those as young as 16, when the crime and the criminal deserve it, mandatory sentencing and the wholesale transfer of high school kids to adult prisons are not the answer.
Effective legislation must also preserve judicial discretion so that each young person will be responded to individually and appropriately.

GOD HAS NINETY-NINE NAMES
Reporting From a Militant Middle East
By Judith Miller
574 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
On the eve of the heady 1960's, the sociologist Daniel Bell pointed to "the end of ideology." In watershed 1989, which brought the end of the cold war, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama foresaw "the end of history." Yet, in ways neither Mr. Bell nor Mr. Fukuyama ever imagined, the odd product of history and ideology we have learned to call religious fundamentalism may yet turn out to be the real measure of our times. 
 In fact, from St. Petersburg, Fla., to St. Petersburg, Russia, and Tripoli, Iowa, to Tripoli, Libya, and Lebanon, the new political religion -- or religious politics -- has now taken root nearly everywhere but Western Europe and the surviving Communist states. Judith Miller, a 19-year veteran of The New York Times and the paper's former Cairo bureau chief, prefers to call its predominant Middle Eastern form "Islamism." Whatever its name, the phenomenon has flourished like kudzu among the ruins and crevices left by liberalism, socialism, nationalism and the crash of rising expectations.
 But the Islamic Middle East seems to be its happy hunting ground. In Lebanon, Ms. Miller has watched 5-year-olds march under the burning eyes of bearded kindergarten teachers who get their lessons from Iran. In Egypt, one of her sources, a columnist and critic of the militants, was gunned down after reporting that senior clerics promised martyrs an eternity of blissful pederasty. Such things can make life difficult for people in the region. But the bombs and bombers they inspire are also at least a potential threat to the rest of us.
"The Middle East is not the Middle West," the Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens once observed. Under most other circumstances, the dour Mr. Arens is probably not Ms. Miller's kind of guy. But on this, at least, she is all but certain to agree. What distinguishes her from Mr. Arens is her determination to understand as well as to master the differences, and to make sure we understand them too.
"I am not a scholar and this is not a scholarly book," she declares preemptively before she even reaches Chapter I. This is true. While generally accurate, Ms. Miller's history comes out of the can. She openly acknowledges her reliance on translators. Like most smart journalists, Ms. Miller piggybacks on scholars, in this case including such familiar suspects as Fouad Ajami, Bernard Lewis, Ghassam Salameh and Emmanuel Sivan.
But her reporting is its own reward. Like such now-forgotten giants of the correspondent's art as Dorothy Thompson, John Gunther and Vincent Sheehan, Ms. Miller is at her best at point-blank range: the interview, the street scene, the face in the crowd, which distinguish a place and a moment from all others. An amateur in the best sense, she is equally good at explaining why the Middle East has captured her imagination since she was a student at Barnard in 1971.
Her subsequent adventures are the kind that make an editor's day. En route with the author through 10 countries and a very big book, the reader visits Lebanese Baalbek in jeans and a T-shirt and an Iranian Persepolis covered from head to toe, attends a Sudanese execution and an Israeli interrogation, just barely escapes a pass by Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi of Libya, enjoys a lift and repeated dinner invitations from King Hussein of Jordan, is issued a Saudi affidavit certifying that the bearer is not a prostitute and watches Iran's theocracy fray and corrode like the Shah's regime 20 years ago.
Along the way, there are the conversations with the men in charge and the man on the street that all good reporters exist to report. But at every stop, there are also the conversations with decent, smart, tough and troubled women that only a good female reporter can deliver.
Fair-minded to her fingertips, Ms. Miller offers sensible thoughts and afterthoughts on a part of the world Americans find intermittently fascinating, sometimes scary, but invariably baffling. No reader of Ms. Miller is ever again likely to think that Arabs are closer to one another, let alone Iranians, than Sicilians are to Finns.
But her real comparative advantages are focus and nuance. The former allows her to note evenhandedly how the people she so plausibly likes have consistently been their own worst enemy, while Americans and Israelis too have done their part to create the golems that now haunt them. Her sense of nuance not only allows her to see such unexpected change as an American-financed birth control clinic in Egypt that actually works. It even allows a feminist case for what the author herself sees as the inhibiting and discriminatory conventions of Islamic modesty. The veil, Ms. Miller observes, can also be a social buffer. It can express generational revolt. It can be a passport to hitherto inaccessible jobs, a cultural analgesic, even a way to save on cosmetics. The argument would not occur to most men.
Ms. Miller's bad news is that Middle Easterners suffer from what is arguably the world's highest ratio of discontent to civilization. As recently as the early 1960's, the seven most prosperous Arab states were no poorer, even slightly richer, than their Asian rim counterparts. Today the same countries are already lengths behind the Asian tigers, not to mention Israel.
In a globalized economy where markets vote daily with their software, 58 percent of foreign investment now goes to Asia, 3 percent to the Middle East. From Algeria to the Sudan, from Syria to Saudi Arabia, rampaging population growth has left economic development in the dust. Yet the region buys half of all arms sold to what we still call the third world, and several Islamic sources not only confirm but volunteer that the Koran is no barrier to nuclear fantasies.
Ms. Miller's good news, if relative, is that Islamists are not inevitable winners, that they can be as pragmatic as anyone else and that Israel, Lebanon and Jordan have all had some success containing and domesticating them. Their own contentiousness is a natural obstacle to any "Khomeintern." They can be a threat to individual states, to the regional status quo, perhaps to economic stability and certainly to our own sense of security. But they are not Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.
Her argument stops here. But what it suggests about the appropriateness, likely efficacy, even rationality of our current national energy habits, defense priorities, special relationships and cultural blind spots, already demands another book. With luck, Ms. Miller herself is now working on the sequel. If not, we should at least hope someone else is.

HEADLINE: In South Africa, Bringing Theaters to the Townships

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: VOSLOORUS TOWNSHIP, South Africa

 BODY:
Hollywood's future in Africa may rest on the shoulders of people like Jerry Phadima.
Until two years ago, Mr. Phadima ran a spaza bioscope. (A spaza, in black township lingo, is an informal shop run in a living room. Bioscope, a turn-of-the-century word for movies, is still in use here.) Toting a 16-millimeter projector, Mr. Phadima showed old films in churches, schools, abandoned buildings -- anywhere he could get a crowd and charge 2 rand -- about 40 cents -- a head. 
 "I sometimes had 500 people," he says. "There was no air-conditioning in these unhealthy places. Often they sat on the floor. But people in the townships were crying for cinemas."
Now he is a franchisee for Maxi Movies, a new South African company that is trying to do for the consumption of movies what Colonel Sanders did for the consumption of chicken: make it cheap and easily available. Since the company deliberately seeks black franchisees, it is also in the forefront of creating black business here. While large South African companies are promoting some black managers, franchise companies, in everything from hamburgers to hair products, are doing more to help blacks own their own businesses.
"I'm from the street," Mr. Phadima says. "But my aim was always to see myself as a big-business man. And today, you see -- I'm wearing a tie."
Whatever the virtues of franchising when it comes to economic empowerment, it also has tangible benefits for Hollywood. From the entertainment industry's point of view, Africa is a great hole into which its products disappear without returning a bit of income. Its films are popular. (Asked their favorite film stars, African teen-agers will often answer "Americans! Jean-Claude Van Damme! Arnold Schwarzenegger!").
But while there are 51 countries in Africa, only 3 -- Egypt, South Africa and Zimbabwe -- have theater chains that show films legally and pay royalties. Almost everything else is pirated. Sometimes the quality is so bad that it is clear the tape was shot in a movie theater with a video camera. In rural areas, spaza operators nail sheets to baobab trees and run their projectors off car batteries.
That is the market Maxi Movies is ultimately aiming at, with the intention of paying royalties back to Hollywood. It has nine theaters now -- six in South Africa, two in Swaziland and one in Namibia -- and deals in the works for 10 more, everywhere from Mozambique to Uganda.
But the black neighborhoods of South Africa are a huge untapped market. Only about two million of South Africa's 41 million people go to the movies regularly. Because of economics and apartheid, nearly all of South Africa's 650 movie screens are in downtown areas or white suburbs. Before 1990, blacks were not allowed to go into those theaters.
So by some estimates, 30 million South Africans -- 75 percent of the population -- do not live within walking or driving distance of a theater. And it is not as if they are all home watching videos, either. Only half the homes in South Africa have electricity, and only 250,000 black homes have videocassette recorders.
But neither can most South Africans afford movies in the theaters that whites patronize. A couple on a date taking a taxi from Vosloorus to downtown Johannesburg would pay 52 rand in taxi fare plus 40 rand for two tickets -- a total of $22. Not much for an American, perhaps, but serious money to a laborer who is lucky to earn 50 rand -- $12 -- a day.
Two Maxi Movie tickets will cost 14 rand for a double feature, and splurging on a township taxi instead of walking will add 4 rand -- for a total of about $4.25
Maxi Movies keeps costs low by projecting video instead of film, and designing theaters so efficiently that they can be run by two people.
The video projectors, like those used on airplanes and in sports bars, cost a third of what the 35-millimeter film projectors used in conventional theaters do, and do not need a projectionist to run them. Also, a distributor like Mr. Nothard has to pay Hollywood far less for the right to show a video three months after the motion picture is released.
Each 96-seat theater -- small enough to retain "big screen" picture quality even in video -- has a normal staff of four, but can be run by two: the ticket-seller can also sell popcorn by simply swivelling her stool around and the manager on the phone lining up new films can load the videocassette and start the projector from inside his office.
Maxi Movies was started by Sven Nothard, the white former chief executive of Numetro, one of the two chains that own nearly all the theaters in the country. For about $500,000, he sold 60 percent to Ster-Kinekor, the other major chain, and Thebe Investments, a black-run investment house connected to the African National Congress.
Before 1990, Mr. Nothard said, Numetro and Ster-Kinekor could not build theaters in black areas. "You weren't given license by the Government," he said. "But it didn't take a degree from Harvard to put two and two together and see how big the market was." That is, if movies could be made affordable.
Mr. Phadima runs his theater -- as comfortable as its American counterparts, though cleaner -- with his wife, daughter and a part-time janitor. His monthly receipts amount to 40,000 rand, or $9,500, against expenses of 26,000 rand, or $6,200. The personal touch is crucial to his success -- a new notion in South Africa, where indifference to the consumer is the norm. When he's not in the lobby asking customers what films they want, Mr. Phadima is visiting churches and schools drumming up new customers.
"Our franchisees must live in the community and be known in it," Mr. Nothard said. He would not, for example, sell a franchise in far-off rural Ladysmith to someone from Soweto, the huge township near Johannesburg. "You have to be behind the counter."
Knowing one's audience takes other forms. In Vosloorus during apartheid, he said, "People were burning each other, shooting each other, putting 'necklaces' around each other," Mr. Phadima says. "You must know your township. Here, they want karate and action movies." He is showing "Goldeneye," a James Bond movie, and "Tough and Deadly," an obscure police thriller.
By contrast, the Maxi Movie in Mbabane, the capital of Swaziland, an independent kingdom inside South Africa, will show "Sense and Sensibility" and "Mr. Holland's Opus" next month.
The biggest problem for the franchisees is time lag. New movies are released in South Africa anywhere from a month to six months after their American premieres. Six months after that, Hollywood studios ship a videotape version to home video-rental shops in South Africa. "That's the trigger for piracy all over Africa," Mr. Nothard said.
He wants to get videotapes for his theaters three months before the stores do, but he wants them encrypted so they cannot be copied. Some studios go along. Others, unhappy with the crude anti-piracy system he uses, refuse. He has hired a European company to develop a sophisticated tape-encryption system that would give each projector a decoder.
Each franchise costs 350,000 rand, about $80,000. For that, Maxi Movies provides the theater and training. It also arranges financing, which is crucial. Mr. Phadima said he was nearly penniless when he enlisted as a franchisee. Ster-Kinekor, one of Maxi Movies's parent companies, is controlled by the Old Mutual and Sanlam Insurance companies, which have combined assets of $50 billion, so financing is hardly impossible
Of the nine initial franchises, Mr. Nothard said, one failed; the franchisee was replaced by a company employee. Now, he said, "six have outstanding results, two are battling, and one is below break-even."
"Africans do not have the cinema-going habit," said Amos Zwane, a Maxi franchisee in Kasigo, a black township near an industrial suburb of Johannesburg. "We still have to build it. But it's a very, very good business proposition."

HEADLINE: KENNEDY AIRPORT IN BIG REVAMPING AFTER LONG DELAY

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
In the confident 1950's, New Yorkers would travel to the airport, not to fly but to dine in a glass-enclosed restaurant as airliners lifted into the twilight. The image is almost fantastic now, as harried travelers flee Kennedy International Airport's sagging terminals to fight their way home through the endless traffic on the Van Wyck Expressway.
But after 20 years with almost no improvement, New York's primary airport is undergoing a profound transformation. In the next five years, the airport's managers and private developers are expected to spend more than $3 billion to replace two aging terminals, rebuild airport roads and parking lots and build a rail line that will ease travel between Kennedy's terminals as well as connect the airport to Manhattan. 
 In part, the plan is notable simply for its scale: $3 billion is triple what it cost to build the World Trade Center. But also remarkable is that the four projects are moving forward after years, or decades, of inaction. There has been no new terminal construction at the airport in 25 years, and the plan to build a rail connection has been under study for three decades.
Why now? The money is available, both from fees tacked onto airline tickets and from private developers. And the political will is there, with both city and state officials agreeing that the poor condition of the airport, which was ranked third worst in the world in a survey of international passengers this year, has made Kennedy an embarrassment to New York. Particularly galling to many New York politicians has been the Port Authority's recent investments in the more modern Newark International Airport, which has threatened to eclipse Kennedy as the New York region's premier airport.
As Charles A. Gargano, director of economic development for New York State and vice chairman of the Port Authority board, tells it, Gov. George E. Pataki gathered his appointees to the authority board shortly after his election in 1994 and told them that the rebuilding of Kennedy should be a top priority.
"It was a question of saying, 'Enough of talk and plans and studies,' " Mr. Gargano said. "Kennedy is in dire need of improvement."
The airport, Mr. Gargano went on, "was a disgrace to New York City and to New York State."
Still, city officials are critical of several aspects of the Port Authority's plans. John S. Dyson, chairman of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's council of economic advisers, said the $1.5 billion cost of the new terminals could make Kennedy more expensive for airlines and travelers.
And city officials contend that the authority's rail plan is unworkable because travelers from Manhattan would have to switch trains in Queens to get to the airport. The Mayor is expected to release his own rail access plan this week.
For all of Kennedy's problems, its old terminals and the shortage of shops and restaurants, the central problem for travelers has long been the incredible difficulty of reaching the airport. It is a long and grinding trip as drivers fight the traffic on the Van Wyck Expressway, only to find themselves negotiating a confusing airport road system seemingly always under minor construction. The trip can also be expensive. A cab ride to Manhattan from Kennedy now costs $30.
While airport managers cannot control the traffic problems outside Kennedy, they promise to make driving inside the airport easier. They plan to couple ongoing road improvements with a $1 billion rail line to Manhattan. Both projects are scheduled for completion by 2001, although elements of each will be operating before then.
The $540 million road project, started in 1989, involves a complete rebuilding of the underground utilities as well as the roads and parking areas at the airport. About half the project, including a large section of the utility work, is complete.
The reconstruction of about 32 miles of airport roadway is expected to eliminate 25 intersections and traffic bottlenecks that have plagued Kennedy for years. The new road system will divide the central terminal area into four sections. Barry Abramowitz, who is managing the road project for the authority, said the new road system would channel drivers directly to their terminals, rather than forcing them to circle the airport.
Port Authority directors acknowledge that the road rebuilding project will not solve the congestion problem at the airport, where 100,000 people on average flood the roads every day. They believe the new railway will draw enough passengers to reduce traffic tie-ups.
The rail plan calls for a small train to circle the central terminal area and transport passengers between terminals. The train would also connect the airport to the Long Island Rail Road at its Jamaica Station and the city subway at the Howard Beach stop. Travelers who wanted to reach Kennedy Airport from Manhattan would board an L.I.R.R. train at Pennsylvania Station and transfer at Jamaica. The airport train would run along an elevated track on the median of the Van Wyck Expressway.
Critics, including city officials, have said the plan will not work because travelers will refuse to transfer between the L.I.R.R. and the airport train. But Governor Pataki, the Port Authority, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the L.I.R.R. have all approved the plan, maintaining that the transfer at Jamaica will be seamless, particularly for passengers with baggage. Officials managing the project have not worked out the the transfer details.
Port Authority officials, as well as transit experts from the Regional Plan Association, have also said it is not possible to run an L.I.R.R. train from Manhattan directly to the airport because the big trains could not handle the turns between the terminals and because there is not enough track space to handle the additional trains. Authority officials have said they plan to begin construction before the end of the year and have the railroad operating by 2001.
Lewis M. Eisenberg, the authority chairman, has agreed that the railway might not be the perfect solution to reaching Kennedy Airport, but he said it was the best solution using available technology. Mr. Eisenberg also said it was a practical solution, unlike many past proposals, which were either too expensive or politically unfeasible.
"One of the standards we use to measure what can be done is, in a reasonable time, can we put a shovel in the ground, can we achieve our goals," he said. "I have seen plans that could never have been accomplished, even if there could have been an agreement."
Mr. Eisenberg said a direct connection to Manhattan could be added in the future, if the track space and technology become available. "We are leaving our options open," he said. "But we also want to have plans that can be worked."
The International Arrivals Building, the center of New York's primary gateway, has been described as an old terminal from a small, Midwestern city. The largest and busiest of Kennedy's nine terminals, it has 1.3 million square feet of space and handles 6 million passengers each year.
When it was completed in 1954, the building was hailed by both aviation experts and architecture critics. But with no major improvements in 40 years, it has become worn and congested. It is the only terminal at Kennedy that is managed by the Port Authority, but that is expected to change by the end of the year when the authority transfers ownership to a private development group. The group, headed by a Dutch airport management company, Schiphol, will spent $1 billion to redesign and renovate the terminal.
The developers say construction will proceed in stages, with the arrivals building staying open throughout the project. The main terminal is expected to be finished by 2000, and the final sections the following year. According to the company that will handle the construction, LCOR Inc., the new terminal will have a centralized customs processing area and better shops and restaurants.
About 70 percent of the cost of the new building is expected to be raised from fees charged to airlines using the terminal. The rest is from a percentage of retail sales from the new food court and shopping mall. Schiphol is expected to pay rent to the Port Authority for the terminal -- figures from $15 million and $40 million a year have been reported -- but both parties have declined to say how much until talks are completed.
City officials have questioned whether the new management will have to raise airline fees to recoup the money spent on the terminal. They are concerned that an increase in fees would make Kennedy, already the most expensive airport in the country, less competitive. But Schiphol and LCOR say that they will be able to make enough money without an across-the-board fee increase, largely by changing the way the airlines are billed and increasing terminal efficiency.
The larger airlines that use the terminal are either reserving judgment until the details of the deal are released or are welcoming the improvements to the terminal.
"The feeling is that finally something is happening at Kennedy," said Marta-Marie Lotti, spokeswoman for Alitalia Airlines. "We are just happy and eager to see it finalized."
While work on the International Arrivals Building is not expected to start until next year, the steel frame of the airport's second new terminal, Terminal One, should be taking shape within the next few months. Terminal One is a half the size of the International Arrivals Building and half the price, $425 million.
The terminal is being built by four of Kennedy's largest foreign airlines, Lufthansa, JAL, Air France and Korea Air Lines. "There are no tax dollars involved in this project," said Charles Croce, a spokesman for Lufthansa. "We share the risks and we share the profits."
The combination of private and public funds is necessary to draw the money and expertise needed to rebuild Kennedy, Mr. Eisenberg said.
"Nothing could be more important than returning Kennedy Airport to the prominence it once enjoyed," he added. "We could not possibly do that without making a major investment in the airport infrastructure."

"I don't want a job," Mr. Elliot said. "I would never take one." 
 Instead he works as a temp, with no job security, no benefits and little chance for corporate advancement. Instead he has the flexibility to pursue his own interests, which include the underground music scene, and most important to him, a freedom from long-term commitment.
"I don't want to get tied down to anybody's plan," said Mr. Elliot, who is 25.
These days, Mr. Elliot can be found in front of a Macintosh computer at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the giant utility company in San Francisco. Since November, he has helped manage the company's public Web site, building Web pages and posting documents.
His previous assignment was at Peachpit Press, a technical publishing company in Berkeley, Calif., where he worked for nearly a year, far longer than the temporary employment agency, or the publishing company, had planned. Mr. Elliot filled in as technical production manager, a position the company eventually offered him permanently. Mr. Elliot, of course, turned it down and moved on.
The agency he relies on is Mactemps Inc., a national company. When the Pacific Gas and Electric job ends, he has no idea where he will be sent next.
Mr. Elliot's approach is not a life strategy for the faint of heart, but at roughly $20 a hour, the equivalent of more than $40,000 a year if he were to work every day, Mr. Elliot can save money to get him through any slow times. And so far, since beginning his temp career when he arrived in San Francisco from Chicago a few years ago, there have not been many. Mr. Elliot said he could not remember all the places he has worked for Mactemps.
Mr. Elliot grew up using computers, and as a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1980's he became proficient with a wide variety of software. He has been a frequent contributor to the Internet's discussion forums for nearly 10 years, and watched the development of the Internet into a commercial medium. His breadth of knowledge wins him a variety of assignments, but he sees the Internet as the ticket to the more interesting ones.
"I've always been a tech freak," Mr. Elliot said. "It just so happened that when I came out here they could put me to work."
Like most people working on the Internet, Mr. Elliot taught himself most everything he knows about the Web, staying up late at night to build Web pages, try out the latest Web software and generally poke around.
During the assignment at the technical publishing company, he helped co-workers build and start the company's Web site, in the meantime picking up what experience he could.
Picking up skills in one job that can be applied to the next is how many temps raise their salaries. In Mr. Elliot's case, he wants all the Web publishing experience he can get so that he can someday own his own Internet services business. But he is also a jack-of-all-trades computer operator within the Macintosh world, with a wide range of expertise. At Peachpit, he set up the company's data base and helped manage book production.
He turned to Mactemps, he said, because he thought that would land him better assignments than he could find as an independent. And the managers at Mactemps, which has offices in San Francisco and Santa Clara, Calif., in Silicon Valley, say his background is perfect for today's high-tech market. The Internet has led to a surge in demand for anybody with Web development experience.
"The reason an agency is good is it gives you access to places you wouldn't otherwise have access to, like P.G. & E.," Mr. Elliot said. "It used to be companies like P.G. & E. would hire direct, but now they go through agencies."
Like a lot of "permanent" temps, Mr. Elliot is choosing this way to earn money so he has time and energy for what he considers his true career these days: he publishes a culture magazine about the underground music scene, a project he began three years ago while working in Chicago as sales clerk in an apparel shop. Today, he devotes his evenings to the magazine, working out of his apartment after a day at one office or another.

HEADLINE: A Temporary Force To Be Reckoned With;
Wanted: High-Tech 'Hired Guns' And Agencies to Provide Them

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 19

 BODY:
The hiring hall of the Information Age is a fourth-floor office encased in glass and granite, just a few blocks from a waterfront that once buzzed with temporary workers of an entirely different sort.
It is not really a hall, of course, nor does it hire out in the traditional sense. It is more like an air traffic control center: a Web-page maker is being sent north to a small start-up company; a "content specialist" is hurried across Lake Washington to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash.; a technical recruiter is dispatched south of Seattle. 
 "The appetite for technical skill in this city has become insatiable," said Sheri Lee, manager of Resource Management Services in Seattle. The company finds temporary workers for high-technology and professional businesses. Six years ago the company did not exist; now it can barely keep pace with demand.
It is at the confluence of two business trends: the unquenchable need for high-technology specialists in all areas and the rise of temporary- placement firms. The resulting demand is not just for technically proficient temporary workers but for controllers to sort them out and direct them where they are needed.
Resource Management is one of at least 229 companies nationwide that specialize in professional temporary placement, high-tech or otherwise. In 1990, there were only 44 such companies, said Jim Kennedy, who publishes an annual directory of temporary- placement companies.
Mr. Kennedy foresees a day in the near future when many corporations will have a core group of permanent employees and then "flex" the rest of the staff -- the "contract" or "just-in-time" employees, as he calls them.
The Labor Department reports a similar wind blowing through the American workplace. In 1983, there were 619,000 temporary jobs in the country. By 1994, that number had grown to 2.25 million, and the Government projects a 60 percent increase by the year 2005. Still, the total number of temporary workers is less than 2 percent of all jobs.
The fastest-growing segment of temporary jobs is in technical and professional fields, which make up 15 percent of the temporary force, Labor Department officials say.
While the image of temps has long been that of downsized, down-on-their-luck people in between real jobs, Ms. Lee laughs at the very idea: the people who come through her office are paid $15 to $50 an hour, for contracts that last three to six months on average.
As competition has heated up among temporary-placement companies, some benefits are now being offered. Resource Management just started a 401(k) program for the temporary workers it places.
"A lot of people consider this a preferred form of employment," Ms. Lee said. "These folks control their own destiny. They are shopping around, in some cases. Or they just don't want to be at one place for a long time."
Critics may see the rise of the technology temporary service as another nail in the coffin of American job security. These jobs, typically, offer no benefits, no chance for lasting bonds with employees. They are held by people who act as digital smoke jumpers.
"The fact is that in today's interconnected global economy, you have to watch out for yourself," said Bruce Steinberg, a spokesman for the National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services, a trade group based in Alexandria, Va. "People are starting to recognize that job security is no longer with the corporation, it is with the individual."
In the argot of this evolving trade, temps are called "a resource" or "talent" or "a hired gun." They are all ages, from all backgrounds. But no matter what they are called, the demand is huge.
Because far more jobs are available than people to fill them, the qualified technical temps tend to have the upper hand right now, Mr. Kennedy said.
Indeed, they are courted and stroked, Ms. Lee said. "In the end, there are jobs we just cannot fill," she said. "People always thought this sort of thing was employer driven. But it's just the opposite."
Employers say the rise of technical temps allows them to be more flexible. At Silicon Graphics Inc., as many as 500 of the workers in technical fields are on short-term assignment at the company's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and elsewhere around the country. The company employs 11,000 people.
"I feel what we're seeing is a real reconfiguration of the workplace," said Eric Lane, the director of worldwide staffing for Silicon Graphics, whose powerful computers are widely used for engineering, architecture, special effects for films and other work where three-dimensional design is important. Temps are brought in -- at up to $60 an hour for some specialized people -- to start a new project or complete an old one.
Managing temps is different from managing permanent employees, Mr. Lane said, because "you have to think about how they can be used right away."
A small company, Photodisc Inc., in Seattle, which sells stock photography images from CD-ROM's and a World Wide Web site, has used about 10 people from Resource Management. "It's win-win for everybody," said Ann Fosburgh, a human resources specialist at Photodisc. "You can come in and see if you like us or like doing a certain kind of work, and if it works out there may be a full-time job, and if it doesn't work out, you go home at the end of it."
Ms. Lee said she thought of her job as a cross between a talent scout and broker. Some of her best finds have been people who are looking for less work, people who want more time to ski or spend with their families.
"Downsizing is not a factor," Ms. Lee said. "More often, we're dealing with somebody who wants to get off the fast track."
Meegan Glouner, who is 30, wanted a job at a good-paying high-technology company but did not want to spend months going through endless rounds of interviewing and job searching. Resource Management found her a marketing position at Microsoft.
Though Ms. Glouner works 40 hours a week at Microsoft now, her employer is Resource Management. It collects from Microsoft, and in turn, pays her.
It took only a week from the time Ms. Glouner was first interviewed at Resource Management until she started work at Microsoft.
"The job market changes so fast that if you want to keep going on your career path you have to be flexible," Ms. Glouner said. "This way, you can stay employed without missing a beat on what's going on."
No figures are available yet on what percentage of the work force at high-technology companies is temporary, but Microsoft officials say they expect the trend to grow, reflecting the sprint pace of for-the-moment job demand.
Resource Management relies on word-of-mouth referrals to find recruits, people who usually have advanced degrees. The temps pay nothing to the service, which makes its money from companies looking for workers.
It is Ms. Lee's job to match workers with a company and to negotiate salary and terms of employment. Sometimes, it takes barely a day for a person to go from a fresh prospect to a job. Or it can take weeks. From a pool of about 6,000 prospects, 2,600 people found work from Resource Management last year.
Ms. Lee was a temporary worker herself when she came to Resource Management. She had been in sales and marketing with NCR, the computer company that at the time was owned by AT&T, and was thinking of going to school when she took a temporary job at the temp agency. She started as a recruiter.
"We don't use the term permanent employment anymore because we know that doesn't really exist," said Cynthia Cross, the president of Resource Management. She founded the company five years ago, joining forces with Elizabeth Parker, who was starting an executive temporary service.
At the time, the Seattle area was in a mild recession, primarily from jobs cuts at the Boeing Company, its largest employer. Many of those former Boeing workers had technical skill specific to making airplanes. All they needed, in general, was some tailoring to fit high-tech companies.
The company specializes in jobs that fall along the periphery of most high-tech jobs, positions that carry arcane names, popping up in seasonal fashion. "We call it tech light," Ms. Cross said.
There may be an enormous demand for such jobs one month, only to have them disappear entirely a few months later.
In the traditional hiring hall, a welder or longshoreman would go into a union center and be dispatched to a given job, confident that his skills could carry through any project. In the technical world, it is sometimes hard even to find a company and temporary worker who speak the same language.
"You live for that person who can go in and be an immediate producer, somebody who can accomplish something right away," Ms. Cross said.
Resource Management does not train people, but it recently added a computer room where prospective temps can brush up on the latest programs. On a recent day, the computer room was full, while in the soft-carpeted offices of Resource Management, a slow stream of people came to be sized up for jobs.
What high-technology temps need most is an understanding of basic computer language, which means learning something new almost every few months. But increasingly, Ms. Lee is looking for people who excel in an old-fashioned language.
"English majors," Ms. Lee said. "That's what we really need. Send me an English major."

This is the fourth article focusing on the new or transformed jobs that have grown up in the computer industry. The first, on Jan. 1, examined the people who answer customer queries on manufacturers' "help" lines. The second, on Feb. 12, covered the work of artists and programmer's designing sites on the Internet's World Wide Web. The third, which ran on March 11, looked at the industry's supersalesmen, who have made product demonstrations into something between circus shows and performance art.

A Transformation for Kennedy
After 20 years with almost no improvement, Kennedy International Airport is undergoing a profound transformation. In the next five years, $3 billion is to be spent to replace two aging terminals, rebuild airport roads and parking lots and build a rail line that will ease travel between Kennedy's terminals as well as connect the airport to Manhattan. In part, the plan is notable simply for its scale: $3 billion is triple what it cost to build the World Trade Center. But also remarkable is that the four projects are moving forward after years, or decades, of inaction. Why now? The money is available and the political will is there. [Page A1.]
 
Dispute Widens Over Renewal
City and state officials stepped up their acrimonious public war of words over a stalemate that threatens to destroy an ambitious urban renewal plan for Harlem and the South Bronx. And as the dispute escalated -- with officials from both sides questioning whether the other has the money to contribute and with officials publicly calling each other dishonest -- many in Harlem and the South Bronx who have been waiting for the funds for more than two years said they are prepared to go to court to force the city and state to end the squabble. [B1.]
 
Pataki's Move to the Middle
For much of last year, his first as Governor, George E. Pataki played the part one might expect from a candidate born of the New York Republican Party's resurgent conservative wing and the first Governor elected on the state Conservative Party line. How things can change in a year. For much of this spring, Mr. Pataki has been steering his administration on a moderate tack, doing and saying things that have confounded and angered his conservative allies even as they have surprised and delighted the consumer advocates, women's groups and environmentalists. Political memo. [B1.]
 
5 Injured in S.I. Melee
What started as a routine response by the police to a report of a stabbing quickly escalated to a disturbance that left eight people arrested, five people injured -- including four police officers -- and as many as 100 people marching on the 120th precinct on Staten Island. [B3.]
 
Rangel Stokes a Tempest
Amid citywide rallies to protest the planned layoffs of hundreds of workers at New York City public hospitals, another tempest surged to the fore: Representative Charles B. Rangel's steadfast use of the phrase "gang-raped" to describe what he believes the Giuliani administration and Republicans in general are doing to labor unions. [B3.]
 
14-Year-Old Is Fatally Shot
A 14-year-old boy was fatally shot outside an apartment building in the South Bronx, the police said. The youth was standing in a crowd of teen-agers when a fight erupted, the police said. Mr. Taylor was struck by gunshots, and the police said they did not believe the gunfire had come from within the crowd. [B3.]
 
Reveling in the Heat
In a few weeks, they will be grousing about days like this. But the oven blast of sizzling heat, the first real preview of summer for the New York region, was just fresh and exotic enough to have many New Yorkers rhapsodizing. "By the end of summer, I'll hate it," Nadeem Kayani, 19, acknowledged. But Mr. Kayani said that his memories of the unusually frosty and tenacious winter are still sharp, so he took the muggy clutch of weather as a welcome, if stultifying, sign of deliverance. "At this moment," he said, "it's pleasant." [B3.]
 
$60 Million in Art Donated
Thirteen works of 20th century art by masters like Picasso, Modigliani, Braque and Leger -- a collection experts believe to be worth $60 million to $80 million -- have been given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Klaus G. and Amelia Perls. The works are from the couple's private collection. The two have been Manhattan art dealers for more than 60 years. The Arts. [C11.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
School Scandal Brings Disbelief
Since school officials in Fairfield, Conn., disclosed that achievement tests at a nationally praised elementary school had been tampered with, former F.B.I. agents have been hired to find the culprit, parents have accused the superintendent of changing the answers herself and the school's pupils have been taunted by children from other neighborhoods. In a community that is passionate about its children and its schools, the feelings unleashed by the disclosure have ranged from the ferocious to the heartbreaking. Parents are in disbelief that any adult at their beloved Stratfield School would change answers on test sheets, and they are in anguish over their children innocently taking on the burden of blame for something they do not understand and did not do. [B1.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Fairway Dreams in Newark
The barren neighborhoods of the inner city usually prize the rough competition on basketball courts or baseball diamonds as the best ticket out. But every spring a small band of students in Newark's high schools develop fairway dreams. Most are rank beginners, playing golf with a hodgepodge of clubs and no small amount of confusion about the rules. The Newark high schools play in different suburban leagues. They find the game in turns frustrating and so exhilarating that they swear they don't want to play anything else. [B1.]
 
REGION
 
Commencements Are Held
Commencement exercises were held at a number of universities and colleges in the region, including Adelphi University, the Southampton College of Long Island University, St. John's University, Vassar College and at the State University of New York at Binghamton and at Purchase. [B5.]

HEADLINE: A Day for Many Diplomas, And for One Famous Frog

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., May 19

 BODY:
Adelphi University, which had a tumultuous year because of questions about the spending practices of its president, Peter Diamandopoulos, gave diplomas to 2,443 students yesterday, and the controversy over the president drew hardly a mention.
Dr. Diamandopoulos had planned to deliver an address, but with 80-degree temperatures roasting the audience during the outdoor ceremony, he decided to deliver it instead by mail -- a decision greeted with applause by students. 
 The university's trustees are facing an inquiry by the State Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco, who says they may have violated several state laws by financing "extraordinary personal spending."
Dr. Diamandopoulos, despite the university's growing financial problems, received $523,636 in salary and deferred bonuses and benefits in 1994, making him the second-highest paid university president in the United States.
The only speaker at the ceremony to refer to the controversy was Ernesta G. Procope, chairwoman of the board of trustees, who said, "On a personal note, I am especially proud of Adelphi's many accomplishments under the leadership of President Diamandopoulos, and with the support of an outstanding board."
Her comments produced a ripple of jeers from the otherwise festive crowd of graduates, families and friends who gathered here under a sunny and cloudless sky in a grassy field at the center of the campus.
In the text of his speech, Dr. Diamandopoulos avoided commenting directly on the controversy that has split the campus, describing Adelphi as "a strong, resilient university poised to move to its second century with a sharper philosophy."
Among those to receive honorary degrees were John Kapioltas, chairman of the board of the ITT Sheraton Corporation, and Conor Cruise O'Brien, the Irish author, who was the commencement speaker.

Southampton College
The world's most famous amphibian -- Kermit the Frog -- swam away from commencement exercises at the Southampton College of Long Island University yesterday with the first ever doctorate of amphibious letters, an honorary degree bestowed upon him for his contribution to raising environmental awareness, which is a major part of the college's curriculum.
Donning a custom-tailored cap and gown, the diminutive frog delivered the main address to the 245 undergraduate and graduate students -- most of whom supported his appearance by decorating their gowns with green stickers that read "Kermit '96" and adorning their caps with stuffed animals and Pez dispensers in Kermit's likeness.
The decision to confer the honorary doctorate, which attracted unprecedented media attention for such a small private college, was made by Robert F.X. Sillerman, the Chancellor of Southampton College, which is nationally recognized for its programs in marine and environmental sciences. "This school is known for its world-class programs in marine and environmental sciences," he said, "and when you think of the 'green print,' you think of Kermit the Frog."
While most of the students supported the choice, some were angry at having a puppet as their commencement speaker.
"I am officially unhappy," said Samantha Chie, a marine biology major. "I've been here laboring for five years and now we have a sock talking at our commencement. It's kind of upsetting."

St. John's University
He began his education at St. John's University in 1931, when Herbert Hoover was President. Yesterday, Salvatore DeGaetano finally received his Bachelor of Arts degree, some 65 years and 11 presidents later.
Mr. DeGaetano was among 600 students gathered at Alumni Hall at the university's campus in Jamaica, Queens, for the school's 121st commencement, an afternoon ceremony which stressed a return to idealism and pursuit of public service.
The audience at the indoor arena graduation was boisterous, showing an enthusiasm for the class of '96 usually reserved for the school's Red Storm basketball team.
Mary Ryan, a class of 1963 alumnus and assistant secretary for Consular Affairs at the Department of State, delivered the commencement address, contrasting the idealism of the early 60's with a cynicism toward government of the 1990's.
"I ask you what J.F.K. asked the youth of my day to do, to return something to the community which has protected and educated you," Ms. Ryan said.
She urged students to "reject the murderous din of materialism," adding, "There is more to life than the amount of money on your W-2 at the end of the year."
School officials pointed to the 14 graduating members of the President's Society as the students who best exemplified that spirit of public service. Donna Jo Koubek, a criminal justice major who will attend law school in the fall, described the society as the "highest honor" a St. John's student could achieve.
As for the 83-year-old Mr. DeGaetano, he plans to return to St. John's this fall to begin pursuing a master's in history.

Vassar College
Vassar College began its 132d commencement yesterday with a procession of 563 graduates accompanied by other students, who carried two 75-foot-long chains of daisies and laurel.
By tradition, Vassar does not award honorary degrees to distinguished elders. Instead, the three-hour ceremony, which was held on the college's Poughkeepsie, N.Y., campus, focused on the young and those who work with them.
The main speaker of the day was a 68-year-old. But he was Maurice Sendak, an illustrator and author who is well known for his children's books including "Where the Wild Things Are" and "In the Night Kitchen." Mr. Sendak, who said that he had never graduated from college or high school, used a metaphor borrowed from Herman Melville and urged the class of 1996 to be a "generation of deep-sea divers," who accomplish things and tell the truth.
After the opening procession, in which members of the class of 1998 carried the flower chains, Claire V. Johnston, a graduating senior from Berkeley, Calif., presented Vassar with a $4,618.06 gift from the class of 1996. It is to be used for the restoration of a campus fountain and for scholarships, career development and athletics.
In addition to Mr. Sendak, the other speakers included Vassar's president, Frances Daly Fergusson, and Michael D. Keenan, the senior class president.
Mr. Keenan remembered the first moment he saw Vassar. "It's so beautiful here," he said, "that I thought I hope I don't break anything. You have to understand, I come from Queens."

State University at Binghamton
The State University of New York at Binghamton, a campus navigating its way through new financial cuts at a time when the entire southern tier is already economically depressed, put its hopes for prosperity yesterday in 3,153 graduates, including a half-dozen women who put letters on their caps to spell "Will Work for Food."
The university president, Lois B. De Fleur, opened the commencement ceremony by acknowledging alumni from the school's first year, 1946. "We had 600 students who attended classes in unheated Quonset huts and carried their chairs from class to class," she said. "While our budget hasn't gotten that bad," she said, "we have faith it won't."
The keynote speaker, Clifton Wharton Jr., the Chancellor of the State University of New York from 1978 to 1987, told students he abandoned his "The Future is Yours" speech for one that criticized the belief that corporate-downsizing and cost-cutting techniques can be applied to public education.
"How about achieving the maximum efficiency for faculty by putting all students in a football field and having one faculty member talk through a loudspeaker at the 50-yard line?" he said.
Despite the serious messages, students remained playful. As Paula Kramer, president of the alumni association, lectured on the transition that graduates were about to make into the real world, the students tossed three beach balls around.

State University at Purchase
The State University of New York at Purchase has a tradition of inviting well-known people from the arts to speak at graduation: William Styron, the novelist, and Cynthia Gregory, the ballet dancer, are among those who have given addresses in the past. But this year's commencement featured someone who is an investment manager by profession: Richard Maass, whose speech received hearty applause.
Mr. Maass, 77, an art and rare manuscript collector, human-rights activist, college benefactor and president of the Purchase College Council, was applauded even before he began to speak, when the school's president, Bill Lacy, told the crowd that the original manuscript of a speech written by Abraham Lincoln that recently sold at Christie's for $497,500 had been donated to the school by Mr. Maass. The college, which sent it to the auction house, will receive the money.
The roars of approval escalated as Mr. Maass spoke. He said that the word patriotism had been "demeaned" by Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and by "disaffected bullies, skinheads, Klansmen, Nazis and trigger-happy men and women who act in loose coalitions known as militias." He further said that the religious right has "perverted honestly held religious beliefs into the coin of hucksterism."
Jonathan Bernstein, who received a bachelor of arts degree in history, agreed. "People don't usually pay attention to these things but, Wow, everyone listened to this speech," he said.
Mr. Bernstein added an original touch to his cap and gown: a model airplane, circa World War II, perched on his mortarboard. . "I hope to go into aviation museum studies and aircraft restoration, not politics per se, but I'll always remember this man's words," he said.

HEADLINE: Worst Drought Since 30's Grips Plains

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HARDESTY, Okla., May 16

 BODY:
Since last October, an average of 2.32 inches of rain has fallen on the wheat fields and cattle ranches that dominate the landscape here in the Oklahoma Panhandle -- the second driest such period since the Oklahoma Climatological Survey started keeping records 101 years ago.
For 71-year-old Lewis Mayer, that means that his winter wheat crop, which normally would be waist-high and turning from green to gold with the approach of next month's harvest, is about to be plowed under and declared a total loss. 
 "There's just no rain at all, it's hotter than blazes, all the grass has thinned out," said Mr. Mayer, crumbling some soil into dust and pointing to wheat stalks that looked like ankle-high weeds at best. "I was a 10-year-old boy in 1935, and as near as I can remember it just looks similar. Very similar."
From Kansas south to Texas, one of the worst droughts on record has pushed thousands of farmers on the Great Plains to the edge of financial ruin and spurred panic selling of cattle in some areas.
Coming after two years of low rainfall and a number of other weather problems, the ferocity of this year's drought has slowly begun to evoke memories for some here of the Depression-era Dust Bowl.
The Oklahoma Agriculture Commissioner, Dennis Howard, predicted last week that 5,000 to 10,000 of the state's 70,000 farming families would go bankrupt this year because of the drought and record low cattle prices brought on by mass liquidation of some ranchers' herds. Mr. Howard said half the farm families in the state were in "critical financial shape," meaning they were in danger of failing to make mortgage or lease payments due this summer.
In Texas, where the $6 billion cattle industry is the largest of any state, 130 counties have applied for emergency Federal subsidies for ranchers to buy feed, after certifying that at least 40 percent of all pasture land is too arid for grazing. That is the highest number of applications ever in the state, according to the Federal Department of Agriculture.
The starkest image of the Dust Bowl -- huge clouds of fine soil blowing across the land, turning day into dusk and rendering crops suddenly worthless -- is unlikely to come to pass. That is because of government-mandated conservation measures that started at the end of the New Deal, including year-round, drought-resistant grasses that hold at least some soil in place, and tree barriers that reduce the force of the wind.
But in other ways the drought conditions are at least as bad. There is simply no rain to speak of, and the heat is withering. In parts of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, temperatures reached 105 degrees this week, the earliest that such temperatures have ever been recorded.
Many families, deep in debt for everything from farm equipment to the large tracts of land necessary for modern farming, are clearly struggling.
"There's no such thing as getting by on the milk check and what the hens can lay you," said 81-year-old Denzil Wilmoth of Beaver, Okla., who managed to make it through earlier droughts in much that way. "That's ancient history."
In Hardesty, where a granite highway marker at the edge of town proclaims the small community as the onetime "mecca of early cowboys in no man's land," Jerod Richards, 19, described conditions for his three-generation farm family this way: "It just seems like Mother Nature's against you."
Mr. Richards, his parents and his grandparents spent much of the last two weeks plowing under all 1,100 acres of wheat they had planted last fall, making the crop a total loss. If there is any prospect of rain coming, he said, the family may try to plant milo, a quick-growing crop primarily used as feed.
Some farmers have given up altogether. "It was a losing deal; I just sold off everything," said Tim Schroeder, 37, who recently let all of his dairy cows go for auction and says he does not know how he will make upcoming payments on his house and property.
"The prices on everything went up -- I couldn't afford to keep the cows fed," said Mr. Schroeder over pancakes and coffee at the Outpost Cafe here. He had just got off the midnight shift at his new job, working in a huge hog-processing plant in nearby Guymon.
A casual visitor to Hardesty might think the town was enjoying a spectacularly beautiful spring -- the other day the sky here was a sparkling blue, and the dry heat gave an almost Mediterranean cast to the air. While most of the farm land relies on rain, and thus is a parched brown, there are pockets of green where families can afford irrigation.
But nobody who lives around here finds much splendor in this particular spring.
"It's not beautiful when there's no wheat growing," said Wanda Flaherty, a waitress at the Outpost.
For the consumer, the drought has spurred a short-term boon, as a wave of selling has led to very low beef prices at the supermarket.
In some parts of Oklahoma and Texas the auctions have reached panic level: in Hallettsville, Tex., last month, ranchers inundated the weekly auction with cattle and the sale lasted from 10:30 one morning to 4:30 the next, with bidding per head typically lasting just 12 seconds or so.
But in the long run, the sell-off promises price increases for beef. Eighty percent of the cows being slaughtered in South Texas now are pregnant, according to the Coastal Plains Production Credit Association, meaning that next year's herd will be dramatically thinned.
The economics are as simple as they are devastating: the cost of feeding, watering, tagging and caring for a cow or a steer is more than what the animal can bring at market.
"There isn't a cow in South Texas that will bring enough money to buy a ton of feed," said Johnny Williams, the owner of Alice Feed Supply in Alice, Tex.
The widespread plowing under of wheat in Oklahoma and several neighboring states, even if offset somewhat by normal wheat production in other parts of the country, will probably spur small but noticeable increases in the price of bread, pasta and other products by this fall.
In parts of Oklahoma, the heart of wheat country, many farms that normally yield 55 bushels an acre are instead yielding 1 or 2, which does not make it economical to harvest.
Factoring in irrigated fields and other parts of the state that have had some rainfall, the Oklahoma Wheat Commission's most optimistic prediction is a total yield of 70 million to 80 million bushels, less than half the state's normal total.
The drought has, of course, had a much wider effect than its impact on farmers and ranchers. Cities across Texas have reported sharply lower rainfall -- San Antonio had 3.7 inches of rain from October through April, compared to a normal rate of 15.8 inches. The drought has forced several communities served by the Edwards Aquifer, the natural underground reservoir that provides water for 1.5 million people in central Texas, to impose watering restrictions of varying severity.
In the West Texas communities of San Angelo and Childress, mayors have signed official proclamations asking residents to pray for rain.
In Stratford, Tex., a highway sign proclaiming the city to be "Home of God, Grass and Grit" seems like a cruel joke in part: many of the lawns and farms there are scorched and brown.
And the drought has contributed to the recent wildfires in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.
One or two heavy rainfalls will not help much -- even if they do occur, which is not expected anytime soon. And while the drought so far has struck most heavily at wheat and cattle, it will affect other crops, including cotton and corn, if it continues.
"Clearly, what's happened is the establishment of a ridge, a pattern over much of the south-central United States," said Jay Grymes, operations manager of the Southern Regional Climate Center, a federally financed research service in Baton Rouge, La. "It is significantly inhibiting rainfall activity, even in conditions where we have all the ingredients for rain events. It is just not creating the kinds of rains that many of these places are needing."
For people here in the Oklahoma Panhandle, the weather has led to a certain kind of gallows humor. Two farmers passing each other in their pickup trucks on a dusty road in Guymon the other day stopped to exchange pleasantries. "Sure is a wet one today," one said. All around them, as far as the eye could see, it was as dry as a bone.
And Wesley James, a farmer and rancher in Hardesty, said: "If the weather doesn't change any time soon, we could be up the creek without a paddle. Of course, there'd be no water, either."
But no matter what happens, many farmers here say they do not plan to join any kind of "Grapes of Wrath" exodus.
"Oh, I'm here to stay," said Mr. Mayer, whose family has been in the area since 1883. "I'll be here when this one's over. I may be broke, but I'll still be here."

HEADLINE: Fight Widens On Aid Zone For New York

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A top Federal housing official called on New York State yesterday to back down in an increasingly bitter feud with New York City officials that he said could kill a $300 million plan to revitalize Harlem and parts of the South Bronx.
The official, Andrew M. Cuomo, an assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said that state officials were making an "unreasonable request" in asking the city to agree to rules that would essentially give the state the final word in disputes over how the money -- $100 million each from the Federal, state and city governments -- would be spent. 
 "After all we've been through," Mr. Cuomo said, "the state should know that the city is not willing to cede control in this way," And he added, speaking of state officials, "One must question if they are genuine in their desire to consummate the transactions."
But state officials countered that the agreement cementing the deals of the plan -- which Mr. Cuomo and state and city officials signed -- requires the state to retain ultimate control. They accused the Federal Government of trying needlessly to stall the plan: a so-called Empowerment Zone that would spur development in the economically depressed neighborhoods.
"I can't believe Andrew Cuomo didn't read the document that he signed with great fanfare back in January," said Caroline Quartararo of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's development agency. "But it is typical of Cuomo and the Clinton Administration to promise, promise, promise, and then find excuses not to deliver jobs and opportunity to those who need it most."
The admonition from Mr. Cuomo, who has threatened to take away the Federal Government's $100 million contribution unless the officials settle the dispute, came on a day when the two sides seemed to move even further apart, with city and state officials aggressively arguing their cases and accusing each other of acting in bad faith.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his top financial adviser accused state officials of using the dispute, which centers on a seemingly minor set of rules used to govern the program's board of directors, to hold up the money. They suggested that this was because state officials had little real intention of ever contributing their one-third share.
While state officials have used words like "willing, maybe, promise, set aside," Mr. Giuliani said, he questioned their actual commitment to providing money for the poor neighborhoods. "So far, I should tell you, New York City is the only government group to put any money into the Empowerment Zone," he said. "The state promised, took it away, promised again, took it away and has promised it again. It hasn't come up with any money yet."
For their part, state officials, including the official in charge of state economic development, Charles A. Gargano, said that the city's adamant insistence on the rule changes and their questions about the state's motives were a smokescreen. The real reason for the delay, they charged, is that the city wants to push the program's starting date past the current fiscal year so that it will not have to carry its contribution on this year's already tight municipal budget.
As the dispute escalated, many residents of Harlem and the South Bronx, who have been waiting for the funds for more than two years, said they were prepared to go to court to force the city and state to end the squabble.
The Empowerment Zone is one of six around the country in which the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development agreed to provide $100 million to impoverished urban neighborhoods for grants and loans to businesses, to create job training programs and to lure companies into those neighborhoods.
But while the city and the state agreed to match the Federal contribution equally and signed the agreement in January on the broad outlines of how the money would be used, long-simmering tensions between Mr. Gargano and the city's top financial adviser, Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, surfaced just as the program was to begin.
Ms. Reiter -- who will be the first chairwoman of the board that runs the program under a system in which state and city chairmanship will alternate -- said the bylaws would make it easy for state officials to oust Mr. Giuliani's appointees if there were a dispute between the two sides over which projects should get money. Until Mr. Gargano agrees to change those rules, she said, she will not call a meeting of the board, a requirement before the first dollar can be spent.
"He wants to intimidate the city into moving this thing forward, and we will not be intimidated," Ms. Reiter said.
State officials said yesterday that they had conceded on several other issues in which the city sought more control, but were refusing to give in on changing the rules because the state is required by law to have ultimate control of city-and-state partnerships like this one, which is a legal subsidiary of a state agency.
"They are asking for something that is impossible to give them," said Randy Daniels, a senior vice president of the Empire State Development Corporation, which promotes the state's economic development plans. "To give the city this power to control a state subsidiary is subject to legal challenge."
But Ms. Reiter said yesterday that to go ahead with the program in its present form would be to sign over $100 million of the city's money to the state with no way to control it, an action unacceptable to the Giuliani administration at a time of sharp disagreements between the city and state over budget issues.
"They want to control every project in the zone, and they'll hold everybody hostage to the projects they want to do," Ms. Reiter said. "The city cannot agree to let that happen."
She said she was prepared to hold up the program indefinitely unless the state found a way to grant the city an equal measure of control.
The details of the battle center on rules spelling out how directors of the zone's board can be removed for cause. Under the state's plan, a director could be ousted by a simple majority vote. Because the state is the majority shareholder in the program, however, the votes of Governor George E. Pataki's appointees would have more weight. The city wants a requirement of a two-thirds majority vote to dismiss a board member, which would mean that an ouster could be accomplished only with the agreement of the city and the state's representatives.
Mr. Gargano argued yesterday that all of the state's economic development subsidiaries were set up so that the state had the final word.
Mr. Daniels, who helped negotiate the agreement on the project between the city and the state, claims that the dispute is just one of a number of instances recently in which the city has tried to sway the balance of power to its side in financial partnerships between the city and state, a charge the city denies.
Mr. Cuomo said yesterday that he would call for a meeting this week between city and state officials, and he held out hope that Mr. Gargano could be persuaded to change his mind.
"I don't believe that the State of New York will renege on its commitment to the Federal Government," he said. "There are ways to get around all of this if they really want to get around it."
City officials said yesterday that the current dispute had its roots in the state's refusal to move forward on the Hudson River Park Conservancy, the agency seeking to create a park system along 4.5 miles of Manhattan's Hudson River shoreline. The plan was conceived during Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's administration and since the Pataki administration took over, it has been stalled because of disputes between Mr. Gargano and Ms. Reiter over its makeup.
"We can't get a board appointed," Ms. Reiter said. "We can't even call a meeting there because they have control."
She added that like the conservancy, the empowerment zone was negotiated under the Cuomo administration and that at that time, state and city officials agreed that they would share power equally in dispensing money.
But after the Giuliani administration and state officials signed a memorandum of understanding cementing the details of the deal -- an agreement reached only after more than a year of tense negotiation -- the state presented the city with bylaws that greatly strengthened the state's position on the board.
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, which is planning a job training and counseling center that would be part of the empowerment zone, joined Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat of Harlem, yesterday in saying that they were both willing to take the city and the state to court to try to force them to end the standoff and produce the much-needed money.
"While they argue over petty issues, people who need better education, better housing and better employment opportunities are left out in the cold," Mr. Butts said.

HEADLINE: Taiwan President Says He Would Go to Beijing for Talks

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Monday, May 20

 BODY:
To the cheers of some 50,000 flag-waving guests, Taiwan's first democratically elected President, Lee Teng-hui, declared in his inaugural address today that he was willing to travel to Beijing to talk with China's leaders.
"In the future, at the call of my country and with the support of my people, I would like to embark upon a journey of peace to mainland China, taking with me the consensus and will of 21.3 million people," said Mr. Lee, an American-educated agricultural economist. 
 "I am also ready to meet with the top leadership of the Chinese Communists for a direct exchange of views in order to open up a new era of communication and cooperation," he promised. But, he warned, "we will never negotiate under threat of attack."
Regarded as a rebel province by Beijing, Taiwan has moved dramatically away from dictatorship and political repression toward the first fully democratic Chinese-speaking nation in five millenniums of Chinese history.
Taiwan has blossomed into one of Asia's economic dynamos and one of the world's dominant trading nations. It is a country with one of the largest foreign cash reserves, a leader in investment throughout Asia and one of the world's most technologically advanced societies.
For several years, Mr. Lee has traveled abroad, mainly throughout Asia, pushing Taiwan's case for international recognition to regional leaders. Those travels have irritated Beijing considerably, and his visit to the United States last June enraged China. It denounced Mr. Lee, saying he was trying to assert Taiwan's independence, something Mr. Lee has repeatedly denied.
In March, against a barrage of threats from Beijing and a round of intimidating war games and missile tests, Taiwan's voters in a landslide chose the 73-year-old Mr. Lee as their first directly elected President.
With that vote, Taiwan shed the last vestiges of the authoritarianism that traced its roots to the government that Chiang Kai-shek established here after fleeing Mao Zedong's victorious Communist armies in 1949. Previously, presidents were chosen by the Legislature.
As jets trailing streams of smoke pirouetted in the sun-splashed sky and the national symphony orchestra played, Mr. Lee and his Vice President, Lien Chan, arrived in the huge Taoyuan stadium. Earlier this morning, Mr. Lee and Mr. Lien, standing before a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the first President of the Republic of China, took the oath of office in a short ceremony in the presidential palace.
In his inaugural address, Mr. Lee etched in unmistakable terms the chasm that exists between Taiwan and China, a chasm that has widened even further with Taiwan's embrace of democracy and one that owes as much to Western ideas and values as it does to different notions of a Chinese ethos.
And in a challenge to Beijing's claim to speak for all that is Chinese, Mr. Lee declared that Taiwan, and not China, would chart the course for Chinese-speaking people in Asia.
"Taiwan has been able in recent decades to preserve traditional culture on the one hand and to come into wide contact with Western democracy and science and modern business culture on the other," he said. "Equipped with a much higher level of education and development than in other parts of China, Taiwan is set gradually to exercise its leadership role in cultural development and take upon itself the responsibility for nurturing a new Chinese culture."
And although both Hong Kong, in 1997, and the Portuguese colony of Macao, in 1999, will revert to Chinese sovereignty, Mr. Lee's speech insisted that Taiwan retained a legitimate interest in the fate of the two territories. Despite Beijing's adamant stance that it alone is the rightful ruler of those territories, Mr. Lee said, in terms that are certain to provoke Beijing's wrath, that "the welfare of the Chinese in Hong Kong and Macao has always been of great concern to us."
"We are ready to lend them a helping hand to maintain democracy, freedom and prosperity in this area," he said.
As momentous as Mr. Lee's ascent to the presidency via the ballot box is regarded here, his inauguration took place largely in an international vacuum. Only a scattering of small, developing countries, mainly from Africa and Latin America, formally recognize the Taiwan Government. No Western or Eastern democracy sent official representatives here.
Still, Taiwan was determined that its legitimacy, and that of its democracy, should be on parade. The Government-controlled television showed videotape of American senators and representatives congratulating Mr. Lee. They were led by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, who said he expected to welcome Mr. Lee to Washington during his presidency. No letter from President Clinton was mentioned in Taiwanese news reports.
A television camera lingered over letters to Mr. Lee from members of Congress, and long shots of the unofficial American delegation, led by Vernon Jordan, were broadcast on the evening news. Throughout the day Sunday, heads of state from several small countries were received by Mr. Lee, who fastidiously reviewed honor guards with each.
In recent weeks, China has been relatively subdued in its statements about Taiwan, evidently waiting to see what Mr. Lee would say in his inaugural address. Again and again, Beijing has said it would use military force to prevent any moves by Taiwan toward independence. And while Mr. Lee uttered the token concession that he would not push for independence, he did so in words that were uncompromising about Taiwan's separate identity.
"The Republic of China has always been a sovereign state," he said. "Disputes across the Straits center around system and life style; they have nothing to do with ethnic or cultural identity.
"The Chinese who were regarded as dictatorial, feudalistic, penurious and backward by Western countries one century ago have by now created in the Taiwan area a new land of democracy, wealth and progress. We believe that whatever is achieved by the Chinese in Taiwan can also be achieved by the Chinese in mainland China."
Despite his assertions about Taiwan's Chineseness, in the last decade there has been a resurgence of ethnic pride among the island's native Taiwanese. Mainland-born Chinese now make up only about 10 percent of the island's population, and the gap with the mainland -- politically, economically and culturally -- has steadily widened.
Indeed, Mr. Lee's political success is in no small measure due to his own Taiwanese ethnicity. Appointed to the Cabinet in 1972 by Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, because of his heritage, Mr. Lee climbed steadily through the political maze of the governing Kuomintang Party, forming alliances and spreading his influence. He became President when Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988. His election to the post by the party-dominated Legislature in 1990, when Mr. Chiang's term expired, marked the transition to local rule from the leadership of the Chinese who fled to Taiwan in 1949.
Today, in his address, Mr. Lee uttered formulaic blandishments toward Beijing, but his determination to preserve Taiwan's way of life echoed clearly. "We now stand on the apex of democratic reform," he said, "and will remain there resolutely. We have proved eloquently that the Chinese are capable of practicing democracy."

HEADLINE: For Journalism Graduates, Opportunities in New Media

BYLINE: By GIANNA JACOBSON 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Mo.

 BODY:
When Addie Butt enrolled in the journalism school at the University of Missouri here two years ago, her goal was to become a newspaper sportswriter. But one of the school's newest courses -- new media, an intensive study of on-line publications -- changed her plans.
Within days of graduation, Ms. Butt will report for a $500-a-week job at Fastball, an on-line publication about major league baseball owned by Cox Communications in Atlanta, a unit of Cox Enterprises. 
 "I developed an interest in on-line journalism and went with it," said Ms. Butt, a 20-year-old from Pasadena, Calif. "That's where the majority of jobs are."
And that is where many of this year's journalism graduates are heading. Electronic reporting, especially on the Internet, is creating a boom in the job market for journalism graduates around the country.
"On-line publications are generating more jobs at higher salaries than we have seen in a long time," said Michael Hoeferlin, placement director at Missouri's journalism school.
For print and broadcast reporters, the job market around the country also seems strong this year, journalism faculty members and career advisers say, especially for students with computer skills. Newspapers in the Midwest are hiring copy editors and designers, while demand for reporters is greatest in the South and Southeast, the advisers say.
At Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, "things are pretty healthy in the entry-level job market for journalism, thanks to on-line publications and the network news magazines," said Melanie Hough, the placement director. "Graduates who want to stay in big cities are finding jobs on line and in broadcast. Those who want traditional reporting jobs have to be more open to the whole country, but the jobs are there."
More than 36,000 students will receive bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from 430 colleges and universities this month, according to Lee Becker, an Ohio State University professor. Professor Becker surveys journalism graduates annually for the Dow Jones Newspaper Fund, a foundation that supports programs to train student journalists. Three-quarters of the graduates will seek jobs in print, radio, television and Internet journalism, he said, while the rest will look for work in advertising, public relations or other fields, or continue their schooling.
In 1994, the last year for which information from the Newspaper Fund survey is available, the median salary for journalism graduates was $20,000. Those working at daily newspapers and in public relations fared best, with salaries averaging around $21,000. Journalism school graduates working at weekly newspapers or in broadcasting earned about $15,000, those in advertising an average of $20,000.
At on-line publications, entry-level salaries approach $30,000 a year.
"It used to be that recruiters asked students for their clips, but now they ask to see Web pages," said Ann Brill, a teacher of the new-media course at Missouri. "There is a window of opportunity for new people coming into the news business to get hired in on-line ventures. The people already in the news organizations don't have the skills or inclination for these jobs."
At the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, students can get course credit for working on Times Link, an electronic version of The Los Angeles Times. "The on-line experience seems to be crucial in getting jobs," said Ester Ramirez, director of career advisement at the journalism school there. "It is not the traditional job market. The on-line opportunities have created a new area."
In the Midwest, Mr. Hoeferlin at Missouri and John Kupetz, placement director at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., report a surge in jobs for copy editors and page designers at medium-sized newspapers.
Last year, 5 percent of Northwestern's journalism graduates took jobs with on-line publications or services, and Mr. Kupetz said he expected that number to be "somewhat higher" this year.
While Ms. Butt sought a job with an on-line publication, other Missouri graduates said that their paths to the Internet were less focused.
"Everyone starts out wanting a reporting job in the major leagues, but you end up having to redefine what is a journalism career," said Beth Hardison, a 21-year-old senior from Bloomington, Minn. Ms. Hardison will spend her summer at a postgraduate internship at Advanstar Communications, a trade-publication company in Cleveland, before starting a full-time job at Arizona Outdoorsman, a new on-line publication in Phoenix. The job will pay $20,000 a year.
"It's a job that meets all the requirements of what I wanted," Ms. Hardison said. "Whatever it is, I can build from there."
If the on-line "zines" and broadcasters are keeping journalism graduates in the cities, small- and medium-size newspapers are luring graduates to reporting jobs in the South and Southeast.
In January, as Judd Slivka began his final semester at Missouri, he sent out 50 letters and resumes before he landed a $400-a-week reporting job at The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, in Little Rock.
"I had the job I wanted by the end of February, and that was a very good feeling," said Mr. Slivka, 21, of Livingston, N.J.
Jessica Thompson never wanted a newspaper job when she enrolled at Missouri. Her internship at Advanstar helped draw a $22,500-a-year job writing newsletters and brochures for the American Association of Orthodontists in St. Louis.
"I put my job search on the back burner for a while, then I just got lucky," said Ms. Thompson, who is from Milton, Wis. "I can do computer-assisted reporting and desktop publishing, and the fact that I knew my way around a computer was definitely part of getting hired."
Matt Hebberd is one graduate who has not yet found a spot, after passing up an internship to attend summer school each year so he could earn two degrees, in journalism and European history, in four years.
One newspaper editor in the South has told Mr. Hebberd that he may be hired when a job opens up. Until then, Mr. Hebberd plans to return to his hometown of Guilford, Conn., where he will work as a public relations intern.
"I'm trying to sell myself on good reporting and writing skills," he said. "If that makes me less likable, it's probably not the right job."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 10, 1996, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on May 20 about the job prospects of recent college graduates with journalism degrees misattributed an estimate of where the graduates are seeking work. The statement that three-quarters of journalism graduates will seek jobs in print, radio, television and Internet journalism was based on interviews with educators, placement directors and professionals around the country. It was not a finding of a survey of graduates by Professor Lee Becker of Ohio State University.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Last Laugh

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
It is Election Day. Millions of Americans who would not have voted for Robert Dole are so moved by his decision to quit the Senate that they decide he is their man after all -- enough to make him the President of the United States.
The list of insults to the American voter's intelligence is so large that it is hard for us to notice each new one. But the idea shouted around Washington by so many Republican writers, politicians and analysts that Mr. Dole's decision was so stirring that by itself it can have a critical impact on the election leaps over mere insult to assumption of idiocy. 
 The decision was not the Dole crossroads that can influence Americans through Election Day. It was a common-sensical move, in acceptable self-interest. It gave Mr. Dole more time to campaign. Time for campaigning, and for change, if he chooses to use it. It distanced him from the various gridlocks and dead ends created for the G.O.P. majorities by a shrewd President Clinton and their own ideological blinders.
The true crossroads lies ahead. Will Mr. Dole decide to continue to sweat -- and lose votes -- in the political straitjacket of the Republican ideologues? Or will he take the advice of Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York to break free and present himself as decidedly conservative but decidedly wise enough to see that the American people are not given to electing ideologues?
Maybe he needs encouragement from fancier-type Republicans than Mr. D'Amato. If Republicans like Bill Weld of Massachusetts, say, the kind so admired by liberal G.O.P. money-raisers, gave Mr. Dole the same advice, they would be loaded down with receptions. But, as a particularly wise commentator wrote recently, Senator D'Amato could pull some people out of burning buildings and they would still sneer at him.
After their victory in 1994, Republicans made the classic mistake of believing that it meant what they wanted it to mean -- a wide social and economic revolution. All of a sudden, the first American Revolution wasn't good enough for them. The problem that Mr. Dole inherited was they shot off their revolutionary mouths after the election without finding out whether the American people wanted any such thing.
Republican rhetoric was a lot less threatening to many people before the election than after. Now, conservative revolutionaries facing another election say they did not really mean to give the impression they were threatening old people, poor people, minority people, school-lunching people, people who wanted a cleaner environment, those kinds of people.
"People wanted change," said Mr. D'Amato to a Republican meeting. "But they did not want a so-called counterrevolution that threatened our very foundations. That threatened seniors, that would appear to say we're in favor of dirty water. Are we in favor of dirty water here?"
The soldiers of the revolution say that their Republican critics, and Democrats, are not being honorable Boy Scouts to say such things.
Maybe; to our eyes spring tears, at the unfairness. But the "revolutionaries" made plain that they thought the real enemy was government, somehow missing the point that Americans are against government only when it annoys them and absolutely adore government when it profits them, which is most of the time.
Like Mr. D'Amato I think Mr. Dole is sophisticated enough to grasp the point and hope he will acknowledge it in his rhetoric and proposals. If he does, G.O.P. ideologues will regard that as treason to Mother Revolution.
Mr. Dole will have to pay one price for leaving the Senate. From now on the country will be entitled to consider all his decisions as his alone -- no laying off any on Congressional collegiality. That goes particularly for what he does about denouncing Patrick Buchanan, for "bashing women and belittling them and African-Americans and Jews and gays," as Mr. D'Amato puts it in his frightfully indelicate manner.
So the real crossroads approaches. If Mr. Dole goes down the ideological road, down is where he will go on Election Day. But if he breaks out and becomes entirely his own Republican, next January he might be singing that song played with such joyous triumph at Bill Clinton's inaugural dinners: "Who's Got the Last Laugh Now?"

HEADLINE: Japan's U.S. Trade Surplus Plunged 56% Last Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 20

 BODY:
Japan's merchandise trade surplus with the United States recorded its steepest drop in 17 years in April, mainly because of rising technology imports from Intel, I.B.M. and other producers.
The politically volatile surplus also shrank because American- bound exports from Japan slowed sharply, as companies like Toyota and Sony continued to shift production abroad, including to plants in the United States. 
 The trade surplus decreased 56 percent from that in April 1995, to 172.09 billion yen, or about $1.6 billion, the 14th straight decline, the Japanese Finance Ministry said today. Japan's global surplus contracted at an even faster pace, by 65.5 percent, to about $3 billion.
"It's very surprising, given the strong growth in the U.S. and Asia," said Ronald Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch here. "It suggests that there has been a structural shift to production bases offshore."
Thus, while Japanese brand-name products are still reaching foreign markets, they are increasingly being made in Malaysia, China or the United States.
For many of Japan's exporters, whose overseas earnings have been adversely affected by a strong yen, producing at home is not profitable.
Toshiba, for instance, no longer exports any television sets, video decks or personal computers from Japan. All models sold overseas are made overseas. Sony, which already makes 47 percent of its products overseas, plans to increase that to 50 percent over the next three years.
The rapid decline in the Japanese trade surplus with the United States is expected to bring it well below last year's level. For the first four months of 1996, it is down 37 percent from the comparable period in 1995.
Trade experts say that most of the reason the surplus has been reduced lies in the strength of the yen. Recent leveling against the dollar notwithstanding, the Japanese currency has appreciated about 60 percent against the dollar since 1985. One result of that appreciation is that Japan's overseas production probably rose to 10 percent last year, up from 8.6 percent in 1994, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
The trade report also showed significant declines in Japan's surpluses with Asia and Europe. The surplus with European Union nations contracted 52 percent, while the surplus with Asia fell 33 percent.
American manufacturers have cashed in. Technology companies, led by Apple Computer and IBM Japan, sold 22 percent more personal computers last year than in 1994, according to IDC Japan, a market research firm.

Drop in Japan's Trade Surplus Helps Dollar Against the Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen yesterday, bolstered by news of a surprisingly large decline in Japan's trade surplus in April.
The politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States plunged by more than half to $1.60 billion in April from $3.62 billion a year earlier. It was the largest percentage drop since 1979. The surplus narrowed as the volume of imports to Japan surged 30.9 percent while exports grew 5.1 percent. 
 "Japan has had a big surplus for a long time and the fact that it's getting smaller is good for the dollar relative to the yen," said Robert McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank Ltd. in New York.
During the session, the dollar climbed as high as 107.40 yen, but a bout of profit taking pushed it down from its peak.
It settled in New York late yesterday at 107.08 yen, up from 106.77 yen on Friday. The dollar traded at 1.5343 marks, up from 1.5333. The British pound slipped to $1.5135 from $1.5150.
Gains were also limited by a reluctance to push up the dollar in advance of a meeting today of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee.
Foreign-exchange traders are also waiting to see a report showing how much Germany's money supply increased in April. The report, which could be released as early as today, is closely watched because it can influence the direction of German key interest rates.
"People are really apt to sit on their hands today until they see" the German money-supply data and the results of the Federal Reserve meeting, said Charles Fago, a trader at Gulf International Bank BSC.
With the dollar trading in a fairly narrow range against the mark and the yen yesterday, dealers switched their focus to currencies including the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars as prices fell for other commodities closely associated with these countries. For example, some copper prices plunged to the lowest point since April 1994.
Some investors sold these commodity-based currencies fearing that the currencies could be hurt because their countries' exports would be worth less, said Brian Garvey, a currency strategist at IDEA Inc.
The Canadian dollar fell to 72.88 United States cents yesterday from 73.05 cents, and the Australian dollar fell to 79.71 United States cents from 80.60 cents.

HEADLINE: G.M. Wants China's Trade To Be Favored Permanently

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 20

 BODY:
The chairman of the General Motors Corporation declared today that the best growth opportunities for the American automobile industry lay in Asia, and he called for the United States to extend full trading privileges to China permanently.
The strongly worded remarks by John F. Smith Jr., who is also G.M.'s chief executive and president, were a sign of how strongly many American business executives feel about the need for access to the Chinese market. Executives in manufacturing industries, in particular, have led the lobbying for China's most-favored-nation trading status with the United States. 
 While Mr. Smith welcomed President Clinton's one-year renewal today of that preferred trade status, he contended that the long-term stability of American investments in China depended on ending the annual debate over trade relations and making China's current status permanent.
"Most-favored-nation status is the basis for a stable, credible economic policy toward China," said Mr. Smith, who as G.M.'s top executive heads the United States' largest company.
But the odds of his getting his wish appear slim. Human rights advocates and hard-liners worried about Chinese weapons exports have insisted that the annual reviews are necessary to put pressure on China to change its ways. Clinton Administration officials refuse even to publicly discuss the possibility of a permanent renewal.
Mr. Smith contended that American companies would have more influence to improve conditions in China if they had stable business relationships there.
"It is no secret that the days of substantial growth in the U.S. automotive market are over -- this is a mature market, so the growth must come from outside North America," notably in Asia, Mr. Smith said.
He acknowledged that American car producers had failed to recognize the growth potential of Southeast Asia in the 1980's, and he argued that China's auto industry was still so much in its infancy that American auto makers could catch up there.
"China, however, is the great equalizer of missed opportunities," he said. "China is the ideal cornerstone for growth in Asia."
Mr. Smith had little to say about the Clinton Administration's threatened sanctions to force China to begin respecting American copyrights and patents. The two nations need to sit down and resolve their differences, he said.
G.M. has started two joint ventures with China's biggest auto makers, although neither project has yet begun producing vehicles. A planned factory in Shanghai will produce midsize Buicks, probably similar to the Buick Century, while another factory in Shenyang, in northeastern China, is to turn out light trucks.
The Chrysler Corporation is building Jeeps in Beijing, while the Ford Motor Company plans to make small commercial-delivery vehicles in China. G.M. and Ford are in talks to sell each other many auto parts in Asia so as to reduce the expense of setting up separate parts-production operations, the trade publication Automotive News reported today and both companies confirmed.
Mr. Smith, who is 58, also dismissed talk today that he might take early retirement at 62. "I have no plans to retire," he said as he left the Cobo Center here after a speech to the Economics Club of Detroit. "It's a phenomenal job."
But Mr. Smith never ruled out the possibility of early retirement. The growing visibility of Harry Pearce, the 53-year-old vice chairman and heir-apparent to Mr. Smith, has spurred rumors that Mr. Smith might step down several years from now.
Mr. Pearce played the leading role when a 17-day strike by the United Automobile Workers union at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, virtually shut down G.M.'s North American operations. Mr. Pearce also made the announcement last Thursday that G.M. would buy a Detroit landmark, the Renaissance Center, and move its headquarters there.
Mr. Smith said that a previously scheduled business meeting prevented him from attending the announcement on Thursday.
He also said that G.M. would like to be the the United Automobile Workers' primary target during negotiations late this summer to renew the Big Three auto makers' three-year labor contract. While the primary-target company bears the greatest risk of a strike, the first management to negotiate can also work out a contract that negatively affects its rivals.
And he announced that G.M. was in the final stages of deciding whether to locate a new assembly plant in Thailand or the Philippines. Thailand, where the auto market has doubled since 1991, has been the favorite, but the Philippines has tried in recent months to woo G.M. with various incentives.

HEADLINE: Move to the Web Is in the Works For Compuserve

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Deciding to flow with the relentless tide of the Internet rather than fight it, Compuserve Inc. is expected to announce today that it is rebuilding its entire on-line service on the standards of the World Wide Web, people briefed by the company said yesterday.
Compuserve's decision to embrace the open standards of the Web follows similar moves by the Prodigy Services Company, the Microsoft Network and AT&T's Interchange Online Network, all of which started as closed, proprietary services. But Compuserve, the world's second-largest consumer on-line service, with more than four million subscribers worldwide, is by far the largest network to acknowledge that it cannot compete against the rapidly growing Web. 
 "This leaves America Online as the last bastion of the proprietary world," said Gregory Wester, research director for the Yankee Group of Boston. "But even A.O.L. will back away from its proprietary software at some point. It's just a matter of time."
American Online Inc., the No. 1 service, in the past expressed confidence that its proprietary model would continue to be attractive. At the same time, the company has become one of the largest Internet service providers, offering its six million customers access to the World Wide Web.
"Over time, all on-line services will become Internet services," said Mary Modahl, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "We expect A.O.L. to be last because they have the strongest position in the flood, and they'll hold out longer."
Compuserve, a unit of H & R Block, was the first on-line service to use the proprietary software model, which requires subscribers to use special software and network access points provided by the service. It also requires that information providers use custom software tools to prepare information to be displayed on the network.
According to people briefed by Compuserve in advance of today's announcement, Compuserve has begun rewriting its existing services in the hypertext markup language, H.T.M.L., the industry standard of the World Wide Web.
Allen Weiner, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif., said the H.T.M.L. model was attractive to information publishers because it allowed them potentially to reach millions of customers without having to write a different version of the same material for each on-line service.
"In the past, content developers were forced to decide whether to develop for the Compuserve standard, for example, or for the World Wide Web standard, and now there's just one," Mr. Weiner said.
The Web is also appealing to subscribers because it offers more advanced features than any proprietary on-line service can provide. Hundreds of companies worldwide are developing such Web-based features as audio, video, interactive chat sessions, multiplayer games and secure electronic commerce.
Compuserve will continue to support existing versions of the DOS, Windows and Macintosh software used to gain access to the Compuserve Information Service and Wow on-line businesses, the people briefed by the company said. But beginning this summer, the company will distribute new software that more fully integrates access to the World Wide Web.
Compuserve declined to comment on its plans.

HEADLINE: Major Indicators at Highs as Stocks Surge

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average surged yesterday, closing at more than 5,700 points for the first time, and the Nasdaq composite index set another record as Wall Street bet the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady at a policy-setting meeting today.
The Dow index ended up 61.32 points at a record 5,748.82, eclipsing the old closing high of 5,689.74 set on April 3 and adding to last week's gain of 169 points -- its biggest weekly point gain so far this year. 
 The Nasdaq index closed up 6.23 points at a new high of 1,248.11 to set its 27th high close of this year. Broader market indexes including the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set records.
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is to meet today to consider monetary policy against the background of moderate economic growth and subdued inflation.
"The conclusion is the Fed will not do anything with rates and that allows the market to breathe a huge sigh of relief," said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.
Since lowering interest rates in January for the third time in seven months, the Fed has kept rates steady.
The strength of the 30-stock Dow index was aided by gains in oil companies stocks following news that after months of negotiations, Iraq had agreed to a United Nations deal that would allow Iraq to make limited oil sales. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude oil ended up $1.84 at $22.48 a barrel, after initially falling to a two-month low at $19.85 on the United Nations-Iraq agreement.
"The oil market was so short prior to this announcement, however, it became a sell-the-rumor, buy-the-fact event," said Rita Beale, an analyst at Fimat.
Oil-company components of the Dow industrials helped move the index higher. Chevron shares rose 2 1/2, to 62; those of Texaco were up 3 1/8, to 86 7/8, and those of Exxon added 2 1/2, to 87 1/4.
Meanwhile, the shares of base metals producers slumped as rising supplies drove copper futures prices to their lowest level since April 1994. On New York's Commodity Exchange, July copper closed 4.40 cents down at 111.20 cents a pound. Alcoa shares fell 1 7/8, to 63 1/4; Reynolds Metals was off 1 1/2 a share, to 53 7/8; Alumax was off 1 3/8, to 33, and Phelps Dodge lost 1 3/8, to 70 1/2.
American depository receipts for shares in Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications company, surged 3, to 39 3/8, and shares of Motorola added 1 1/4, to 65 3/4, after CS First Boston named Nokia its featured stock of the week and Smith Barney raised its ratings for both companies.
General Electric shares rose 3 1/8, to 84 3/8, on news that GE Capital Services, the company's financial unit, had agreed to acquire Ameridata Technologies for $16 a share, or $490 million. Ameridata shares rose 3/8, to 15 3/4.
Shares of Cycare Systems, a health care information processor, rose 3 1/8, to 50 3/8, and those of HBO & Company jumped 5 1/4, to 128 3/4, after HBO agreed to acquire Cycare in a stock deal.
Valujet shed 1 7/8 a share, to 11 1/4, after the airline said late Friday that it had decided to ground half its flights to inspect its entire fleet following the May 11 crash in Florida.
Iomega jumped 13 3/8 a share, to 82 5/8, ahead of its 2-for-1 stock split.
Shares of Republic Industries, which is run and controlled by H. Wayne Huizenga, the Florida billionaire, rose 3 1/4, to 43 7/8, after saying it planned to acquire Continental Waste Industries, up 2 7/8, to 16 1/4, in a deal worth about $240 million.
The S.& P. index of 500 stocks rose 4.24 points, to 673.15, a new closing high. The American Stock Exchange index rose 4.15 points, to 609.36, also a record.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.31 points, to a record 361.09. On the Big Board, advancing issues led declines, 1,318 to 1,034.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of New York, American and Nasdaq issues -- was at a record high of 6,719.131, up 37.876 points, or 0.57 percent.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Downsizing That Offers An Upside

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Milwaukee has the unwelcome distinction of being PBS's favorite case history of economic dysfunction. A few months ago "Frontline" brought home the travails of two of the thousands of workers laid off by Briggs & Stratton, once the city's biggest employer. And tonight it is back with another woman set adrift by Briggs & Stratton and a man who was among the 5,000 workers let go by Chrysler when it "downsized" its Kenosha plant, south of Milwaukee. Both programs grow out of a study begun by the producers Tom Casciato and Kathleen Hughes in 1991.
Although tonight's report does not gloss over the pain of unemployment -- which, it is noted, is feeding the resentment at corporate callousness that has become a potent political campaign theme -- "Does America Still Work?" offers a somewhat brighter picture than its predecessor did. By the end of the hour, Bill Donnell, who spent months taking retraining courses only to find himself with plenty of certificates of completion but no job prospects, and Sheila Caldwell, an unmarried mother who lost the health benefits that were paying for her daughter's cancer treatments, are back at work. 
 But the temptation for companies to lower labor costs, often by departing for nonunion climes, remains strong. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich tells the evening's reporter, Jeff Madrick, that "re-engineering or restructuring or downsizing or rightsizing or whatever you want to call it -- it's basically firing -- has gone way too far." How a few Milwaukee manufacturers are resisting the pressure to move south lest their profits go south is the upbeat part of the program.
Mr. Madrick talks to the heads of Harley-Davidson, Master Lock and Chrysler, which has rejuvenated its Kenosha plant and hired back some of the workers, like Mr. Donnell, who were laid off during the company's tough times. All agree that corporate responsibilities go beyond profits, with the caveat that the top priority is still a profitable bottom line.
Richard Teerlink, who runs Harley-Davidson, speaks of his obligations to employees, customers, suppliers and society as well as to investors. Master Lock is helping to rehabilitate homes for employees in its neighborhood. And Chrysler is using state aid to retrain workers to handle its new technology and bring them into management decisions.
Having delivered its happy endings and examples of companies doing well by doing good, the program reminds us that people who lost jobs in the 1990's tend to be out of work longer than those who lost them in the 1980's and that new jobs typically pay less than the old ones. The persistence of Mr. Casciato and Ms. Hughes is paying off with close-ups of what downsizing means to people whose lives have been upended and by focusing attention on what corporations and government can and ought to do about it.
 
 'Nova'
 'Alive on Everest'
 PBS, tonight at 8
 (Channel 13 in New York)
This vivid account of Rick Wilcox's 1991 attempt to reach the summit of Mount Everest is preceded by a report from one of the expeditions in which eight lives were lost last week. "Nova," which had been charting a team's progress over the Internet all month, carries an interview with the climber David Breashears at the base camp about what it must have been like for the exhausted climbers as they struggled toward the summit in a blizzard. To the accompaniment of pictures of a forbidding rock and weather, he says: "Suddenly you're alone in a howling wind, and you don't know up from down, left from right. So you lay down on the ice to stay warm, maybe you're too tired . . . and you lay down to die because there's nothing else left to do."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Mixed On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities turned mixed yesterday, as investors displayed caution ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Although few market participants expect any change in interest rates at the meeting, investors were not inclined to get ahead of themselves. 
 Much of the day's momentum was a carry-over from last Friday's strong rally, but the market failed to build on last week's gains, which were inspired by data that suggested that the pace of economic growth was slow enough to keep inflation from accelerating.
The 30-year bond declined 1/32 , to a price of 8914/32 to yield 6.83 percent, unchanged from Friday.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management, a Washington-based firm with $5 billion in bonds under management, said the market continued to exhibit the positive mood that took hold two weeks ago.
That was inspired, he said, by the small movement in the producer price Index. Excluding food and energy, it was up one-tenth of 1 percent, with the year-over-year gain just 1.8 percent. The low-inflation outlook was confirmed the following week by the Fed's beige book report and again last week by the Consumer Price Index.
Other factors are now coming into play, Mr. Carpenter said, notably the recent fall in crude oil prices.
"Additionally, the change in bond market psychology has been aided by the very soft retail sales reported last week," Mr. Carpenter said.
Also working to swing the mood are political and budget issues that relate to the budget deficit, the forecast of a large Treasury surplus for the month of April, from what may amount to a 20 percent to 25 percent increase in tax payments compared with last year, and contemplation of welfare reform to save tax dollars. "Given the big drop in inflation expectations and the substantially lower core numbers at wholesale and retail, and the big recent drop in energy prices," Mr. Carpenter said, "the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates at the F.O.M.C. on one hand nor lower rates given the healthy 2.8 percent growth rate recorded in the first quarter and the great likelihood that second-quarter growth will be in the neighborhood of 3.5 percent."
The earliest the Fed would move to change policy, he said, will be late third quarter or early fourth quarter. It appears that the Fed has more or less correctly set the Federal funds rate within 25 basis points of a level consistent with producing moderate growth of around 2 percent and inflation at around 2.5 percent. In yesterday's Treasury bill auction, the three-month maturity averaged 5.03 percent and the six-month issue 5.11 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Partners Vote For Changes At Goldman

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company took action yesterday to strengthen its capital base and to limit the liability of the firm's partners.
Goldman said it would retain for a longer period the capital of partners who leave the firm. The firm also said it would become a limited liability partnership on Nov. 30, the end of its financial year. 
 Goldman's partners approved the measures yesterday at a meeting at the firm's Broad Street headquarters in Manhattan. The partners voted at their annual meeting in January to remain a private partnership while also seeking to create some advantages enjoyed by public companies, such as limited liability.
Goldman, which is the last big private partnership on Wall Street, reported profit before taxes of $1.37 billion for the year ended Nov. 30, 1995. Partners said the firm, which has been doing well in the current buoyant financial climate, had more than $5 billion in capital.
The moves approved yesterday are part of a gradual realignment that Jon S. Corzine, Goldman's chairman and senior partner; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the vice chairman and chief operating officer, and the new management committees they installed last November are carrying out as they try to increase Goldman's stability and profitability.
Mr. Corzine and Mr. Paulson described the measures in a letter to Goldman staff that was dated today. "The partners yesterday adopted certain arrangements to strengthen and enhance the stability of the firm's capital base, reduce partners' personal risk in the event of a catastrophic loss, and, by these and related measures, encourage partners to lengthen their active careers at the firm," the letter said.
Goldman declined to disclose exactly how partners' capital would be affected by the changes. "A piece of their capital will have a longer tenure," said a partner who attended yesterday's meeting, explaining that the capital of a partner leaving the firm would probably remain with Goldman for an average of about six years, compared with the current three and a half to four years. The extension of this tenure makes it less likely that Goldman would experience unexpected strain on its capital.
In addition, under the new arrangement, partners with long service would have some greater flexibility in gaining access to their capital once they cease to be active working partners, and instead become limited partners.
In 1994, when interest rates rose rapidly, Goldman, like other big Wall Street firms, suffered losses and some drain of capital as it marked down the value of its huge bond portfolios. Yesterday's moves are an attempt to insure that the firm is well able to deal with similar problems in the future.
Goldman partners played down the new moves, emphasizing that they effectively codify much of the firm's existing practices.
Goldman has 173 working partners and 110 limited partners, a spokesman for the firm said yesterday. The working partners, along with two powerful outside investors, Sumitomo Bank of Japan and the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, an educational trust in Hawaii, own about three-quarters of the firm's capital, with the limited partners holding the rest.

HEADLINE: Effort to Weaken Bosnian Serb Leader Seems to Have Failed

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 20

 BODY:
The international campaign to weaken Radovan Karadzic's grip on power, and perhaps even drive the Bosnian Serb leader from office, appears to have ended for now in failure.
Dr. Karadzic, who has been indicted as a war criminal and is not recognized by the rest of the world as the legitimate leader of Serbian-held Bosnia, has succeeded in ousting Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic, and has appointed new hard-liners to fill key government posts. 
 Mr. Kasagic, who worked with other countries to implement the Dayton peace accord, has dropped out of sight. And despite pressure by Western countries to oust Dr. Karadzic, Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, has refused to do anything more than issue statements condemning the latest consolidation of Dr. Karadzic's power.
The moves by Dr. Karadzic are ominous. They push back the international efforts to prepare for Bosnian elections, which are due to take place Sept. 14. If Dr. Karadzic is still in power in July, when campaigning is to begin, many Western diplomats say that it will be impossible to hold meaningful elections. And, for the first time since the Dayton agreement, there appears to be an urgency among Western diplomats to get rid of Dr. Karadzic, perhaps, in the end, by military force.
"If Karadzic is in a position to actively take part in the election campaign," said Michael Steiner, the senior deputy to Carl Bildt, "then any election campaign makes no sense."
Mr. Bildt, who is in charge of the civilian aspects of the peace accords, has been trying to bolster moderate Bosnian Serb leaders, including the ousted Prime Minister.
Mr. Bildt has often been criticized for weak leadership, and Western diplomats today welcomed his emergence, for the first time, as a forceful advocate for a change in the Bosnian Serb leadership. They conceded, however, that he has few tools to threaten or cajole the Bosnian Serbs at his disposal, other than the carrot of international aid.
Together with the United States, Mr. Bildt is now rallying international support, much of it aimed at pressuring Mr. Milosevic to force Dr. Karadzic to relinquish power. Mr. Milosevic needs to open trade with Europe and desperately desires loans to jump-start his economy.
But Western diplomats also said that if the elections were canceled it would signal a collapse of the peace process and could lead to a renewal of the conflict. They conceded that they might be forced to go ahead, even with Dr. Karadzic in power.
"We run the serious risk of the collapse of the peace process, in all its splendor, the military dimension and the civilian side," said Robert H. Frowick, the head of mission that will oversee the elections. Mr. Frowick, representing the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, said, "There is enormous pressure to find a way to meet reasonable desiderata to proceed."
The current clash, although it ended in Dr. Karadzic's favor, is the beginning of a drive by Mr. Bildt to push Dr. Karadzic out of office, according to Mr. Steiner. The focus has now shifted from Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, to Belgrade. And Mr. Bildt's office hopes that European and American envoys will deliver harsher messages to Mr. Milosevic to use whatever forces are at his disposal to get rid of Dr. Karadzic. Western diplomats, in recent days, have told Mr. Milosevic that he will not receive economic support until Dr. Karadzic is replaced.
Those diplomats said, however, that Mr. Milosevic shows little interest in taking forceful action to remove Dr. Karadzic. They said it appears that Mr. Milosevic hopes that the elections, which Dr. Karadzic is not allowed to enter, will remove the Bosnian Serb leader from any major role in Bosnian politics.
"Milosevic has moved and has produced something," Mr. Steiner said, "but it is important that he understands that this is not what we wanted. While he may think he has done enough, we don't think he has done enough."
Dr. Karadzic has announced that he would turn over international negotiations to a hard-line supporter, Biljana Plavsic. Mr. Bildt's office initially greeted this as a sign of weakness. But it was clear today, from statements made in Pale, that it instead meant a stiffening of the refusal by Pale to implement the civilian aspects of the Dayton accord, including permission for displaced people and refugees to return home and the efforts to create a unified Bosnia.
"After three wars in this century, we can't live together," the new Prime Minister, Gojko Klickovic, said tonight, rejecting the call by the peace accords for a united Bosnia.
And Mrs. Plavsic, selected by Dr. Karadzic as a Vice President, said the only reason she had been given authority was because "the international community does not want to talk to President Karadzic."

HEADLINE: GE Capital to Acquire Ameridata Technologies for $490 Million

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company's Capital Services unit agreed yesterday to buy Ameridata Technologies Inc. for $490 million to expand its computer equipment leasing and consulting business.
The purchase will double to $3 billion the annual revenue of G.E.'s Technology Management Services, which specializes in buying, setting up and managing corporate computers. 
 It also gives GE Capital, one of the world's biggest computer equipment lessors, more power to compete with rivals like I.B.M., Electronic Data Systems and Andersen Consulting for top technicians.
"The overall pie in servicing desktop machines is expanding very rapidly, but the cost of hiring talent is increasing," said Waverly Deutsch, an analyst at Forrester Research. The acquisition will give GE Capital a quick infusion of 3,600 workers worldwide, she said.
GE Capital will pay $16 a share for Ameridata; that company's shares rose 37.5 cents to $15.75 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday -- a 52-week high. The stock has jumped 26 percent the last two weeks. General Electric's shares rose $3.125, to $84.375.
Ameridata specializes in supplying computers wholesale to its customers. In recent quarters, the company switched its focus to maintaining PC's and networks, an industry that is expected to grow 14 percent a year, according to Dataquest Inc.
The acquisition would give G.E.'s Technology Management Services, based in Norcross, Ga., a bigger share of the $28 billion-a-year industry of managing corporate computer networks, analysts said.
Earlier this year, the unit bought the Ferntree Computer Corporation of Australia to expand its reach abroad.
GE Capital will start a cash tender offer for Ameridata shares in five days, General Electric said. Ameridata's management, which owns 6 percent of the shares outstanding, has agreed to tender its shares. Ameridata, based in Stamford, Conn., also said it adjourned its annual meeting, which had been scheduled for today.
"It's a reasonable purchase price for G.E., because it's a growing business," said Russell Leavitt, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York.
GE Capital, which leases equipment as diverse as trucks, airplanes and computers, had an operating profit of $3.52 billion in 1995, on revenue of $26.49 billion.
Since 1992, Ameridata has bought at least 25 companies to bolster its computer systems and services group. Last year, Ameridata bought five international units of Control Data Systems Inc., expanding its reach into Austria, Canada, Mexico, Norway and Britain.
In 1995, the company's net income rose 24 percent to $17.3 million, or 79 cents a share, while revenue rose 49 percent to $1.52 billion. Had Ameridata remained an independent company, per-share earnings were forecast to rise 29 percent, to $1.02 a share in 1996, in a recent survey of three analysts by IBES International Inc.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Game's Big Problem: Futile Tigers

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
On a daily basis, people say Major League Baseball should do something about Marge Schott, should do something about Albert Belle. What baseball should do something about, though, is the Detroit Tigers.
In the best interests of baseball, the acting commissioner, the executive council, the American League president and anyone else who has compassion for people and passion for the game that used to be should do something about the Tigers. What they should do is declare the Tigers' remaining games exhibitions, not to be counted in the standings, and declare their games already played to be exhibitions and remove them from the standing. 
 Projections are meaningless, but to put the Tigers' performance in perspective, if they were to continue playing at the pace they have established in the first seven weeks, they would win 43 games and lose 119, record numbers for a 14-team league. Putting it in further perspective, that record would come humiliatingly close to the 40-120 record the Mets staggered to in 1962, the first season of their existence.
At the same pace (7.7 runs a game), the Tigers' opponents would score 1,253 runs, a total that would shatter records for all league sizes and shapes. As an example of just how bad the Tigers' pitchers are, that total would exceed by nearly 300 the record for most runs allowed in a 162-game season.
High-scoring games are one thing. If baseball officials believe runs and home runs will attract more fans, let the scoring continue. But the Tigers' games go well beyond the call of business. In the Tigers' weekend series with Chicago, the White Sox, no scoring machine themselves, scored 11, 16 and 14 runs, punctuating the final game with a pair of grand slams. Opponents have scored in double figures in 8 of the Tigers' last 16 games and 14 times over all this season.
In short, it has become far too easy for teams to score against Detroit pitchers. They don't even have a challenge anymore. Play the games, but use them for what they are -- batting practice.
It has become far too easy, too, for journalists, both print and electronic, to elicit the most inane and offensive comments from Marge Schott. Like shooting fish in a barrel, reporters who ask the Cincinnati Reds' managing partner a question they know will get some dumb comment that will gain attention.
Therefore, it is time to make Schott off limits. No more cheap and easy stories. If we don't ask, she can't tell.
Furthermore, baseball officials should take no action against Schott. Anything they try to do will lead them to court, and baseball needs a nasty legal fight over the Reds' franchise less than it needs to get rid of Schott. At the rate she is going, she is headed for the economic equivalent of a 43-119 record.
Reds fans will let Schott know that it is time for her to bow out and either sell her share or step aside and let someone else operate the club. She is a hard-nosed, bottom-line businesswoman, and a growing number of empty seats, left unfilled by fans tired not necessarily of her comments but of her decimation of the team, will prompt her to get out.
For precedent, see the Mets of the late 70's, who under the misguided stewardship of the de Roulet family and its Rasputin, M. Donald Grant, drew a decreasing number of fans until a record low of 788,905 showed up in 1979. The de Roulets sold the Mets before the next season.
Baseball officials have tried to do something about Albert Belle, but no amount of counseling is going to change him. At least the Indians hope it won't. The Indians like the Albert Belle who leads the league in home runs, is tied for the lead in runs batted in and is fourth in hitting. And who can blame them?
The Indians know that Belle hits best when angry. The last thing they want to do is defuse his anger. The trick for Dr. Charles Maher, the Rutgers professor who serves as the Indians' sports psychologist, will be to find a way to persuade Belle to stop menacing members of the news media without diluting the intensity and anger that stoke his fire.
It might be in the best interests of baseball to have Belle tone down his off-field behavior, but it is in the best interests of the Indians to keep him hitting. The way the Indians hope it works is that baseball officials can lead Belle to a shrink, but they cannot make him think.
Officials will monitor Belle's counseling visits but not their content. Neither Belle nor Maher will be conducting any interviews on the subjects discussed in their sessions. If Belle's power and production start slipping, though, know that the counselor went too far.
Has Darryl Strawberry gone so far with his off-field problems that he has ended his major league career? Shunned by every major league organization, Strawberry began his comeback last night when the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League started their exhibition schedule looking ahead to their May 31 season opener.
"I talked to our manager last night," Marvin Goldklang, the Saints' owner, said yesterday, referring to Marty Scott. "Based on what he's seen, he thinks Strawberry ought to be in the big leagues."
Asked why he thought major league teams have ignored Strawberry, Goldklang said: "I think the concern is more one of media reaction than a lack of ability or unwillingness to take on a player with his background. Maybe some teams are concerned over what their local columnists might write if they signed him. I think it's ill founded."
If the major leagues are big enough to hold Marge Schott and Albert Belle, they should have room for Darryl Strawberry.

HEADLINE: Moratorium on Protecting Species Is Ended

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Ending a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress, the Federal Government complied with a court order today and granted protection under the Endangered Species Act to a California frog.
But Federal officials said the endangered species program was severely short of money and overwhelmed by a backlog of hundreds of imperiled species -- and by almost as many lawsuits demanding action to save them. 
 Having persuaded Congress to drop the moratorium as part of the recent agreement on Federal spending for the current fiscal year, the Clinton Administration is now struggling under intense legal and political pressures to decide which species to protect first.
Its plan is to act first to help species facing an immediate danger of extinction, followed by those species that biologists determine would be most likely to recover if fully protected under the law, according to a notice published on Thursday. Only later would the Government turn to less pressing questions, including studies of additional species and decisions about lifting protections on species that are now out of danger. Federal protection prohibits the destruction of habitat.
At issue are the needs of species as familiar as the peninsular bighorn sheep and coho salmon of the West Coast, or as obscure as Appalachian mussels, Hawaiian plants and the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl of the Southwest.
The California red-legged frog, the species thought to have inspired Mark Twain's yarn about a "celebrated jumping frog," appeared today to have, well, leap-frogged over the 242 other species whose proposed protection was held up by the moratorium.
In a suit brought during the moratorium by the Environmental Defense Center, a Federal District Court in California had ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service last year to protect the frog. But until now, the Administration could not obey the order because Congress had refused to provide money for the agency to take any such actions.
The California red-legged frog was classified as threatened, a status that under the law means a species is headed toward being legally endangered throughout its range but is not yet in danger of extinction.
Long since eliminated from most of the streams it once occupied, the frog still survives in about 240 streams or wetlands, but there are thought to be only three areas sheltering more than 350 frogs.
Smaller populations than that are considered less likely to survive the stresses of pollution, habitat destruction, and competition from non-native species like bullfrogs, which were introduced after the red-legged frog was largely extirpated many decades ago by hunters who sold its legs as a gourmet delicacy.
Now, as the endangered species program rises unsteadily back to its feet, Administration officials said the Government faced a huge backlog of cases involving species that might merit protection under the law, but that there was far too little money to protect them all right away.
Administration officials said they believed that the California red-legged frog could be protected without undue economic disruption, although grazing, logging, mining, flood control, and other activities would have to be carried out with the needs of the species in mind.
Mollie Beattie, the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the frog's needs were already being addressed in projects at Fort Ord, in the San Francisco transit system, and around the Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the Contra Costa Water District, as well as in several habitat conservation plans.
There seems to be no way for the Government to act quickly on the full range of decisions involving endangered species.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has less than $4 million to spend between now and October on its endangered species program. It faces a backlog of 242 species, not counting the frog, for which protection has already been proposed but not made final. Some 182 species more are viewed as likely candidates but need further research before being proposed for listing.
Almost as worrisome to officials who manage the program, there are about 60 lawsuits pending involving disputes over which species should be listed, and 300 more cases where plaintiffs have notified the Government that they may file suit under the law.
"Biological needs, not the preferences of litigants, should drive the listing process," said the Fish and Wildlife Service last week in an explanation of how it would set its priorities. "In some cases courts have ordered the service to complete activities that are simply not, in the service's expert judgment, among the highest biological priorities."
For example, the Fund for Animals won a lawsuit against the Bush Administration that requires the agency to decide whether to protect 443 species by Sept. 30, 1996, a deadline that the agency had expected to meet but that now appears impossible.
Officials said that if the agency was bound by that decision it would spend its entire budget meeting the deadline and would be unable to address higher priorities.
"The question is, do we want to do this in a biologically sensible way or not, given the situation we are in?" said George Frampton, the Assistant Secretary of Interior for fish and wildlife.
Mr. Frampton said it was not clear which species would be given priority. The agency's biologists had been transferred to other jobs for the past year, and it will take time for them to finish other tasks and then to review the status of endangered species.
As the listing of new species accelerates in the months ahead, it is also unclear how the continuing Congressional debate over revising the law will be affected.
Congressional Republicans at one time believed that the moratorium on protecting new species would pressure the Administration to sign a bill radically overhauling the law. A proposal drafted in the House would have removed restrictions on private landowners and compensated them for regulations that decreased the value of their property.
But Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, has signaled he will not bring that proposal to the floor, and now the resumption of new listings may increase the pressure on Congress to consider a more moderate approach.

HEADLINE: For First Time, Justices Reject Punitive Award

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Overturning a $2 million punitive-damage award to an Alabama man who bought a new BMW with a touched-up paint job, the Supreme Court set new standards today for determining when an award of punitive damages is so "grossly excessive" as to violate the constitutional requirement of due process of law.
The 5-to-4 decision marked the first time in more than a decade of wrestling with the punitive-damages issue that the Court had actually overturned an award as excessive. The decision, with a majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens and over the dissents of four Justices who said the Court should not intrude in an area traditionally reserved for state law, came in a high-profile case that had become something of a poster child of the debate -- now going on in Congress and the Presidential campaign as much as in the courts -- over revising the tort system. 
 The majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also wrote a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist also signed.
In his decision, Justice Stevens said the award went far beyond what BMW might have reasonably expected to suffer for its conduct and said courts should consider factors like "degree of reprehensibility" and the mathematical ratio between punitive and actual damages in deciding whether to uphold awards.
But the decision, BMW v. Gore, No. 94-896, left a number of important questions unanswered, offering what it called "guideposts" rather than specific formulas for assessing the fairness of punitive-damage awards. The case now returns to the Alabama Supreme Court. The Court is also likely to vacate decisions in more than a dozen other punitive-damage cases on its docket and send those back to the state courts as well. A clear view of the boundaries of the Court's analysis today is likely to emerge only gradually, as state courts adjust their practices.
"Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment but also of the severity of the penalty that a state may impose," Justice Stevens said.
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia derided what Justice Stevens called "guideposts" as "criss-crossing platitudes" that he said marked "a road to nowhere."
But while the ruling will clearly not end the debate, "it really gives lawyers and courts something to work with in terms of structuring the inquiry," Andrew L. Frey, the lawyer who won the case for BMW, said in an interview today.
An Alabama jury had originally awarded $4 million, calculating the damages based on the manufacturer's behavior not only in Alabama -- where 14 customers, including the plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, Jr., had bought new cars that had been repainted to correct minor paint damage -- but throughout the country.
Nearly 1,000 repainted BMW's had been sold as new in the 10 years before the 1992 trial, most in states where, like Alabama, there was no law on the books that made the specific practice illegal. Viewing the practice as consumer fraud, the Alabama jury reached its $4-million verdict by multiplying 1,000 by the $4,000 it calculated as the loss of value to Dr. Gore's $40,000 car from the paint repair, which itself cost $601.37.
The Alabama Supreme Court, in a 1993 ruling, cut the award in half on the ground that an Alabama jury could not rely on "acts that occurred in other jurisdictions." The majority today strongly agreed with that analysis, while finding the smaller award still too high.
"While each state has ample power to protect its own consumers, none may use the punitive-damages deterrent as a means of imposing its regulatory policies on the entire Nation," Justice Stevens said. Using legal jargon for "wrongdoer," Justice Stevens said that "a state may not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors' lawful conduct in other States."
While an important part of the ruling, this analysis was also a source of ambiguity, because Justice Stevens said that "we need not consider" whether one state's courts could take into account conduct that was illegal in other states. Product liability cases that involve dangerous or negligently made products are likely to raise this question.
Earlier this month, President Clinton vetoed a bill that would have set limits on punitive damages, in both state and Federal courts, in cases involving faulty products. During the Presidential primaries, Republicans ran advertisements attacking the liability system and calling for drastic reform. But the failure of a two-year-long Congressional effort was likely to shift attention to the courts as the forum where the next act in the punitive-damages drama would play out.
In his opinion, Justice Stevens said the $2 million award against BMW failed three tests that courts should use to make sure that a defendant had adequate notice of exposure to heavy punitive damages.
The first was the "degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct": whether the behavior had put people's health or safety at risk, for example, or whether there was evidence of bad faith. In this case, Justice Stevens said, there was only minor economic injury and "no deliberate false statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment of evidence of improper motive." He said BMW had no reason to think its practice violated Alabama law.
The second of the "guideposts" was the ratio between the punitive and the actual damages, in this instance 500:1. Justice Stevens said the Court would continue to reject "the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula," but added that "when the ratio is a breathtaking 500 to 1, however, the award must surely raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow."
The third test was to compare the punitive-damage awards and any civil fines or criminal punishment available in the state for similar conduct. In Alabama, the fine for violating the state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act is $2,000. Justice Stevens noted that in New York, the penalty for a first-time violation of the equivalent consumer-protection law is $50. He said that while the Alabama courts were free to impose a punitive-damage award beyond the statutory fine, "we cannot, however, accept the conclusion of the Alabama Supreme Court that BMW's conduct was sufficiently egregious to justify a punitive sanction that is tantamount to a severe criminal penalty."
Justice Ginsburg's dissenting opinion included a four-page appendix of recent actions or bills currently under consideration in the states to curb punitive damages.
She said: "The Court, I am convinced, unnecessarily and unwisely ventures into territory traditionally within the states' domain, and does so in the fact of reform measures recently adopted or currently under consideration in legislative arenas."
Justice Scalia said the majority had accomplished "nothing at all except confer an artificial air of doctrinal analysis upon its essentially ad hoc determination that this particular award of punitive damages was not 'fair.' "
He said: "I do not regard the 14th amendment's due-process clause as a secret repository of substantive guarantees against 'unfairness.' "

HEADLINE: Pataki and Giuliani End Squabble Over an Economic Renewal Zone

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Breaking an impasse that had held up $100 million in Federal aid for two of New York City's poorest neighborhoods, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that they had overcome their differences over how to share control of the board that will dole out the money.
The dispute over the so-called Empowerment Zone program, in which parts of Harlem and the South Bronx are to receive $300 million in city, state and Federal money for economic development incentives, came down in the end to haggling over legal technicalities. 
 But with the subsidies already more than a year overdue, the squabbling had prompted charges that petty political rivalries were standing in the way of the interests of poor people. And the resolution announced yesterday appeared to be the most expedient way for the Mayor and the Governor to put behind them an episode with potentially unpleasant political repercussions.
"We have been and are prepared to meet our commitment," said Mr. Pataki, who announced the agreement at a joint news conference with Mr. Giuliani in Albany. Federal officials had suggested that the Republican administrations in Albany and City Hall had been dragging their feet because they were reluctant to pay for an expensive program that was championed largely by their Democratic predecessors.
Discussing the dispute over control of the board that will run the program, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, "The issue very simply is that both the city and the state want to feel that they can be accountable."
Under the terms announced yesterday, the state agreed to a revision in the bylaws of the board that will govern the empowerment zone, giving state officials less power to remove board members they oppose. The city had complained that under the previous rules, the state could have ousted the city's appointees on the board if city and state officials disagreed over which projects should get money.
For its part, the city agreed to indemnify the state against liability lawsuits against the board of empowerment zone, which has members from the city, state and Federal governments but will technically be a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency.
With those legal sticking points resolved, officials said the only question remaining before the zone is formed, and the spigot of government subsidies turned on, is when the city will call the first meeting of the zone's board. Since the bylaws of the zone designate the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Fran Reiter, as the board's chairwoman during its first year, it is up to her to call the meeting.
"Our lawyers are meeting with their lawyers, and assuming everyone is on the same page, there is no reason whey there shouldn't be a meeting of the board by the end of next week," Ms. Reiter said in an interview late yesterday.
Unless lawyers for the city or the state come up with other problems, the deal announced yesterday appeared likely to placate a chorus of critics led by Andrew M. Cuomo, an assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, whose district includes Harlem and the South Bronx.
It followed a week of bitter exchanges between city and state economic development officials, reflecting an unusually tense rivalry that had been apparent in recent months in disputes over such projects as development of the site of the New York Coliseum and of a park along the Hudson River in Manhattan.
The dispute was brought to a head by Mr. Rangel, who had been one of the chief advocates of an empowerment zone when Harlem and the South Bronx were selected for the designation in December 1994 after a national competition among cities.
He complained bitterly last week that five other cities that were selected for empowerment zone benefits at the same time quickly established their zones last year, and said the long delay in New York City meant that it might sacrifice the Federal Government's commitment to the program.
That fear was reinforced by Mr. Cuomo, who is charge of administering Federal funds under the empowerment zone program. He said on Friday that New York City was "very close" to losing Federal funds for the zone because of the delay.
Under a agreement reached in January, the city, state and Federal governments, which are to contribute equal amounts of money to the zone -- to a maximum of $100 million each -- agreed to pitch in $6 million each during the first year.
But because of the legal snags that have delayed formation of the zone since then, it was unclear yesterday how much money would be immediately available to the zone once a meeting of its board is called. That is because its first year of operations was to have corresponded with New York City's fiscal year, which ends on June 30, giving the board little time to select projects and dispense money.
Among the Harlem civic leaders who had criticized the delays in the program was the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, who has been planning a job counseling program that would be paid for by empowerment zone subsidies.
"I am very pleased that things seem to have been resolved," he said yesterday. "But I remain deeply concerned that this community was held hostage over details."
The government aid will be used for job training programs, low interest business loans and projects intended to attract small companies to the neighborhood, like a building planned on 125th Street in Harlem to house small startup companies.

HEADLINE: Despite Tensions, Clinton Urges Renewal of China's Trade Status

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Despite a conflict with China over pirated American computer software, movies and music, President Clinton called today for unconditional renewal of preferential trade status for China, saying the step would be "a vote for America's interests" and "not a referendum on all China's policies."
Mr. Clinton's speech began a full-scale Administration lobbying effort to win Congressional approval for the extension of most-favored-nation trade status for China, even though tensions linger over major issues like nuclear proliferation and human rights abuses as well as trade. 
 The President's address to the Pacific Basin Economic Council also came close to being a point-by-point response to a withering election-year attack by Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, on Mr. Clinton earlier this month for "weakness, indecision, double talk and incoherence" in foreign policy, especially toward the Pacific Basin.
Reviewing his Asia policy, Mr. Clinton emphasized the "firmness and steadiness" with which his Administration secured the shutdown of reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium in North Korea. He said the United States must also be "steady and firm" in pushing for a stable, open and prosperous China.
And while Mr. Dole had cited a merchandise trade deficit with Japan last year of $60 billion, higher than when Mr. Clinton took office, the President today countered with his own trade statistics. He said that the trade deficit with Japan was down 25 percent from last year.
Four years ago as a candidate, Mr. Clinton denounced President George Bush for his position that engaging China rather than threatening it with trade sanctions was the best way to promote human rights and protect America's interest in Asia. But once in office, Mr. Clinton came around to a similar policy of engagement.
Last week, after months of warnings regarding the violations of an agreement protecting intellectual property rights -- which include pirating of software, videotapes and music -- the Administration published a list of $3 billion of goods exported from China to the United States annually that could be subject to the largest trade sanctions ever imposed by Washington.
But Mr. Clinton has long made clear his intentions to push to continue the trade benefits, and his action today was expected. His speech displayed the kinds of arguments he will be making during the next few months as Congress weighs whether to vote to revoke China's trade benefits and force Mr. Clinton to exercise a veto. Although the President almost certainly would defeat an override attempt, the battle would make him look weaker on the world stage.
[On Tuesday, a Vice Premier of China, Li Lanqing, welcomed Mr. Clinton's effort to renew the trade status but warned Washington not to impose sanctions over trade disputes, Reuters reported.
["This, of course, is good news," Mr. Li told a seminar in Beijing. "I feel that it is harmful to long-term Chinese-U.S. economic and trade cooperation for China and the United States to argue about this problem each year. It will create psychological instability on both sides and will have no good results."
[Referring to looming tit-for-tat sanctions announced by Beijing and Washington in the dispute over copyright piracy, Mr. Li said: "I don't know who will be imposing sanctions on whom or who will be containing whom. I feel that this is inappropriate. We are not willing to see a trade war."]
Mr. Clinton noted today that China is Asia's only "declared nuclear weapons state" and has the world's largest standing army. In less than two decades, he said, it could be the world's largest economy.
Faced with such an economic and military behemoth, he argued, it would not be in America's interest to drive China toward isolation by denying the "most favored" trade status that is given routinely to most trading partners in the world and allows China to export its products to the United States at the lowest possible tariffs. The sanctions for violating the piracy agreement amount to only a small fraction of China's total imports to the United States.
Revoking the status, Mr. Clinton said, "would drive us back into a period of mutual isolation and recrimination that would harm America's interests, not advance them."
"Rather than strengthening China's respect for human rights," Mr. Clinton said, "it would lessen our contact with the Chinese people. Rather than limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction, it would limit the prospect for future cooperation in this area. Rather than bringing stability to the region, it would increase instability as the leaders of Hong Kong, Taiwan and all of the nations of the region have stated repeatedly."
Mr. Dole earlier this month spurned the conservative wing of his own party and said he too backed the current status for China, though he sharply criticized Mr. Clinton's overall policy toward Asia.
"President Clinton's long silence and his history of zigzags on China has put extension of M.F.N. in serious doubt this year," Mr. Dole said today in a statement. "The President still needs to articulate a coherent policy toward China and how M.F.N. extension fits into that policy."
Patrick J. Buchanan, Mr. Dole's erstwhile competitor for the Republican nomination, called Mr. Clinton's move to renew China's trading privileges "an act of economic, moral and military appeasement."
He added: "For the Republican Party this will be a defining moment: Do we stand with Bill Clinton or do we stand by the values that made us a Congressional majority. Do we love trade more than we loathe tyranny?"
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton would formally notify Congress of his decision to extend the trade preferences on June 3, starting the time-clock for action. Beginning a month later, on July 3, the House and Senate have 60 days in which they could vote to revoke China's benefits.
Republicans say that there has been rising frustration on Capitol Hill with what is seen as Administration leniency toward China as well as with Beijing's conduct on several issues ranging across the areas of trade, human rights, diplomacy and arms control. The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, today also acknowledged a tough fight ahead and said that is why Mr. Clinton announced his decision early.
"We are worried enough that we are not taking anything for granted," Mr. McCurry said. A variety of Administration officials were to be deployed to begin making the Administration's case, with Defense Secretary William J. Perry, for example, scheduled to make an address concerning China on Wednesday.
Officials predict that the House will vote against trade preferences or make the benefits conditional because of liberal and conservative concerns alike about China's human rights record and failure to live up to international accords.
Mr. Clinton has stronger support in the more moderate Senate. But even there, Republicans say, the balance could tilt depending on whether the size of the House vote puts pressure on Democrats to split with the President and stand up for human rights or if the United States and China are in the midst of a trade war over intellectual property.

HEADLINE: A New Star In Constellation Of Art's Giants;
Queens Landmark Wins A Coveted Cultural Title

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
The Museum of Modern Art is not part of this club. Neither is the Guggenheim or the Whitney. Not even the Metropolitan Opera or the New York Philharmonic.
Just who is in the "in" crowd? Such giants as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Hall, the Bronx Zoo and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, to name a few. Their perks are the official city title of "Cultural Institution," a dollop of cachet and, more to the point, a steady stream of city money. 
 "It's a very privileged group," said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts and chairman of the city's advisory commission for cultural affairs. "You can imagine it seems like El Dorado to a lot of people."
Now, after 14 years, (well, nine years if you count the entree of Lincoln Center's parking garage and fountain), the newest cultural institution has just been crowned. It is . . . Flushing Town Hall.
How did Flushing Town Hall manage to net such a plum? Especially in a year when merciless city budget cuts are proposed for culture and the arts?
"I badgered the hell out of the city," said Claire Shulman, Borough President of Queens, who has made the renaissance of Flushing Town Hall something of a personal crusade. "I just didn't let go. I don't really know who the competition was, but I hear that other organizations were looking for institution status. We just kept pushing it and pushing it and pushing it."
The Town Hall, an 1862 Romanesque Revival building that is a national landmark, was once a 19th-century meeting hall, courthouse, police station and village library. It is undergoing a top-to-bottom renovation, and the first floor is being used for art exhibits, jazz and classical concerts and community programs.
The choice has been greeted with a mix of shrugs, applause and grimaces in the city's culture klatches. No one turned green on the record. Off the record, there were some sighs of disappointment.
"How do they justify doing the Flushing Town Hall?" said the head of one organization, who did not wish to be named possibly because the institution is hoping to join the inner sanctum someday.
At stake is a berth in the constellation of museums, zoos, botanical gardens and performance halls that are on real estate owned by the city and get the majority -- 85 percent -- of the money given out by the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.
"Favoring city-owned institutions has been a policy of all mayors," said Mr. Bourscheidt, a former deputy commissioner for cultural affairs. "It's why New York is the cultural capital of the damn world. It's why the Met can be compared to the Louvre."
Cultural institution money goes for some of the least glamorous parts of a museum or concert hall -- but that's exactly why it is so prized. It is operating money, guaranteed each year to pay for utility bills, security guards, maintenance and other day-to-day costs. Being a cultural institution means access to city capital money for construction and renovation. It also means the city covers the costs of pay raises for employees and acts as labor negotiator between a museum's management and staff.
"No private donor wants to contribute money for bricks and mortar," said Judith E. Daykin, the president and executive director of City Center and the chairwoman of the Cultural Institutions Group, an informal organization of city-owned cultural organizations. "They want their money to go to paintings or a sculpture exhibit."
There are other attractions.
In the bone-whittled budget drawn up by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the designated cultural institutions take a much smaller hit than the 400 other organizations that divvy up the remaining 15 percent of the Cultural Affairs Department money for programs, exhibits and performances. Flushing Town Hall had been the biggest recipient of that money for the last few years, getting half a million dollars. That is roughly the same amount of money its director expects to get as a cultural institution. But while the city wants to slash program funds by 59 percent, it is protecting cultural institutions, proposing to cut their money by only 9 percent.
Less tangibly, being one of the 31 cultural institutions (32 if you count Lincoln Center's "public spaces" -- the fountain, plaza, park and the parking garage -- which are on the list, but not its Chagalls, which are not), confers a certain security and stature, something that encourages other donors.
"One of the things I think will come from C.I.G. status is more prestige with foundations," said Jo-Ann Jones, the executive director of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts, which runs Flushing Town Hall.
City officials say they are besieged by museums and other organizations that want to float the idea of becoming a cultural institution.
"We certainly have inquiries all the time, numbers of requests from institutions big and small," said Patricia T. Smalley, the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, who said Flushing Town Hall had an edge because it was already city-owned. She would not reveal the names of the hopefuls, but other sources in the arts said some of those actively interested include the New York Historical Society.
Of course, the Cultural Institutions Group, pick-of-the-litter polish notwithstanding, would not really be a great deal for every museum or concert hall. The prerequisites for getting all the city's goodies can seem pretty steep.
The Guggenheim or Museum of Modern Art, for example, would have to relinquish private ownership of their buildings, not a necessarily desirable option even if the city could afford to compensate them. They would have to give up city program funds if they receive them. Then, they would have to adhere to a panoply of codes and guidelines.
Still, even a place with the stature of the Museum of Modern Art does not dismiss the idea out of hand.
"Obviously it would be very desirable, but it's just not feasible with the city's budget problems," said Elizabeth Addison, a spokeswoman for the museum, adding that there have been no serious discussions about the prospect.
Since 1877, when the American Museum of Natural History became the first cultural institution, the city has, little by little, accepted others into the fold, including the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the New York City Ballet, the Museum of the City of New York and the Studio Museum in Harlem. There has also been an effort to knight noted institutions outside Manhattan: the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the New York Hall of Science and the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, the Snug Harbor Cultural Center in Staten Island, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and other smaller historical societies and art centers.
All of them have banded themselves loosely into the Cultural Institutions Group, complete with a paid lobbyist.
Like a dogged stage mother, Mrs. Shulman has been trying for years to land this role for Flushing Town Hall. She brought it up at meetings, submitted proposals, worked the phones. She even agreed to use Queens borough money to make up the difference for the first year between what Flushing Town Hall used to get in program money and what it would get as a cultural institution.
"Some people say Claire Shulman is the Golda Meir of Queens," said John S. Dyson, the outgoing Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Finance, responsible for cultural financing. "I say Golda Meir was the Claire Shulman of Israel."
She began soon after the stately building on Northern Boulevard was turned over to the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts in 1991, with a mission to turn it into a cultural community center. The hall had fallen into despicable disrepair during the 1980's while it was subleased by an insurance executive.
Mrs. Shulman has pumped more than $7 million of Queens borough money into the renovation of the hall. The first floor, which is complete, is now showing memorabilia from the 1964 World's Fair, including Barbie dolls, neon signs and model space rockets.
Not quite the Picasso exhibit, perhaps, but that isn't the point.
"They have really put their time in," Mr. Bourscheidt said.
Ms. Daykin, the chairwoman of the Cultural Institutions Group said: "If the city in its infinite wisdom has analyzed the programming content and deemed it worthy, then it's not for me to say. It's important for the borough of Queens to be identified as having major institutions or what can be considered major institutions."

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Julie Salamon;
Growing Up in Ohio In the Shadow Of the Holocaust

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
FOR a moment, Julie Salamon seemed to be speaking in contradictions.
Her mother and father were survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Dachau death camps, and naturally, when she was growing up in southern Ohio, the Holocaust hovered in the background, a silent specter. Then again, the horrors of the Nazi era commanded little attention at home. 
 As she filled in details about her family over lunch at a SoHo bistro, it became clear there was nothing contradictory here at all, only a reminder that life's important tales are rarely neat.
"The Holocaust was very present in our household, but never in a personal way, never 'this happened to me,' " said Ms. Salamon, who has described what she calls her "family's search for a rightful place" in a new book called "The Net of Dreams." "I couldn't begin to tell you the moment I first knew about it. All I know is that I never didn't know about it. Nobody talked about it. That's the great mystery. I know I never had a discussion with my father about concentration camps -- ever, ever. There was only one moment with my father that I can even identify with the Holocaust, and that was when I was about 15 or 16."
That was when her father, Dr. Alexander Salamon, was asked to take part in a Holocaust memorial ceremony in Cincinnati, 60 miles west of Seaman, the tiny farm town where the family settled in 1953, the year Ms. Salamon was born.
"He had to go up and light a candle," she said. "My father was this tall, handsome, cool guy. And when he went up to light the candle, his hand was shaking so hard that I thought he was going to blow the candle out. I remember sitting there, watching him so completely overcome by grief.
"I just thought: 'I can't believe it. There is something going on in this man that I don't know about, and it's so sad and so horrible.' We never had discussed it."
By contrast, her mother was a talker. But insights did not flow freely from Lilly Salamon. "She would start telling a story," her daughter said, "and might say, 'Oh, when we were in the camp . . . ' She would talk about it almost like Girl Scout camp. But she would never finish the story. She would always be getting up to go do something."
It was left to an intensely curious girl to find out for herself what this ever-present but little-discussed cataclysm was about.
"Since I was very, very young, I was obsessed with reading about the Holocaust," she said. "It was way beyond my comprehension, but I was obsessed."
"The Net of Dreams," whose title is borrowed from a line in William Styron's "Lie Down in Darkness," traces the odyssey of Alexander and Lilly -- Americanized from the original Sanyi and Szimi -- from their hometown in what is now Ukraine to the camps and then on to the postwar United States.
After a false start as a general practitioner in New York, Dr. Salamon found his rightful place in Seaman (population, 714), where Jews were as scarce as skyscrapers. But something about the rolling farmland evoked the Carpathian foothills of his boyhood. There he found peace.
It is hard to imagine a topic further removed from the one Ms. Salamon has since taken on in a novella she is writing, "a fairy tale," as she describes it, about the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center. She wasn't eager, though, to talk much about the new work.
The focus instead was on her family and, not surprisingly, on growing up in the shadow of the Holocaust, a subject familiar to her lunch companion, who grew up in New York among many survivors from Europe and their American-born children.
Ms. Salamon, who was a movie reviewer for The Wall Street Journal for 11 years, until 1994, sets the stage for her story with a visit to Auschwitz, which she and her mother made three years ago.
On the way, they called on Steven Spielberg, who was then shooting "Schindler's List."
Uh-oh, you think, here comes another Holocaust book, with glitzy Hollywood frosting to boot. But that isn't it. It is mostly a story about family and searching for roots. Sanyi and Szimi are not held forth as Victims, as though that was what defined them.
"What's interesting is that they went through the Holocaust and then had a full life afterward," Ms. Salamon said. "My father was a beloved doctor in a poor community, who never talked about his experience and never asked for a thing. My parents never took reparations from the Germans because my father didn't want any pity."
Doc, as he was known in Seaman, died in 1971. A more dominant presence in the book is Lilly, a strong-willed woman with her own built-in contradictions. Julie, the younger of her two children, both daughters, calls her an "undominating Jewish mother," in no way overprotective and convinced that things will turn out for the best.
Yet, her mother also carries around half-eaten sandwiches in her purse, just in case. You never know.
"There was a book party for 'Net of Dreams,' and the hostess had these incredible cookies made," Ms. Salamon said, ignoring her cheese-and-peppers omelet to concentrate on the story.
"The waiters were carrying them around, and I was talking and talking and didn't have a chance to get one. So I asked one of the waiters if he had any more cookies, and he said, 'Well, there's this lady over there who took a whole big pile of them and put them in her purse.' I started laughing and said, 'Oh, I bet that's my mother.' "
It was.
"I think there is something about her that always wants to make sure we're all provided for," she said.
Ms. Salamon picked this restaurant, Frontiere, on Prince Street, because she likes it and because it is a short walk from Sullivan Street, where she has lived since 1976, a year after her arrival in New York. It is also not far from Public School 3 on Hudson Street. She knew she would be cutting it close to pick up her daughter, Roxie, 6, in first grade. A son, Eli, was born in 1994 while she was working on the book.
SoHo seems a far cry from Seaman. But Ms. Salamon finds something small-town about her block, where "there's still a very homey atmosphere."
"I'm going to be one of those old ladies hanging out the window," she said, with one of the many smiles that crossed her oval face, crowned by a helmet of dark hair.
For a critic, usually no stranger to lacerating prose, she showed no trace of sarcasm. Stories poured forth in an almost girlish voice, sentences often curling up at the end as though they were questions.
Until persuaded by an editor to focus on her parents' journeys, she said, she was going to write about life in Seaman. It is a pretty town, she said, but also a place that time and the interstate have passed by. Like so many other dots on the American map, it struggles with recessions and shuttered stores and bored teen-agers, who go to Cincinnati to hang out at a mall.
By now, Ms. Salamon is used to wise-guy New Yorkers, like the fellow who took her to lunch, who find implausible the idea of Jews in Smalltown, U.S.A.
"Jews from the Midwest are different from New York Jews," she allowed.
"You're probably nicer," her companion said.
"We are nicer," she agreed. "Because we can't help it. We're probably more boring, but we are nicer. We've got those Midwest manners."
"Being Jewish in Seaman was strange," she continued. Not that there was hostility, she said. Far from it. "But it was a very Protestant environment, to put it mildly," she added. "I went to Presbyterian Sunday school when I was a little kid. They did the Old Testament up until first grade. Then when they moved into the New Testament, my parents yanked us out before we came home singing, 'Jesus loves me.' "
For college, Ms. Salamon went to Tufts University, where she met her future husband, Bill Abrams, an executive at ABC-TV. She graduated from New York University Law School in 1978. But well before getting her degree, she realized the law was not for her. Journalism beckoned, and she signed on at The Wall Street Journal, starting out on the commodities beat.
At first, she knew so little that she mixed up commodities and condiments. She still recalls it as her stint as "the ketchup reporter."
But the ketchup started to run thin. In 1983, looking for something new, Ms. Salamon became intrigued by The Journal's plans for a new arts page. A film reviewer was needed. "Literally a day before they started the page, they hired me," she said. "I think they were trying to decide whether to hire a name person or a cheap person.
"I was the cheap person."
It sounds like a great job for a self-described cinema buff -- going to movies all the time. Don't kid yourself, Ms. Salamon cautioned as tea arrived. "When you see seven movies a week, you can be guaranteed that at least six of them are going to be horrid or just not interesting. I found that it wasn't new anymore."
Staying fresh is important to her.
She branched out in 1988 by writing "White Lies," an autobiographical novel. Three years later, she produced "The Devil's Candy," a book about the making of the movie flop based on "The Bonfire of the Vanities." Now, there's the novella about the Rockefeller Center tree.
That's some leap, from Dachau to Christmas.
"Once you know the lay of the land, you want to move someplace else," Ms. Salamon said.
Her parents moved many times before coming to this country, under extraordinary duress. Their daughter the writer has led quite a different life. "I've lived in the same place for 20 years now, and I lived in Ohio for 18 years," she said. "So in my personal life, I don't keep picking the wagon up and moving."
"But in my work life," she added, "that is what I do."

Calm in Palestine

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Traveling through the West Bank two weeks ago, I drove from Hebron to Bethlehem, through Ramallah and up to Nablus. What you see is a region racked by soaring unemployment among Palestinian youths and an economy sapped by the security measures imposed by Israel and Yasir Arafat. What you see are growing Israeli settlements around Jerusalem and new Israeli roads dissecting the West Bank more than ever. What you see is a grim picture -- and I couldn't be more optimistic.
That's right. Because if you look at the surface conditions in the West Bank today you could only conclude that all the ingredients are there for an explosion. But it's not exploding. In fact, in an odd way it's sort of quiet. There's a story in that quiet. 
 One explanation is that while the West Bank is still a complicated, sometimes messy weave of Israeli and Palestinian police, roads and areas of control, the fact that Palestinian institutions are now increasingly running Palestinian lives is a real calming factor. I was driving out of Bethlehem the other day with a Palestinian journalist, Khaled Abu Aker, and we went the wrong way down a one-way street. A uniformed Palestinian policeman stopped us. Khaled jumped out of his car and started shouting back at the policeman, saying that he was in a hurry and needed to go the wrong way. That was not a discussion he would have ever had with Israeli soldiers. In the end, the Palestinian policeman calmly prevailed and we turned around. But Khaled almost seemed to enjoy the encounter. Palestinians have never really had the luxury of shouting at their own policemen.
Another explanation for the relative calm is that the peace process has worked. It has forged a Palestinian silent majority that believes the peace negotiations, with all their shortcomings, are generally moving in the right direction and deserve a little patience. Save for the extremist fringe, Palestinians in the West Bank are deliberately being quiet now to help Shimon Peres get re-elected -- cooperation that would have been unthinkable five years ago.
Said Kanan, director of the Center For Palestine Research, says the change in Palestinian attitudes is easily tracked in his group's polls. In November 1994, 57 percent of Palestinians said they supported armed attacks against Israeli civilians, while 34 percent were opposed. By March 1996, 21 percent of Palestinians supported such armed attacks (still too high), but 70 percent were opposed. In January 1994, 51 percent of Palestinians supported negotiations with Israel, while 40 percent were opposed. By March 1996, 78 percent supported negotiations and only 16 percent were opposed.
Aaron Miller, one of the State Department's top Middle East experts, argues that these numbers attest to two fundamental changes that have occurred in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The first, he contends, is that "the conflict is no longer between the Palestinian mainstream and the Israeli mainstream, but between the Palestinian extreme and the Israeli extreme." The second, he says, is that the historic shift of Palestinian political life and leadership from outside the West Bank and Gaza -- places like Beirut and Tunis -- to inside the territories, where people have to deal with the real problems on the ground, "has produced a much greater pragmatism in Palestinian politics."
But the silence of the Palestinian silent majority is not only a reflection of assent, insists Khalil Shikaki, a leading political scientist at the Center For Palestine Research. "Repression by Arafat's security services also has been used to silence the opposition," he said. "Arafat's security services are creating a culture of doubt about what you can and cannot say. I am afraid we will duplicate the Arab regimes around us."
But this relative quiet, whether voluntary or forced, is based on the assumption that Mr. Peres will be re-elected and talks culminate in a Palestinian state of some kind. That is the light at the end of the tunnel that Palestinians are groping toward. If they discover that that light is instead a train coming at them -- in the form of a Likud government and more Jewish settlements -- then look out. If we have learned anything since 1967 it is that nothing in the West Bank is irreversible -- not Jordanian influence, not Israeli control, not Palestinian rejectionism and certainly, certainly, not quiet.

HEADLINE: Atlanta 1996: Olympic Profile;
For Czech Athlete, Payoff Is on Field

BYLINE: By SAMANTHA STEVENSON 

DATELINE: DEL MAR, Calif., May 21

 BODY:
They told the building manager they wanted the apartment for only six months, but Robert Zmelik and his fiancee were fighting a losing battle. They were from the former Czechoslovakia, the manager said, without employment. They could be drug dealers. Their application was turned down.
Then Zmelik pulled a shiny Olympic gold medal from his pocket. They got the apartment. 
 Olympic triumph has its benefits, and for Zmelik, the 1992 decathlon champion, the apartment north of downtown San Diego was one. But few other payoffs have come.Zmelik wasn't counting on the economic problems that struck when the Czechs and the Slovaks divided his homeland, and the money-making opportunities he envisioned in America never came for him.
Now, as he battles back from injuries and prepares to defend his title at the Summer Games in Atlanta, the man who once said, "First comes the gold medal, then comes the money," is driven by more than the pursuit of riches and fame.
"Czech is like this, and America is like this," Zmelik, 27, said in his halting English. "Maybe in dreams I make a million. Some guys have won the Olympics and finished with sports, and made millions and millions. Me, I won and I still compete."
"Robert still has the innocence in sports," said Durdam Rocherolle, a friend and aspiring decathlete Zmelik trains with. "Instead of saying, 'How can I make money everyday?' he says, 'How can I improve?' His sport is spiritual. He knows that things aren't always easy, and he only focuses on the positive."
It doesn't seem long ago that Zmelik won the 1992 Olympic decathlon in Barcelona, Spain. He finished with 8,611 points, comfortably ahead of Antonio Penalver of Spain, who had 8,412, and the United States' favorite, Dave Johnson, with 8,309.
But since then, multiple injuries have beset Zmelik, and last July he finished 13th at the world championships. In September, he fell on a tennis court, diving for a ball like his hero, Boris Becker, and tore two ligaments in his shoulder, nearly costing himself his career.
"I know he's been dealing with injuries," Dave Johnson said from his home outside of Los Angeles. "A couple of Americans called me after his meet last weekend in Italy. He posted 82 in the rain, which is an 85 in good weather. He's back, if he can stay healthy."
Johnson was referring to Zmelik's performance in his first pre-Olympic competition, a Multi-Star track evening in Desenzano, Italy. With a healed shoulder Zmelik amassed 8,232 points, which more than meets the Olympic requirement for points needed to compete in the decathlon and sets him in good position to be among the top three decathletes representing the Czechs in Atlanta. Zmelik trains on a track overlooking the Pacific Ocean, at the Shiley Sports and Health Center of Scripps Clinic, north of downtown San Diego. His schedule is monitored by Dean Brittenham, the Shiley director. Each day, Zmelik arrives at 9 A.M. to begin eight hours of training with his fiancee, Andrea Sollarova, a retired 3,000-meter runner from Slovakia, and Rocherolle.
"Robert is the favorite," said Brittenham, who works on speed and quickness with other Olympic athletes in track and field and volleyball. "I think he's the most powerful athlete I've ever worked with."
Brittenham and Rocherolle have tried to help Zmelik pay for his training. Rocherolle's parents have lent financial support, and Brittenham has received help from various companies. Zmelik has a contract with Reebok for shoes and clothing, but no agent, only well-meaning friends. He trains apart from the Czech federation. "Every athlete prepares alone," Zmelik said. "They help me with the shot-put and discus, how I look. The federation only cares how I compete."
Zmelik and Sollarova have kept their apartment in Prague, where they will return to be married after the Olympics.
Zmelik was born in the village of Ivan, in Moravia, a town of 1,000 people, that he describes as "like Idaho." His family members were good athletes, and his older brother, Vilem, inspired the 7-year-old Zmelik to compete in track and field. It was Bruce Jenner's success in the 1976 Montreal Olympics that set his mind on the decathalon.
As a teen-ager, Zmelik was sent to a sports boarding school, where he would become a part of the Czech federation men's team at age 17. "It was a very hard life," Zmelik said. "But after a few years, it was healthy for my life."
Zmelik believes he is still that small boy who got angry if he came in second. But, he refuses to talk about the marks he needs to win in Atlanta. "If I talk about what I want, I lose power," Zmelik said. "I know I will be better. We will see."

HEADLINE: France's Army Keeps Grip in African Ex-Colonies

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: LIBREVILLE, Gabon

 BODY:
Week in and week out for years, French sentries have manned the lookout towers at a military base here, and French soldiers have drilled behind high concrete walls topped with barbed wire.
Despite such vigilance, France's military outpost here, 3,300 miles from Paris, is not guarding some hostile border or protecting against a foreign threat. 
 Instead, to judge from the base's setting, hard against one of Africa's most extravagant presidential mansions, among Paris's top priorities here is protecting Gabon's autocratic leader, Omar Bongo, who was installed with French help in 1968.
With the end of the cold war, France has begun the difficult process of wrestling with the future size and shape of its large standing army. Earlier this year President Jacques Chirac announced sweeping reforms that would alter longstanding French deployments in Europe and gradually introduce an all-volunteer force.
Left unchanged, at least for now, however, are African commitments like these that date to independence 36 years ago. Besides Gabon, French troops are based in the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Senegal, Central African Republic, Chad, Djibouti and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.
In addition to the countries where it has troops, France has military cooperation agreements with Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Togo, Equatorial Guinea, Congo, Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi.
Since its 1964 intervention in Gabon, France has intervened militarily on the continent every other year on average. Paris has repeatedly sent troops into action in Chad, flown in paratroopers to rescue French and Belgian nationals in Zaire and help put down an insurrection there, and used its forces to replace political leaders in the Central African Republic.
[France said May 21 that it was trying to arrange a settlement to an army uprising in the Central African Republic, Reuters reported. French troops had been patrolling the capital, Bangui, at the Government's request, but most of the troops retreated to their bases, witnesses said, as fighting and looting continued.
[A French military plane flew out with 138 French nationals, and an American military plane was used to evacuate 13 Americans as American marines arrived to help. French troops were flown from Gabon and Chad to reinforce those already in the Central African Republic.]
In response to worried appeals by clients across the continent over rumors of an impending cutback of French troops, Mr. Chirac's Government pledged that Paris's military presence in Africa, totaling some 8,700 soldiers, would not be reduced.
If the announcement soothed Paris's main political allies , however, it has also stirred a public debate in Africa's increasingly free press and among opposition parties about France's mission on the continent.
Late last year, France's Minister for Foreign Assistance, Jacques Godfrain, explained the sense of his country's continuing military presence in Africa in terms of stabilizing democracies. Paris "will intervene each time an elected democratic power is overthrown by a coup d'etat if a military cooperation agreement exists," he said.
Given that France had never done such a thing and that most of its African-based troops are billeted in countries of dubious democratic credentials, Mr. Godfrain's remarks unleashed a storm of skeptical commentary throughout West and Central Africa.
The skepticism turned to derision when Niger's first democratically elected Government fell to a military coup in February. At the time, France, which has a defense treaty with Niger, said it regretted the development but would not intervene.
"What justifies this kind of presence?" asked an editorialist in the Ivory Coast daily Le Jour. "An external threat? Nothing could be less certain." For the Ivorian newspaper, and for commentators throughout this region, France's presence here has more to do with perpetuating Paris's predominance in an area that it has long considered its "natural" zone of influence.
"Only the African continent gives France the illusion of being a great power," another Ivorian editorialist wrote, under the headline "France Comes to the Rescue of Dictators," in response to Mr. Godfrain's remarks.
Some countries where French troops are stationed, like the Ivory Coast and Gabon, represent rich markets for France or, like Niger and Chad, are current or potentially important sources of strategic resources such as uranium and oil.
For many experts on African affairs, the history of France's military role in post-colonial Africa can be neatly condensed in the experience of Gabon, where Paris launched the first of many full-fledged interventions in 1964.
When Gabon's first President, Leon M'ba, was overthrown in a broadly popular military coup in 1964, French paratroopers were flown in to reinstate Mr. M'ba, whose devotion to France was legendary.
Mr. M'ba was soon weakened by illness, and by France's promotion of a young aide, Omar Bongo, to near figurehead status. Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser on Africa to the French President at the time, Charles de Gaulle, wrote in his memoirs that Paris literally auditioned Mr. Bongo for the role of head of state, which he assumed in 1968 upon Mr. M'ba's death.
Shortly after taking office, Mr. Bongo banned opposition parties in Gabon, and ruled unchallenged until a democratic reform movement began sweeping much of Africa in 1990. With his huge mansions throughout Gabon and around the world, diplomats say Mr. Bongo has used the country's large oil revenues to become one of the continent's wealthiest leaders.
Diplomats say corporations and businessmen from France, which retains an unusually high degree of influence here, even by the standards of its former colonies, have also done well by Gabon's oil-based economy.
To protect that investment, from their bases in Gabon, the 600 or so French troops here have intervened twice, in 1990 and 1994, to help put down civil disturbances directed against Mr. Bongo's rule.
A second wave of riots occurred after Mr. Bongo declared himself the winner of an election that international observers called "a very flawed exercise," with 51 percent of the vote.
These days, Mr. Bongo, who is also protected by Moroccan security units and privately hired former French military officers, never goes anywhere without first closing off nearby streets to traffic.
"There is no threat to Gabon other than the disaffection of the population towards its leader," said one Gabonese businessman who is sympathetic to the opposition. "When someone needs this kind of protection, that should tell you immediately that something is badly wrong."
For diplomats of other Western nations, France's high-profile security role in countries like Gabon has more to do with preserving Paris's privileged access to business opportunities than it does with questions of democracy.
"You could talk about the French presence for hours and hours, but it comes down to two things: prestige and business," said a Western diplomat here. "And they are absolutely determined not to let go of either."
Though more and more Africans have begun to openly criticize France leveraging its military presence and tight network of political ties in Africa to maintain a commercial grip on its foreign colonies, French officials have been frankly unapologetic.
"When we aid a country, we must have a minimum in return," said Bernard Debre, a former minister of foreign assistance, in an interview with the Paris-based magazine Jeune Afrique. "For France, Africa is also a market. Not a captive market, certainly, but not a sieve either."

New School Confers Tips And Degrees

 BODY:
A second day of record-breaking heat in New York could not dampen the spirits of the 904 graduates at the New School for Social Research's 60th commencement yesterday morning. Their spirits were helped in part by the setting, the cool sanctuary of Riverside Church.
The traditional solemnity of the opening ceremony and speeches was eventually eclipsed by cheers, photo flashes and screams that erupted from the church's balconies as the commencement progressed. 
 One student wore a miniature dressmaker's mannequin on her mortarboard. One doctoral student collected his diploma with a pipe in his mouth, and Florence Nkosinkulu from South Africa accepted her master's in human resources accompanied by her 3-week-old daughter.
The president of the New School, Jonathan F. Fanton, giving his 14th commencement speech, offered the graduates six "practical tips," beginning with "Do what you want to do; be what you want to be."
Among those receiving honorary degrees were United States Senator Claiborne Pell; Kitty Carlisle Hart, emeritus chairwoman of the New York State Council on the Arts; Ornette Coleman, the musician and composer, and Robert A. Dahl, emeritus professor of political science at Yale University. President Fanton said Ms. Hart and Mr. Coleman symbolized "the artistic standards" the graduates should aspire to.
Professor John Eatwell, chairman of the New School's economics department, referred to the ceremony as the "end of the beginning," as he encouraged students to be true to their intellectual inheritance, and reminded them that their education had equipped them with the capacity to change the poverty and unemployment that surrounded them.

HEADLINE: A Defensive McCaughey Ross On Offensive Against Accuser

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
First came reports of Gov. George E. Pataki's displeasure with her. Then came more open slights like the removal of her security detail. And now, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross is facing problems much closer to home -- a former housekeeper has accused her of harassment and of neglecting to pay some taxes on her wages.
Yesterday, the Lieutenant Governor called an unusual news conference at City Hall to declare: Enough already. 
 Ms. McCaughey Ross vehemently denied the housekeeper's charges and, in a flamboyant gesture, slammed $1.44 down onto a table, saying that was the total amount she owed in unemployment insurance payments to the State Department of Labor. Waving copies of state documents and canceled checks to prove that she had no past due payments and owed only $1.44, she said: "I'd like to pay that right now. Here it is. That's what I owe."
Ms. McCaughey Ross's problems with a former housekeeper, Erica Krstec, first surfaced on Monday when The New York Post ran a front-page headline proclaiming "Betsy Is a Bully." In The Post's article, Mrs. Krstec contended that Ms. McCaughey Ross had been verbally abusive to her and had left her stranded in Ms. McCaughey Ross's summer home in Southampton, L.I., without food or transportation. Mrs. Krstec also accused the Lieutenant Governor of not paying required taxes for her salary.
The Post also quoted from Labor Department documents that concluded that Ms. McCaughey Ross had not obtained a registration number from the agency, a necessary step before paying taxes for her employees. An obviously shaken Ms. McCaughey Ross said repeatedly yesterday that all those charges were untrue. "I have fully complied with all Federal and state regulations and tax requirements for my employees," she said.
She also released a letter from the State Department of Labor confirming she had registered as an employer of a domestic worker and had filed all required payments and reports. In her news conference, Ms. McCaughey Ross explained that she dismissed Mrs. Krstec after 10 months of employment because Mrs. Krstec had done a very poor job of supervising Ms. McCaughey Ross's children.
Ms. McCaughey Ross said that, on many occasions while Mrs. Krstec worked for her, she would get home late from work only to learn that Mrs. Krstec had no idea where her daughters were. On other occasions, Mrs. Krstec would tell her that she had allowed Ms. McCaughey Ross's daughters, now 12 and 14, to go to places Ms. McCaughey Ross felt were inappropriate.
"Not knowing where my children are late in the evening, an 11-year-old girl, hearing that she's been allowed to go to a pool hall or to areas of Central Park where drug addicts and drug dealers congregate," Ms. McCaughey Ross said. "Those are unsafe conditions for an 11-year-old girl and I think any mother listening or watching would agree with that."
The public battle is just the latest in a series of incidents that have made Ms. McCaughey Ross one of the most visible Lieutenant Governors in the state's history.
Mr. Pataki and Ms. McCaughey Ross have had a tense relationship for much of his administration. But the problems escalated earlier this year after The Post reported that Ms. McCaughey Ross was plotting to challenge Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Governor's friend and political mentor, in the 1998 Republican primary. Also this year, the Governor removed her state police security detail amid allegations that she had asked the troopers to run personal errands for her.
Ms. McCaughey Ross would not speculate on why the latest charges had emerged. "It would be unfair to point blame," she said. "I am concerned, though, about these anonymous charges referred to in The New York Post from State Labor Department officials. Once again, anonymous charges from members of state government that are untrue."

HEADLINE: In New Challenge to Peace Plan, Bosnia May Pull Out of Election

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 21

 BODY:
In a new challenge to the American-brokered peace in the former Yugoslavia, the Bosnian Government threatened today to withdraw from elections unless voting rules were drastically changed and NATO arrested the most prominent Serbian war criminals.
The elections, scheduled for Sept. 14, are intended to underpin a stable democracy here and allow the withdrawal of 60,000 NATO peacekeeping troops. But in an interview today, Ejup Ganic, the Vice President of the Muslim-led Government, said the elections would not be held unless Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb leaders indicted for genocide, were removed from power. He also insisted that voting rules be changed to prevent Serbs from gaining electoral control over Muslim towns and villages they seized in the war. 
 In a separate interview, the chief prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal broke a long public silence and warned that NATO's refusal to arrest the Bosnian Serb leaders threatened to undermine the precarious peace in the region. [Page A8.]
Vice President Ganic declared: "We will not participate in these elections unless the rules change. The danger of these elections, if they are not done correctly, is that they will verify ethnic cleansing. They will become a blueprint for how to ethnically expel people."
The elections are intended to play a central role in the reintegration of the Croat, Muslim and Serb entities that now make up Bosnia. Senior Bosian officials say that if the elections lock in the virtual ethnic partition of the country left by the war, renewed fighting is almost certain as displaced Muslims battle to regain their homes.
The need to begin preparing for elections has been the principal obsession of all parties in the civil war here, as well as the international officials trying to hammer this splintered country back together.
The Bosnian Serbs hope the elections will ratify their control over nearly half the country. The Muslim-dominated Government wants to use the elections to reassert control over all of Bosnia, and to hold the international overseers here to the stated goal of the Dayton accords, which is to preserve a unified country.
International officials, the United Nations and the United States all say they support the Dayton goal, but have so far been unwilling to risk conflict by removing Dr. Karadzic and Mr. Mladic, both indicted war criminals who under the accord cannot take part in political life.
The Bosnian Government raised its objections today with the Swiss Foreign Minister, Flavio Cotti, the chairman of the Organization of Security and Co-Operation in Europe, the body that must certify whether by July 14 conditions exist for free and fair elections. But the organization's officials said the Government did not hand them an ultimatum.
"The Bosnian Government expressed these issues as concerns," said Franaz Egle, the spokesman for the Swiss Foreign Ministry, "not as conditions which must be met before participating in the elections."
Still, Mr. Cotti and other outside officials have said they agree that fair elections are improbable with Dr. Karadzic still in power.
An American official in Washington acknowledged that the elections were "the most important element of implementing the peace plan." He interpreted Mr. Ganic's remarks as a bargaining tactic, adding, "I don't believe he's seriously contemplating following through with the threat."
Mr. Ganic, however, was emphatic in the interview today, conducted in English in the presidential offices, that his Government would find it impossible to take part in elections unless the changes took place. He said holding elections under the current conditions would be "obscene."
Bosnian Government officials said that free and fair elections would be impossible as long as Dr. Karadzic and Mr. Mladic remained in power, even behind the scenes.
The Government also worries that under somewhat ambiguous election rules, the Serbs might use large concentrations of Serbian refugees to win political control of local governments in traditionally Muslim towns that the Serbs won by force. The rules allow people to register to votein their former homes, or in places in which they now live. Thus Serbs who have moved into Muslims' homes in towns like Srebrenica, where Muslims were driven out and many were massacred, have a right to vote in those areas. In most cases the Serbs now outnumber the Muslims, making a Muslim return to power in such places impossible, even if absentee voters cast their ballots.
"Today Srebrenica is packed with Serbs from the Sarajevo suburbs and the Muslims are gone," said Mr. Ganic. "If the Serbs are allowed to vote in Srebrenica they will elect a Serb Mayor and a Serb city council. This will give the official stamp of approval to ethnic cleansing.
"The Serbs in places like Srebrenica should go and vote in the places they used to live, not in the villages and towns they took from Muslims and now occupy. Let them go back to the Sarajevo suburbs and elect a Serb Mayor."
But while officials of the Organization of Security and Co-Operation in Europe said they recognized the "contradiction" implicit in the voting procedures they also said that the Muslim-led Government had agreed to the rules, and that change at this stage was impossible.
"There was a long struggle over this issue," said Peter Burkhard, a Swiss official involved in the elections. He said the Bosnian Government had argued strongly in favor of requiring people to vote in the places they lived before the war broke out, but that the Serbs had argued for allowing people to choose, instead, to vote in places in which they were newly settled. But both parties agreed in April to the current procedures, he said.
By all accounts, many of the conditions set out by the Dayton agreement for free elections have not been met. They include freedom of movement for all people in Bosnia, free access by the opposition to news organizations, the establishment of independent news media, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and a return by refugees and the displaced to their prewar homes.
The Dayton agreement, while prohibiting Dr. Karadzic from running for office, does not stop him from being in power while elections take place. Officials of the Organization of Security and Co-Operation in Europe said it was conceivable that they would certify that conditions for elections were acceptable, although Dr. Karadzic remained in power.
The protest by the Bosnian Government comes on the heels of the failure by the international community, led by Carl Bildt, who is overseeing the carrying out of the peace plan, to push Dr. Karadzic out of office. Mr. Bildt and Western officials have asked the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosovic, to exert pressure on Dr. Karadzic to step down. And Western officials have threatened to withhold economic aid if Mr. Milosovic does not push the Bosnian Serb leader from power.
But so far Mr. Milosovic appears to have little interest in directly challenging Dr. Karadzic. Western diplomats said it seems he sees the September elections as the vehicle for sidelining Dr. Karadzic.
Dr. Karadzic, in a consolidation of his hold on power, recently removed more moderate leaders, who had worked with the international community, and replaced them with hard-line followers. He has also proposed holding a referendum, before the elections, to show the rest of the world that most Serbs support him. While such a referendum would not be recognized as valid by the international community, it might give Dr. Karadzic the ammunition he needs to sabotage the elections.

HEADLINE: Only the Amex Manages to Keep On Going

BYLINE: The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks retreated yesterday in a decline led by oil and computer companies.
Trading was restrained before and after a meeting by the Federal Reserve's policy makers, who, as expected, left short-term interest rates unchanged. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.56 points, to 5,736.26, ending a nine-session winning streak that added more than 325 points to the Dow. On Monday, the Dow jumped more than 61, setting its first record high since early April.
The American Stock Exchange rose to its fourth straight high, but most broad indicators finished lower. The Amex composite rose 2.87, to 612.23.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.39 point, to 672.76, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.69, to 1,244.42, ending a three-session string of new highs.
Bond prices edged lower after a report by Johnson Redbook on weekly retail sales showed surprising strength. Bond yields move in opposite directions from their prices, and the yield on 30-Year Treasuries -- a sensitive barometer of inflation fears -- rose to 6.85 percent from 6.83 percent on Monday.
The rise in interest rates helped spur some profit taking in stocks, said Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn.
"We're somewhat overbought," he said. "Looking back, we're up sharply in the last two weeks." He noted that the S.& P. 500 rose 5.5 percent in that period.
After leading Monday's rally on a sharp increase in crude oil prices, energy stocks led the market lower as investors took some profits.
The Dow's three oil issues were among the four biggest losers in the blue-chip average. Texaco fell 1 7/8, to 85; Chevron 1 1/2, to 60 1/2, and Exxon 1 1/8, to 86 1/8. They represented a combined loss of more than 14 points on the Dow.
Computer stocks also retreated. Microsoft lost 1 5/8, to 115 1/8; Cisco Systems 1 1/8, to 55 1/8, and Intel 3/4, 70 1/4.
Among individual issues, Wyndham Hotel, rose to 22 5/8 on its first day of trading, up from its initial offering of 16.
Gucci Group climbed 5 1/4, to 70 7/8, after the Italian company reported that sales nearly doubled in the first quarter.
Dayton Hudson surged 4, to 106, on better-than-expected first-quarter profits.
 Compuware jumped 6 5/8, to 37 1/8, after reporting a jump in quarterly earnings.
 Iomega closed at 43 3/8, up 21/16 , a day after the company annouced a 2-for-1 split.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, added 2 3/8, to 59; Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the company.
Republic Environmental Systems, surged more than 100 percent from 10 1/4, to 20 1/4. The stock jumped for the second straight day after news that Alliance Holding would merge its Century Surety Group with Republic in exchange for a 51 percent stake and options to buy 2.1 million more shares in the waste cleanup company.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Bill Would Extend Pensions in Small Business

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
House Republicans plan to pass legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier for small businesses to offer retirement savings plans for their 36 million workers. And in a break from decades of pension policy, the bill would let owners reap tax benefits for themselves even if their workers do not participate.
The retirement provisions are part of a $7.5 billion bill filled with changes sought by owners of small businesses to simplify tax, pension and other rules that bedevil companies with fewer than 100 workers. 
 For example, over seven years the bill would increase to $25,000 from $17,500 the value of equipment purchases that can be deducted immediately, instead of being depreciated over several years. The bill would also phase out tax breaks for companies that build factories in Puerto Rico and reinvest the profits on the island, using the increased revenues to offset the small business tax breaks.
These provisions will provide political cover for Republicans who oppose another aspect of the bill, increasing the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour over two years, to $5.15. Polls have shown that raising the minimum wage is widely popular despite concerns expressed by small-business owners and many economists that it would cost jobs.
Republicans, citing a rising public concern about retirement income and the safety of nest eggs, sought to focus attention today on changes to pension law.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the proposals would help workers in small business by "making it easier to get a secure pension and by providing increased security for existing retirement accounts." And he said all 120 million working Americans stood to benefit from one or more of the two dozen pension changes in the bill.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich called the bill "a watered down version of what President Clinton has already proposed." And he noted that it did not require accountants or other professionals who find indications that retirement savings are being embezzled to report their suspicions to the Government.
But the centerpiece of the bill is what the Republicans call a Simple pension plan for small businesses, which is short for "savings incentive match plan for employees."
Companies with fewer than 100 workers at any time during a year could create a sort of mini-401(k) plan in which workers could save up to $6,000, compared with $9,500 under existing 401(k) plans.
Existing 401(k)'s require expensive and complex tests comparing the contributions of highly paid and low-wage workers to insure that tax benefits do not flow only to the highly paid. In Simple plans, these tests would not be necessary if the employer either deposited 2 percent of each employee's pay into the employee's account or matched dollar-for-dollar the first 3 percent that employees saved. Employers who choose the matching option could reduce the match in two of every five years if they fell on hard times.
Under the bill, the owner of a small business could save $6,000 on tax-deferred basis and match the savings with another $6,000, even if none of his or her employees participated in the Simple plan.
A critic of existing pension laws, Karen Ferguson, co-author of "The Pension Book," called the bill "a radical departure from decades of pension policy requiring that lower-paid workers get benefits as a condition of owners and managers' getting tax breaks."
"This is shortsighted, crazy and foodhardy," she said.
Republican staff members said they were confident that millions of workers, even those earning modest wages, would leap at the chance to save money on a tax-advantaged basis for retirement, especially when their money would be matched by their employers.
Mr. Reich noted that the President's proposal would require small- business owners to contribute at least 1 percent of their workers' wages to a retirement savings plan before their own contributions could be tax-deferred.
Another provision of the bill would allow the one in six workers who are employed by nonprofit organizations to have 401(k) accounts. Currently, workers at nonprofit organizations are limited to less generous 403(b) plans.
The bill would also protect the assets of state and local government pension plans from creditors, putting them on the same footing as business and nonprofit pension plans. This provision was added in response to the bankruptcy filing by Orange County, Calif., which focused attention on the disparate treatment of government and business plans.
The bill would also protect truck drivers, carpenters and others who participate in pension plans paid for by groups of employers by making retirement benefits mandatory after five years, the same as the law requires of plans provided by a single employer.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Mixed As Fed Keeps Policy Steady

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were mixed in light trading yesterday as Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged, as expected.
Bond prices rose in early trading after a weekly report on retail sales showed weakness, but the price gains faded after another retail survey late in the day showed a sharp rise in sales. 
 Such conflicting reports have fostered uncertainty in the market about the direction of the economy and have bolstered expectations that the Fed will continue its present monetary policy until there is compelling evidence that economic growth is overheating.
"I don't think there is an economist on the Street who thought the Fed would move today," said Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist and director of research at Technical Data in Boston.
"There are crosscurrents in the data and in the economy as a whole and I imagine that was the subject of great deliberation at the meeting," she said, referring to the meeting of the Fed's policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee. "It has been difficult for the Fed to determine the underlying strength of the economy and the real risk of inflation."
The Fed announced around 2:15 P.M. yesterday that there would be no statement regarding the committee's meeting.
The announcement had little effect on the market. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 5/32 , to 8910/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.85 percent, from 6.83 percent on Monday.
A move by bondholders away from the long end of the market to the relatively safe haven of shorter maturities helped lower the rate on the six-month Treasury bill by a basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.10 percent. The rate on the one-year bill also fell by a basis point, to 5.25 percent.
The market received a lift early in the day after the Bank of Tokyo/ Mitsubishi Schroder reported that its index of chain-store sales had dropped 4 percent for the week ended Saturday. But the Johnson Redbook sales index, which was released in the afternoon, rose 6.1 percent from last month. That index had been expected to show a decline, and bonds immediately gave back some of the day's gains.
Some economists say they expect data later this year will show the economy is not as strong as some recent reports have indicated.
Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said the current quarter would be the strongest of the year, reflecting inventory buildup. By the second half of the year, he said, the data would begin to show that the economy was too soft.
"We've feasted on short stimulus from mortgage refinance, auto rebates and tax refunds, but all this is behind us now," Mr. Sohn said. "The market is just now beginning to realize this as evidenced by its tone."
Mr. Sohn said he expected that the Fed would not change monetary policy until later this year. Indeed, he expects that interest rates will decline. "The only question is will it be in the second half of 1996, or sometime in the first half of 1997," he said. The Fed will probably keep a low profile until after the elections in November, he said.
Ms. Kimelman of Technical Data said she expected the Fed to be reluctant to act on interest rates because of the election and because "the Fed may still have some egg on its face from the quick easing last December and January."
Robin Mesch, fixed-income-market analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said, "It looks like bonds will remain in consolidation for the rest of the week." In the futures market, she expects the June bond contract will trade lower at 10825/32 to 1091/32 as the market heads toward a long holiday weekend. At the close of trading yesterday, the June bond contract settled at 10919/32 .

HEADLINE: Time Is Changing The Model S.& L.;
Home Savings Pushes Ahead Into Full-Service Banking

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

DATELINE: ARCADIA, Calif.

 BODY:
The bright California sun filters through the stained-glass windows, creating a reverential mood in this cavernous edifice. Decorated with elaborate mosaics, bronze statues and lots of marble, it is a stolid temple of thrift -- one of many erected by Home Savings of America in affluent suburbs like this one, outside Los Angeles, in the years after World War II.
The ornate branches gathered enough of the growing wealth of Southern California to make Home Savings the nation's largest and in many ways most successful savings and loan. But on this spring afternoon, a slender banner dangling over a half-dozen tellers bears a simple announcement: "We now offer home equity, automotive, personal loans and credit lines." 
 This would hardly be worth noting nearly anywhere else. At Home Savings, though, it is no less than heresy.
Home Savings thrived for more than a century by largely sticking to a simple dogma: harbor the savings of people at or near retirement and funnel the money into home loans for young families. While other giant savings and loans were crashing into ruin, Home and its owner, H. F. Ahmanson & Company, returned even more devoutly to this regime five years ago after a modest but painful diversion into real estate development.
But with those losses and those caused by falling home prices largely behind it, Home is abandoning its creed. Charles R. Rinehart, the 49-year-old chairman of Ahmanson, wants to transform it into a full-service bank with loans, business accounts and the like. Indeed, it will finally add the word "bank" to its name -- probably becoming Home Savings Bank of America -- a decade after similar rechristenings at most other savings and loans.
Mr. Rinehart's goal: to refocus Home Savings on a low- to moderate-income clientele, acknowledging the demographic change in his own customers and, more generally, in California, as well as the competition for the affluent from the state's two giant banks -- Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
Home Savings, in short, has finally discovered that the savings and loan business is fundamentally an anachronism. Traditional savings and loan products -- savings accounts and mortgages -- are now offered on such good terms elsewhere that profits are meager at best. What is more, savings and loan clients are literally dying off: 45 percent of Home's deposits are in the hands of people over 65; their children send their savings to mutual funds.
Congress, meanwhile, is considering merging the savings and loan regulatory system with that for banks, although savings institutions can now offer almost all bank products.
Ahmanson, moreover, must adapt to the changing landscape here. No one expects a return of the surging real estate market that made mortgage lending virtually foolproof. And rising Asian and Hispanic immigration is changing many neighborhoods that Home Savings entered decades ago.
As the banner in Arcadia heralds, Home branches have started making personal loans, and Home has opened finance company offices to lend to an even less affluent population. New offices will be tiny storefront models. Sanctified spaces like the Arcadia branch may be divided, with corners rented out to a Kinkos copy center or a McDonald's Express.
Mr. Rinehart's heresies have not been universally appreciated among Ahmanson's directors or at its headquarters in Irwindale, a bleak patch of gravel pits and beer distributors. And that is why the full dimension of his vision is only now emerging, two years after he took over.
"There was a lot of internal debate," Mr. Rinehart acknowledges. "And in one sense the opponents were kind of right. The idea of getting into a business you don't understand is fraught with peril. But ultimately it became clear to everybody that the business we were in was not viable."
Mr. Rinehart's plan remains fraught with peril. Efficiency drives will mean laying off hundreds of longtime employees. Those who stay will have to adjust to a new regime that values profitability and sales targets, a far cry from the tradition of low-key service.
Even the president, Fredric J. Forster, quit in April in a disagreement about the new strategy. He was quickly replaced by Bruce G. Willison, the highly respected vice chairman of the First Interstate Bancorp, which has just been bought by Wells Fargo & Company.
Other savings and loans, including Great Western, California's second largest, have been trying for years to act more like banks, with mixed results. And Ahmanson is so big, and so late, that its transformation can only be more difficult.
In addition, even if Mr. Rinehart can eventually change Home Savings into more of a bank, he will hardly be home free. Most top banking companies also worry that their business is rapidly deteriorating.
"The best thing you can say about his company over the past few years is they stayed in business when two-thirds of their competitors didn't," said Joseph Jolson, a savings and loan analyst with Montgomery Securities. "Rinehart is a great guy -- young, energetic, open-minded. His problem is he inherited a $50 billion company that structurally has little profitability built in."
[For investors, Ahmanson has been a perpetual disappointment. Its stock hit its 10-year high of $28.625 in 1986, , and it closed at $25.75 on Tuesday, down 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.]
Mr. Jolson and some other analysts like the shares now not so much because of the likelihood of a rapid turnaround but because they see the stock as undervalued relative to other savings and loans. They also harbor a somewhat remote hope that it will be bought by a bank seeking to enter California.
The new plan may be a radical change for Ahmanson, but it is far less so for Mr. Rinehart, who before coming to Ahmanson was president of Avco Financial Services, a finance company owned by Textron, which serves lower-income customers.
An actuary by training, Mr. Rinehart has coldly analyzed Ahmanson's books and concluded that its current business will never earn a reasonable 15 percent return on shareholder equity, double its current level.
Nearly all of its $50 billion in assets are in adjustable-rate mortgages, a highly price-competitive market. Of those assets, the $20 billion backed by low-interest checking and savings accounts makes the profit target. But the remaining $30 billion, made with higher-interest certificates of deposits and money raised from institutional investors, earns barely 6 percent.
"We considered whether to stop originating mortgages altogether," Mr. Rinehart explained, allowing the portfolio to shrink slowly to the $20 billion Ahmanson can make money on. "We would have done that if we thought the mortgage business is hopeless. But we don't."
Instead, Ahmanson is spending $75 million to move its mortgage processing from 100 local offices into two central operations. With a sales force and network of appraisers working through laptop computers, it hopes to pare the cost of originating a mortgage from $3,000 to $1,000.
Ahmanson, wary of making mistakes, has slashed its lending volume to $6 billion this year, half its level five years ago. With thousands of jobs disrupted and many eliminated, Ahmanson has lost many seasoned loan officers. Moreover, Mr. Rinehart, building on his finance company background, wants credit officers to look at a borrower's finances, not just the home's value.
"As long as the collateral value was there, we didn't care about the owner," Mr. Rinehart said. "In the 80's, that worked because values were rising, but in a flat or down market, you will get slaughtered." The loans made in 1990 are still causing losses, with homes often selling for less than the mortgage balances.
Ultimately, Mr. Rinehart hopes to lift mortgage volume to as much as $25 billion, at least in good years. He wants to sell off three-quarters of the loans to investors, keeping on the books only those with higher risk, and thus higher interest rates --like those with down payments of only 5 to 10 percent.
Mr. Rinehart also plans to increase profits by making $5 billion in consumer loans by 2000, largely selling home equity, auto and other loans to deposit customers, half of whom borrow from other banks. He got a jump start by buying 61 First Interstate branches, flush with checking accounts and $500 million in business and consumer loans.
And he has started a finance company, similar to Avco and others, known as Home Consumer Finance of America. It will lend to people buying furniture and other goods through small offices in strip malls.
The albatross of Ahmanson's huge balance sheet actually helps the company here. Since it has so many low-risk mortgages on its books, Ahmanson can make high-risk consumer loans without setting aside much more capital as a reserve.
But getting these new businesses going will not be easy for a company whose staff has been accustomed to doing little more than opening savings accounts.
"It does help if the banker puts the name of the customer on the loan application," said William A. Barrett, the head of consumer lending, who said he has had to deal with myriad "horror stories" as loan products were introduced over the last year.
And now, to drive home the point that bank personnel have to sell these new products, a large part of their pay will be in the form of commissions earned only if they meet sales targets.
"We don't want the Bataan death march, where all the employees who don't want to sell are out," said Carl Forsythe, a former Banc One executive brought in last year to run Ahmanson's branches. "But employees will self-select out. They will say, Gee, the rules have changed and I can't keep up."
In Arcadia, the burden of keeping as many of Home Savings' bankers marching along has fallen to Brett Doty, the 26-year-old assistant branch manager, who joined last year.
"They came to me and said, 'You are going to be the change agent,' " said Mr. Doty, wearing a bright red T-shirt that read "Get Fiscally Fit." So he has been taking classes in "coaching" tellers and account officers, many of whom have been working the same way for more than a decade, to help their sales techniques.
"There has been resistance," he acknowledged. "Moving a company this size is like turning a battleship around."

 H. F. Ahmanson & Company, parent of Home Savings, is becoming more like a commercial bank, because it cannot earn an adequate return in its traditional business.

HEADLINE: 2 Big Retailers Exceed Earnings Estimates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Two of the nation's largest retailers, Dayton Hudson and Kmart, reported better-than-expected financial results yesterday for the first fiscal quarter.
Both chains cited lower expenses among the reasons for their surprisingly strong results. But to increase earnings in the future, retail-industry analysts said, both need to focus on improving their operations, not just cost-cutting. 
 "So they have cut costs, but if you don't get sales growth, what do you have?" said Otto Grote of Derby Securities. "They can't regain profitability just cutting costs forever."
At Dayton Hudson, the nation's fourth-largest retailer, earnings more than tripled on a rebound at its struggling Mervyn's chain of moderate-price stores and strong sales at its larger Target discount business.
The surprising turnaround at Mervyn's has more to do with the resurgent West Coast economy, analysts said, than Dayton Hudson's efforts to revamp the chain. California, where almost half of Mervyn's 297 stores are found, is adding jobs twice as fast as the rest of the country.
Kmart, the nation's third-largest retailer, attributed its narrower-than-expected loss to lower expenses. It pared expenses by $105 million in the quarter, largely because of store closings and the sale of its auto-service business.
Dayton Hudson, based in Minneapolis, reported net income of $41 million, or 50 cents a share, well above the 40-cent estimate of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. A year earlier, it earned $11 million, or 10 cents a share.
Sales for the quarter, which ended on May 4, climbed 13 percent, to $5.38 billion from $4.76 billion, largely on strong results from its Target chain of 688 stores. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 7 percent.
Mervyn's increased operating profit to $39 million from $1 million in 1995 on lower marketing and headquarters costs. Sales rose 6 percent; same-store sales were up 3 percent.
At Target, the third-largest discount chain, operating profit rose 37 percent as it put less merchandise on sale. Revenue gained 18 percent.
At the department-store division, operating profit declined to $28 million from $38 million. Sales at the 64 stores -- which include Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field -- were little changed from last year, and same-store sales dropped 1 percent.
"We should not forget the company is about where it was two years ago," said Saul Yaari of Piper Jaffray. "All they're doing is recapturing the ground they lost last year."
Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., said its loss from continuing operations narrowed to $38 million, or 8 cents a share, from $109 million, or 24 cents, in the first quarter a year earlier.
The discount retailer had been expected to post a loss of 10 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by IBES International.
In the most recent quarter, a charge of $61 million, or 13 cents a share, for the sale of part of its stake in Thrifty Payless Holdings, a big drugstore chain, resulted in a final loss of $99 million, or 21 cents.
A year earlier, a gain of $84 million from freezing its pension plan and a loss from discontinued operations of $3 million led to a final loss of $28 million, or 6 cents a share.
Sales in the quarter ended May 1 increased 1.8 percent, to $7.58 billion from $7.44 billion. Same-store sales rose 4.5 percent.
At the company's annual meeting in Detroit, its chairman, Floyd Hall, said cost savings should show a "pretty significant" improvement in coming quarters.
Kmart's American discount stores posted an operating profit of $58 million, compared with an operating loss a year earlier of $38 million, not including a $124 million gain from freezing pensions.
Kmart said preliminary votes showed that investors supported the company's recommendations on stockholder proposals, including three from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
The unions sought to require the election of all directors every year and to eliminate director retirement plans. The third proposal called on Kmart to study a possible sale or merger of the company.
The unions said their proposal on director elections had received widespread support and appeared to be ahead. Final vote totals will not be known for as long as two weeks.

The Atlanta airport is being all spruced up for this summer's Olympics, and beyond.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
HARTSFIELD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT in Atlanta and Delta Air Lines, its biggest tenant, are spending millions on improvements before the Summer Olympics -- changes that will also make life easier for travelers long after the Olympics have gone.
Delta, the official carrier of the games, is investing $45 million in new ticket counters and furnishings, more baggage-claim equipment, a separate underground pedestrian mall linking concourses C and B, and moving Atlantic Southeast Airlines, its regional carrier, closer to Delta's domestic concourse. 
 The airport is spending about $250 million to add escalators, new concession areas, security checkpoints and roving translators at its new international concourse. The interterminal rail transit system is getting new cars and passengers on the system will soon hear a human voice instead of the current computer-generated "voice" (named Hal, after the talking computer in the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey)." The new voice -- its human source has not yet been disclosed -- was chosen by two focus groups of travelers who frequently use Hartsfield.
Airport officials say the new voice will be more friendly and its messages less confusing, especially to foreign travelers. For example, many foreigners regard the word "stop" as a synonym for "halt," but not as meaning the next "stop" on the train. They also have trouble with the warning, over the speaker system and on the outside of trains: "Caution. Doors do not rebound or spring back." That warning has also confused multitudes of Americans. The new warning will simply say: "Caution. Doors do not reopen."
 
Luring Georgians Southward
Speaking of Atlanta, some Georgians are miffed that Florida has blanketed the Atlanta area with 60 billboards aimed at drivers frustrated by the traffic jams caused by Olympic-related construction. The billboards urge them to "Return to Your Senses in Florida." The billboards promote Florida's own "Summer Games," which include beach ball and working on a tan. Charles Dusseau, Florida's Commerce Secretary, said, "We just want to remind folks that when the going gets tough, the tough take a trip -- to Florida."
 
Lodging Inflation
No, it is not your imagination, you really are paying more for a hotel room this year -- 5.4 percent more than last year, for a total bill of $71.08 a night on average, according to Coopers & Lybrand. Hotel profits should reach $9.9 billion this year, Coopers & Lybrand said, about $2 billion more than in 1995 and the third consecutive year of record profits.
 
Waldorf Towers Joins a Club
Many road warriors who check into the Waldorf Towers in New York assume that they have checked into an annex of the Waldorf-Astoria: the Towers have sat atop the Waldorf-Astoria since the hotel was built in 1931, occupying floors 28 through 42. The Towers has its own entrance, own registration desk and own express elevator, but it and the Waldorf-Astoria have the same owner-operator -- the Hilton Hotels Corporation.
But unlike the Waldorf-Astoria, the Waldorf Towers recently joined the Leading Hotels of the World, a group of 300 luxury properties worldwide that have joined in reservations and marketing services. "We wanted the Waldorf Towers to be marketed with similar upscale properties on a global basis," Ron Drake, marketing director for the Waldorf Towers, said.
Hilton, based in Los Angeles, is predominantly a domestic hotel company. Most Hilton hotels outside the United States are Hilton International properties, owned since 1987 by the Ladbroke Group in London.
 
How Tips Are Really Figured
A study by researchers at Cornell University and the University of Houston found little relationship between the size of a tip and the quality of service from a waiter or waitress. The tip, they found, is influenced largely by the amount of the bill and the fear of disappointing the server.
The implication, the researchers say, is that there may be little incentive to provide good service. In fact, they concluded, waiters and waitresses might be tempted to rush their tables so that more diners could be served. That could lead to more tips, but could also create a less pleasant dining experience.

 BODY:

Simple Pensions Planned For Small Businesses
Small businesses could more easily offer retirement savings plans for their 36 million workers under a bill that House Republicans plan to approve today.
In a break from decades of pension policy, the bill would allow business owners to take advantage of tax-deferred retirement plans, even if no workers participate. The bill also calls for a 90-cent-an-hour rise in the minimum wage, to $5.15, over two years. [Page D2.]
 
House Votes to Repeal Gas Tax
The House of Representatives, spurred by public clamoring over a steep rise in gasoline prices, voted to repeal the 4.3 cents-a-gallon Federal excise tax on gasoline. The Senate is expected to approve it and President Clinton has said he will sign it. [A15.]
 
Accountants Tilt With Levitt
The accounting profession, through the Financial Accounting Foundation, is tilting with Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C., in a battle over who sets accounting standards. Mr. Levitt wants half the foundation's directors to have no stake in its decisions. [D2.]
 
Fed Leaves Rate Policy Unchanged
The Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged, as expected. Treasury securities prices were mixed in light trading. [D15.]
 
Stock Prices Decline; Oil Shares Off
Pulled down by oil stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.56 to 5,736.26, ending a nine-session winning streak. The Nasdaq composite slipped 3.69 to 1,244.42. [D8.]
 
A Dream for Once-Sleepy Diana?
The stock of Diana Corporation, once a sleepy distributor of meat and seafood, has zoomed from less than $5 a share to a high of $91 since it acquired an 80 percent stake in a technology company called Sattel Communications. But insiders at Sattel have been sellers. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D8.]
 
Russian Fund to Settle With S.E.C.
A Moscow-based fund, Russ-Invest, has agreed to settle S.E.C. charges that it offered Americans unregistered securities. [D4.]
 
Nations Air Quits Scheduled Flights
Nations Air, a small airline that served Boston, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, is halting scheduled service and laying off a third of its staff to go into the charter business. The founder, Mark W. McDonald, cited a drop in passengers following Valujet's crash. [A12.]
 
Retail Results Exceed Forecasts
Dayton Hudson and Kmart, reported better-than-expected financial results, citing cost-cutting efforts. Dayton's earnings more than tripled to $41 million, while Kmart had a narrower-than-expected $38 million loss. [D5.]

He will help peddle Adidas U.S.A.'s newest line of sneakers for an few hundred thousand dollars the company finds "affordable." [B9.]
 
Viacom to Retain Spelling Stake
Viacom dropped a plan to sell its 75 percent stake in the Spelling Entertainment Group, the television production company. Analysts said Viacom wanted $750 million to $1 billion. [D3.]
 
Broadcast Networks' Tough Sale
The four broadcast TV networks are scrambling to sell commercial time in advance of the coming season. But with competition from cable, matching the $5.6 billion sold before the 1995-96 season will be tough. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D3.]

CORRECTION-DATE: May 23, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the Business Digest yesterday, referring to a Market Place column about the stock of the Diana Corporation and the company's ownership of an 80 percent stake in the Sattel Communications Company, misstated the details of a stock sale by Sattel Technologies. As the column reported, Sattel Technologies recently reduced its stake in Sattel Communications to 5 percent from 20 percent, selling the 15 percent stake to the management of Sattel Communications; no insiders in either company sold stock in Diana.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
German Banker's Remark Lifts The Dollar to a 16-Month High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a 16-month high against the mark yesterday after a German central bank official suggested that a weaker mark could help the nation's sagging economy.
A higher dollar "would have benefits," said Olaf Sievert, a member of the Bundesbank's interest rate-setting council. He said he had "no fear" that German inflation would accelerate if the dollar rose "a couple of pfennigs." A pfennig is a hundredth of a mark. 
 Mr. Sievert predicted that the Bundesbank would make further cuts in an important German money market rate, the rate on 14-day securities repurchase agreements. Lower interest rates tend to hurt a currency by making bank deposits and investments denominated in it less attractive.
The German central banker's remarks were made on the same day that the Federal Reserve, as expected, left United States interest rates unchanged.
Peter Wadkins, manager of interbank currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank, observed: "We are looking at comments from the Bundesbank that a stronger dollar helps and that there is potential for lower rates there again. That gave us the impetus for a higher dollar."
The dollar also benefited from remarks by the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence H. Summers, that the United States would "prefer a strong dollar" as well as from a call by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis of France for the dollar to rise further against other major currencies.
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose as high as 1.5450 marks, its highest level since January 1995. It settled at 1.5425 marks, up from 1.5343 on Monday. The dollar traded at 107.18 yen, up from 107.08 yen. The British pound declined to $1.5110 from $1.5135.
The dollar also posted strong gains against the Swiss and French francs, rising to 1.2701 Swiss francs, from 1.2615 francs on Monday, and to 5.2220 French francs from 5.1945.
A weaker mark could help bolster Germany's stagnant economy by making its exports cheaper in foreign-currency terms. Conversely, the dollar, since falling to a postwar low of 1.3455 marks in March 1995, has appreciated almost 15 percent against the mark.
"The Bundesbank has to ease the big noose over the German economy: the strong mark," said Michael Perelstein, managing director for international investments at the MacKay Shields Financial Corporation.

HEADLINE: GOVERNORS' PLAN TO REFIT MEDICAID STARTS TO ERODE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The bipartisan consensus among the nation's governors on Medicaid and welfare, announced with much fanfare in February, appears to be crumbling, reducing chances that the programs will actually be overhauled in this election year.
On Wednesday, Republicans in Congress will introduce a bill to carry out recommendations of the National Governors' Association, which were praised 15 weeks ago by President Clinton and many members of Congress as a possible basis for compromise. 
 But in separate interviews over the last week and at a breakfast meeting with journalists today, three Democratic Governors -- Bob Miller of Nevada, Roy Romer of Colorado and Howard Dean of Vermont -- said the Republicans on Capitol Hill had upset the delicate compromise endorsed by all governors in February.
They said the Republicans were using the bipartisan mantle of the National Governors' Association to cloak a partisan initiative, intended to give President Clinton a bill he would veto.
"Congress has taken the 'bi' out of the word bipartisanship," said Mr. Miller, a moderate Democrat who is vice chairman of the National Governors' Association.
Mr. Dean said that "a right-wing majority in Congress" had drafted legislation that would eliminate the individual entitlement to health care under Medicaid and make substantial cuts in cash assistance for poor families. Mr. Dean said the Republicans would push this legislation through Congress "for the purpose of forcing the President to veto it" a few months before Election Day.
Governor Romer said, "It's obvious the Republicans want to give him a bill he can't sign." Mr. Romer described this as "a pure political strategy" to embarrass Mr. Clinton, who has twice vetoed welfare legislation in the last six months.
Republicans in Congress said their bill generally followed the governors' recommendations. They said it gave the governors at least 75 percent of what they wanted on welfare and more than 90 percent of what they sought on Medicaid.
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a Republican, said the differing reactions of Republican and Democratic governors were "driven by the politics of the moment." In an interview, he predicted: "Republicans will say this looks pretty close to the governors' proposal. Democrats will say, 'That's not what we agreed to.' "
Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who heads the Commerce Committee, said tonight: "Our Medicaid reform plan meets the governors' objectives. It guarantees health care for the most vulnerable Americans, brings Medicaid spending under control, gives the states maximum flexibility and protects state taxpayers from unanticipated costs that might be caused by changing demographics, economic downturns and natural disasters."
Mr. Clinton has criticized the Republican Medicaid proposals more forcefully than the welfare proposals, and Republicans in Congress insist that the two be linked in one bill. Democratic governors said they had never agreed to such linkage.
The Democratic Governors voiced three other objections:
*Republicans in Congress, in keeping with their new budget blueprint, would cut projected welfare spending more than the proposal of the National Governors' Association. Savings would total $53 billion over six years, as against $43 billion.
*The governors' proposal was developed through months of bipartisan negotiations, but Democratic members of Congress and their aides were excluded from the process of writing the legislation. "There has been no Democratic participation or inclusion," Mr. Miller said.
*Congressional Republicans are not using the exact formula recommended by the governors' association for distributing Medicaid money to the states.
Mr. Romer said this change "knocks the whole negotiation in a cocked hat," because "the formula is the key" to the success of any Medicaid proposal. Medicaid accounts for more than 19 percent of all state spending and is the fastest-growing item in many state budgets.
In short, Governor Dean said, "It's very unlikely there will be any consensus in the National Governors' Association" on this legislation. "We'll end up agreeing to disagree on Medicaid and welfare," he said.
In policies adopted on Feb. 6, the governors' association recommended huge changes in Medicaid and welfare that would have shifted large amounts of money and decision-making power to the states. On many points, they split the difference between entitlements and block grants, giving states more flexibility but preserving Federal guarantees for the needy. Mr. Clinton has said he wants to preserve Medicaid as an entitlement, available to all who meet Federal and state eligibility criteria.
Medicaid and welfare serve more than 36 million people, at a combined Federal cost of $114 billion this year. Medicaid is, by far, the larger program.
Republicans in the Senate and the House worked together in drafting the new Medicaid-welfare bill. They tried to address some of the criticism directed at the governors' proposals by child-welfare advocates. For example, Republicans said their bill would eventually allow states, as an option, to obtain Federal money to finance health care for poor children from the age of 13 through 18.
The governors' proposal would have guaranteed Medicaid for poor children through the age of 12. But it would, in effect, have repealed a 1990 law that eventually guarantees coverage for youngsters 13 through 18.
In addition, Republicans said they would go beyond the governors' proposal by allowing states to provide Medicaid coverage for disabled people and elderly people who do not qualify for Supplemental Security Income, but incur large medical expenses. Supplemental Security Income is a cash assistance program for the aged, blind and disabled.

HEADLINE: Wacky World of Russian Politics: It's All in the Altered Genes

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 22

 BODY:
At a news conference billed as the outlining of the Communist Party's definitive economic program, the economist in charge of formulating it instead spoke spookily this week about attempts by the Yeltsin campaign to tamper with the Russian gene pool.
"It's an attempt to modify the genetic code of ethnic Russians who represent the core of the citizens of Russia, rather than what seems to look like persuasion," the economist, Tatyana I. Karyagina, said. She was apparently alluding to the mass media she said were working on behalf of President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 She went on to discuss the ways in which the subconscious of voters was being "violated" though their genetic codes, potentially leading to "schizophrenia of society."
Mrs. Karyagina did not reveal much about the party's specific proposals to redress the economic crisis in Russia. But her rambling, at times bizarre, news conference on Tuesday spoke volumes about the party's internal confusion over how -- and whether -- to present an economic program before the presidential election next month.
Her presentation was also emblematic of the confusion and disarray that now afflict the Communist campaign.
The Communist team led by Gennadi A. Zyuganov, which a few weeks ago was fiercely attacking the policies of President Yeltsin, is now on the defensive. It is fending off questions about its economic program, as well as reports of internal dissension within the Communist Party, and leaks of contentious remarks made privately at a party meeting last weekend that have been reported in many of the country's leading newspapers.
Today Mr. Zyuganov did not deny a report that a party member stood up at the closed meeting and asked him to rid the Russian Government of "non-Russians and non-Christians." He said members are entitled to their own views, and instead complained that the party meeting must have been secretly recorded.
"Is it that bugs are being planted, depriving us of a possibility to calmly carry out our discussions?" he asked.
He likened the situation to Watergate, saying, "When elections were held in the United States and the opponents of the Democratic Party installed bugs in their headquarters, it cost President Nixon his job."
As polls show Mr. Yeltsin gaining against his Communist opponent, the Zyuganov campaign has begun loudly proclaiming that the Yeltsin campaign is planning to rig the election results.
"I think the results of the election will in simple terms be falsified," Viktor Ilyukin, a Communist leader and chairman of the security committee in Parliament, said today. "I think the President will not be elected, he will be named."
Anxiety over its current standing has caused the Zyuganov campaign to rethink its strategy.
Stepping back from earlier promises that the campaign would soon disclose a definitive economic program, Communist Party leaders said today that the campaign was still working out a broad "conceptual" outline, which may be issued in the next few days.
Mr. Zyuganov and his advisers have been hammered in recent weeks in press articles criticizing the Communist economic program on the basis of parliamentary draft laws and press leaks. Party leaders have therefore apparently concluded that any effort to produce a concrete plan for reversing economic reform and restoring state control of the economy would only benefit Mr. Yeltsin.

Oil Prices Surge After a Report Showing Low U.S. Inventories

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices surged yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a report showed that United States inventories fell to 19-year lows last week, heightening concern that rising demand around the world would continue to keep supplies tight.
On other markets, corn prices fell while copper rose. 
 After the oil market closed on Tueday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stockpiles in the United States fell 4.54 million barrels last week, to 295.2 million barrels, the lowest since 1977. Imports fell by 10 percent and consumption held steady, the institute said.
The drop came even as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries produced 26 million barrels of crude a day, more than their 24.52-million-barrel-a-day output ceiling and the highest rate in 16 years.
"The A.P.I. numbers for crude were pretty darn good," said John Saucer, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc. "The inventory situation is a problem and the high levels of OPEC production have done little to change that."
Crude oil for July delivery soared 77 cents, to $21.40 a barrel.
Traders also said that comments by Gen. J. H. Binford Peay 3d, the head of the United States Central Command, regarding Iran's military buildup helped push prices higher. General Peay was quoted by Jane's Defense Weekly, a London-based magazine, as saying that Iran's weapons programs far exceed its military needs. His comments raised traders' concerns that Iran could disrupt oil production or shipping in the Persian Gulf.
"Any time there is possibility of unrest in the Middle East the market goes up," said Lee Taylor, a broker at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
Corn prices fell as more warm, dry weather in Midwestern crop regions dried fields for spring planting and spurred development of this year's crop.
July corn fell 14.75 cents, to $4.865 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest since May 10.
Copper rose for a second day, rebounding from a five-month low, as falling stockpiles in United States warehouses indicate stronger demand from manufacturers.
Copper for July delivery rose 2 cents, to $1.1355 a pound at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
German Money Report Leaves Traders Puzzled, Dollar Static

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished little changed against major currencies yesterday after new German economic data failed to give any hints about the direction of interest rates.
The dollar narrowly rose against the mark while slipping against the Japanese yen. 
 Currency traders have looked to German money-supply data and to a business-sentiment survey yesterday for insights into whether German monetary officials would reduce more interest rates.
When the data pointed to mild German inflation, traders squared their positions in advance of the long Memorial Day weekend in the United States.
"We were hoping for some guidance and inspiration, and unfortunately we didn't get it," said Lisa Finstrom, a senior currency analyst at Smith Barney. "The main event of the day was another nonevent."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.5428 marks from 1.5425 marks on Tuesday. The dollar slipped to 107.03 yen, from 107.18 yen. The British pound traded at $1.5086, down from $1.5110.
The broadest measure of the German money supply was expected to have slowed in April and begin approaching German central bank growth targets of 4 to 7 percent.
Although the market expected double-digit money supply growth, it was disappointed by the increase for April against 1995's fourth quarter -- a reduced rate of 11.2 percent. While this was lower than the growth in March, it was not at all close to Bundesbank targets.
Also released yesterday was a report on business sentiment in Germany from the Ifo Institute for Economic Research. The institute reported that sentiment improved in western Germany -- to a rating of 91.1 in April from 90.4 in March, and in eastern Germany to 103.1 in April from 100.5 in March.
The report seemed to contradict Government data released on Tuesday showing two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, which by some standards constitutes a recession.
But to offset the weak economy, the central bank was expected to lower interest rates to spur lending and growth. "Bundesbank officials have come out and said there will room for an ease, but people are not sure about this," Ms. Finstrom said.

Agencies use zippy Dr. Seuss-style rhymes and comics to sell Ford Escorts and Mercury Tracers.

BYLINE: By Robyn Meredith 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE agencies helping to introduce two redesigned small cars for the Ford Motor Company are borrowing techniques from children's books and comic strips to convince buyers the cars are more than mere "econoboxes."
The cars, the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer, which officially go on sale today as 1997 models, are intended to compete with the Dodge Neon, Honda Civic and Saturn sedans. The Escort ads, by the J. Walter Thompson Detroit unit of the WPP Group, use Dr. Seuss-style rhymes to play up the features found in the revamped car. 
 Television commercials began running Sunday and will appear frequently for three weeks. They will be followed by print ads that use the rhymes, bright colors and even the actors from the commercials.
The Detroit office of Young & Rubicam Inc. is taking an innovative approach to selling the Tracer. Radio will be the primary ad venue -- making the Tracer, its marketers say, the first car introduced by a Big Three auto maker without TV spots since before the television era. Themes from the radio commercials will be picked up in print ads, which use comic-strip panels and trumpet "As seen on radio."
The Escort and Tracer are nearly identical, but are marketed by different Ford divisions and are trying to reach different audiences. Ford is trying to attract 20-something buyers to the Escort, while Mercury is aiming at couples, perhaps in their early 30's, for the Tracer.
Though the Escort is Ford's second-cheapest model after the bare-bones Ford Aspire, the average age of its buyers is 37, said Randy C. Stewart, Escort's brand manager. In the past, the Escort appealed mostly to the wallets of drivers. "It was positioned as an econobox," Mr. Stewart said.
The redesigned 1997 Escort will still appeal to the thrifty -- the cheapest model, at $11,430, costs $500 less than the 1996 version. But Thompson Detroit used the rhymes to promote the features that were added to appeal to the younger consumers.
"We didn't want to get into a laundry list of the improvements," said Kurt J. Schneider, the partner at Thompson Detroit who managed the Escort account, "so we kind of worked them into the rhyme."
In one spot, a young couple consider the car as an announcer begins an extended ode: "This is Ford Escort. It's new and it's nifty. It's made for the smart, the intelligent thrifty." Images appear of the dual air bags and the rear seat that folds down to expand the trunk area.
At the end, the commercial invites buyers to drive the Escort. It signs off with, "We've given you every rhyme, and rhymed every reason." According to Competitive Media Reporting in New York, which tracks advertising spending, Ford spent $28 million last year on Escort ads. This year, Mr. Stewart said, Ford will spend three or four times more.
Mercury is taking a different approach to selling the Tracer. Donald D. Williams, who oversees Y.& R. Detroit's work for Mercury, explained that in a typical auto campaign advertisers look for "a medium that provides a visual image of a car."
But Y.& R. Detroit chose radio for Tracer because consumers "don't see the exterior of small cars as being highly differentiated," he added. Indeed, the redesigned Tracer and Escort look like other small sedans.
Dale L. Jones, marketing communications manager for Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division, said that the ads for Tracer, which begin today, will run in especially heavy rotation in markets like Baltimore, Los Angeles, New York and Washington.
The zippy ads use fanciful scenarios to describe various Tracer attributes. In one, an announcer says he is strapped to the top of a Tracer atop the Parthenon in Greece, while the driver listens to the car's optional six-disk CD changer play the theme from "Zorba the Greek."
"As we drive down the 537 steps, Tracer's solid body construction and quadra-link suspension helps smooth out the bumps while Zorba barely misses a beat," the announcer says. "Now, if the Mercury Tracer can handle the steps of the Parthenon, imagine it handling something even more timeless, like potholes."
Colorful print ads recreate the radio spots using a comic-strip format. The campaign carries the theme "The small car that thinks big."
Because the Tracer campaign excludes television, it is relatively inexpensive for the introduction of a redesigned car. Mercury spent about $13 million in the last two years promoting the Tracer, according to Competitive Media Reporting; plans call for spending at least that much this year on the radio and print ads.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Jump In Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday, but light trading exaggerated the gains.
With a lack of fresh economic data, the impetus for buying yesterday came from the Treasury's announcement outlining next week's auctions of new two-year and five-year notes. The size of the auctions will be much smaller than what many traders had been expecting, and the announcement helped ease concerns about the market's ability to absorb new supply. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32, to 89 23/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.81 percent, from 6.85 percent on Tuesday.
But trading was light yesterday as the market approached a long holiday weekend. The Public Securities Association, a trade group that represents securities firms, has recommended that the Treasury market close early tomorrow, at 2 P.M. The market will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.
Many major institutional investors, like hedge funds and portfolio managers, remained on the sidelines yesterday, leaving trading to the dealers and day participants, who turned largely to price and chart analysis as a guide to their positioning in the market.
Market participants had been anticipating that the Treasury would announce plans to sell some $19.2 billion of two-year notes and some $13 billion in five-year notes. They were pleasantly surprised when the Treasury said it would sell $18.75 billion of two-year notes on Wednesday and $12.5 billion of five-year notes on Thursday. Fewer notes available typically bolster prices.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 6.02 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.39 percent.
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd., said the Treasury's announcement gave the market an excuse to remove excess short positions before the long weekend.
Mr. Bleier said the recent positive tone to the market had been dictated by moderate growth, low inflation and faith in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
But market concern that strong producer prices will filter down to the consumer level has caused yields to take the path of least resistance. "So far we've had a number of scares, "with strong gains in grains, commodities and oil prices which are producer-oriented staples," he said. "But the most recent consumer report shows those increases have not filtered through in any major way. So, the whole thought of price stability at the consumer level remains intact."
Mr. Bleier said the yield on the long bond was on the way down to test the 6.50 percent to 6.625 percent level. "Next week, coming economic data will give us a gauge to the course of interest rates the next three months," he said.
In the futures market, which can affect the Treasury cash market, the June bond contract is approaching a pivotal level, said Robin Mesch, fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research in Boston. "Long term, if bonds can sustain a rally above a 110 16/32 to 110 17/32, then a move toward 112 should get under way," she said. The June bond contract settled at 110 5/32, up 19/32.

HEADLINE: Donations to Charities Rose 11% Last Year, Report Says

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Buoyed by a stronger economy, charitable donations jumped nearly 11 percent last year to $143.9 billion, the biggest increase since 1986, according to a report released yesterday. After inflation, the real increase was 7.8 percent, also the largest gain in a decade.
"People had the wherewithal to give," said Nancy Raybin, chairwoman of the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy, an arm of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. The figures were included in the trust's annual report, Giving USA. 
 Not all charities gained equally, however. Donations to human service groups fell slightly to $11.7 billion, for a decline of 3 percent after inflation. The category includes disaster relief agencies like the Red Cross, as well as human services like youth and family programs and housing and employment agencies.
Total donations to this category often surge in years when there are bad earthquakes, floods or other disasters, and fall in less eventful years. These groups also had a sizable decline in donations in 1994, when they received the lowest dollar amount in inflation-adjusted terms since 1982.
Arts, culture and humanities groups, already faced with cuts in government support, also fared relatively poorly in charitable giving last year. Private giving to these groups rose less than 3 percent, to $10 billion, and was virtually flat after inflation.
"People have had to respond to what the perceived as the most urgent needs," said Stanley Katz, president of the American Council of Learned Societies. "It's a terrible problem, particularly in my neck of the woods."
The group showing the biggest gains was public and society benefit philanthropies, a category that includes research and public policy organizations, community development and advocacy organizations, and charities that collect goods for other charities. Giving to this group rose by 17 percent overall, to $7 billion, for a gain of 14 percent after inflation.
Environmental and wildlife groups also showed strong gains for the second year in a row, with donations growing by 13 percent to $4 billion, for an increase of 10 percent after inflation.
Other types of groups that had smaller real gains included religion (2.5 percent), education (5 percent) and health (6.2 percent). International affairs groups had an overall decline of 9 percent after inflation.
Living individuals provided most of the charitable giving last year -- $116 billion, or 81 percent. About $10 billion, or 7 percent, came as bequests. Foundations gave $10 billion and corporations gave $7 billion last year. Corporate and foundation giving grew 8 percent last year, somewhat lower than the 11 percent growth in individual giving.
Despite continued worries about corporate downsizing and job losses, Americans generally felt comfortable enough to make charitable donations. Ms. Raybin noted that personal income grew 6 percent last year, the fastest rate since the 1990-91 recession.
Congressional discussions about changes in the tax law that would have made charitable giving less useful for cutting personal taxes probably also prompted people to speed up donations they otherwise would have made later, said Ms. Raybin, who is president of Raybin Associates, a fund-raising and management consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn.
She and others at the fund-raising association also say fund raisers worked harder last year to raise money in the face of threatened government budget cuts.
Concerns that the trial of United Way of America's former chief executive and the fraud by the New Era for Philanthropy might curtail giving seem not to have been realized, although organizations like United Way might have been affected.
One reason, Ms. Raybin said, is that nonprofit groups "made a major effort to communicate with their donors, and tried to distinguish themselves from other nonprofit organizations to protect their own images."

HEADLINE: Designing Boutiques Like Palaces

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON 

 BODY:
LAST Wednesday, amid feverish preparations for the imminent opening of the luxurious Chanel boutique on East 57th Street, an improbable ballet occurred: workmen in construction gear and French-speaking women in turquoise Chanel suits rushed across a lush, sand-colored carpet in protective blue booties.
An hour later, firefighters -- crowbars in hand, oxygen masks assembled and axes at the ready -- stood poised to break down the bright blue construction facade of the Moschino fashion boutique on Madison Avenue, near 68th Street. 
 "Sorry folks," a weary-looking fireman said, sensing the keen disappointment of the crowd. "It's a 10-92, a false alarm. Problem is, with all these fancy new boutiques going up around here, people keep seeing construction smoke, and we get called out for no reason."
The alarms may be false, but something is definitely burning: ambition. A designer-boutique stampede is taking place from East 51th Street to East 70th Street that is putting the braggadocio of the 1980's to shame. Some 20 international fashion designers at retail's high end are building their own dream houses -- mansions is more like it -- using innovative store design as the bait.
Within a year, Madison Avenue will float a parade of palatial mega-stores, with Prada (21,000 square feet); Valentino (9,000); Moschino (20,000); a new Italian presence, Etro (10,000), and two Armani stores (28,000 square feet, combined). Flagship boutiques coming to anchor on Fifth Avenue include Versace (25,000 square feet) and Ferragamo (6,500), with Piaget (3,750) and Revillon (3,800) branching out on their own.
Chanel, which opens on May 30, will be giving the neighboring Niketown (65,000 square feet) and Warner Brothers (a k a Bugstown, expanding to 75,000 square feet) a run for their money. The 16-story Chanel building -- some are already calling it "Cocotown" -- will include even a five-story Frederic Fekkai beauty salon.
Spokesmen for Donna Karan, Jil Sander, Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce & Gabbana and Genny confirmed this week that they, too, are urgently seeking space in the neighborhood.
"There's a feeding frenzy," said Alex Kabbaz, the president of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District. "It's amazing when you consider there were 75 empty stores on Madison Avenue between 53d and 96th Street as recently as 1992."
This flourish of new stores seems unlikely to warm the hearts of neighboring department stores that carry the same merchandise (but less of it). Dawn Mello, the president of Bergdorf's, says that almost every leading important name in her store is opening on Madison Avenue. But "we seem to flourish anyway," she said, adding, "There are clients who just like the way a Bergdorf buyer edits a collection."
Why this remarkable boom? Alan Millstein, a retail analyst at Fashion Network, said: "Every leading fashion designer now wants a flagship boutique in New York that serves as a showcase for their entire product -- something a department store can't guarantee them. It's a European concept that was taken up by Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, and now everyone wants one."
Faith Hope Consolo, a real estate and retail specialist at Garrick-Aug Associates, pointed out that on Madison Avenue, between 57th and 72d Streets, rents that were $200 a square foot in 1991 are now $350.
"And I predict they'll go even higher," she said.
Ms. Consolo added that rates are around $500 a square foot on Fifth Avenue (compared with $400 in 1993), and $425 on 57th Street (compared with $350 in 1993). Michelle Stein, director of marketing for Moschino, said that opening a flagship store in New York is now considered "an investment in your future worldwide, because New York is the window on the world." She continued, "Everyone is literally banking on the renaissance of Madison Avenue."
Mr. Millstein added that projections for luxury goods are buoyed by a climbing stock market and a profusion of South American, Asian and European tourists lured by the cheap dollar.
What might amaze shoppers -- but not the fashion industry, where it is conventional wisdom -- is the notion that these bold new stores are not expected to recoup the millions of dollars lavished on their creation. "Quite a number of them defy retail logic," Mr. Millstein said. "Some are here as corporate flagships that aren't necessarily for profit. They're being used as international advertising tools."
The designer stores and their pop-culture neighbors share more than geography. They will be tourist destinations, complete with souvenirs. At the Warner Brothers Studio Store, $1.50 will buy a keepsake (a Looney Tunes Pez dispenser); the Chanel impulse-buy equivalent is a splash or two of Chanel No. 5 Eau de Toilette at $47.50. For such purchases shoppers at both stores can walk proudly onto the street clutching a logo-emblazoned shopping bag.
Interior designers are providing the spectacle. Peter Marino seems to be making out best. He is designing Vuitton's new store on 57th Street and also those of the rivals Valentino and Armani, which will face each other, "High Noon" style at opposing corners of Madison Avenue and 65th Street.
Mr. Marino's design for Valentino will include a courtyard garden: "lighter" and "brighter" are his new watchwords. "Access to outdoor light has become very important," Mr. Marino said, adding, "the old idea of keeping stores closed and dark so customers would focus on the merchandise is over -- it's literally out the window."
THE prize for lavishness goes to the Chanel building, designed by Platt Byard Dovell. The store's interior, designed by Christian Gallien, has evoked Coco Chanel's legendary salon on the Rue Cambon in Paris. Built from scratch where the jeweler James Robinson used to be, the store has glossy black display cases and a profusion of mirrors and the Coromandel lacquer screens favored by Mlle. Chanel.
At the entrance, the eye will be drawn to a sweeping French-limestone double staircase modeled on one at Versailles. (Visitors can draw their own conclusions.)
Chanel is unlikely to redecorate any time soon. When a 12-foot Paris-made sofa was installed last week, the vast third-floor window on 57th Street had to be removed.
Grandest of all is the 3,000-square-foot Chanel Suite and adjacent Salon Prive, which boasts a luxuriously appointed ballroom-size double-height salon for fashion shows, couture fittings and special parties.
"I woke up a few nights in a cold sweat thinking about it," said Arie Kopelman, Chanel's chief executive. "With the cost of real estate in New York, everyone was asking, 'How can you be turning two floors into one luxurious room you're only going to use for occasional events?' "
At Holland & Holland, the new 57th Street outpost of the London hunting and field-sportswear store, the tail of a stuffed pheasant was quivering next to an air-conditioning vent last Friday. Visitors, their Hermes scarves flapping in the breeze, streamed in to examine walnut and mahogany hunting guns, flax and bridle-hide bags, "half Norfolk" shooting jackets and safari wear.
And lest gleaming mahogany counter tops become warm with all the discreet lighting, each is fitted with an inside fan to keep it cool to the touch. In this rarefied atmosphere, the alternative sportswear at Speedo and the looming Niketown down the street seemed a world away.
A palpably nervous delegation from the display team at the flagship Ralph Lauren store on 72nd Street was spotted on the second floor, checking out the rival goods.
Upstairs in the Brevis Room, adjacent to the Gun Room, patrician-looking gents were observed discussing the finer points of engraving for the custom-made guns they were ordering. While they talk about "the glorious 12th" (the start of the British grouse season on Aug. 12), potential customers are offered single-malt whiskies -- not unlike the free cocktails offered in Las Vegas casinos -- possibly to cushion the shock of paying as much as $120,000 for a gun, however delicately engraved.
Even the less rarefied neighbors are managing to keep up with the Cocos. In the reconfigured 9,700-square-foot Sony superstore, customers try out equipment while splayed on Donghia sofas, sample designer waters and cappuccino from a semicircular cracked-glass bar and screen videos in a room designed by Ralph Lauren, based on one he dreamed up for Sharon Stone's home.
Jim Mansour, the store's interior designer (who did creative work at Bendel's, the Limited and the Warner Brothers store), traces the development of the notion of what he calls "entertainment retail" to Mr. Lauren's success. "Ralph Lauren was the progenitor of all this stuff," he said. "When he opened the Rhinelander Mansion on Madison Avenue at 72d Street it turned the head of every retailer in the nation. It was at that point that people started to understand the compelling nature of having a brand image that was articulated by store design."
At Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, on the site of the former restaurant Cote Basque, giant ink-black paint brushes and a curled film strip rendered in bronze herald the new 45,000-square-foot Disney store (even the huge figures of Mickey and Minnie Mouse above the door were putting on the dog, dressed in black formal wear. Designed by Imagineering, a branch of the Disney empire, the new Disney store spotlights plastic crocodiles dancing in place.
On the third floor, overlooking the staircase from the Game Room, visitors will recognize a life-size Cruella DeVille, the villain of "101 Dalmatians." As the ultimate Fifth Avenue shopper, she has a face-lift-tight countenance eerily reminiscent of a number of socialites to be found at places like Mortimer's and Le Cirque, where Chanel suits abound.
Here, where the customers are called "guests" and the staff is called the "cast," a window overlooks the Christian Dior boutique, still clinging to its Old World elegance in striking contrast. Can the chasm between these two retail worlds be bridged?
"I think it's pure nonsense from people who don't know retail" to suggest that they won't, Mr. Kopelman said. "The woman who buys a Chanel suit is just as likely to want to buy running shoes for the country," he continued. "And let's be honest -- the American retail landscape has changed, and that goes for 57th Street, as well. The trend is toward a diversity which works well for everyone because it creates traffic."
Dr. Stephen Gullo, a diet specialist whose office is on East 65th Street, observed: "The Renaissance of Madison Avenue is a great upper. It's a barometer to the life of New York City. You see many more people walking at night, whereas before the streets were empty. The only down side is you know the rents will go up -- and traffic congestion. Great shops are better than Prozac."
How long can the feel-good retail high continue when rents spiral up to $4.3 million yearly, as they did at Disney?
Mr. Millstein says he often ponders that question. "If something should happen to the economy in a couple of years," he said, "it will be interesting to see how these luxury stores suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes."

HEADLINE: The $5.15 Question

BYLINE: By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University, was formerly vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Some self-evident truths are neither self-evident nor true. Elementary economic theory insists that a higher minimum wage must reduce employment. On this basis, many people dismiss recent scholarly evidence suggesting that higher minimum wages may not cost the country jobs. But perhaps the elementary theory is, well, too elementary.
When evidence contradicts a theory previously deemed indisputable, there are two ways to react. An honestly inquisitive mind will question the validity of both the new and old evidence. Which is stronger? He or she will also ask whether another theory could explain the puzzling new evidence. A polemicist who "knows" the answer, however, will dismiss the new evidence and attack the messenger. 
 So it has been with the minimum- wage increase. Two of my Princeton colleagues have been attacked regularly and roundly for their research suggesting that an increase in the minimum wage might not decrease the number of jobs.
But Profs. David Card and Alan Krueger are among the most careful empirical researchers in the economics profession. A few important points need to be made about their research:
First, when their study of fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania was conducted, Professor Krueger was not employed by Labor Secretary Robert Reich; indeed, at that point, he had never met him! (Only later did Mr. Krueger work briefly as the chief economist of the Labor Department.) To suggest that his research was politically biased is not only mean-spirited but ludicrous.
Second, evidence casting doubt on the theory that the minimum wage reduces employment is not limited to the Card-Krueger study. About 20 different studies by two dozen authors have produced similar results. Are we to believe that all these researchers are political hacks?
Third, the evidence in the Card-Krueger study represents a quantum jump in quality over previous research. Virtually all earlier studies on the minimum wage were based on time-series analysis, which tries to control for other pertinent influences by statistical methods and therefore always does so imperfectly. The Card-Krueger research is based on something akin to a natural experiment and is thus vastly more powerful and reliable.
Fourth, it turns out that most of the older studies supporting the conventional view fall apart when data from the 1980's are added. The studies no longer imply that raising the minimum wage kills jobs.
 The principal study used to discredit the Card-Krueger findings is by David Neumark of Michigan State University and William Wascher of the Federal Reserve staff. No polemicists they. But those interested in this debate should know that:
* The original data used in their study were provided by the Employment Policies Institute, which is financed by manufacturers, restaurants and retailers and whose director has been a lobbyist for several fast-food chains. That may be fine, but . . . .
* The institute never claimed that its sample of 71 restaurants was drawn randomly, and it still refuses to release the data to other researchers.
* When Mr. Neumark and Mr. Wascher drew their own sample of 150 restaurants, they found a loss of jobs small enough to have been a statistical blip. (In technical parlance, the loss was not "statistically significant.") This more reliable sample, therefore, does not refute the Card-Krueger study.
But how could jobs not be lost, when basic economic theory insists on the opposite conclusion? Here are three possibilities:
* The simple theory disregards the costs of training new employees. Paying a higher minimum wage might reduce job turnover enough to pay for itself, leaving companies with no incentive to reduce employment.
* The simple theory also ignores the problem of recruiting new workers. Employers with many minimum-wage workers may be reluctant to fill vacancies by offering higher pay because they will have to increase the wages of their existing workers as well. A higher minimum wage -- which equalizes the pay for all workers -- makes this issue moot.
* Minimum-wage labor may often be a small and relatively fixed proportion of costs, which include more expensive labor and machinery. In that case, the increase in the minimum wage may only slightly affect businesses' total costs.
I do not know if any of these alternative "theories" are true. But the list demonstrates that one can accept the new empirical findings and still be a card-carrying economist.
Where does this dueling evidence and theory leave us? In my view, it justifies agnosticism. Those who want to raise the minimum wage have not taken leave of their senses, have not forsaken basic economic principles and have not cooked the books.
Frankly, I do not know whether a modest minimum-wage increase would decrease employment or not. If it does, the effect will likely be very small.
But that doesn't answer the relevant question. One can accept the new evidence and still oppose the 90-cent-an-hour increase in the $4.25 minimum wage. After all, it does abridge business freedom. It does impose higher costs on some businesses and reduce economic efficiency. And it might reduce employment a bit.
But other considerations push me strongly in its favor. The folks who earn the lowest wages have been suffering for years. They need all the help they can get, and they need it in a hurry. The claim that most minimum-wage workers are teen-agers from prosperous families is untrue.
About 40 percent of all minimum-wage employees are the sole wage earner in their households, and about two-thirds of the teen-agers earning the minimum wage live in households with below-average incomes.
Yes, there are other ways to help the people at the bottom of the economic ladder. But every solution sacrifices some economic efficiency, and Congress is not about to enact any of them. A minimum-wage increase is being debated now. Congress should pass it.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally; Dow at a High In 41.74 Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The stock market snapped out of a one-day stall to spurt to record highs late yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 41.74 points, to 5,778.00, its 21st record closing this year. 
 "I feel pretty good about the market," said Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at IDS Advisory Group in Minneapolis. "I believe the economy is in really good shape," adding corporate earnings should continue to advance even as interest rates decline.
Broader indexes also rose to new records. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 5.66 points, to 678.42, and the Nasdaq composite index added 2.96 points, to 1,247.38. The American Stock Exchange's market value index gained 2.76, to 614.99, setting its fifth consecutive record high.
The Dow average recovered from a loss of more than 20 points early in the day and was up fewer than 10 points until shortly before 3 P.M., when the bond market rebounded, cutting a path for stocks to move higher.
Bond prices rose in light, technical trading, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for interest rates -- down to 6.81 percent, from 6.85 percent on Tuesday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
"There was no news to drive it, just a little technical rally in bonds," said Bill Meehan, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities, "but that was all it took to ignite the Standard & Poor's futures markets, which then spread" into the stock market.
Part of the rebound yesterday came from short-sellers -- investors who had speculated the market would weaken. When stocks advanced, these investors scrambled to buy in order to minimize their losses.
"Everybody's instinctively nervous that we've had a big run-up," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "They're worried they'll be left out if we have another big move up."
But, he added, "the market's likely to be trendless until we get another set of economic numbers" that may direct the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. The next important report on the economy will be the May employment data scheduled for release on June 7.
Oil stocks rose with oil prices. Exxon climbed 1 5/8, to 87 3/4; Chevron gained 1 3/8, to 61 7/8; Mobil added 1 3/8, to 115 3/4, and Royal Dutch Petroleum advanced 2 1/4, to 152 1/8.
A number of computer issues were weaker yesterday. Shares of Intel, fell 3/8, to 69 7/8. The company increased its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share from 4 cents, The higher dividend will be paid Sept. 1 to shareholders of record on Aug. 1.
Global Village Communication fell 4 7/16 to 10 13/16, after the company said it expected to report a loss for its first quarter because of Apple Computer's recall of the Macintosh Power Book 5300 and 190 models to remedy defects. Global Village, which makes modems and other communications products sold with the Macintosh, said the recall would reduce the number of new computers sold with its Powerport PC card.
Shares of Forte Software tumbled 4 1/2, to 77 1/4, after the company said company insiders could now sell as many as 1.25 million shares. Forte went public in March at $21 a share.
But Iomega jumped 10 5/8, to 54, after Acer Inc., a Taiwan computer maker, said it would include Iomega's storage drive in a new model. Iomega's share value has increased more than sixfold this year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Brooklyn Lawyer Stole Millions Using Property Schemes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
A lawyer with a reputation for charitable deeds was charged yesterday with swindling victims out of nearly $14 million using bogus real estate schemes, and a Federal court complaint said that he had told another lawyer that his swindles had totaled more than $50 million.
The lawyer who was charged, David Schick, is a member of a prominent Orthodox Jewish family in Brooklyn, and prosecutors said most of his victims were Orthodox Jews. 
 The victim in one scheme charged yesterday was identified as a British organization, Vindola Ltd., that finances charitable activities in Israel. Prosecutors said it was defrauded of $7 million that Mr. Schick misappropriated from an escrow account set up for what he had promised would be a safe investment paying a guaranteed high interest rate.
Mr. Schick, 36, a Brooklyn resident who was said by his lawyer in a recent interview to have been involved in some bogus investments, surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation yesterday and was arraigned in the Federal District Courts in Manhattan and Brooklyn on fraud charges.
Federal prosecutors in both districts have been investigating what appears to be an extensive web of activities that one official said may have lost investors $100 million.
But the official, insisting on anonymity, said he could not estimate how much of the total loss resulted from criminal fraud. Prosecutors said the charges reflect only the beginning of an investigation expected to lead to counts involving far more than the $14 million cited yesterday.
The authorities said they suspect that much of what was taken from later investors went to pay back earlier investors in a pyramid scheme. But they also said that some funds may have been used to pay back investors in legitimate deals that suffered losses.
Mr. Schick, a bespectacled, heavy-set man, was released at each arraignment on a $1 million bond secured by his home in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife and 10 children, and by the Brooklyn home of his father, Arthur Schick, who heads a well-known Brooklyn kosher catering concern.
Mr. Schick was not required to enter a plea at the arraignments, but in the interview earlier this month, his lawyer, Victor J. Rocco, said that Mr. Schick was "prepared to accept responsibility" for the crimes.
"Today, I'm not going to have any comment," Mr. Rocco said as he and his client's father waited yesterday for Mr. Schick to be arraigned in the Brooklyn Federal Court, where the case involving Vindola Ltd. was outlined in prosecution papers.
Papers submitted in Federal Court in Manhattan charge that an unidentified investor was defrauded of nearly $7 million in a similar scheme.

HEADLINE: Economics Lesson In a Border Town;
Why That Asian TV Has A 'Made in Mexico' Label

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico

 BODY:
The towering blue sign that lights up the night at Samsung Group's sprawling new industrial complex seems out of place in this gray and grubby border town.
But in the months since it was erected, the 70-foot steel structure has become an unofficial landmark, at once a beacon for poor and restless Mexicans looking for work and a symbol of the free-trade forces that are siphoning manufacturing jobs from the United States. 
 When Kwang Ho Kim, the president of the South Korean conglomerate, pushed a button to activate the assembly lines at the $212 million plant on March 29, Tijuana, with a population of about one million, quietly nudged a step closer to matching the entire United States in the number of workers involved in making television sets and parts.
In all, 24,600 people are employed here by Samsung; by Japanese companies like the Sony Corporation, Hitachi Ltd. and the JVC unit of the Matsushita Electric Industial Company, and by other electronics manufacturers. Together, the Mexican Government says, they assemble more than nine million television sets a year. In the United States, where more than 90 companies once built TV sets, television-manufacturing jobs -- mostly production of picture tubes, receivers and cabinets -- have fallen to 30,000 nationwide, according to the Electronics Industry Association.
"Tijuana's got first world equipment with third world labor," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in labor issues and the global economy. "They now have the ability there to handle a surprising level of complexity and some very sophisticated processes."
Mexico has always had cheap labor and thus has been a magnet for American manufacturers of low-technology consumer goods like clothing and hand tools that can be mass-produced here at a fraction of the cost in the United States. But with trade barriers falling, it has become easier for multinational corporations to make high-tech products in border towns like Tijuana and ship them worldwide.
For the old factory towns and aging industrial parks of the United States, however, Samsung's new tower looms more like a warning flare than a beckoning light. "We invented the television in the United States, and they're going to take it completely out of the country," said Nelson Silva, a forklift operator who was shop steward at a JVC assembly plant in Elmwood Park, N.J., before it shut down in March and moved to Tijuana. "I'm bitter that we lost these people, lost these jobs, not just at JVC but all over America," Mr. Silva said in a phone interview.
The big manufacturing companies say the competitive pressures of the global economy leave them no choice but to abandon workers like Mr. Silva and flee to cheap-labor countries. According to them, an Asian company churning out televisions in a Mexican town for export to American consumers is the wave of the future.
It was the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that sealed Mexico's status as a manufacturing center for the entire continent. In years past, Samsung operated on the principle that the best way to penetrate a market was to make the product in the same country where it was sold, said Young M. Kwon, president of Samsung Electro-Mechanics America Inc. in Tijuana.
Indeed, after being declared dead in the 1970's, the victim of low-cost foreign competition, the television manufacturing business in the United States was revived in the 80's. Foreign -- mostly Asian -- producers, spurred by political pressures and business efficiencies, opened American plants to supply the United States market.
But with the free-trade agreement guaranteeing a vast free-market zone of nearly 400 million people, Mr. Kwon said, the necessity of building TV's in the United States evaporated. "We consider this place, or America, or Canada, or in the future Latin America, one block in the market," he explained. Indeed, almost 90 percent of the 1.5 million color TV sets that Samsung will produce in Tijuana this year will be sold in the United States.
While Samsung moved its manufacturing operations here from Ridgefield Park, N.J., in 1991, it waited until the trade agreement took effect three years later to begin a big expansion. It now plans to spend $581 million over four years to double TV production to three million sets a year, as well as to turn out more picture tubes and produce more complicated items like microwave ovens. The total Samsung work force, now at 2,300, could quadruple to 9,300.
At the company's plant here, the global economy is less an economic concept than a lesson in cultural accommodation. In the entrance lobby, a sign that begins in Spanish and ends in English instructs visitors to remove their shoes and put on slippers before entering the plant.
The popularity of Tijuana among Japanese electronics companies has driven real estate prices so high that newcomers are looking at other border sites, setting off interstate bidding wars within Mexico. In April, the Daewoo Corporation of South Korea announced that it would open a $250 million picture-tube plant in the Baja California city of Mexicali because the state had offered a better deal than had neighboring Sonora.
But as production surges on the Mexican side of the border, it is drying up to the north. Nearly 200 people lost their jobs when JVC closed the plant in Elmwood Park. "Imagine it, nine lost years I spent working there," said Angela Nasareo, a 39-year-old assembly line worker from nearby Paterson who was let go in March. In a phone interview, she said she was offended that the young women in Tijuana who now have the jobs she and her colleagues lost make about $50 a week, compared with the $9 an hour she had earned. "There the company wants more quantity than quality, that's all," she said.
The United States Labor Department says the North American Free Trade Agreement has so far resulted in the destruction of 66,600 American jobs. Nevertheless, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said the trade accord's overall effect on the American labor market had been benign.
"The premise of Nafta is that trade is not a zero-sum game," Mr. Reich said in an interview in Mexico City, where he met with the Mexican and Canadian labor ministers. Since the accord was signed, he said, increased American exports have created hundreds of thousands of American jobs that pay more than the old manufacturing jobs they replace. "There is no evidence that Nafta has been bad for American workers," he said.
It has certainly been good for Mexican workers. The trade accord eliminated tariffs on most of the electronics products entering the United States from Mexico, causing an estimated 50 percent increase in exports in the first two years. The freer access sweetened the deal for Asian companies that had already made Tijuana their first stop in North America because of its proximity to Silicon Valley and the port of Long Beach in California.
In the recent Mexican recession, the border plants known as maquiladoras, which assemble products from imported parts, were a singular bright spot. Employment grew by more than 13 percent to over 151,000 and maquiladora exports rose more than 10 percent.
Now, the television manufacturers are showing that their plants can offer the local economy more than just the low-paying assembly jobs of the maquiladoras. To meet local-content standards imposed by the trade agreement, the Asian companies have invited some of their traditional providers to join them in Tijuana. Already, at least half a dozen South Korean and Japanese concerns have started producing parts in the city.
Samsung and Daewoo are building factories to produce picture tubes, which are considered the most complex part of the television production line and which until recently were made mostly in the United States. Samsung thinks that by 2000, about 90 percent of the parts it needs will be produced locally, providing higher paying jobs and contributing more to the local economy.
Samsung also plans to open a research and development headquarters, but in San Diego instead of Tijuana. Despite their disappointment at that choice, Mexican officials are upbeat about Mexico's increasing standing as a maker of big-ticket durable goods. Increasingly, they point out, the big automobile companies are switching output to Mexico. The city of Matamoros has already become one of the largest producers of automobile parts in North America, for example, turning out wiring assemblies for car factories in the United States and Canada as well as those in Mexico.
As more factories manufacture finished goods from scratch rather than just assembling parts shipped from the United States, they offer workers an opportunity for advancement to more skilled positions with higher pay. For all that, though, Tijuana's greatest advantage remains cheap labor. Seventy percent of Samsung's workers are young women who dropped out of school before completing the sixth grade. The starting salary for a 45-hour week is 345 pesos, or about $50.
Still, for 17-year-old Mariana Delgado Caballero, it is enough. She is working her first job after having migrated with her father from the central state of Guanajuato in 1995. She says they had no intention when they arrived here of sneaking across the border into the United States, as so many millions of Mexicans before them have done, but the shy way she says it suggests that such an escape is very much on her mind.
And while attaching tiny brass pieces to a tuning board for eight hours a day at Samsung is not her idea of a magical route to a better future, she is glad to be making money at all. "I'll do it," Miss Delgado said, "till I have the chance to better myself."

HEADLINE: America Keeps Peace, Clinton Tells Coast Guard

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
President Clinton mounted a broad defense of his foreign policy yesterday, arguing that in military deployments in Haiti and Bosnia and in his fight for free trade, he had chosen the unpopular course and left America better off for it.
In his second foreign policy address of the week, Mr. Clinton told the graduating class of the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., that he had trod a careful course in an era lacking the clear superpower delineation of the cold war. 
 "Imagine the ongoing reign of terror and the flood of refugees to our shore had we not backed diplomacy with force in Haiti," Mr. Clinton told the rows of white-uniformed graduates and their families.
"Imagine the shells and the slaughter we would still be seeing in Bosnia had we not brought our force to bear through NATO," he continued. "Imagine the chaos that might have ensued had we not used our economic power to stabilize Mexico's economy."
Mr. Clinton urged Americans to stay engaged in the world despite the end of the cold war. "We cannot withdraw into a fortressed America," the President said.
Mr. Clinton also used the occasion to denounce a Republican proposal to require deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003 as wasteful, misguided and a breach of arms control agreements with Russia.
He said the possibility of a long-range nuclear missile attack on American soil by a rogue nation was at least a decade away and that he was committed to working toward a missile defense system that could be deployed in seven years if such a threat were to materialize.
But, without specifically mentioning the Republicans, he stepped up the Administration's attack on legislation sponsored by Senator Bob Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich that would require the United States to have a national missile defense system deployed by 2003.
The proposal, the President said, "would force us to choose now a costly missile defense system that could be obsolete tomorrow."
House Republicans had planned to vote Thursday on their bill, which revives the national debate over the antimissile technology that is popularly known as Star Wars.
But the Republicans abruptly postponed action when confronted by an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office showing the project would cost between $31 billion and $60 billion by 2010.
Mr. Dole has been sharply critical of Mr. Clinton's approach to foreign policy, accusing him in a speech this month of "weak leadership, vacillation and inconsistency."
Republicans have suggested that a second Clinton term could leave Americans vulnerable to attack from missiles fired by countries like North Korea and Libya.
The President, who campaigned and won the 1992 Presidential election largely on domestic issues, has fashioned himself as an international peacemaker in this election year.
As he has repeatedly since January, he cited his Administration's support for Russia's transition to democracy and a free market economy, as well as the American role supporting peace efforts in the Middle East and Ireland. In the past months, however, the peace efforts have looked tenuous, and Russia's presidential election could restore a revived Communist Party to power.
Mr. Clinton specifically singled out Israel for support today, saying: "We must be with you every step of the way until there is a comprehensive, lasting peace in the Middle East. Now is not the time to turn back, and the United States must do its part."
Later yesterday, the President flew by helicopter to the Intrepid, the floating naval and air museum in the Hudson River along Manhattan's West Side, where he emerged onto a windswept flight deck to welcome sailors celebrating Fleet Week in New York City and to receive the Intrepid's freedom award.
Mr. Clinton was greeted by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor, who, using a favorite line, welcomed the President to the "capital of the world."
Last night Mr. Clinton addressed a dinner in Stamford, Conn., that raised $2.3 million for Democrats before he flew on to Milwaukee. He is scheduled to meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in Wisconsin today, allowing him to showcase foreign policy once again, this time in the American heartland, in a city with a distinct German heritage.
White House officials said the President's day of talks with Mr. Kohl would encompass issues ranging from the Russian elections, the expansion of the NATO alliance to include former Warsaw Pact nations and America's efforts to isolate Iran. The two leaders -- who have bonded in the past over food -- also plan to sample the local bratwurst.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Submits New Bill to Revamp Welfare and Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Republican leaders of Congress kicked off a new effort to overhaul welfare and Medicaid today by introducing legislation to meet some of President Clinton's objections to their earlier proposals, but members of both parties said the process would probably end in a Presidential veto.
Under the Republican bill, adults would have to go to work within two years of entering the welfare rolls or lose benefits. States would have to put at least half of their adult welfare recipients to work by 2002, and no person could receive cash benefits for more than five years. 
 Mary Jo Bane, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the new proposals still cut too deeply into Federal aid for destitute children.
The savings in the bill, $53 billion over six years, "do not appear consistent with the goal of bipartisan welfare reform that will move people from welfare to work and protect children," Ms. Bane told the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources.
But Republicans said that the Administration was deliberately blocking action on welfare. Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, told Ms. Bane, "You are setting this bill up to be vetoed again."
Republicans said that their welfare and Medicaid proposals followed the recommendations of the National Governors' Association. The governors offered their bipartisan recommendations in February as the basis for a possible compromise between Congress and the White House, and Mr. Clinton praised them at the time.
But today Ms. Bane expressed "serious concern" about the governors' proposals. She said that the Administration opposed many of the specific provisions, including one that might allow states to substitute Federal dollars for state money now being spent on social services.
Haley Barbour, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said he was extremely frustrated with the President's "repeated oscillations and gyrations" on welfare policy. In the last six months, Mr. Clinton has twice vetoed other bills containing Republican welfare initiatives.
"This is a persistent pattern of purposeful deception," Mr. Barbour said. "When the TV cameras are on, Bill Clinton talks about how he's for welfare reform. But later, when the cameras are off, his aides and appointees do something different. This is classic Clinton, page 1 of the Clinton play book: fake right, then run left."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said the Republicans' new bill "sets up the campaign face-off" between President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, on welfare policy.
In an interview, Mr. Moynihan, who has studied welfare policy for several decades, said he now felt confident that "we will get through this awful year without something potentially calamitous happening" to the nation's welfare programs.
"This is an agreeable impasse," Mr. Moynihan said of the deadlock between Congress and the White House. "I had hoped we would not do anything until the next Congress, so we could let some of these issues be argued out in the election. The current climate is much too politicized to have any good emerge in terms of social policy."
On April 26, the White House sent Congress a detailed legislative proposal to revamp welfare programs, but Ms. Bane said that no member of Congress had introduced the draft legislation as a bill.
The President said his proposal would impose work requirements on welfare recipients and set a five-year limit on cash assistance. Republicans said the proposal contained so many exceptions and exemptions that the work requirements and time limits were not meaningful.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, the work requirements would not apply to a family headed by a single parent who "has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care."
Even if a family reached the five-year limit, it could still receive welfare benefits if one member was working 20 hours a week, if the family resided "in an area with an unemployment rate exceeding 8 percent" or if the family was experiencing "other special hardship circumstances."
A state could define hardship in such a way as to nullify the work requirement for 15 percent to 20 percent of the families on welfare.
Moreover, under Mr. Clinton's proposal, if a family was denied cash assistance because of the five-year limit, the state would have to meet the needs of the family's children by providing vouchers for shelter, clothing, diapers and other goods and services.
A family consisting of a mother and two children would receive vouchers equal to the cash welfare grant for a two-person family; the Administration proposal would provide no vouchers for the mother.

'Ish' vs. Issues

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
What if Bill Clinton's blatant intervention in the Israeli election on the side of the left wing's Shimon Peres backfires? What if the right wing's Bibi Netanyahu -- to the consternation of the media and most leaders of the Jewish community in America -- brings off an upset?
A keening geshrei would go up from doves around the world: Peace process doomed! Disaster looms! Yasir Arafat would go through the roof, gloom would pervade the halls of the U.N. and Syria's Hafez al-Assad would summon Warren Christopher to Damascus for the 21st time, demanding an explanation.
But after the shock wore off, the U.S. President would extend an invitation to the new leader for a state visit, the world's media would find new seriousness in Mr. Netanyahu, and high-level rejoicing would be heard in the capital of Jordan.
That's because the Israeli election next week is not about whether to pursue a peace. That pursuit is a given; neither war nor the status quo is an option. The question is how to give Israelis a sense of personal and national security while giving Palestinian Arabs a sense of political and economic progress. The ultimate compromise would enable each to govern itself side by side.
Terrorists have twice jerked poll standings around. The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a crazy rightist caused a spike in Labor's support, which was later flattened by Hamas's suicide bombings. Extremists, either Jewish or Arab, could still deliver a "revulsion vote" against their own mainstreams.
But polls are deceiving because this is the first Israeli election to be decided by Arabs and Russians. Peres is counting on Israeli Arabs, who support him overwhelmingly, but they might not turn out in the light of his need to punish Lebanon for harboring Hezbollah rocketeers. Netanyahu is counting on Russian immigrants who seem to be splitting, but come from a tradition of misleading pollsters. My hunch is that the current 5 percent Peres lead is really a dead heat.
Reached by cellular phone as he was about to address 100 rabbis, Bibi tells me, "Labor is talking the ish and we're talking the issues." This means that his opposition is running a negative personal campaign against him -- ish means "the man" in Hebrew -- while he is stressing the Golan Heights and Jerusalem.
Hawks like me think Likud is right about wanting to make the strategic Golan a permanent part of Israel. Syria lost that threatening position in a war of aggression; Peres has been pleading with Assad to take it back in return for a promise of peace. That would be foolhardy, and the hoped-for American troop tripwire in that dangerous spot will not be forthcoming. The way to deal with Assad's terrorist regime is to be ready to wait for his successor.
Is Likud right about keeping Jerusalem's unity under Israel's sovereignty? Both parties say that's what they're for, but I think only Likud means it. That's because a Palestinian state, which Labor would instantly permit on almost all the West Bank, would demand East Jerusalem as its capital, and Arabists from Turtle Bay to Foggy Bottom would lean hard on Israel to give way.
But Netanyahu's Likud, without breaking agreements already made, would divvy up the West Bank into large Palestinian enclaves with a more limited sovereignty. With an Israeli government resolute about maintaining control of all Jerusalem, Arabs might thus be inclined to accept Gaza as their capital.
That explains Jordan's cordial relationship with Likud. In a final settlement, a "religious solution" would be possible, with King Hussein the key in determining access to, and providing protection of, Islamic holy places in Jerusalem. He competes with Arafat for that considerable power in the Arab world.
The little King has been, in Netanyahu's word, "impeccable" in his impartiality during Israel's current campaign. However, Al Asswak, a leading Jordanian newspaper that reflects his views, just ran an editorial headlined, "Likud victory can save the peace process."
I think it can, too. Is Netanyahu worried about President Clinton's preference for his opponent? "American-Israeli relations are impervious to changing governments," says Bibi, adding with mischievous confidence, "I'll work with whoever is elected President of the United States."

HEADLINE: Clinton Says He Will Veto Republican Plan in Wage Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
President Clinton accused Republicans today of cluttering up a proposal to increase the minimum wage with a provision he said would promote sweatshops. He called their proposal "a giant fraud on the American people" and said he would veto it if it reached him.
The bill would increase the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25. But it contains a provision that would allow small businesses with sales of less than $500,000 a year -- companies that now employ more than 10 million workers -- to hire new workers without paying them any specified minimum wage. It would also free them from paying new workers overtime. The proposal would bar pay cuts for those already employed by these companies, but those workers would not get the raise, either. 
 After several hours of skirmishing, the House quit for the night before voting on either the wage increase or the exemptions. Democrats, backed by television adertisements sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. targeting opponents of an increase, ae been pressing for a vote for two months. Votes on both issues are expected on Thursday.
Today, as the House debated taking up the wage measure and related proposals, including tax breaks for small businesses, many Republicans rose to speak. But none defended the exemption of new workers.
The amendment's sponsor, Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, did send his colleagues a letter saying the plan was necessary to correct flaws in a small-business exemption first drafted in 1989, the last time the minimum wage was raised.
But Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, said in a letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich, "This proposal invites a return to the sweatshop conditions that Americans abhor."
In an interview, Mr. Reich said the exemption for new workers "would create an incentive to a lot of businesses to subcontract their work to new, tiny subcontractors paying 50 cents to a dollar an hour." That, he said, would provide "another incentive for illegal immigration."
House Democrats were uncertain about whether they could find enough Republican allies to defeat Mr. Goodling's proposal. But they continued to revel in the opportunity to hammer the Republicans for not allowing a simple, unencumbered vote on the minimum wage. So all 196 of them who were present voted against taking up the bill under the procedures set by the Republicans.
Fourteen Republicans, mostly very conservative junior members, joined them, as did the House's one Independent, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont. But 219 Republicans, including the two dozen or so who have supported a minimum wage increase, voted to take up the bill. By a vote of 219 to 211, the House took up the bill.
Some Republicans argued against raising the minimum wage. Representative Porter J. Goss of Florida said such a step "will force many Americans out of work."
Representative Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas called the proposal "misdirected, election-year politics" and "a job killer." He accused Democrats of telling workers, "You're going to lose your job so we can play politics with the American economy."
But Democrats insisted the proposal, which would raise the Federal minimum wage to $4.75 a hour on July 1, and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997, was long overdue. Representative John Lewis of Georgia asked, "How can these mean-spirited Republicans, too cheap to pay a worker $5.15 an hour, claim to care about the American workers?"
Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts asserted, "It's just like Harry Truman said: 'The Republican Party supports a minimum wage -- the lower the minimum the better.' "
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat, turned the attack personally on House leaders. "This is just another attempt by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey to kill the minimum wage," Mr. Bonior said.
The Goodling proposal "bogs it down, it lards it up and it slips a poison pill," he asserted, adding, "Sweatshops, slave wages and pay cuts may be Newt Gingrich's idea of a revolution, but it is no way to build a better America."
As the House worked into the night it first adopted, by a vote of 414 to 10, a series of tax proposals designed to aid small businesses.
The most important of them would authorize a new "savings incentive match plan for employees," called Simple. It would make it easier for companies with fewer than 100 workers to provide pensions for their 36 million employees.
The Simple pension plan is patterned after the 401(k) plans, but with a significant difference. It allows owners to defer taxes on $6,000, plus an equal matching contribution from the company, even if none of their workers participate. Other federally authorized pension plans, including the 401(k) plan, require that lower-paid workers get benefits as a condition of others getting tax breaks.

HEADLINE: Top Professionals In Layoffs Steered To Temporary Jobs

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
America's largest job-finding company for laid-off white-collar workers has reached an agreement to channel such workers -- particularly managers, engineers, accountants, lawyers, bankers and the like -- into temporary work when it cannot place them in permanent, well-paying jobs.
The unusual agreement, made public yesterday, is between Drake Beam Morin Inc., the job-finding, or outplacement, company, and Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary-help company. It reflects the explosive worldwide growth in temporary employment and also the growing reluctance of corporate America to pay the cost of keeping former top-level employees in outplacement firms long enough to land good jobs. 
 "The traditional support for individuals who had been earning above $50,000 was unlimited five years ago," said Charles Albrecht, president of Drake Beam, who said nearly all upper-level people once received over a year of severance pay from their old companies as well as a year or more of support at an outplacement firm. "Now nearly half are here for only three months and their severance has shrunk. So there are individuals who need help while they are with us job hunting, and temporary work feeds that need."
For Manpower, the arrangement with Drake Beam, provides -- almost overnight -- a huge new supply of highly skilled workers to feed a growing demand for such people to take temporary jobs, not only in the United States but increasingly abroad. For Drake Beam, the agreement would satisfy corporate clients who want to see their laid-off workers re-employed as quickly as possible.
Both organizations operate in more than two dozen countries. And Manpower in particular is facing stiff competition from European temporary-help companies that are expanding rapidly, responding to a growing demand for "flexible workers," which means day work or short-term contracts.
Such work, once concentrated among blue-collar and clerical people, has spread up the income ladder so that it is not unusual today for a company to hire an engineer to carry out a six-month project, or accountants during the income tax season, or even temporary executives.
The agreement between Drake Beam and Manpower, a first for either industry, seems likely to focus attention on one aspect of the election-year debate over the downsizing phenomenon: are white-collar workers laid off from well-paying jobs having trouble finding comparable work that pays as well. .
Many economists, and members of the Clinton Administration, have argued that the economy is creating many well-paying permanent jobs. But Drake Beam and Manpower, in working together, suggest that laid-off workers are becoming more willing to take temporary work, either because they cannot find satisfactory new jobs fast enough or becausetheir severance pay runs out.
But while Mr. Albrecht of Drake Beam, which is based in New York, insists that temporary work is becoming a necessary compromise for laid-off workers, its chief rival, Right Management Consultants, a Philadelphia-based company, criticized the concept of outplacement firms and temporary-help agencies working together.
"The whole idea of outplacement is to help people realize that they can find similar or better positions in a reasonable amount of time, within a year, and they don't have to fall back on an inferior assignment," said Nancy Geffner, a Right Management executive. "If you interrupt this process by taking a temporary job, you lose the momentum of seeking a new career. This agreement is going to set people up for failure."
Mr. Albrecht and Mitchell Fromstein, chairman of Manpower, said the agreement would become effective once final details were worked out. Their arrangement involves no exchange of money, the goal of both organizations being to step up job placement.
The outplacement industry, almost nonexistent 20 years ago, is crowded with companies today, growing with particular speed in the 1990's as downsizing spread from blue-collar and clerical ranks into white-collar jobs well up the income scale. The corporations engaged in this downsizing turned increasingly to outplacement companies to get their former workers placed in new jobs as quickly as possible. One stated goal was to avoid lawsuits; another, to keep up the spirits of surviving employees who might someday need similar outplacement help.
The outplacement companies, in turn, for fees that can range to $10,000 a person and beyond, give their charges a desk and phone, emotional support and an upbeat approach to job-hunting. If the laid off learn how to sell themselves properly, acquiring these skills at the outplacement firms, then the vast majority will land good jobs soon, the firms contend. Above all, the outplacement firms try to teach their clients to suppress any anger at having been laid off. An angry job applicant, the argument goes, will not be hired.
Mr. Albrecht and Mr. Fromstein insist that their agreement supplements this approach without changing it. "It is going to give Drake Beam a channel to put people into work situations more quickly," Mr. Fromstein said. "And many of these jobs will lead to permanent employment. Our clients aren't advertising for an accountant or an engineer. What they want instead is to try people out."
For Mr. Albrecht, the logic is more compelling, and he predicts that outplacement companies, for all their reluctance, will increasingly branch into channeling people into temporary jobs. "Some of these people have children in college," he said, "they have mortgage payments, they have limited dollars in the bank and they need a revenue stream when their severance runs out."
"The question," he added, "is would you go to work on a contract basis for six months, knowing that 40 percent of those who do it end up with full employment. The answer is yes; that is why we are aligning with Manpower."
Mr. Albrecht and Mr. Fromstein said their companies would work together wherever the two have operations, here and abroad. A major competitor of Manpower, Adia International S.A., suggested yesterday that it would soon mount a similar operation. Adia, a Swiss company, announced a merger last week with Ecco S.A., in France. The merged temporary-help companies will be second in size to Manpower, whose sales reached nearly $7 billion last year.
Adia, which has a major operation in the United States, owns an outplacement company, Lee Hecht Harrison, based in New York. One of Lee Hecht's clients is the Bell Atlantic Corporation, and for three years Lee Hecht has been placing some laid-off Bell Atlantic workers in temporary jobs through Adia, often so they can hone new skills, said Steven Harrison, president of Lee Hecht.
Within 30 days, Mr. Harrison said, Adia will expand this practice for clients beyond Bell Atlantic. "We have decided to create a new division of our firm," he said, "to help companies in more than traditional outplacement ways."

HEADLINE: Shifting Campaign Strategy to Tax Cutting, Dole Meets With Forbes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Bob Dole met today with Steve Forbes, his former primary opponent, as part of Mr. Dole's effort to move closer to the tax-cutting economics that he has spurned most of his political career but now may need to revive his Presidential candidacy.
"What I intend to propose is a sound, pro-growth tax policy, coupled with economic changes," Mr. Dole said as he and Mr. Forbes, the champion of the so-called flat tax, emerged from Mr. Dole's Capitol office after a half-hour discussion. 
 Mr. Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, declined to discuss the specifics of the economic plan that he and his advisers are developing as a centerpiece of his campaign. But he said it could include a single-rate income tax, much as Mr. Forbes championed, and a national sales tax. A 15 percent across-the-board cut in income taxes was also listed as an option.
Mr. Dole has been consistently identified over the years with balancing the budget as opposed to cutting taxes. In his bitter primary struggle earlier this year with Mr. Forbes, he called the magazine publisher's economic proposals "snake oil," and his television commercials said Mr. Forbes's flat tax of 17 percent would add $200 billion to the deficit.
Still, Mr. Forbes's message of "hope, growth and opportunity" appears to have outlived his candidacy, leading the Dole campaign to consider adopting some of his proposals with the hope that they generate a similar enthusiasm for Mr. Dole.
"Steve Forbes caught the nation's attention with a tax-reform message and with a cutting-taxes message," said a Dole campaign official, explaining today's meeting. "There was a moment when he had a Wendell Willkie-like momentum and captured the imagination of the Republican base and independents, and it's important for people to understand that he is a player in the Republican Party and he is someone who will be helpful in advising the campaign."
For his part, Mr. Forbes said today that he had urged Mr. Dole to consider "radical tax simplification." Mr. Dole said that Mr. Forbes's flat-tax proposal was "a message that resonated."
Unlike Mr. Forbes, Mr. Dole would retain deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions. Still, he has given no indication how he would pay for any tax cut.
Other ideas under consideration since Mr. Dole met with a half-dozen economists earlier this month are making payroll taxes, like Social Security, deductible, and a national sales tax.
For some, the Dole-Forbes meeting was full of symbolism. Marshall Wittman, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said it could be as significant as the meetings in the late 1970's between Jack F. Kemp, the former Congressman, Jude Wanniski, the economist who most prominently promoted the "supply side" theory of promoting economic growth by lowering taxes, and Ronald Reagan, as they developed Mr. Reagan's economic platform.
Mr. Wittman said Mr. Forbes's association with Mr. Dole could help Mr. Dole make his political transition from budget balancer to tax cutter more easily, which he said began last year when Mr. Dole embraced the tax cuts in the Contract With America, the Congressional Republicans' manifesto.
"This is the next significant step, meeting with Forbes," he said. "Tax cuts cannot only unite the factions of the party that would otherwise be divided on social issues, but it gives him an optimistic message about the future and addresses the underlying anxiety."
One flaw with the Reagan analogy is that Mr. Dole, the former head of the Senate Finance Committee, has more experience in the realm of national economic policy than Mr. Reagan had. He has a long record of supporting tax increases, and his steadfast devotion to a balanced budget, born of his Dust Bowl youth on the Kansas plains, creates a major problem for him: He has staked so much of his political credibility on deficit reduction that he would have to be extremely artful in advocating deep tax cuts, or the move could be seen simply as a political ploy. This could mean showing how he would pay for them.
"The problem is that Dole is not a very good spokesperson for this message," said Stephen Moore, an analyst at the Cato Institute, a conservative research group. But he did not rule out a conversion by Mr. Dole. "Dole almost has to do a Nixon-goes-to-China kind of thing."
On the campaign trail, Mr. Dole has consistently talked about "fairer, simpler, flatter" taxes. In March, after it was clear he would win his party's nomination and Mr. Forbes had withdrawn, Mr. Dole called Mr. Forbes's flat tax "a good idea," but he has so far resisted endorsing a specific single-rate income tax, although at one point he raised the possibility of two rates.
One of his closest advisers, particularly on economic matters, remains Senator Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee and is a fierce deficit hawk.
"Dole has more of a definition as a budget balancer than as a supply sider," acknowledged one Dole official, "so we have to make certain we are consistent. But nothing says that Dole can't both be a pro-growth tax reformer in the tradition of the modern Republican Party as well as someone who is more trustworthy on balancing the budget" than is President Clinton.
Voters say their top priorities are cutting Government spending and balancing the budget, according to Republican polling. Cutting taxes follows. But tax cuts have traditionally proved a strong and winning issue for Republicans, and many conservatives now are eager to get back to that happier Reagan-like message of prosperity than the budget-balancing message of austerity that dominated the last year.
At the same time, some of Mr. Dole's close campaign officials and advisers are former acolytes of Mr. Kemp. Mr. Kemp is one of the original supply siders, but he is also in the dog house with Mr. Dole since he endorsed Mr. Forbes after Mr. Dole had all but won the nomination. Some of these people are advocating particularly deep tax cuts, both for economic and political reasons.
"The danger for Dole is that if he doesn't come up with a tax plan that is sufficiently bold, Clinton will come out with his own plan," said Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan and Bush Administration official, who helped formulate the 15 percent tax cut that Mr. Dole is weighing. "Since there seems to be no limit to what Clinton will do to steal Republican ideas, it puts pressure on Senator Dole to move quickly before Clinton pre-empts him -- and to be bolder than his instincts might let him."
Mr. Wanniski, an adviser to the Forbes campaign and not part of the Dole circle, said, "Both Haley Barbour and Newt Gingrich have told Dole that a dinky little tax-cutting idea is not going to cut it," referring to the Republican Party chairman and the House Speaker. "He's going to have to go for something big and bold, a la the kind of tax-cutting ideas Steve Forbes has," said Mr. Winniski, who now runs an economic consulting concern in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Summer Travel Boom Expected, Despite Hitches

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of high gasoline prices, a spring that seemed more like autumn and unanswered questions about the crash of a Valujet airplane earlier this month, the summer travel season kicks off this weekend, almost a month before the official start of summer.
Yet despite the handicaps, travel experts predict that summer travel will set a record for the third consecutive year, with 30.4 million Americans taking to the roads and skies by Labor Day. And if the weather cooperates, many traditional tourist destinations expect to post gains well above the projected average increase of 1 percent from 1995. 
 Meanwhile, this Memorial Day weekend will be marked by fun, food and festivals: music festivals in in Philadelphia, Decatur, Ill., Nashville and Charleston, W.Va.; by a folk life festival in Seattle, by a sport kite competition on the beach at Wildwood, N.J.; by the opening of the 17-day Spoleto arts festival in Charleston, S.C., and with a strawberry festival in Garden Grove, Calif., featuring the world's largest strawberry shortcake.
Indianapolis will be its usual madhouse at race time, with several hundred thousand spectators expected for the Indianapolis 500 parade on Saturday and race on Sunday.
In Niagara Falls, N.Y., which is expecting a sellout this weekend, the Maid of the Mist sightseeing boats will launch their 150th consecutive season on Saturday. Among the passengers are expected to be Vicki Conner and Joseph Ulibarri from Phoenix, one of 11 couples scheduled to tie the knot over the weekend at the Niagara Wedding Chapel.
"We thought it would be a romantic place to start the first day of our life together," Ms. Conner said.
Ships of a different kind, cruise ships, will benefit from the long weekend, to which many travelers are tacking on extra days, partly because of fears that the recent run-up in gasoline prices would lead to long lines or even shortages.
Norwegian Cruise Line's 2,000-passenger Norway is sold out for its weeklong Miami-Western Caribbean cruise departing on Saturday, while three Royal Caribbean ships in the Caribbean are also fully booked.
The American Automobile Association and the nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America said at a joint news conference in New York last week that an auto trip from Los Angeles to Washington would cost an average $12 more for gasoline this year over last, Seattle to Yellowstone Park in Wyoming $3.41 more and Philadelphia to New York, 45 cents.
Tourism officials in Newport, R.I., are expecting a big Memorial Day weekend and an even bigger summer, despite high gasoline prices. "Besides, the weather in the Northeast was so awful this winter that people will be itching to get away," said Evan Smith of the Newport County Convention and Visitors Bureau. Similarly, in Myrtle Beach, S.C., about 90 percent of whose 11.3 million annual visitors drive there, pent-up demand is expected to overcome any reservations about paying more for a tankful or two of gasoline.
That biggest concern in Myrtle Beach, the Jersey shore and many other summer resorts is not gasoline prices but weather, especially more cold or rain. That worry is shared by Virginia City, Nev., the frontier town that was the site of the Comstock Lode, the richest known silver deposit in the United States and where Mark Twain worked as a reporter on The Territorial Enterprise.
"Memorial Day kicks off our busiest tourist season," said Julie Lee of the Virginia City visitors bureau, "and this Memorial Day we're expecting about 15,000 visitors -- unless we get snow."
Snow at the end of May? "Why sure," she said. "Last July 12 we got three inches."
The A.A.A. and the Travel Industry Association of America predicted that summer vacationers would take a record 232 million person-trips (i.e., one person traveling 100 miles or more) this summer, 80 percent by auto, truck or recreational vehicle, and that they would spend 8.5 nights on their vacations, compared with 7.9 nights last summer. But because vacationers plan to spend the same as last year, $1,076 for a family of four, the implication is that with a longer vacation period and higher gasoline prices, they plan to spend less on food, lodging or entertainment.
Air travel is projected to account for 17 percent of the trips, five percentage points higher than last year. And while the Valujet crash in Florida earlier this month did nothing to calm fears about flying, travel agents and individual carriers said there had been no significant cancellations.
Unless the economy goes into a downturn or the 10 percent excise tax on airline tickets is reimposed, said David Swierenga, the chief economist of the Air Transport Association, "I would expect to see both domestic and international traffic to continue growing right through the summer." Year-to-date airline traffic is 5.9 percent above the same period last year.
New York City appears headed for what Jennifer McGuire of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau terms "our strongest summer this decade." Hotel reservations already presage the highest occupancies of the decade in each of the summer months, June, July and August, during which the average overall rate of 82.2 percent is likely to mean many hotels will post "no vacancy" signs virtually every night.
Although increasingly overshadowed by merriment, many communities still hold memorial services for those who died in the nation's wars, the purpose for which the holiday is intended.
On Monday, Mystic Seaport in Connecticut will recreate Decoration Day (as the holiday was originally called), as it was observed throughout the state in the 19th century, as a memorial to the casualties of the Civil War.
The ceremony will include a reading of the Gettysburg Address, after which townspeople dressed as Civil War veterans will place a floral wreath on a waterfront cannon to honor Army veterans. A second wreath honoring the Navy dead will be transported by rowboat and left floating in the Mystic River.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Drop by 7,000 in Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The number of first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped by 7,000 last week.
New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 344,000, down from 351,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said today. It was the lowest since 340,000 claims were filed in the week that ended on May 4. 
 Many analysts had expected about 350,000 new claims. They contend a range in that neighborhood suggests a moderately improving labor market.
The four-week moving average of new claims also fell by 7,000, to 345,750 from 352,750 the previous week. The drop was the seventh straight and pushed the number to the lowest level since the average stood at 345,250 during the period that ended on Aug. 26, 1995.
Many analysts consider the less-volatile four-week average to be a more accurate gauge of labor conditions because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.

HEADLINE: J.F.K. Trove Available For Love, Not Money

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CATONSVILLE, Md., May 21

 BODY:
Robert White just hates it when someone picks up one of the treasures of his collection and asks, "So, what's this worth?"
He never started collecting John F. Kennedy memorabilia to get rich. Nor did he change his mind after 1,300 items owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis fetched a staggering $34.4 million at a Sotheby's auction last month in New York. 
 "I'm not into selling," Mr. White said today in the cramped basement of his mother's home, where he keeps much of his collection. "This all belongs in a museum, and that's where I want it."
Mr. White, a 47-year-old industrial cleaning supplies salesman, has been collecting for more than 30 years. By now, he estimates he owns more than 100,000 Kennedy items, including the black alligator-skin Hermes briefcase the President used throughout his political career, a padded rocking chair from the White House that bears an indentation from his back brace, and the wallet and St. Christopher money clip he was carrying when he was shot in Dallas.
The prized items include thousands of handwritten pages of notes, memorandums and doodles; Kennedy's first Washington address book, which lists telephone numbers for family members as well as the Jackson Fish Market; an engraved wristwatch he wore to his 1961 inauguration, and a cigar humidor Kennedy kept on his Oval Office desk. It still contains a dozen cigars.
A humidor offered by Sotheby's -- without cigars -- brought $574,500.
The White collection pales in comparison with that of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, a branch of the National Archives, which has 32 million documents, 300,000 photographs and 17,000 artifacts, Frank Rigg, the curator, said.
But Mr. White says his is "the finest Kennedy collection privately owned in the world," as his business card reads. He even has documentation for his items, like the bill of sale for two "#1000 Jumbo Rockers" that Kennedy bought in 1954 for $12.50 each from the P&P Chair Company of Asheboro, N.C. On a typewritten note from an aide asking the President-elect if he intended to take one of the rockers to the White House, Kennedy answered in pen, "Whither I goest, it goes."
Sotheby's sold a similar Kennedy rocking chair for $442,500.
An aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the President's brother, said Mr. Kennedy was unaware of Mr. White's collection. John Kennedy Jr. did not respond to a request to be interviewed. Mr. Rigg said he could not comment on the White collection unless he saw it.
Mr. White said he had received the majority of his Kennedy items, including the most personal ones, from one source. He would not identify the source but said it was "a White House insider" from the Kennedy Administration. He declined to say more because of his plan to create a museum and dedicate it to his source, who died last year.
He befriended the source soon after the President was assassinated in 1963, he said, and over the years received items that the source had been given by Mrs. Kennedy or items that Kennedy family members did not want or claim after the President's death. He said his source left him even more things in a will.
The collection has grown so vast that Mr. White decided the time had come to share it with the outside world, something that until now had been almost impossible because of the limited space in his mother's house and in his own, just blocks away, in this middle-class suburb southwest of Baltimore.
He has begun discussions with city officials in Annapolis, the Maryland capital, about lending the city his collection if the city can find a site and help finance a museum project. Mr. White said he only wanted to be curator and tour guide of the museum and to collect a small salary.
So far, signs are positive. Carl O. Snowden, chairman of the Annapolis Economic Matters Committee, said he expects the City Council to approve up to $10,000 next month for a feasibility study.
"It's a golden opportunity for the city," Mr. Snowden said. "I'm very excited about the possibility of this coming to Annapolis. Tourism is very, very important to the bloodlines of the city."
Mr. White has shown the collection only to friends, friends of friends, memorabilia dealers and strangers who somehow find him through the grapevine of collectors. He happily ushers them all through his mother's foyer, down a hallway and into the dimly lit basement, which now looks more like a storehouse.
"She's been great about it," Mr. White said of his 82-year-old mother, who carries no insurance for her son's collection. "But now it's time to do something with it."
With many of the items crowded into old display cases or open shelves and evidence of Mr. White's other interests filling up sections of the basement, it is apparent the Kennedy collection needs a home of its own.
In addition to separate displays of material from the assassination, including the uniform worn by Nick McDonald, the police officer who arrested Lee Harvey Oswald, Mr. White has amassed celebrity autographs, old hotel registers and mummified heads. He also has the mummy of a gangster killed in a shootout almost 100 years ago.
The Kennedy material is the crown of his collection. It includes a golden baby ring, the passports of the Kennedys when he was a senator, telephone credit cards, a driver's license, a checkbook from the National City Bank of New York with one signed check remaining, a threatening telegram from Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in the Cuban missile crisis and a page of doodled notes that read, "Blockade Cuba," with the name of President Fidel Castro of Cuba squared off in a box.
Other material associated with the assassination include the Ray-Ban prescription sunglasses Kennedy had with him in Dallas. In a wooden display box, Mr. White has two swatches of blood-stained upholstery from the limousine that carried the Kennedys. Hanging in a wall display are the United States and Presidential flags that Mr. White says were flying from the limousine. Mr. White also has what he claims is the shell casing from the bullet fired by Jack Ruby to kill Oswald.
Mr. White said that neither the material related to the assassination nor any evidence that he has of Kennedy's marital indiscretions would be focal points of the museum.
"I don't want any kiss and tell or derogatory things involved with this," he said. "And I don't want to emphasize the assassination. I want to walk people through Kennedy's life, showing the good, substantiated and credible things he did."

Among the items are two of President Kennedy's wallets. He carried the one with the money clip when he was killed 32 years ago. Robert White's collection of John F. Kennedy memorabilia includes a humidor, with a dozen cigars, that was kept in the Oval Office. (David Scull/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Free (Not) to Farm

BYLINE: By James Bovard; James Bovard is the author of "Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty."

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE, Md.

 BODY:
Drought in the Plains states, along with spiraling grain prices and the specter of inflation in food costs, is drawing needed attention to farm policy.
The so-called Freedom to Farm Act, signed by President Clinton last month, reduces some Federal controls over agriculture while keeping subsidies flowing. Unfortunately, Uncle Sam is still paying lavishly to let tens of millions of acres of farmland lie fallow. And the effects of the drought have been severely worsened by these policies, which continues to limit grain production. 
 The most harmful tourniquet on farm output is the Conservation Reserve Program, supported by both Democratic and Republican politicians. This year the program is paying farmers to leave 36 million acres idle. The acreage, mostly corn and wheat fields, composes about 10 percent of American cropland. While many people believe that the policy of paying farmers not to plant ended with the new farm law, it continues.
The program was begun in 1985, purportedly to protect environmentally sensitive land -- fields vulnerable to erosion, for example. But it is largely a means of increasing Federal handouts. Most land enrolled in the program could easily be farmed with no major environmental harm. Farmers who enroll sign a contract to leave certain lands idle for 10 years in return for annual payments. Routinely, the payments are the equivalent of double or triple the local rental rate for the land. This is like offering people $40 an hour to go on welfare so long as they promise not to look for a job for 10 years.
A result of the Conservation Reserve Program is that much of the best farmland is left unplowed, even as world markets loudly demand more grain. The forgone harvests cut American exports by billions of dollars at a time when politicians claim to be worried about the trade deficit.
President Clinton and Congress had a chance with the new farm bill to end this system. But with its strong appeal for farmers and environmentalists alike, it was renewed. The Administration also had the option of making it easy for farmers to withdraw early from the program if crop prices are high enough to encourage planting, as they are now. Instead, it issued regulations so tangled that most farmers chose to stick with the current commitment.
The Administration has pursued other policies intended to create a domestic grain shortage. Last year, it continued to spend lavishly on export subsidies, using tax dollars to underwrite foreign buyers who wound up getting American wheat at fire-sale prices.
Also, despite signs of a potential shortfall in corn reserves, last year the Administration required corn growers participating in support programs to leave five million acres idle. Since then, corn prices have more than doubled. The mandate symbolized the Administration's determination to minimize harvests in order to maximize prices -- and farmers' votes. (Consumers, who face higher food prices as a result,are also voters, but they usually don't think about farm policy in the voting booth.)
One positive aspect of the new farm bill is that this sort of set-aside is prohibited. But the President is talking about trying to amend the law, and it is difficult to know which foolish policies will be revived.
Food is too important to become simply another political pawn. The Government must stop idling farmlands and end its mindless policy of artificial scarcity.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips a Bit Against Mark In Pre-Weekend Profit Taking

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower against most leading currencies yesterday on profit taking ahead of a long holiday weekend in the United States.
The dollar surged against the German mark early in the day on reports that Anatoly Stepanov, a Russian deputy justice minister, had been murdered in Moscow. The news aroused fears of growing instability in Russia leading up to the June presidential elections. The mark is vulnerable to instability in Russia because of the large amount of investment German companies have in the country. 
 But the dollar retreated on profit taking in early New York trading. In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5425 marks, down from 1.5428 marks on Wednesday. The dollar was trading at 106.93 Japanese yen, down from 107.18 yen Wednesday. The British pound rose to $1.5120 from $1.5086.
Trading is expected to be thin today; financial markets in the United States and many in Europe will be closed on Monday.
The mark was bolstered yesterday after Ernst Welteke, president of the regional central bank in Hesse and a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, told a conference in Germany that an April slowdown in the country's money-supply growth did not necessarily imply that interest rates would fall anytime soon.
The broadest measure of Germany's money supply slowed to an 11.2 percent annual rate last month compared with a 12.3 percent rate in March. German monetary officials are sensitive to money supply growth because it can contribute to inflation and diminish the prospects for lower interest rates.
But currency traders have been betting that Germany's sagging economy will prompt the Bundesbank to further reduce interest rates to stimulate growth.
"Welteke's remarks were interpreted as meaning it's too early to say whether there will be a rate cut," said Win Thin, an economist at HSBC Midland in New York.
The dollar declined modestly on that news. Still, buyers emerged when the dollar fell below the 1.5400 level, suggesting that the longer-term trend for the dollar remains stronger against the mark.
"People are still in the mode that the dollar is grinding its way higher," said Steve Jonathan, a director of foreign exchange sales at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "It's going to be a slow grind, but an upward grind nonetheless."

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
Deal Shows Banks Ease Loan Rule For Co-ops

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
The East New York Savings Bank closed a $10.7 million mortgage loan to a cooperative apartment building in Queens last week even though only 14 percent of the apartments were owner-occupied. The percentage was well below the 50 percent generally considered the norm for writing mortgages, either for co-op corporations or for individual co-op or condominium buyers.
It is still rare to see mortgages written with such an extremely small percentage of apartments owned by the people who live in them -- not owned by the building's sponsor or by investors who buy apartments from the sponsor. But several major mortgage brokers said the writing of such loans was on the increase. 
 "There were always a few lenders who would do these loans," said Jerry Swartz, partner in Pergolis Swartz, a large mortgage broker whose firm handles the underlying mortgages for buildings. "What's new is that today there are more of them."
"Funds are more available now; the market is much more competitive to loan money," Mr. Swartz added. "There's banks that weren't competing in the market before."
Mortgage brokers and loan officers interviewed stressed that to lend money to the co-op corporation, for the underlying mortgage, or to individuals purchasing co-ops or condominiums when owner-occupancy is below 50 or 60 percent, certain conditions must be met. They explained that without these conditions, the risk of an investor who owns a lot of apartments going bankrupt -- and leaving the co-op in the lurch -- was just too high.
"No. 1, the building must be in a desirable area, where the subleasing of apartments will bring in more money than must be paid for maintenance of the apartments," said Sam Giarrusso, who heads real estate loans at East New York Savings.
To assess whether a building is a good risk, the loan applicant must be able to generate a positive cash flow on the bulk of his apartments. In other words, if the absentee shareholder can sublease an apartment for $900, and pays only $500 for maintenance, the bank may look favorably at the investment.
The bank will next look toward the personal assets and liabilities of absentee shareholders to see if they have sufficient income or liquid assets to make necessary repairs.
"We look at their integrity, their track record," Mr. Giarrusso said.
With individual mortgages for apartment buyers, the bank also looks hard at the percentage of owner-occupied apartments buildingwide, mortgage brokers said.
If the percentage is the same -- less than 50 or 60 percent, depending on the bank -- it is traditionally difficult to obtain a mortgage.
But Ellen Bitton, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, said that more banks than ever would consider such a loan. She said she knew about eight banks of the 24 she dealt with that would do so. "It's very different from two years ago," she said.
But she cautioned that the banks lending to individuals use the same criteria they do when lending to buildings: The desirability of the building and the creditworthiness of the person or persons seeking the loan is taken into account.
The guidelines apply not only to co-ops, although condominiums as a whole are not allowed to have underlying mortgages. Ms. Bitton told of a woman who wanted to buy a condominium apartment in a five-year-old building on Park Avenue. When she applied for the loan the building had almost no apartments sold.
The building had been built as a condominium, but ended up being completed at the nadir of the real estate recession, so its developers decided to rent out the units until the market improved. Although the woman had excellent credit, it took a year to close on a loan. By the closing, nine of 21 apartments had been sold, still a low percentage but nowhere near as bad as zero.
People seeking mortgages on buildings and apartments in which the building has a low ratio of owner-occupants may still have a tough time. But banks are apparently eager to give loans in buildings with more than 60 percent owner-occupancy.
"We just can't compete with what the banks give people with buildings with 65 or 70 percent," Mr. Giarrusso of East New York Savings said. "There's a lot of players in that marketplace." As an incentive, Mr. Giarrusso said, some of the larger banks will offer lines of credit for capital improvements, and some will offer no-point loans, where the buyer does not have to pay an extra percentage of the loan at the time of closing.
While some of the smaller banks may consider giving mortgages to buildings with fewer owner-occupants, they charge more for the loan, Mr. Giarrusso said.

HEADLINE: Senators Offer Bipartisan Plan To Cut Taxes in the District

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
In an effort to reverse years of population and economic decline in the District of Columbia, two Senators said today that they would introduce a bill on Friday that would substantially cut the Federal taxes paid by District residents.
The measure, co-sponsored by Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, and Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, is almost identical to a House bill introduced last month by the District's representative, Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, which she said was the only viable way of saving the city from ruin. 
 The House and Senate bills would both create a flat Federal income tax rate for District residents of 15 percent, down from as high as 39.6 percent. Standard deductions would rise to $15,000 for single filers, $25,000 for head of household filers and $30,000 for married couples. Those figures were $3,900, $5,750 and $6,550, respectively, last year.
The Senate bill would eliminate capital gains taxes for any business investment in the city, while the House bill would do so only for investments by District residents. The Senate bill would also provide a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers in the District. Ms. Norton's bill has no such incentive.
Describing the tax cuts as "the best way to help" the nation's capital, Mr. Mack said today that he expected both bills to pass this year. And if that happened, Mr. Lieberman said, "I bet you a lot of money President Clinton signs it."
"High taxes are driving people out of the District of Columbia," Mr. Mack said at a news conference, where the Senators were joined by Ms. Norton and Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration. Mr. Kemp has been a strong supporter of using tax breaks to attract residents and businesses to cities.
The lawmakers and Mr. Kemp said that if the cuts helped Washington's economy, Federal and state tax breaks could be used to resuscitate other urban areas losing population for the same reasons -- crime, poor schools and inefficient city services.
It is not clear, however, whether the Clinton Administration supports the idea of Federal tax cuts for District residents or of having the cuts be a model for use across the country. In an interview after Ms. Norton proposed her bill, Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the measure was "more a dramatization of the problem than a real solution."
Also, at a time when Congress and the White House are straining to balance the budget in seven years, the lawmakers said that neither the House nor Senate had analyzed how much the tax cuts would cost the Federal Government.
Mr. Kemp estimated the cuts would cost $700 million to $800 million a year for up to six years.
The proposed tax cuts have become the latest in a series of efforts to restore the District's economy. Congress last year created a financial control board to help the city curb spending. The White House has appointed a task force to work with city agencies to solve problems. And Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. has begun work on a four-year plan to reduce the size of city government by 25 percent.
But the tax cuts would appear to be the most dramatic of the initiatives.
Stressing the bipartisan nature of their efforts, Mr. Kemp nodded toward Ms. Norton and said: "We've joined together in a bleeding heart issue to save the nation's capital. This is an urgent plea to the White House and leaders of the House and Senate. Do it now. People in this city desperately need urgent action."

HEADLINE: North Korean Fighter Pilot Defects to South With Jet

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 23

 BODY:
A North Korean Air Force captain defected to South Korea today in his MIG-19 fighter plane, setting off air raid sirens before arriving on a South Korean air base with his aircraft and a mountain of intelligence about the North Korean military.
The incident lasted only about 13 minutes as the defector, Capt. Lee Chul So, raced to the Yellow Sea from North Korea and then inland toward South Korea. South Korean forces, fearing an attack, set off air raid alarms in the western suburbs of Seoul, the capital, and scrambled six fighters to intercept the Northern plane. 
 Captain Lee dipped his wings, to signal that he was not hostile, and the South Korean planes escorted him carefully to an air base where he landed and was immediately placed under tight security.
"I couldn't live under the North's system any longer," Captain Lee told a handful of South Korean reporters who were allowed to talk to him soon after he landed.
The defection, if genuine, was the first in 13 years of a pilot with a plane. The MIG-19 is an old model and is not expected to yield major new information to South Korean intelligence specialists, but Captain Lee is a rare source of direct information on the abilities and preparedness of the North Korean Air Force.
"It's not just a plane and a man, but information about the state of troops in North Korea," said a senior Government official in South Korea.
The defection comes at a very delicate moment in inter-Korean relations. North Korea, the last Stalinist state in the world, is suffering from economic disintegration and widespread hunger, and some American officials warn that the North could strike out against South Korea out of desperation, believing that the alternative is internal collapse.
The border between the Koreas remains the site of the greatest massing of enemy troops in the world, and the United States keeps 37,000 American troops in South Korea to deter a North Korean attack. To reduce the risk of another Korean war, President Clinton and President Kim Young Sam of South Korea met in the South last month and together offered a new peace proposal to the North.
The proposal, which North Korea has said it is still considering, calls for four-party peace talks involving the two Koreas, the United States and China. Some experts warned today that the defection would infuriate North Korean leaders and might leave them less inclined to accept the peace proposal.
"It will probably make North Korean policy makers more nervous about contacts with South Korea, and they may draw back for a little while," said Kim Kyung Won, a former envoy to the United Nations and the United States.
North Korea had no comment today on the defection.
Defections from North Korea are growing increasingly common, though usually they are civilians who come through third countries. A growing number have been drawn from the North Korean elite, in what may be a sign of growing discontent even in the most pampered stratum of North Korean's society.
"This is another in the current series of defections by members of North Korea's establishment," another senior South Korean Government official said. "This is someone the North Korean leadership trusts."
To reduce the risk of defections, North Korea carefully picks pilots who are thought to be especially reliable politically and who have family members they must leave behind. In addition, the cockpit radios of military aircraft are rigged so that they cannot receive South Korean transmissions, making it impossible for a defecting pilot to explain his purpose to South Korean pilots or South Korean ground control.
Captain Lee leaves his father, his wife and two children behind in North Korea. There have been reports that members of defectors' families are sometimes imprisoned or executed, although on other occasions family members have avoided severe punishment.
South Korea offers rewards for defectors, although it has drastically trimmed them recently, and a South Korean television station said Captain Lee might be able to collect $320,000 for landing the MIG-19 in South Korea.
At the time of the last defection, in 1983, South Korean radar was late in detecting the intrusion. But the radar systems have been upgraded, and today Government officials said with some relief that Captain Lee's plane had immediately prompted an alert.
"The South Korean intercept mission worked perfectly," said Jim Coles, an American spokesman for the United Nations forces in South Korea.
In another unusual incident today, North Korea reportedly sent five naval vessels into South Korean-controlled waters this morning. While such intrusions happen from time to time, military specialists said this involved more boats than any previous such incident.
The episode began, according to an account by the South Korean Defense Ministry, when about 10 North Korean naval craft approached the maritime dividing line. Five of the boats crossed over and remained about 20 minutes before being chased back by South Korean gunboats sent to the area. No shots were fired.
North Korea offered a different version of events, asserting that the South Koreans had illegally infiltrated warships deep inside North Korean territorial waters.
"The infiltration of the warships is a deliberate and premeditated provocation aimed at intentionally aggravating inter-Korean confrontation and tension," the North Korean statement declared.

HEADLINE: Anger at French Troops Grows in Central Africa

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: NDJAMENA, Chad, May 23

 BODY:
A mutiny by unpaid soldiers in the Central African Republic showed signs today of turning into a popular uprising against French intervention in the country, after French soldiers came to the aid of the Government.
With Paris sending mixed signals about its intentions in the Central African Republic, a former colony still under strong French influence, diplomats said what started as a minor army insurrection now threatens to become a serious embarrassment for France. 
 The spreading of the crisis began late Wednesday, when a French helicopter gunship fired on a van carrying several mutineers as they headed into an assault on the national radio station in the capital, Bangui. Nine of the rebellious soldiers were reportedly killed in the attack.
Early today, as news of the French action spread through the city, several thousand angry demonstrators shouting anti-French slogans marched in central Bangui to protest foreign intervention. Emboldened mutineers, many of them shedding their uniforms, secured positions in the heavily looted downtown area, occasionally firing on French troops, at least two of whom have been wounded.
According to radio reports from the city, French troops, together with Central African soldiers who remained loyal to the President Ange-Felix Patasse, fired warning shots to prevent the marchers from reaching the French Embassy nearby. But before the crowd could be dispersed, the demonstrators set a lavishly built French cultural center ablaze, destroying the new structure.
Taking no chances with a further loss of control, Paris announced that all of its citizens in the country, along with departing Americans and other foreigners, were being evacuated immediately.
With airplanes operating around the clock, French officials said they expected the bulk of the evacuation would be completed by early Friday.
"The people were shouting anti-French slogans and we felt quite threatened," said one evacuee who was interviewed on French radio. "They were altogether out of control. Uncontrollable."
Along with Chad, the Central African Republic represents the heart of France's military presence in Africa. Its forces in the region are intended to protect French interests and help project the country's power from the shores of the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.
An opposition leader, Abel Goumba, told the BBC that he blamed the French intervention for the sharp deterioration of a situation that even on Wednesday seemed well on its way to being resolved by negotiation.
Mr. Goumba accused the French of waging a "veritable war." The French Government sent increasingly confusing signals about the purpose of its intervention.
When the Central African Republic's second army mutiny in two months began on Saturday, the French Minister of Foreign Assistance, Jacques Godfrain, who routinely manages France's relations with its former colonies, said on French radio that France would not intervene in its former African colonies except in cases of "external aggression."
"We are not the gendarmes of Africa," Mr. Godfrain said.
On Wednesday, however, as Paris began to receive panicked calls for intervention from its African clients, including many unpopular governments of questionable democratic credentials, the French Government seemed to change its tune.
"The mission is to maintain the democratic state; that means freedom of movement and freedom of expression," Mr. Godfrain said.
Today, as the situation deteriorated further, Paris retreated from this position, with Mr. Godfrain saying that the French military had been dispatched primarily to assure the safety of some 2,500 French citizens who live in the Central African Republic, along with that of other foreigners.
Late today, French and other radio reports from the country said that negotiations had resumed between a leader of the rebels, Sgt. Cyriac Souki, and a French general, Bernard Thorette, who was flown to the country from Paris, along with his staff, 100 special forces commandos and 24 armored personnel carriers early Thursday.
Prior to the stepped-up French intervention on Thursday, the mutineers were demanding the resignation of key defense aides to Mr. Patasse, in addition to an ultimatum made in an uprising last month that their back salaries be paid.
When Mr. Patasse balked at replacing his military confidants, the rebellious troops in the capital, emboldened by the spread of the mutiny to the countryside, raised the stakes, saying for the first time that Mr. Patasse himself must step down.
France's relations with Mr. Patasse are complicated by his long history of opposition to the presence of French bases in his country, which Paris has frequently used to intervene in the country's politics or mount missions in neighboring countries.
Mr. Patasse was elected in 1993 as a wave of democratic reforms that swept much of this region early in the decade ended a long string of dictatorships here. Diplomats say he has proven to be an ineffectual leader, however, and as the country's economic difficulties have multiplied, he has shown increasingly autocratic tendencies.
Serious political turbulence began in April when troops, whose monthly salaries rarely top $100, rebelled, demanding back pay and better working conditions.

HEADLINE: A Fund to Bail Out Countries in Crisis Is Doubled, to $50 Billion

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The big industrial nations agreed today with a group of smaller countries to double the money available for dealing with a severe international financial crisis, to $50 billion.
The agreement comes a year and a half after the global economic system was shaken by the near-collapse of the Mexican peso, and is intended to provide more firepower in keeping acute, destabilizing financial problems in one country from spreading to others. 
 The money would be lent to the International Monetary Fund rather than directly to a country in crisis, and would be disbursed only to countries agreeing to strict economic programs, officials said.
The doubling has been a key objective of the big industrial democracies since the Mexico crisis. American officials said this agreement, along with an I.M.F. plan adopted last month to require all nations to disclose more economic and financial data, strengthened the ability to prevent and deal with financial catastrophes.
The expanded war chest is being financed by bringing about 15 new countries into the crisis fund and by extracting higher pledges from current participants.
The agreement spreads the burden of dealing with a large-scale crisis from 11 of the biggest economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands -- to smaller European nations like Austria and to fast-growing Southeast Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia.
The American commitment would increase by 50 percent, from $6.16 billion at current exchange rates to $9.25 billion. Although the increase requires Congressional authorization, officials say it would not require any actual budget outlay or add to the Federal deficit because any money lent to the I.M.F. under the program would be secured by the monetary fund's own financial reserves, including billions of dollars' worth of gold. Treasury officials said they did not expect any problem getting the authorization.
"This is a sound and prudent agreement," said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. He said the fund would be called upon "only in exceptional circumstances" and only when the borrowing nations "are willing to take strong corrective policy actions."
The new arrangement would require the approval of participants representing 80 percent of the money pledged to the fund. The weighted American share, according to figures provided by Treasury officials, would be slightly over 20 percent, giving the United States a veto.
Indeed, the emergency fund was set up to protect against a crisis in one of the big industrial economies.
The last time money from the fund was borrowed was in 1978 when the United States called on the fund to help build up its currency reserves. Since then the fund has become a last line of protection against a potentially destablizing crisis.
The agreement was reached in Paris at a meeting of the 11 industrialized countries. Mario Draghi, the Treasury Secretary of Italy, who presided at the meeting, said in a statement that agreement "has been reached both on the broad principles and on the key substantive points for new arrangements to increase the resources available to the I.M.F. to deal with international financial emergencies."
Officials said the agreement was likely to win final approval in the coming months. They said they expected it to be adopted by the I.M.F., whose managing director, Michael Camdessus, was appointed on Wednesday to a third five-year term.

Excerpts From Dole Speech: 'Referendum on the Basic Values of the Country'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a prepared text of Senator Bob Dole's speech yesterday at the Catholic Press Association's annual convention in Philadelphia:
 Most of us grew up in a time when it wasn't politically incorrect for our parents, our schools and our churches to instill some values in us. Values like civility. Decency. Charity. Personal responsibility. Individual initiative. 
 I said last week when I announced my decision to leave the Senate that my campaign for the Presidency is not merely about attaining office. It is about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real.
The values I just mentioned are fundamental. They are consequential. They are real. And restoring them to their rightful place in our society is what my campaign for President is all about. . . .
Every Presidential election is, to some degree, a referendum on the basic values of the country. This election, I believe, will turn even more than most on those bigger questions -- on the direction our country is headed now, and where it should be headed.
It is no secret that the majority of Americans believe our nation is on the wrong track. Today's newspapers are filled with stories about job layoffs and corporate downsizing. Two incomes are now an economic necessity for too many families, not a choice. Our economy is not growing as fast as it should.
But while these feelings of economic anxiety are certainly widespread, I believe our problems go much deeper than that. There is a sense of moral drift in America -- and it has us worried.
Look around. Americans are all too often faced with schools that don't teach, courts that don't punish, welfare policies that impoverish, a popular culture that undermines our most cherished values and a whole range of other social problems that politicians promised would be solved long ago. . . .
Once, our schools were places of learning and order. In public schools from Philadelphia to Chicago to Russell, Kan., generations of Americans -- kids of all classes, races and creeds -- were brought together. They instilled ambition, hope, discipline, decency and love of country. That was the purpose they were meant to serve and can serve again.
But where is that spirit today? Many parents today view our public schools as hostile to their own deepest values. Instead of instilling hope and discipline, too often our schools breed resentment, despair and mediocrity. Our schools are teaching recycling and AIDS prevention, but our kids can't add and too often aren't allowed to pray.
That is why I favor the most sweeping reforms of our public schools -- beginning with the principle of school choice. I support our nation's public schools, for how could I not? I am a product of one. Nonetheless, I believe every parent in America should have the right to choose the school that is best for their children -- public, private or parochial.
Our welfare system discourages work, undermines families and perpetuates poverty. If some enemy of our country wanted to undermine the fabric of American society, it could not inflict anything upon us worse than the welfare system we have inflicted upon ourselves. . . .
On Tuesday, I outlined a series of welfare reforms which would address the national epidemic of illegitimate births, discourage drug use among welfare recipients and encourage people on welfare to work. That will go a long way towards fulfilling a well-known promise to "end welfare as we know it."
But I am determined to go further. We all know that too often a baby born on welfare belongs to a baby who was born on welfare. We are just beginning to recognize that perhaps half of the fathers of those babies are grown men, 20 years or older. In other words, a central feature of the plague of illegitimacy is older men preying on young girls.
Solving the welfare problem must include ending the epidemic of these male sexual predators. That is why I issued a call to our nation's governors: Enforce the statutory-rape laws you already have on your books. Make them stronger where need be. But enforce them to the fullest.
There are things government can do to help those in need. Social Security -- which I helped to save in 1983 -- has lifted generations of elderly out of poverty. Food stamps and the WIC program -- which I helped to create -- have provided nourishment to the most vulnerable among us. The Americans With Disabilities Act -- which I sponsored -- opened for millions a door that had been shut for too long. And Medicare -- which I am fighting to preserve -- has helped protect millions of elderly and disabled Americans.
These are our responsibilities as a government, but they do not exhaust our responsibilities as a people. Our faith in the Great Society has ended, but our moral duties to the poor have not.
I do not believe in the hard philosophy of sink or swim -- the survival of the fittest. Because that is not the way my community treated me. Because my life is a tribute to the people who thought life was bigger and nobler than that. I learned the hard way that while self-reliance is an essential part of the American character, so is that generous spirit that reaches out to those wounded in body and soul.
The alternative to cold bureaucracy is not indifference. It is the warmth of families and neighborhoods, charities, churches, synagogues and communities. These value-shaping institutions have the tools to reclaim lives -- individual responsibility, tough love and spiritual renewal. They do more than care for the body, they restore the spirit. . . .
America does not lack community organizations or parishes or synagogues willing to help restore goodness to our country. The problem is, these organizations lack the resources they need to do so.
To this end, I will propose a charity tax credit, which over time would allow taxpayers to earmark a portion of their annual taxes to private and religious charities -- faith-based or not -- that spend over 75 percent of their money on poverty relief. This credit will be up to $500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for couples.
The goal is to get funding and authority into the hands of institutions that reclaim lives. It would present Americans with a stark choice: Give your money to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or give it to Habitat for Humanity; give it to the Department of Health and Human Services, or to Mother Teresa and the Sisters of Charity; to Big Government, or to Big Brothers and Big Sisters.
Americans, I believe, have lost patience with the Great Society. But they have not lost their compassion for the poor and their commitment to the common good. This direction is a way to both part with our political illusions and maintain our human decency. . . .
Indeed, many of the cultural problems America faces cannot be solved by reforming failed government programs. This places public officials at every level in a new role -- a role that may not be comfortable, but which has become essential. We must speak not just for innovative policies but for enduring values like family, work, responsibility and tolerance.
I decided that I must use the bully pulpit to discuss these issues if I am to lead. Our times demand more of us than policies and programs -- they require a vision of the kind of people we aim to be.
Early in this campaign, I raised some questions about popular culture and the industry that shapes it. While I spoke out against the Hollywood movies and music which celebrate casual sex and mindless violence, it touched a chord with people everywhere. Parents know the pull of the popular culture. They know that televisions and movie screens, boom boxes and headsets, are windows to the world for our children -- an advance report on the adult world our kids are so eager to experience.
Leaders in our entertainment industry enjoy all the freedoms and privileges America can offer. What do they offer in return? All too often, they give us films, music and television which debases our culture, scorns virtue and celebrates shamelessness. I do not question anyone's right of artistic expression. But I would again remind that industry that art and virtue are not opposites. Art should lift us up -- it does not have to drag us down. You don't have to be an art critic to see the difference between freedom and license -- between Michelangelo and Mapplethorpe. . . .
Finally, Americans look to the White House for moral leadership. Yet, in some way, we have an Administration that reflects the most troubling features of our culture. An Administration that seems to believe in everything and nothing. An Administration which talks about the "politics of meaning," and with such talk reinforces, for far too many, the meaninglessness of politics. An Administration guided by nothing more profound or permanent than the latest polling data. An Administration constantly exhorting itself and lecturing the public but itself fundamentally adrift, without direction or moral vision.
The saddest evidence of this came last month when President Clinton vetoed a bill to prevent partial-birth abortions.
Let me speak to this issue as simply and directly as I can. I am pro-life. I am opposed to abortion on demand. But I understand that reasonable and decent people can disagree on certain points. Here, though, was an easy call. Here was an issue where all Americans can come together.
With his veto, President Clinton pushed the limits of decency too far.
When the vote to override that veto is cast, I may no longer be a Senator. But if I am, I will stand proudly with all the Democrats who voted against the President on partial-birth abortions. I would vote with Senator Moynihan, a man of conscience who calls the practice "too close to infanticide." Though not a Catholic, I would listen to Pope John Paul II, who calls the practice a "brutal" act of inhumanity.
And if I am President, I can tell you exactly what I would do. I will ask Congress to pass a bill banning the practice, and I will sign it into law.
I know that on this particular issue there are those who seek to focus on what divides us. I prefer to focus on what unites us -- the values that hold us together as a people. It is in these values that I have found my strength and our nation has found its strength.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Stalled Plans Leave Public Hospitals in Trauma

SERIES: PROGNOSIS: POOR -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Ever since he was elected, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has derided New York's public hospitals and vowed to turn some of them over to private hospitals, which he says will provide the poor with better care and save the city money. Three hospitals are on the auction block and the administration predicts a deal this summer.
But as the Mayor and his advisers try to spin off large chunks of the system to the private sector, so far unsuccessfully, critics say they have so neglected the hospitals that patient services and building conditions are worse than at any time in recent years. 
 In two years, the Mayor has trimmed more than three-fourths of the city's annual direct subsidy to the public hospitals, and he plans to give only $37 million in the next fiscal year. His advisers have presided over rapid-fire downsizing campaigns designed to eliminate inefficiency, which last week culminated in the system's governing body, the Health and Hospitals Corporation, announcing it would lay off 2,800 of the system's 38,000 hospital employees by July 1.
At the same time, the planned hospital sales and other efforts to move public hospitals out of the system are stalled primarily by a shortage of potential buyers, who are worried that Medicaid cuts will make it less profitable to care for the poor. So the infusions of private cash and know-how that were to help rescue the hospitals and replace public funds have not materialized.
Administrators, doctors and nurses at the public hospitals describe a flagging system in which bed sheets go unchanged, patients wait months to see specialists, repairs on X-ray machines are delayed or forgone and storerooms run out of essential supplies, like suture material for emergency rooms.
What's more, hospital directors say that budget demands have prevented them from buying equipment -- such as computer systems -- that they desperately need to survive in a competitive market dominated by managed care.
"The corporation finds itself under siege and the city has done a very poor job of trying to explain how they believe it will survive," said Martin Arrick, managing director of Standard and Poor's Corporation, the bond-rating agency that lowered the corporation's rating in November. "It is fine to say we want to off-load hospitals, but that's not a policy or a plan."
Maria K. Mitchell, whom the Mayor chose as his special adviser on health policy and installed last year as chairwoman of the hospital agency, insisted that the city's tougher fiscal policy would "strengthen these hospitals." But instead of propping up a failing system, the city was insisting for the first time that each hospital achieve financial independence and learn to compete in the private market, she said. "They now have that mindset, so they are stronger and that makes them a bigger player," she said.
Revamping the hospitals corporation by bringing in private investment was one of two planks in the Mayor's election platform on health care; the other was to enroll Medicaid patients in managed care plans. The latter is also stalled.
While health experts credit City Hall with injecting accountability into a system long known for loose spending and mediocre medicine, many say that if the Mayor knowingly throws these struggling hospitals into the turbulent seas of New York's managed care market without more support, some will sink, and fast.
Already, the combined effect of dwindling financing and new market forces have caused the public hospitals' patient census to drop 21 percent in the last 18 months. Prized employees and insured patients are fleeing to the private sector, leaving decaying buildings and the sickest or uninsured patients behind.
"The Mayor's action -- or in some cases his lack of action -- is driving the public hospitals on a downward spiral," said Emilio Morante, who resigned two years ago as director of H.H.C.'s North Central Bronx Hospital. "At some point, care will become so atrocious that he will be able to say these really are terrible places. And no one will care if they disappear."
 
Unfolding Strategies
Hospitals Search For Private Support
City Hall's strategy for taking care of the poor relies heavily on the notion that private hospitals or other independent agencies would acquire public hospitals and -- importantly -- pay to improve them. A mayoral advisory panel recommended last year that the entire public hospital system be dismantled, although the Mayor distanced himself somewhat from that suggestion.
Mr. Giuliani has offered Coney Island Hospital, Elmhurst Medical Center, and Queens Hospital Center for lease. And the city is quietly but aggressively trying to move several other hospitals out of the corporation by more circuitous routes.
Dr. Luis Marcos, the corporation's president, said he would like to see Kings County Hospital Center merged with an adjacent state hospital, University Hospital of Brooklyn. The Mayor's health advisers hope that Montefiore Medical Center, a large private hospital in the Bronx, will take over North Central Bronx Hospital and, perhaps, Jacobi Medical Center, according to a corporation official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
With managed care companies demanding streamlined medical care rolling into New York in the past few years, it has become clear that the oversized Health and Hospitals Corporation needs restructuring. The corporation has eliminated 2,000 of its 8,000 beds in the past two years and reduced its work force by more than 20 percent, to 38,000, mostly through severance and early retirement offers.
But reworking the agency, with its $3 billion annual budget, is a political minefield, since its 11 hospitals and dozens of clinics are as much community symbols and employers as they are sites for medical care.
Ms. Mitchell acknowledged that the Giuliani administration was now courting partnerships between public hospitals and others, and defended that approach as the most effective way to bring innovation, and investments, into the lumbering hospitals corporation. She said that Harlem Hospital Center is developing a Medicaid health maintenance organization in conjunction with two private hospitals, North General Hospital and Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center -- and said she expected other similar arrangements to follow. Private hospitals, which have themselves lost business to managed care, have become increasingly interested in treating poor people with government insurance, she said.
But with Medicaid rates now plummeting and the ranks of the uninsured rising, health experts say that private medical centers once intrigued by the prospect of owning a public hospital now have second thoughts.
Although a mayoral advisory panel recently disclosed its plan to cover the uninsured through a tax on hospitals and insurers, the Mayor has not endorsed the strategy and health economists question its financing. The New York State statute that compensates hospitals for charity care expires July 1.
Hospital executives say that sales prospects wane as the city watches patients leave and buildings decay. "These hospitals are slipping, their patients are leaving," said an executive at a private hospital that has been mentioned as a buyer. "Soon, there may not be anything left to sell or even give away."
 
Deteriorating Conditions
Patient Care Slips With Slimmer Budgets
As the public hospitals wait for their unnamed saviors, they are falling apart.
"There are prolonged waiting times for charts, there are no elevator operators around, elevators and X-rays don't work and aren't fixed," a physician, who spoke on condition of anonymity and has worked at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx for decades, said. "As the Mayor cuts back, he will make it extraordinarily difficult to take care of patients here."
The Mayor has said that services at H.H.C have not been affected by the streamlining campaign. But doctors, nurses and administrators who spoke on condition of anonymity told of a dirtier system falling into deeper disrepair. They mentioned these conditions:
*The Emergency Department at Kings County Hospital last month ran out of suture material to close wounds, forcing doctors to use a more expensive, delicate thread normally reserved for plastic surgery. At the same hospital, a referral to an eye doctor is taking more than four months, and to a neurologist, more than three months.
*At some hospitals, like Bellevue and Harlem, psychiatric patients brought to the emergency room who do not require admission must wait three to five weeks for a follow-up visit -- although many are actively schizophrenic and delusional.
*Queens Hospital is so short of nursing staff members that patients are not always washed daily nor are their sheets always changed.
*Patients at Bellevue now wait more than a month for a new gynecology appointment, although the corporation standard stipulates a wait of no more than 10 days.
*Staffing shortages have forced the closing of the outpatient X-ray department at Jacobi for three of five days in each of the last two weeks.
*At North Central Bronx, doctors taking care of AIDS patients now see 15 a day, up from 8 this time last year.
Numerous projects planned within the past two years -- including customer service training and cultivating a health maintenance organization based at the public hospitals -- have been held up in large measure because executives have little time or money for forward-looking pursuits.
"The idea that you can strip the budget and get rid of staff and the quality will stay the same is ludicrous," said Howard Berliner, professor of health policy at the New School for Social Research. "If H.H.C. does not hurry up and get itself into the managed care game in a major way, it is out of business."
 
A Murky Vision
Critics Question Giuliani's Motives
In interviews, current and former public hospital executives said that the attitude displayed by the Giuliani administration and Ms. Mitchell toward the corporation ranges from overt hostility to benign neglect.
"The administration constantly undermines these hospitals because of an ideological bias against the institution," said David Jones, a corporation board member who has clashed frequently with the Mayor. Mr. Jones said that the Mayor's advisers shot down an advertising campaign proposed by the board after the corporation's 11 acute care hospitals finally received full national accreditation last year. Likewise, a state official said that when the public hospitals received surprisingly high marks in a state survey of maternity care, the Mayor's office effectively canceled a press conference that had been scheduled by officials of the corporation to promote the results.
"There is no guiding vision here except that any way you can dismantle the system or show that privatization is working is good," said one H.H.C. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "As long as H.H.C is inefficient and delivering poor care, it's a great argument for privatizing H.H.C."
 
Shrinking Resources
Projects Stall As Priorities Shift
Ms. Mitchell, the Mayor's special adviser on health care, disputed reports of troubled services at the public hospitals, noting that "access to care had improved dramatically at H.H.C."
Ms. Mitchell also said she was not overly concerned about the exodus of patients to private hospitals. "It's not a bad thing that patients have choices and can choose a place they perceive as being better," she said. "It is our goal to give them choices and to upgrade facilities that are not up to par."
Dr. Marcos, appointed as president by the Mayor within the last year, acknowledged the hard times caused by downsizing. But he said that the root problem was, simply, a lack of money. The corporation almost did not make its payroll payments in late March -- an H.H.C. aide had to fly to Albany to pick up a state Medicaid reimbursement check and deposit it at Chemical Bank, said one corporation official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"We simply don't have the money to support this huge organization," Dr. Marcos said. "The big issue for me is that these hospitals are struggling for survival and how are they going to make it." The corporation faces a $550 million deficit for the fiscal year beginning July 1.
Dr. Marcos said that he would be hiring fewer consultants and streamlining outpatient clinics -- which, he noted, lost $250 million last year. He pointed out that the public hospitals have far more employees than private hospitals their size, and will need to further trim the workforce -- particularly given patient defections.
In these lean times, Dr. Marcos said, there was not even money set aside for hospital projects that had been previously approved, such as the rebuilding of Queens and Kings County hospitals. Both hospitals still house patients in large open wards.
The administration hopes that a private purchaser will rebuild Queens, whose renovation was last estimated at $550 million. And the Mayor's advisers are counting on the Federal Government or New York State to help foot the bill for the Kings County project -- although state officials say they will not bankroll it.
 
An Unsettling Limbo
Private Hands Wary Of Unstable Hospitals
Thus far, H.H.C.'s efforts to wrangle deals with the private sector have yielded mixed results and left the fate of many hospitals hanging.
More than a year ago, corporation executives announced that they would pay less and demand more from the private hospitals and medical groups which provide doctors on contract for the public hospitals. But so far only the Woodhull Medical Group -- a physician company that staffs Woodhull Hospital -- has agreed to the new terms. Albert Einstein College of Medicine and New York Medical College each decided not to renew contracts. In such cases, Dr. Marcos said, the corporation would find new partners.
The city's plans to sell hospitals have met unexpected obstacles.
Mount Sinai Medical Center, long considered the obvious purchaser of the Queens hospitals because its doctors already work there, abruptly withdrew from the bidding last month, citing unacceptable terms set by the city. Its original proposal required that Elmhurst and Queens be bought together, that any buyer rebuild Queens and provide guarantees to continue charity care. High-level officials at Mount Sinai last week confirmed that they were once again negotiating with the city, but refused to discuss the new ground rules. Dr. Marcos said that if no buyer agrees to rebuild Queens, the hospital would probably be converted to an outpatient clinic. Some health planners have questioned the need for a hospital at that site.
Politicians and patient advocates worry that the Mayor, facing reluctant buyers, will not be able to protect the health of the poor.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough president and a political rival of the Mayor, said that he had "reluctantly" decided to pull $1 million from his office's discretionary fund out of the public hospitals this year, for fear that private owners might soon be in place who would not serve the community.
"Selling these hospitals is more important to the Mayor than getting a good deal," said Rory Lancman, a member of the Queens Hospital Center Community Advisory Board, which has filed a lawsuit to stop the sale. "He'll give away the farm -- forget caring for the uninsured, or forget rebuilding Queens -- in order to get a sale."

HEADLINE: Republican Senate Passes Budget Blueprint

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Senate Republicans passed their six-year road map for a balanced Federal budget on a party-line vote late today, as everyone expected. What no one expected was an uncommon spate of bipartisan good feeling that very nearly swept a different blueprint to passage in its stead.
A middle-of-the-road spending plan offered by John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, nearly passed before a flurry of nays sealed its defeat, 46 to 53. 
 The Republican budget passed hours later, 53 to 46, but not a single Democrat supported it, in sharp contrast to the Chafee-Breaux plan.
The budget blueprint, which will be melded with a similar plan the House passed two weeks ago, is not a law and thus does not require the President's assent. Instead, it sets the boundaries for the House and Senate committees that will begin writing a detailed fiscal 1997 budget in June.
But as a practical matter, this year's resolution is more a state of Republican fiscal principles than a working document. President Clinton has already warned that he will veto many of the spending measures it contemplates, and Republicans do not have to votes to override him.
Mr. Chafee and Mr. Breaux had argued that theirs was the only plan that could actually become law in the partisan climate of a Presidential election year, and that argument apparently proved powerful.
Before today's vote, only the 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans who helped Mr. Chafee and Mr. Breaux compile the plan this spring had formally endorsed it. In interviews today, both men said they had expected to win no more than 38 votes.
Like the Republican budget blueprint approved today, and a White House alternative defeated earlier, the Chafee-Breaux plan would erase the Federal deficit -- but in seven years instead of six.
Their plan split the difference between budget proposals put forward by the White House and Republican leaders in Congress, in part by reining in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Both men said later that their strong showing suggested that a political consensus was forming to restrain spending on the entitlement programs before their costs consumed the entire Federal treasury. In theory, that would occur early in the next century if current spending rates continue.
"People are beginning to realize something's got to be done about these entitlement programs, or they won't be there," Mr. Chafee said. "And this solution we proposed was a realistic one."
Mr. Breaux said the plan was a safe alternative to the two parties' own budgets, whose own proposals to curb entitlement spending have become prime targets in this year's election campaigns.
"The good thing about what happened today was that it was bipartisan," he said. "That kind of cover is the only way this thing is going to get done."
With $105 billion in tax cuts through 2003, the Chafee-Breaux plan held savings and tax cuts midway between those of Mr. Clinton and the Republican leadership. But the plan would pare domestic spending on Federal agencies and programs like road building and the environment significantly less than would the other two.
It would also reap $126 billion of its savings on entitlement spending by a means neither side would embrace: a half-a-percentage-point cut in the inflation index used to set cost-of-living increases in many benefits and all Government pensions.
Many economists contend that the current index overstates inflation by at least that much. But the Labor Department, which compiles the gauge, is loath to make such a major change without intense study. And neither party has been willing to support a move that could be read, fairly or not, as a cut in Social Security and other Federal benefits.
The Democratic leader in the debate, Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, urged his party to oppose the Chafee-Breaux plan because of the cut in the inflation index. Mr. Clinton has raised the same objection.
The Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, said in a speech that the proposal might be the basis for compromise later, when control of Congress and the White House are not so clearly at stake. But to support it now, Mr. Domenici warned, would be political folly.
No Republican should support the plan "unless those members who vote for it want to take on the President of the United States five months before a Presidential election," he said.
Twenty-two of the 53 Republicans voted for it anyway, as did 24 of the 47 Democrats. Senator Bob Dole was in the Capitol but did not vote. Among the ayes were both of New York's Senators and two Democrats from surrounding states, Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
Mr. Bradley has announced his retirement at the end of this year. Indeed, 12 of the 14 Senators who have said they are leaving office voted for the Chafee-Breaux plan.
Mr. Domenici, the budget expert among Senate Republicans and something of a fiscal moderate himself, said he had voted no because he pledged last year not to draft a budget that touched Social Security benefits. But he did not seem especially disappointed that the budget he did draft was almost eclipsed.
"Dynamite vote!" he said, adding that the plan's supporters had cast "a courageous vote."
Hours later, the Senate did approve Mr. Domenici's budget blueprint, which closely follows a six-year budget outline that the House approved this month.
The Republican plan would cut taxes by $122 billion through 2002, largely in the form of a $500-a-child tax credit to most taxpaying families. It also would pare deficit spending by more than $700 billion on the way to fiscal balance, mostly by slowing the growth of benefit programs, cutting domestic spending and selling some Government assets like the broadcast spectrum.
The Senate passed the last two weeks mulling over more than 40 amendments to the bill and batting down most of them. None of the few that were adopted made major changes to spending plans.

HEADLINE: Manager of Biggest Mutual Fund Quits After Recent Subpar Gains

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Jeffrey N. Vinik, the embattled portfolio manager of Fidelity Magellan, the country's largest mutual fund, resigned yesterday, stepping out of the spotlight as Wall Street's most closely watched investment manager.
Mr. Vinik said he was leaving to start his own money management company, but the sudden departure came after five months of subpar performance. The announcement was enough to help send bond and stock prices lower, as investors and traders worried about the possibility of a shift in strategy at the fund, which has 4.3 million shareholders and $56 billion invested. 
 Mr. Vinik's resignation also sent some tremors through the mutual fund industry, which has become the vehicle through which nearly 40 million Americans are investing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to pay for their retirement and their children's college educations.
Mr. Vinik, whose resignation set off a shift of six other portfolio managers at Fidelity Investments, will be replaced by Robert E. Stansky, a company employee for 13 years. Mr. Stansky is known as a methodical, consistent "growth" investor, who invests in the stocks of companies that are selling increasing amounts of their products or services. [Page D1.]
This was the second major shake-up in three months at Fidelity, of Boston, the country's largest fund company, with 238 mutual funds. And Mr. Vinik is the third high-profile portfolio manager -- each of whom has had a reputation for making aggressive market bets -- to leave Fidelity this year.
Analysts said yesterday that the change in leadership at Magellan could lead to a change in the fund's investments and performance. But since 1990, there have been three different portfolio managers at Magellan, each of whom has put together a better-than-average long-term record. In Mr. Vinik's case, it was only this year, after he bet that the stock market would start 1996 poorly, that Magellan's performance flagged. In addition, more than 75 percent of the fund's money is invested through retirement plans, and analysts said that money was unlikely to be taken out quickly.
In the nearly four years that Mr. Vinik ran the Magellan fund, its value jumped almost 84 percent and it outperformed a majority of its competitors.
In part, that growth came from Mr. Vinik's astute investment decisions, like a huge bet on technology stocks last year. But Mr. Vinik has also been the subject of withering criticism this year as he has put much of the Magellan fund's money into long-term Treasury bonds and cut the proportion of the fund's investment in stocks.
As interest rates have risen this year, that decision has caused the fund's performance to lag behind, growing less than 5 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average has climbed more than 12 percent. And the flow of new money into the fund has slowed significantly. In addition, several analysts of Fidelity have predicted that Mr. Vinik would soon leave or be forced out.
In an interview, Mr. Vinik said he was "absolutely not" dismissed or asked to leave Fidelity, a unit of the FMR Corporation of Boston.
"This was strictly an idea I had on my own," he said, adding that in the last week he received a vote of confidence about how he had been running the fund during the last six months from Fidelity's chairman, Edward C. Johnson 3d. His resignation is effective on June 3.
Taken together, the recent changes have led some analysts who specialize in watching Fidelity to speculate that the company has been tightening control over fund managers in response to pressure from large institutions that offer Fidelity funds in employee retirement plans. The managers have traditionally been given wide latitude by Fidelity to invest as they see fit.
Fidelity, which manages about 13.5 percent of the $3 trillion in mutual funds, has tightened its control in other ways as well. Last year, the company forbade fund managers to talk to the press about specific stocks. The ban came after several lawsuits charged that Mr. Vinik had tried to manipulate the price of Micron Technology stock by making positive public comments about the semiconductor maker at about the same time that he was selling shares of the company from the Magellan portfolio. The firm also tightened regulations under which employees could trade stocks and bonds in their own accounts, forbidding them to own brokerage-firm accounts outside of Fidelity.
Mr. Vinik's is the third resignation of a high-profile Fidelity manager this year. In January, David J. Breazzano, manager of the Capital and Income fund, and Dan Harmetz, who managed three private partnerships, left the company when Fidelity abruptly said it was discontinuing its aggressive style of investing in the securities of weak and insolvent companies.
Mr. Vinik, however, said none of those developments had led to his decision to leave Fidelity. "I had three goals when I took over the Magellan fund," he said. "To beat the market, to spend more time with my family and to last a significant amount of time in the position. I achieved all of those."
Mr. Vinik also played down the rash of criticism he has faced in the last two years. He first drew questions last year as he moved 45 percent of the Magellan fund's assets into technology stocks. Outsiders feared that a fund as large as Magellan could not help but roil the financial markets when it started to sell such a huge position.
In November, Mr. Vinik, who had worked on Wall Street as a trader specializing in the buying and selling of huge blocks of stock, cut the fund's technology position nearly in half, selling $10 billion in technology stocks in a month's time without causing an upheaval in the sector or the market as a whole.
Mr. Vinik's next move drew a greater amount of criticism. Instead of quickly redeploying the cash into other stocks, during the next few months he built up cash reserves to more than 15 percent, put another 20 percent in bonds and cut the fund's stock holdings to 65 percent of assets.
In the Magellan fund's annual report, issued last week, Mr. Vinik wrote that "euphoria surrounding the stock market in general and certain sectors in particular" led him to believe that long-term bonds were the most attractive assets for the next 12 to 24 months.
That may still turn out to be the case, but since Mr. Vinik started moving Magellan's assets into bonds late last year, the fund's performance has suffered. Through yesterday, the Magellan fund was up 4.16 percent since the beginning of the year, compared with a gain of about 10 percent for both the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and the average growth mutual fund.
Last year, the Magellan fund recorded a gain of 36.8 percent, slightly behind the 37.6 percent gain of the S.& P. 500 but better than 80 percent of the funds in the growth-stock category, according to Lipper Analytical Services, a mutual fund research company. And since Mr. Vinik took over the Magellan fund in July 1992, the fund outperformed 68 percent of its peers.
In compiling that record, Mr. Vinik has managed the fund quite differently from his two predecessors, Morris Smith, who ran Magellan for two years beginning in June 1990, and Peter Lynch, the legendary manager who ran the fund for 13 years.
Mr. Smith and Mr. Lynch were known for working incessantly, but Mr. Vinik vowed he would run the Magellan fund in the same manner as he ran other, smaller funds. And his life style has changed little: Mr. Vinik works at Fidelity's downtown Boston office from 7 A.M. to 5 P.M., then goes home for dinner with his wife and three children. After putting the children to bed -- all three are under age 6 -- Mr. Vinik spends two to three hours making out a list of stocks to buy and sell the next day.
People who know Mr. Vinik say that he has become increasingly uncomfortable with the level of criticism aimed at him. Mr. Vinik, however, said that was not part of his decision.
"I don't worry about the criticism," he said. "One thing you learn in this industry is you're never as smart as the press says you are when things are good, and you never are as dumb as they say you are when things are bad."
Eric M. Kobren, executive editor of Fidelity Insight, a newsletter that follows Fidelity funds, said it was not surprising that Mr. Vinik had decided to quit. "Why does he need to withstand this level of criticism?" he asked. "He has a great opportunity. He loves to play the market. And I think he can raise the money" to start his own money management firm.
Mr. Vinik said his plans for the structure and strategy of his new firm, to be called Vinik Asset Management, have not been completed. While he said he had no current plans to run a mutual fund, he added that he "always wanted to run money for my friends and my family."
At the new firm, Mr. Vinik will be joined by two other Fidelity employees whose resignations were announced yesterday: Michael S. Gordon, who was appointed manager of the Fidelity Retirement Growth fund last March, after three years running the Blue Chip Growth fund, and William Copeland, a senior technical analyst.
In addition, Mark Hostetter, currently general counsel for equity markets at Merrill Lynch, will join Vinik Asset Management as chief operating officer, Mr. Vinik said.

HEADLINE: A Newly Clean Hudson Awaits Swimmers

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In a sign that the Hudson is again a bountiful, swimmable river and no longer an open sewer and convenient dump site, Westchester County officials have announced that the county's only public beach on the river, at Croton Point Park, will open for swimming for the first time since 1987, starting on the Fourth of July.
For decades, the beach had been shunned and then closed because the water was tainted with sewage and the graceful half-mile arc of white sand was only 100 yards from the county's smelly, seeping landfill. 
 Elsewhere along the river, some stalwart swimmers have always braved the water, adjusting their strokes and bathing times to avoid contact with sewage or industrial waste. But the pronouncement Tuesday by county officials -- after repeated tests for bacteria and other health threats turned up no dangers -- gives the lower Hudson its first official clean bill of health in nearly a decade. With the landfill sealed and water clean, swimmers have been clamoring to return to the river.
Susan Gonda, a boater who has already swum at the Croton Point beach several times this year and who took an unofficial dip yesterday, said her only complaint now was that thousands of people would soon crowd the waters that until recently had been the domain of braver folk.
And in an indication that further improvements in the river may be in store, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he wants to spend $43 million over three years on new state programs to resolve environmental, economic and recreational problems along the Hudson.
No new staff or funds will be added this year, and the commitment of money is small, but in endorsing the first comprehensive state plan for restoring the Hudson, Mr. Pataki said he was hoping to make the cleaner river the basis for the economic recovery of the Hudson Valley. The plan was to be released today.
Mr. Pataki said he was confident that the Legislature would provide the money for the proposed programs. "Without this, we'll run the risk of backsliding with one of the most important areas in the state of New York," he said.
"As a kid growing up, the Hudson River was the back door," said Mr. Pataki, who grew up in Peekskill. "That's where the garbage went, where the pollutants went. Now the river is becoming the focus of communities again."
Along with proposing money for everything from land purchases and underwater surveys to eight new boat launching ramps, the plan would strengthen regulations on wetlands and streams along the river and lay out how its banks -- for 150 years filled and reshaped to suit human needs -- might be re-tailored here and there to restore natural vegetation and fisheries.
In many areas, the plan would restore funds for research projects that had been sharply cut or eliminated over the last decade, said Frances F. Dunwell, a special assistant to the state's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation who has been the plan's chief architect since the Legislature created the effort in 1987.
For example, financing for research on two of the river's most important fish -- shad and sturgeon -- had shrunk 50 percent in a decade, she said. With up to $726,000 in state and Federal funding, the programs would be revived. With populations of shad and the 9-foot-long Atlantic sturgeon, the Hudson's greatest denizen, in sharp decline, the revival is welcome, she said.
Ms. Dunwell, who was dismissed last fall by the Pataki administration as a holdover from the Cuomo administration only to be rehired a week later after a bipartisan outcry, said Mr. Pataki has sent strong signals that he intends to fight for the plan. "He gets misty-eyed when you talk about the river," she said.
Mr. Pataki's political opponents said they were encouraged by the Governor's endorsement of the plan, but skeptical.
"He puts out plans all the time and refuses to put up the money for them," said Richard L. Brodsky, the chairman of the Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee and a Westchester Democrat. It was likely that the plan would receive the support of the Legislature, he said, adding, "We will look at this in a most cooperative way."
Focusing on the 150-mile stretch of the river south of Troy, the plan provides a detailed menu of research projects aimed at filling in large gaps in scientific understanding of the river and its inhabitants. One of the biggest gaps, Ms. Dunwell said, is that there has never been a thorough survey of the river bed. "We know virtually nothing about the habitat types on the river bottom," she said.
Ms. Dunwell said the plan would help unify the policies of half a dozen state agencies with land holdings or responsibilities along the river. "It's all been scattershot before," she said. One project would spur the transfer of unused tracts of state land to agencies, like the Parks Department, that can open the land to public uses.
Environmental groups were particularly pleased to see that the plan calls for strengthening regulation of wetlands along the river's margins. Under state laws passed in the 1970's, any swatch of marsh north of the Tappan Zee Bridge had to be 12.4 acres or larger to qualify for strong state protection. Now all wetlands south of Troy will be regulated, no matter how small.
"These wetlands are very critical habitat," said Andre Mele, environmental director of Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a 10,000-member group based in Poughkeepsie.
He said the plan had several weaknesses, including a lack of any attention to the problem of pollution from dispersed sources like agricultural runoff and faulty septic systems. But over all, he said, "We're cheering up here."

HEADLINE: Financier Pleads Guilty in Banking Fraud

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, May 24

 BODY:
Michael Carlow, the financier who once owned the companies that make the Clark candy bar and Iron City beer, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court today to a $31 million fraud against the PNC Bank of Pittsburgh.
The United States Attorney, Frederick Thieman, said more people would probably be indicted in the check-kiting scheme. 
 Mr. Carlow, 45, who is to be sentenced on Aug. 16, faces at least six years in prison and could serve as much as eight years and one month. He pleaded guilty to one count each of bank fraud and conspiracy and four counts of falsifying income tax returns. He also pleaded guilty to wire fraud and embezzlement charges in Connecticut, where he swindled $13,000 from the employee benefits plan at the Helikon Furniture Company.
Mr. Carlow defrauded PNC by writing false checks to shift money among different accounts. He also defrauded the Government by not paying at least $550,000 in income taxes in 1992 and 1993.
Mr. Carlow, who told the court he was unemployed, once controlled the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and the D. L. Clark Company, both of which were ailing before he restored them in the early 1990's.

HEADLINE: March Fed Meeting Unanimous for Steady Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers voted unanimously at their March 26 meeting to keep the overnight bank lending rate unchanged, according to the minutes of the session, released today.
The 10-to-0 vote by the Federal Open Market Committee's left the target for the Federal funds rate at 5.25 percent. The committee left the rate unchanged again at its latest meeting on Tuesday. 
 "Information on the economy and prices did not seem to indicate developing inflation pressures that needed to be contained" by raising interest rates, according to minutes from the March 26 meeting.
In addition, Fed members noted that recent increases in Treasury bond yields and other market interest rates were likely to slow economic growth.
"Nonetheless, a number of members noted that inflation was not expected to moderate further" in the months ahead, the minutes said. That could require rate increases to stem rising prices, the minutes suggested.
Some analysts are predicting that the committee could raise interest rates as soon as its session on July 2 and 3 as a way of slowing the economy to keep inflation in check.
The low unemployment rate, which was 5.4 percent in April, suggests that labor costs may rise as businesses are forced to pay more to attract and keep workers, analysts said. Labor costs account for about two-thirds of consumer prices.
At their meetings in March and this week, the choices before the Fed policy makers were limited. Richard Yamarone, an economist at the Market Data Corporation in New York, said the committee was operating "with limited and distorted data" at the March meeting following the temporary Government shutdowns and the severe weather of the winter.
And this week, the decision against raising rates suggested that the Fed officials had discounted recent run-ups in energy prices and were looking for more evidence that the economy was gaining momentum before tightening credit.

HEADLINE: Still Life, With Tourists;
Can Visitors Revive the Economy for Philadelphia?

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
The promoters of this city's summer blockbuster art exhibit, which opens May 30, aren't missing a trick. Already, tourists can buy neon-hued, vinyl-covered baseballs plastered with Paul Cezanne's signature, or see the sights on a bus decorated with a 40-foot-long copy of a Cezanne still life of fruit. The exhibit is even being touted in a 20-page special-advertising section in Business Week magazine.
While the showing of 170 paintings by the French master is a major cultural event, its real objectives are economic. Philadelphia has lost tens of thousands of jobs in recent years, and now the nation's fifth-largest city has become the latest Eastern dowager to embrace tourism as its economic salvation. 
 Mayor Edward Rendell, re-elected in November to a second four-year term, is spearheading an aggressive $12 million tourism-marketing campaign. Described by both admirers and foes as a tireless cheerleader for his city, he has solicited public and private funds to develop tourist attractions like the $330 million "Avenue of the Arts," a concentration of museums, theaters and concert halls that one local observer called a "strung out Lincoln Center," and a $90 million entertainment, dining and hotel complex on the Delaware River. He has revitalized the historic district and has obtained funds for a new $20 million visitors center at Independence Mall, home of the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.
In the course of the summer, Philadelphia officials are counting on the Cezanne exhibit alone to draw more than 500,000 visitors to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, pumping at least $40 million into the local economy. Fifteen Philadelphia hotels have banded together to sell Cezanne packages to out-of-town visitors, and major restaurants, including the top-rated Le Bec-Fin, are offering discounts to museum-goers. The Advanta Corporation, a big issuer of credit cards based in suburban Horsham, is hoping to help its business and its image by spending $1 million to underwrite the show and an additional $2 million to publicize it.
Few locals fault Mr. Rendell's approach. With manufacturing shrinking and corporations fleeing, tourism is one of the few things the city has going for it these days. The problem is that it isn't very much.
Specialists in urban affairs say it is a mistake to pin too much hope on tourism. "Tourism is certainly a desirable thing, but I doubt you can revive all of a central city on it," said Edwin Mills, a professor of real estate at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. "What really generated jobs in the 1980's were financial services, real estate, health care and high-tech industries. These still have potential in the 1990's, but I'd hate to see a city expect to derive all of its benefits from tourism. That's putting too many eggs in one pot."
In Philadelphia, the 1.3-million-square-foot convention center, hailed as the engine of the city's tourism-driven economic renaissance, has fallen dismally short of its backers' promises. Constructed around the old Reading Terminal train shed and connected to a $212 million, 1,200-room Marriott hotel, it was completed in the summer of 1994, three years behind schedule. By then, its cost had soared to $522 million, double the original estimate by the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, the city's economic-development arm.
Worse, the economic payoff that the group predicted a decade ago -- 10,000 full-time and part-time new jobs and a steady flow of profits that would increase to $23 million by the year 2000 from an initial $4 million in 1991 -- has not materialized. So far, the center-and-hotel complex has created only 1,100 full-time jobs, according to Robert Butera, executive director of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority. (In part, this is because the city originally anticipated the development of two -- rather than the current one -- large convention hotels at the center.)
And instead of profits, Mr. Butera foresees only red ink. He said the city would be saddled with an annual debt-service bill of $24 million for the next quarter-century. And while revenues from the center and a 6 percent hotel tax should exceed operating expenses, the net cost to taxpayers will still be huge, he predicts: $20 million this year, then declining somewhat year by year to $15 million by the turn of the century.
What of the early promise of the center's economic contribution? "It sounds like an exaggeration in order to get a deal done," Mr. Butera said.
Critics concede the convention center is an impressive architectural achievement but say it is an extravagance for a city that only recently pulled back from the brink of bankruptcy. The money spent to build it, they maintain, should have gone to repairing Philadelphia's decaying infrastructure.
"The structure is elegant and excellent," said David Cohen, who has served a total of 17 years on the City Council. "I only wish we could afford it. Undoubtedly, certain businesses will be helped, but we're paying an enormous amount of money for it. The city has heavy needs, in schools, recreation, housing, mass transit. Every level of government is in crisis. We face tremendous deficits."
Even nearby merchants, who in theory stand to gain from the influx of visitors, are casting a skeptical eye on the convention center. George Mickel Jr., who owns By George, an Italian-food store in the adjacent Reading Terminal Market, said he lost 15 percent of his customers while the complex was under construction. And while most of them have returned, and convention-goers have increased sales a bit, he estimates that business is still down 20 percent for the fresh-food purveyors that account for one-third of the market's shops. "They're struggling," he said.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Rendell dismisses his detractors' concerns as overblown or plain wrong. In an interview in his office, he said the convention center "probably produces" a net gain of tens of millions of dollars, because convention-goers shop, dine out and pay taxes on liquor. If the taxpayers' subsidy were eliminated, he said, "you'd be eliminating 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 million dollars in tax benefits we get by having conventioners in town." "So," he added, "it's a ridiculous argument."
Mr. Rendell and other city officials say there is ample evidence that the tourism strategy is paying off. The convention center boasts strong advance bookings, they say, and private developers are negotiating with the city for the construction of four new hotels. They add that the hospitality industry is providing job training for hundreds of high-school students and unemployed adults.
Besides, they argue, they have no choice but to seize on tourism as an economic lifeline because there is not much else. Other ailing cities, after all, have followed the same path, with Boston developing its historic Faneuil Hall district and Baltimore sprucing up its scenic inner harbor.
For its part, Philadelphia is one of the sickest cities in the Northeast, desperately trying to halt an economic slide that began more than half a century ago at the close of World War II. According to David Elesh, an associate professor of sociology at Temple University in Philadelphia, the portion of the city's work force employed in manufacturing has shrunk to just 9 percent today from 50 percent in the mid-1950's. Since 1980, he estimates, the number of Philadelphians with jobs has fallen by 16 percent, to 669,000 from 794,000.
The city's population has likewise contracted, to 1.5 million last year from nearly two million in 1970. Ed Schwartz, a former director of Philadelphia's Office of Housing and Community Development and the current president of the Institute for the Study of Civic Values, estimates that one-fifth of the city's residents live below the poverty line. Weed-strewn lots and abandoned buildings dot many neighborhoods.
"There is no way the residents there can do any broad-based renewal, and the city can't do it either," said David Bartelt, a professor of geography and urban studies at Temple.
While the city does have several buoyant sectors -- notably its medical centers, its colleges and universities and a vibrant business-service industry -- analysts say these are not enough to turn the economy around.
That leaves tourists -- and, for the moment, Cezanne. While even Philadelphia's biggest boosters say tourism's long-term impact is limited, hoteliers are optimistic about the potential for immediate gain. The Latham Hotel predicts the show will add at least $250,000 to its revenues during the usually slow summer season; the Four Seasons Hotel foresees a minimum windfall of $500,000.
Advanta, the credit-card company, is also making commercial hay out of the extravaganza, sponsoring a local art contest and underwriting a documentary on Cezanne that will be broadcast nationally on the Public Broadcasting Service. Not least of the beneficiaries will be the Museum of Art itself, which expects $3.5 million in ticket sales and $3 million from the sale of souvenir items.
There is always the chance that tourism really will help turn Philadelphia around, of course. A recent study of the economic impact of the convention center by the Pennsylvania Economy League, a public think tank, predicts that by the end of the fiscal year 2004, Philadelphia should collect $30 million annually in taxes "connected with convention center activity."
But even some backers of the Mayor's tourism gamble -- those who call it a key ingredient in any long-term solution to Philadelphia's economic woes -- say there are severe limits to how far visitor dollars can take a big city.
"Tourism alone won't bail out Philadelphia's structural difficulties," said Graham Finney, a consultant and the former chairman of Philadelphia's planning commission. "Its tax base is pretty well tapped out, and the state is not generous to older cities. Tourism is no silver bullet."

HEADLINE: April Orders For Durables Down 1.9%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods fell 1.9 percent in April because of slack demand for aircraft, the Government said today, as the sluggish recovery in manufacturing crept forward.
The 1.9 percent decline was larger than analysts had expected and was in contrast to March's increase, which was revised to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent. Orders for durable goods have declined in three of the year's first four months. 
 Analysts said the drop came mostly in orders for aircraft and other transportation equipment. Excluding that often volatile sector, they noted, orders rose 1.7 percent in April after having fallen 1 percent in March.
Transportation orders fell 12.6 percent in April, the steepest decline since July 1994, Commerce Department officials said. About one-quarter of all durables orders are for transportation items.
"A large decrease in aircraft and parts more than offset an increase in motor vehicles and parts," the department said. The Government does not break out aircraft orders separately.
Orders for new cars rebounded in April from the strike that idled most of the output of General Motors for much of March.
"What was going on in April was that the motor vehicle industry passed its strike-driven low point while the rest of the economy was basically holding its own," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
With low inventories of new vehicles, auto makers geared up to restock dealers' lots while some other industries were still working down stocks of unsold goods.
"The motor vehicle industry has basically completed its inventory correction, but other industries still were being affected in April," Mr. Dederick said.
The Federal Reserve said last week that industrial production surged in April after being hurt by the strike at General Motors.
Orders for industrial machinery, including computers, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in April after falling 4.5 percent in March. Military orders fell 35.1 percent after soaring 62.9 percent in March. Electrical goods orders dropped 2.7 percent after a 4.8 percent March increase.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, taken as an indicator of business investment in new equipment, fell 12.2 percent after a 4.8 percent increase in March. Aircraft are included in this category.

HEADLINE: Burmese Crackdown May Be Tactical Victory for Opposition

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 24

 BODY:
With a sweep of more than 200 arrests around the country, the military Government of Myanmar has succeeded in preventing a full-scale meeting this weekend of the democratic opposition party that won a parliamentary election six years ago but was never allowed to take power.
In doing so, it may have handed a tactical victory to the opposition party, the National League for Democracy, and its charismatic leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. They have regained the limelight that was in danger of fading, and their claims of repression have been vividly underscored. 
 The arrests have been condemned by the United States and Japan, two of the most important investor nations in Myanmar, formerly Burma. And they have given a lift to an effort under way in Congress to enact economic sanctions against the Southeast Asian nation.
At her home in Yangon, the Burmese capital once called Rangoon, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said today that she did not believe that such sanctions would harm ordinary citizens there. "I certainly will not protest against them, not the way this Government is behaving," The Associated Press quoted her as saying.
The White House criticized the clampdown, saying in a statement, "We have strongly protested these arrests to the Burmese authorities and have warned that a continued crackdown would lead to further deterioration in our already strained relationship." And on Thursday the Senate banking committee opened previously scheduled hearings on two bills that would impose far-reaching economic sanctions on Myanmar.
In Tokyo, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda demanded the release of those arrested and said their continued detention could discourage Japanese investment.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said the planned three-day meeting at her home would proceed symbolically on Sunday even if only a handful of members could attend. She said the number of arrests since Monday had risen to 217, including 195 of the party's elected delegates and 15 members of a youth wing who were helping organize the conference.
In 1990 her party won 392 of 485 contested seats in Parliament, but the junta refused to honor the results and continued to rule by decree.
In a statement distributed to reporters in Bangkok today, the Government, known formally as the State Law and Order Restoration Council, said the arrests were meant to prevent "disturbances and riots."
"The measures are taken with a view to maintaining stability, as the recent preparation for convening a conference of N.L.D. may endanger the stability and tranquillity strenuously and successfully restored during these years," the statement said.
In a reminder of the powers wielded by the military Government, the statement, quoting the Deputy Minister for Information, U Thein Sein, referred to the events of 1988 in which hundreds of people died in a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations.
Mr. Thein Sein's remarks, which were presented as the text of a news conference in Yangon on Thursday, described the opposition as jealous that the country was developing economically under the military Government and criticized it for hampering that development by supporting economic sanctions.
He added, "Those who were called in for questioning were not arrested but were being accommodated comfortably at guest houses."
The diplomats said it remained unclear whether the authorities would move directly against Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi or the party's 10-member executive committee, which has been gathering at her home. It was also uncertain whether those arrested would be freed once the time of the planned meeting passes.
The diplomats in Yangon and other foreign analysts said it appeared that nearly a year after Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from six years of house arrest, Myanmar was entering a new period of increased tension.
In recent years the Government has opened the economy and eagerly sought foreign investment, while keeping a tight rein on political expression. Analysts said that after freeing Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi in July, it had hoped that human rights protests would wane and that her movement would be marginalized.
"The N.L.D. has clearly decided not to lie low and go quietly away," a diplomat said. "I would not be surprised if this meeting is part of an attempt to maintain the profile of the opposition, as well as to keep it active as an organization. Things seem to be moving toward increasing confrontation, but what form it will take remains to be seen."

HEADLINE: The Bronx Is Up, the Battery's Down and the Fleet Is in Town

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
In his crisp dress whites, Lieut. Paul Durso plunged into the sea of pin stripes at the wood-paneled bar.
"Are you sure you want the Penn Club?" the bartender asked in that icy tone that all but screams, "You don't belong here." 
 Lieutenant Durso flashed his Penn Club membership card and ordered a beer for himself and a couple of buddies from the destroyer Arleigh Burke. Penn degree or no Penn degree, he is in the Navy now.
In the last few days, the city has been flooded by sailors who clambered off the ships that paraded up the Hudson River on Wednesday. The first-time visitors have spent their days boarding civilian vessels, like the Statue of Liberty ferry, and checking out civilian territory, like Times Square, Central Park and the Empire State Building. They have been noticed wherever they have gone. Those starched uniforms are hard to miss, different from the workaday crowd: more disciplined, more gung-ho, less stressed out.
But some bunks in the ships docked alongside the Intrepid Museum, at 46th Street and the Hudson River, are occupied by sailors from the New York area. They grew up humming the "On the Town" lyric about the Bronx being up and the Battery down. They know their way around by subway. They never thought of New York as Sodom or Gomorrah. And they have spent Fleet Week showing their shipmates the city New Yorkers know.
"Old haunts" is how Lieutenant Durso, who grew up in the Rockland County community of Pearl River, described the places he headed for. He decided to make his first stop the Penn Club, a watering hole for alumni of the University of Pennsylvania on West 44th Street, near Fifth Avenue.
"They were kind of shocked to see a bunch of sailors," said Lieutenant Durso, who attended Penn on a Reserve Officers Training Corps scholarship. "But it was nice to have a place to take your shipmates. They sure liked it."
Lieutenant Durso, 24, majored in European history and economics at Penn, but on the Arleigh Burke he is an engineer. He has responsibility for the 466-foot-long destroyer's hydraulic steering gear and her water-supply systems, which circulate drinking water for the sailors and coolant for the air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. "The Navy is great about training you to do anything," he said. "All you need is a positive attitude."
Lieutenant Durso oohed and aahed about the Manhattan skyline from the water. "This was the most special way I've ever arrived in Manhattan," he said. "Poignant."
Petty Officer Joseph Peisher of Clifton Springs, N.Y., near Rochester, spent his first day "on the beach" with Petty Officer Jeremy Thompson from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy. Mr. Thompson is a Vermonter who had never been to New York before. They headed for Times Square.
"It wasn't the same 42d Street I wasn't allowed to look at when my parents would say, 'Cover your eyes,' " said Mr. Peisher, an electronics technician on the destroyer John Rodgers.
Mr. Peisher noticed another difference: "It's cleaner. We just came back from Edinburgh. I couldn't believe the amount of trash there. I was expecting the same kind of thing, blowing newspapers and stuff, here."
Something Mr. Thompson said made Mr. Peisher aware of another difference. "Just walking down the street, he couldn't believe how many pretty women smoked," Mr. Peisher said. The antismoking laws had taken effect since his last visit, leaving the streets as one of the few public places where smokers can puff freely.
Ens. Jason Stevens, who grew up in Knox, N.Y., near Albany, lived in the Bronx while he attended the New York Maritime College. He headed for Hurley's, a restaurant on the Avenue of the Americas side of Rockefeller Center. Ensign Stevens had baked clams and shrimp "the size of giant whales," and chatted with landlubbers at the bar.
"Their only nautical experience had been racing sailboats," he said, "and they wanted to know what it was like to do it professionally."
He said he gave them the "straight scoop," something about "long hours and how it's kind of tough being away from home, but you definitely get to see some interesting places."
Were the people at the bar Navy material, and did Ensign Stevens succeed as a recruiter?
Negative on both counts. "I think," Ensign Stevens said, "they were past the age limit."

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Edge Higher As Holiday Gets Early Start

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks tiptoed higher yesterday, lifting some indexes further into record territory, as trading slowed before the holiday weekend.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 0.74 point, to 5,762.86, finishing the week with a gain of 75.36 points. The blue-chip average, which set new highs on Monday and Wednesday, was up nearly 37 points at the start of yesterday's trading before the advance faded. 
 Broad market measures were mostly positive, but the Nasdaq market was weighed down by the technology sector.
Analysts said there was little motivation for buying in a pricey market that has already ridden a wave of encouraging economic reports well into record territory.
"It's a meaningless day in terms of setting any agenda for where we're going," said John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security Benefit Group in Topeka, Kan. "Everybody's already on vacation and we're taking a break."
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slim margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 329.2 million shares, down sharply from Thursday's 431.9 million.
Although the market's advance was modest, it was enough to break some records.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 1.31 points, to 363.74, barely topping Wednesday's record finish of 363.69. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.51 points, to 678.51, edging Wednesday's record high of 678.42.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.27 points, to 613.95.
The Nasdaq composite index, which on Thursday set a new high, fell 0.85 point, to 1,247.80, as investors sold some high-flying technology issues. Two makers of disk drives, Iomega and Syquest Technologies, plunged after a weeklong rally based more on speculation than news. Iomega lost 6 11/16 , to 44 9/16 , while Syquest slid 7, to 10 7/8.
Investors took some profits on tobacco stocks, which enjoyed a big run-up on Thursday after a Federal appeals court rejected a class-action liability suit filed on behalf of millions of smokers. Philip Morris fell 3/8, to 103 1/2; Brooke Group was off 1/8, to 6 3/4, and Loews was unchanged at 82 1/8. But RJR Nabisco rose again, adding 1/2, to 33 5/8.
Among other issues, A. G. Edwards rose 1, to 24 7/8, after it said it planned to buy back up to 22 million common shares over the next five and a half years.
Systemix soared 7 5/8, to 18 5/8, after it received a proposal from Sandoz to acquire the remaining 27 percent of the company at $17 a share.
LSI Logic fell 2, to 30, after Robertson, Stephens cut its 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates for LSI.
Masland gained 1 1/2, to 25 3/4, after Lear agreed to acquire it in a deal valued at $26 a share. Lear also rose, gaining 2 1/2, to 37 5/8.
In Tokyo, Japanese stocks ended higher yesterday, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues gaining 74.35 points to close at 21,798.43. For the week, the Nikkei ended won 118.17.

HEADLINE: In Post-Cold-War Washington, Development Is a Hot Business

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
While foreign-policy makers have trouble even defining the post-cold-war era, Washington deal makers have already figured out how to make millions in it.
A cottage industry of consultants, business executives and lobbyists are tapping into one of Washington's least-known pools of money: international development banks. Foreign aid budgets are shrinking, but these banks are growing. Each year they generate some $30 billion in contracts. 
 And in the Washington tradition of revolving doors, former officials of these banks are taking advantage of the new business opportunities. The institutions, which are financed in part by American taxpayers, have much less restrictive rules on what former officials can do and how much they must disclose about their activities.
Those deals often benefit from another new trend of the post-cold-war era: the worldwide emphasis on privatization. Big public works projects that were once undertaken by governments -- from airports to water treatment plants -- now are often being done by private entrepreneurs.
"The cold war's demise removes the philosophical underpinnings for the earlier support of government intervention," said Moeen Qureshi, a former top official of the World Bank, who sees development banks acting now as "catalysts" for business executives like himself.
Consider the Inter-American Development Bank, which is owned by 46 nations and helps Latin American countries reduce their chronic poverty. It recently made available some of its billions of dollars in annual loans to private businesses, following the trend at other international lending organizations.
Last fall the bank entered into a first-of-its-kind alliance with a private group of investors whose advisers include several prominent former development officials, from Mr. Qureshi to Lloyd M. Bentsen, who served as Secretary of the Treasury in 1993 and 1994 and was a governor of the inter-American bank.
Now a businessman, Mr. Bentsen is helping organize a billion-dollar investment fund backed by giant corporations and pension funds. They hope to realize profits of as much as 25 percent a year by investing in Latin American power projects, telecommunications systems and toll roads, according to Mr. Bentsen.
In a turnaround, Mr. Bentsen went to Buenos Aires last March to attend the inter-American bank's annual meeting even though he was too busy to attend those sessions when he was Treasury Secretary. This year he went to entertain executives of the bank and potential investors who were attending the bank's annual meeting. However, Mr. Bentsen said, he has not been involved in actual negotiations with the bank.
When raising money for its fund, Mr. Bentsen's group makes note of its unique agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank, which offers information sharing and possible co-financing, and the previous ties of the group's mangers to various development banks, according to Mr. Bentsen and other fund officials.
"If the bank can provide comfort to investors in the project -- fantastic," said Enrique V. Iglesias, the inter-American bank's president. He hopes the agreement with Mr. Bentsen's fund will be the first of many such alliances.
But some bank officials and outside experts question whether a public bank set up to finance projects in developing countries that the private sector considers too risky should be helping wealthy private investors.
"The I.D.B. shouldn't be in the business of making life easier for the capital markets," said Jerome Booth, a former official of the Inter-American bank who is now head of emerging markets research for the Australian New Zealand Bank, a private bank. "It's in the business of helping development of countries, typically things like water, sanitation, health and education, not toll roads, telecommunications or power stations."
Moreover, the world of development banks is one of Washington's least regulated. Most lobbyists before Congress or the executive branch of Government must register and disclose their clients. In addition, Federal law limits or prohibits former officials from having substantive dealings with the Government agency that had employed them. None of these rules apply to the development banks. And though the banks are financed by governments, their loans face far less scrutiny from the public.
"These institutions are pretty opaque, pretty much beyond scrutiny," said Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.
The principal international financial organizations in Washington are the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Mr. Iglesias said in the interview that the inter-American bank would prod Mr. Bentsen's fund to follow its lead and invest in the region's neediest countries. But he acknowledged that he fears "money will only flow to the best projects" since Mr. Bentsen's fund's stated intention is to make 80 percent of its investments in the region's six richest countries.
Mr. Qureshi has told investors the fund hopes to generate returns of 20 to 25 percent.
"That's a genuinely high rate of return," said Louis T. Wells, the Herbert F. Johnson Professor of International Management at Harvard Business School. While the high rate may reflect the risky history of private projects in Latin America, it may, ironically, create even further risk, Mr. Wells contends.
"Its going to be questioned in the host country where somebody is going to say we could have raised this money a lot cheaper, " he said, adding, "It's an unfortunate dilemma."
While the inter-American bank's principal activity is to make development loans to member countries, it has become infected with private-sector fever, enthusiastically supported by the United States.
And in Latin America, where some $60 billion is needed each year for infrastructure, private capital is becoming the primary source of financing.
Last year, the Inter-American Development Bank lent $7 billion while the World Bank lent $12.7 billion. The inter-American bank also began making riskier loans to private capital projects last year as part of a program to lend up to 5 percent of its capital without any official guarantee.
This came on the heels of the bank's creation in 1994 of a new private sector department. And in 1989, 30 years after its inception, the bank set up a separate investment corporation, the Inter-American Investment Corporation, to lend to and invest in Latin American businesses.
The result of these changes has been an expanding new market, where contracts resulting from those loans are in the billions, whether they are made directly to private companies or governments.
"The multilateral development banks do $30 billion a year in contracts awarded by borrowers, and the banks give out another $4-$5 billion in consulting contracts," said Donald Strombom, a Washington consultant who advises companies on how to win these contracts. "It's a very sizable market. U.S. firms are getting more of the contracts but most U.S. companies don't understand the multilaterals." Mr. Strombom was once head of procurement at the World Bank.
Mr. Qureshi, the former senior vice president of the World Bank and chairman of the Washington-based Emerging Markets Corporation, agrees that now is the time to jump into private business using his old contacts with the banks. Since he left the World Bank, where he spent most of his career, Mr. Qureshi has avoided business dealings with it.
"I decided to work with the I.D.B. so nobody could say I was using my old contacts, although I've known Enrique Iglesias for 20 years, and I still know virtually everybody at the I.D.B. because we've been in the same field," Mr. Qureshi said.
After 23 years with international banks, he moved to the private sector in 1992 because "my feeling was that private sector institutions would be playing an increasingly important role in the flow of capital to the developing world," he said in an interview.
The brains behind Mr. Bentsen's Latin America infrastructure fund, Mr. Qureshi has convinced several of his colleagues to join him, including Donald C. Roth, the former treasurer of the World Bank; Everett J. Santos, who headed Latin American affairs for the World Bank's private sector affiliate, and Arnold H. Weiss, former general counsel to the Inter-American Development Bank.
But Mr. Qureshi also needed some deep pockets. He formed an alliance with Maurice R. Greenberg, the chairman and chief executive of American International Group, the largest international insurance company.
Mr. Qureshi joined the insurer's international advisory board, American International invested in Mr. Qureshi's corporation and the two groups formed an infrastructure investment fund for Asia.
With the Asia fund up and running, Mr. Qureshi and Mr. Greenberg turned their attention to Latin America. They brought in another financial giant as a sponsor: the General Electric Capital Corporation. G.E. and American International have pledged the first $300 million for the fund.
Why was it necessary for the Latin American fund to enter into an alliance with a public development bank like the Inter-American bank? Mr. Qureshi's answer: "They have a triple-A credit rating. We felt there would be a great benefit from having the the close relationship with the I.D.B., particularly in raising money. The I.D.B. itself can be a lender to some of the projects we invest in."
He also explained how the ties to the bank can reduce the risk that a country will renege on its obligations to private creditors.
"The risk is lower with the presence of a multilateral institution," Mr. Qureshi said. "Governments will think twice about reneging on an obligation where a public institution is involved."
The bank's agreement with the fund is mostly symbolic, but in the world of marketing, symbols are important, which is one of the main attractions of hiring former officials for these groups. It was Mr. Greenberg who enlisted Mr. Bentsen to help raise money for the fund: Mr. Bentsen sits on the board of American International, which is based in New York.

Lear to Buy Car-Parts Maker As Industry Consolidates
The Lear Corporation, a large supplier of car seats and other car parts, plans to acquire the Masland Corporation, a maker of car interior carpets, in a $384 million deal that reflects the changes and consolidation in the international auto parts industry. 
 Wall Street liked the acquisition, which valued Masland at $26 a share. Not only did Masland's shares gain $1.50, to $25.75, Lear's stock jumped $2.50, to $37.625. [Page 33.]
 
Mazda Squeaks Out a Profit
Mazda Motor, whose two years of heavy losses led to its effective takeover by Ford, returned to profitability, barely, in the latest fiscal year. But while the results indicate that Mazda is recovering, its health is not as strong as the bottom line would suggest. The gains came from stock and real estate sales, offsetting an operating loss from auto sales. [32.]
 
Orders for Durables Fall
Orders for durable goods fell 1.9 percent in April because of slack demand for aircraft, the Government said, as the sluggish recovery in manufacturing crept forward. The decline was larger than analysts had expected and was in contrast to March's increase of 2.6 percent. Orders for durables have declined in three of the year's first four months. [33.]
 
Stocks Edge Up in Quiet Trading
The stock market ended a record-breaking week with modest gains, as trading slowed to a crawl before the Memorial Day weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 0.74, to 5,762.86, finishing the week with a gain of 75.36. Some other indicators set records, but the Nasdaq market was weighed down by weakness in technology stocks. [35.]
Bonds got a lift from the drop in durable goods orders. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.83 percent. [34.]
 
Black Raises Southam Stake
Conrad Black is moving to increase his already sizable newspaper holdings in Canada, sharply raising his company's stake in Southam, which publishes The Montreal Gazette and The Vancouver Sun. [32.]
 
U.S. Pullback in Trade Talks
The United States signaled that it was withdrawing from the negotiations to liberalize world trade in maritime services, dealing another blow to the fledgling World Trade Organization. [32.]
 
Merrill's Retreat in Indiana
Merrill Lynch will refrain from selling securities for some Indiana agencies for two years because an official of the firm donated $1,000 to the Lieutenant Governor. [34.]
 
Unanimous Vote on Rates
Federal Reserve policy makers voted unanimously on March 26 to keep the overnight bank lending rate unchanged, minutes of their meeting showed. [44.]
 
Abbott Labs Settles Suits
Abbott Laboratories agreed to settle, for $32.5 million, lawsuits brought by 17 states that contended that the company had fixed the price of baby formula. Abbott said it continued to maintain its innocence but settled to avoid further legal costs. In one case, Minnesota sued after finding that formula prices had increased 130 percent from 1980 to 1993. The settlement represents Abbott's effort to put years of litigation over baby formula behind it. [34.]
 
With Texas Dry, Cotton Prices Rise
Cotton futures prices advanced with the July contract up 0.96 cent, to 82.55 cents a pound, as traders worried about a severe drought in the important West Texas growing areas. [41.]
 
Dollar Gains Against the Yen
The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen in early trading on reports that a Japanese finance official expected strong dollar gains, but the surge slowed later in New York. [41.]

How to say 'Grass Roots' In Russian

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
WHAT is 'chimichanga?' " asked the puzzled Russian visitor, who studied the menu at Los Tres Aztecas Restaurant on Rivington Street as if it were a nuclear test ban treaty.
It's sort of like a spicy blintz, an American said. 
 Too bad there weren't easy analogies for business improvement districts, community housing development companies and tenant patrols. The people who brought the world the dictatorship of the proletariat, communal flats and collective farms need pointers on starting volunteer neighborhood groups. Their interest is part of a newfound move to create the kind of not-for-profit agencies that in this country have provided housing and social services and restored sanity to chaotic communities.
That's why a dozen Russians ventured to centers for the elderly in Flatbush, renovated tenements in the South Bronx and union-sponsored cooperative apartments in Manhattan. They want to learn from this city's grass-roots champions how to become organizers who can rally their Moscow neighborhoods in the fight against privatization and poor government planning.
"Before," said Igor Kokarev, "we lived like an atomized society, organized only at the top of government." Mr. Kokarev, a filmmaker, is president of the Citizens Foundation, a Moscow group that is training organizers. "When we all belonged to government, we had free education, medicine, free funeral. Everything. But we had no right to even move a bench in our courtyard without getting 17 signatures to approve it. Now, government becomes much less powerful and citizens, especially tenants, feel abandoned."
In a country where "not for profit" applied to state-owned businesses, Mr. Kokarev finds that many Russians misunderstand the American do-good motive. These days money talks in Moscow, and people walk away from anything that smacks of the forced voluntarism of Soviet times.
"Sometimes people believe they are not able to change something," said Yelena Kudriavtsev, who runs a children's group in her Moscow neighborhood. "Of course the young people have to look for money. They don't have the opportunity to spend their time without being paid."
T HE Russians huddled under the patchwork shade of the trees lining Sara Delano Roosevelt Park as they learned about the poor planning that created a seven-block strip of green cut through by streets and ringed by sagging sidewalks. Representatives of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a resource agency for advocates, explained how they had helped a neighborhood coalition create a center for the elderly, and gardens, as well as designs for making the park more inviting to its Asian, Hispanic and Jewish residents.
"No one is trying to buy parts of the park to build something?" asked one visitor.
The fear of privatization is understandable, said Dan Karan of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a New York housing group sponsoring the visit. In the Moscow housing market, new millionaires are buying out families from communal flats, creating a bizarre income mix.
"Imagine a welfare mother and Donald Trump living in the same building," Mr. Karan said. "What an organizing challenge that would be."
THERE were no millionaires on their next stop, the grassy hills of Sunset Park, where lower Manhattan's skyline sprawled behind Brooklyn's steeples, row houses and factories. Tony Giordano, executive director of Sunset Park Restoration, explained the intricacies of building coalitions among the area's Irish, Italian, Hispanic and Asian residents.
He ambled down to a busy commercial strip on Fifth Avenue, where a few years back he had persuaded merchants to tax themselves and create a business improvement district to clean the streets, put up lights and improve security.
This, he said, is what an organized community can do with the help of volunteers.
"Any volunteer group that hires a worker for money loses its volunteers," Mr. Giordano said. "The things you do without personal gain give you greater gain."
"He's a socialist!" Mr. Kokarev said.
"I consider it direct democracy," Mr. Giordano replied. "Part of the problem in America is we've given away our authority to people who claim to have greater brains and greater hearts."
Across the street, an abandoned building with decals of plants and shades on its boarded windows stood as a reminder of past policy brainstorms. The Russians weren't falling for the Potemkin tenement. It was time to get real.

Downsized

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
'YOU SHALL MARK many a duteous and knee-crooking knave," says Iago in "Othello," "that . . . wears out his time, much like his master's ass, for nought but provender, and when he's old, cashiered." Such is "the curse of service."
If the Bard were writing today, the conniving Iago would be saying, "and when he's old, downsized." 
 Despite economic growth and low unemployment, the word that strikes fear into middle managers and white-collar worrywarts is downsizing. Though the word's connotation is positive when President Clinton speaks of "downsizing the Government," it has gained a pejorative aura when applied to layoffs of workers.
The word was born in a happy spirit. The United Auto Worker leader Leonard Woodcock was an early user, reported the quarterly American Speech, speaking of "the down-sizing, as G.M. calls it" on "Meet the Press" on Sept. 5, 1976. A month later, an ad for Ford LTD's in Southern Living asked, "Will 'down-sized' cars have 'down-sized' prices?" The raising of oil prices by the Shah of Iran in 1974 sped the need to reduce gas consumption, and Newsweek in 1978 reported "the rush to down-size cars to meet tougher fuel-efficiency standards."
In the 80's, when the verb about making cars smaller extended its sense to making work forces smaller, it was greeted with enthusiasm by stock analysts and met with narrowed eyes by unions and by easily replaced managers. Britain's Longman Register of New Words dates the current sense to 1987, defining downsize as "to reduce (a work force) in size by redundancy." (That can result from outsourcing, based on a similar formulation of direction-and-verb, outsource, meaning "to manufacture elsewhere," and causing workers to be outplaced.)
The obvious reverberant coinage was upsize, which made an appearance in an ad in the March 1983 Car and Driver. Its meanings, however, were "to enlarge, amalgamate, conglomerate, grow," as in the 1996 Variety headline about the ballooning of show biz: "The Upsizing of Hollywood." However, these related meanings are not the opposite of "to fire" in the current, personal sense of downsize. A newly hired person does not say cheerily, "I've been upsized," unless he has been putting on weight as well.
In "The Dilbert Principle," the cartoonist Scott Adams writes of his years of employment at Pacific Bell: "Companies realized they had to make downsizing sound like more of a positive development in order to keep morale high. This was accomplished through a creative process of inventing happier-sounding phrases that all meant essentially the same thing. 'You're fired' (1980); 'You're laid off' (1985); 'You're downsized' (1990); 'You're rightsized' (1995). . . . You'll see the following phrases used during the next five years: 'You're happysized!'; 'You're splendidsized!' "
The lexicon of layoff has a wide range. Cashier, the verb Shakespeare chose in the sense of "discharge," is from the French casser, "to annul," not from cassier, "to put in a money box" (which is why we don't cashier cashiers). The verb cashier is "to dismiss from a position of high rank, usually with dishonor." To dismiss is to let go without taint; to discharge lies between, to dismiss for cause but without tearing off epaulets and putting a reprimand in the 201 file. Sack, bounce, give the heave-ho and can are all informal synonyms for these verbs of peremptory riddance. The government bureaucracy's rif stands for "reduction in force" and imputes obedience to budget cuts rather than firing for cause. Walking papers is passe. Ax is still in use, a favorite of sports headline writers, and suggests that the owner doing the firing of the manager gets a sadistic kick out of the act.
All these are more vivid than downsize, which in turn has more blood in its veins than the recent restructure and re-engineer, leading to the even more vapid noun phrase work-force imbalance correction.
A counter-euphemism is called for to denote an opposite of dismissal. The language is struggling to come up with a verb expressing irate voluntary departure better than the currently muttered I'm outta here. Lexicographers can almost hear it now: "You can't downsize me -- I [future euphemism]!"

Duh

"Duh . . . N.F.L. Players Really Aren't So Dumb," read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal over an article about the measurement of cognitive ability given to football draft prospects.
Is duh considered paralanguage, like the uncertain uh or the interrogatory hunh? No. Is it what the sociologist Erving Goffman calls "a response cry," like ouch or yecch? Sometimes.
Most often, duh is an interjection, an exclamatory sound ejaculated for a lexical purpose -- that is, to convey a specific message. For that meaning, let us turn to Frank Nuessel, professor of classical and modern languages at the University of Louisville and the leading, and perhaps only, authority on duh.
"The interjection duh appears to have a general meaning of 'Boy, am I stupid!' " notes Professor Nuessel. "It may also appear as a 'tag form' at the end of a sentence, meaning 'Don't you think I'm behaving in a stupid (ignorant) fashion?' This usage implies another person in a conversational dyad." (Duh? Dyad means "pair.")
In one use, duh is a response to which the person does not know the answer. Person 1: "Do you know the square root of 1188?" Person 2: "Duh." (Meaning: "I don't know.") In the tag form, a person would say self-mockingly: "I'm really good at this. Duh!" (Meaning: "I really haven't the foggiest notion how to do this!") Here the interjection equals "Not!"
"The choice of this interjection is a calculated usage," Nuessel points out. "It represents a linguistic convention designed to symbolize ignorance. It differs from the paralinguistic form um because um is an automatic response while the use of duh is deliberate."
To avoid the need to assert ignorance, all I do is hit my Num Lock key and transform a portion of my keyboard into a calculator, thereby getting the square root of 1188. Done. So where's the square root key? Duh!

HEADLINE: How To Get To Mars (And Make Millions!)

BYLINE: By John Tierney; John Tierney is a staff writer for the Magazine.

 BODY:
[The urge to venture afar] arises from the threefold nature of man. One motive is fame, for it is the nature of man to journey where there is great danger, and thus win honor and praise. A second motive is curiosity, for it is also man's nature to see the things he has heard about, and thus learn whether they are as he has been told or not. The third is the desire for gain, for men seek wealth wherever they have heard that gain is to be gotten. -- FROM "THE KING'S MIRROR," A 13TH-CENTURY NORSE TREATISE
 WHEN HUMANS FINALLY ACQUIRED the technology to travel to another planet, it occurred to them that they didn't really want to go. A manned mission to Mars, the fantasy that had paid the mortgage for generations of science-fiction writers, lost its appeal as soon as NASA plotted the itinerary. The $400 billion price tag seemed absurdly high to a nation bored with the sight of astronauts lumbering around craters. We already had enough extraterrestrial rocks, thank you. 
 Recently, though, an intriguing modification to NASA's Mars plan has been suggested: ditch NASA. Let private explorers, modern Vikings inspired by the Norsemen's third desire, seek wealth on Mars. The basics of the expedition have been worked out by Robert M. Zubrin, who has his own research and development company, Pioneer Astronautics, in Denver. Since devising the technology for a simple and cheap mission to Mars, Zubrin has been traveling the globe giving passionate lectures about "our generation's New World." He tells audiences of the prizes offered by 15th-century Portuguese and Spanish rulers to entrepreneurs for venturing down the African coast and across the Atlantic. (Columbus's expedition was financed not only by Queen Isabella but also by private merchants who stood to gain trading concessions.) Zubrin thinks that if the United States Government were to offer a Mars Prize of $20 billion -- four times what he estimates a private mission would cost -- entrepreneurs would take the bait. If they made it to Mars and back, pocketing the prize, they could turn a nice profit; if they failed, taxpayers wouldn't be stuck with the bill.
The Mars Prize would be a bargain for the public, and not merely because it would cost so much less than a NASA mission. It would also have the wonderful consequence of making exploration interesting again. Unlike NASA's conservative officials, entrepreneurs couldn't afford to bore everyone with meticulously plotted test missions executed by bland technicians. They would have to take chances, risking their lives (or at least their employees' lives) with one bold venture, as explorers used to do. And because they would finance their mission by selling media rights and marketing tie-ins, they would have to appeal to the public's imagination. They couldn't go to Mars just to perform arcane scientific experiments and drop off a plaque with politicians' names. They would have to turn Mars, once again, into a dangerous and romantic destination.
The journey would be a multimedia entertainment package put together by someone like Joel Rosenman, one of the promoters of the original Woodstock festival and its recent sequel. Rosenman, whose venture-capital projects have included an expedition to salvage doubloons from a sunken Spanish galleon in the Caribbean, has no trouble imagining the commercial possibilities of a journey to Mars.
"Under NASA, space exploration has been a low-yield cash hog," Rosenman says. "To make a Mars mission profitable, you'd have to create a global consciousness. People have to be eating Mars cereal, listening to Mars music, entering Mars dance contests, watching Mars pay-per-view TV shows, driving cars with technology from the Mars mission. You'd want to put a celebrity in the crew -- Harrison Ford would be perfect -- or at least turn the crew into celebrities. I'd set up a betting parlor on the Internet where people could bet on everything from the temperature of the spaceship to which astronaut will be the first to catch a cold. Sprint would have Candice Bergen offering free phone calls when Mars was in a certain apposition to the Earth."
The Olympic Games, a three-week media event, currently generates close to $2 billion from television and marketing deals; packaged properly, the three-year Mars extravaganza might make considerably more. "A Mars mission could attract the largest global audience ever," says David Hill, the president of Fox Sports. "The Olympics are just the Olympics -- people running, jumping, throwing balls. Mars has figured prominently in man's imagination for thousands of years. It's the Red Planet, the God of War. Now it's the next logical step in human endeavor. The crew would be on live television traveling through space at 200 million miles an hour, and they could die at any moment -- it's the world's greatest soap opera."
A commercial Mars mission may sound impractical and undignified, but that's only because our thinking has been warped by NASA, which is an anomaly in the annals of discovery: the wilderness has not usually been conquered by bureaucrats. The best models for a Mars mission are provided by the kind of explorers who early this century raced to the North and South Poles -- regions that seemed as remote, inhospitable and useless as Mars does today. Forget all those cautious mission planners speaking NASA jargon to emotionally repressed astronauts. We need explorers with flair, adventurers like . . . Amundsen and Shackleton.

The Amundsen Approach
ZUBRIN IS BORROWING HIS MARS strategy from the greatest of the polar explorers, Roald Amundsen, the first man to reach the South Pole and the first to sail the Northwest Passage. Before Amundsen started his trip through the Arctic ice in 1903, dozens of expeditions had unsuccessfully tried to traverse the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The British Navy, the NASA of the 19th century, kept sending armored ships with scores of sailors and tons of salted meat, but the massive ships always ran aground or got blocked by ice, and when the food ran out the men would give up.
Norway, Amundsen's homeland, didn't have a grand navy; Amundsen had to pay for his own expedition. He spent his inheritance on a tiny old fishing boat and hired a crew of six. "Amundsen's expedition was by far the smallest one ever to attempt the Northwest Passage," Zubrin says. "He didn't go into the Arctic with 300 tons of salt pork. There wasn't enough room in his boat or his budget. As an expedition done with private money, it had to be, we might say, a pork-free mission." Amundsen was prepared to live off the land. When his ship got frozen in at the same spot where British sailors had perished, he and his men survived by using local Inuit techniques. They built igloos, wore fur underwear and hunted caribou from dog sleds. Eating heartily, the men proceeded all the way through the Bering Strait.
The Amundsen approach, as Zubrin calls his strategy for Mars, is nothing like the $400 billion Battlestar Galactica approach proposed by NASA engineers. NASA's ship, according to the 1989 plan, would have carried enough fuel for the round trip and was so big that it would have had to have been assembled at a space station. Zubrin prefers an expedition that would travel light and live off the land -- or, more precisely, the atmosphere, which would supply the Martian equivalent of Amundsen's caribou: carbon dioxide. The expedition would bring machines for converting Mars's carbon dioxide into liquid oxygen and methane to power the spaceship home. This local fuel would also power the utility vehicles used to drive around the Martian surface. Because the ship wouldn't have to lug so much fuel to Mars, it could be launched from Earth with rockets that have already been built and tested. Instead of NASA's 1,000-ton space liner, Zubrin proposes a pair of 120-ton ships; instead of a 30-year timetable, he thinks he could get there in as few as 6.
NASA was skeptical of the plan when it was drawn up six years ago by Zubrin and David Baker, both of whom were then engineers at Martin Marietta Astronautics. But once it became obvious that NASA's Mars scheme was unaffordable, the agency studied Zubrin's plan and provided $47,000 for him to build a prototype of the machine for converting carbon dioxide into rocket fuel. NASA's engineers, concluding that the Amundsen approach was technically feasible, drafted their own version of Zubrin's plan. NASA estimates that its mission would cost $55 billion -- a big improvement over $400 billion, but Zubrin thinks NASA could trim the budget to $30 billion by making do with less equipment and more spartan accommodations.
Even greater economies, though, would come from bypassing NASA's bureaucracy, which is why Zubrin and others have been urging incentives for space entrepreneurs. (Last weekend, the privately financed X Prize Foundation announced a $10 million prize for the first manned, completely reusable spacecraft that can take off on its own, rocket 62 miles above Earth and safely return to make another flight.) Zubrin figures that private explorers could get to Mars cheaply by cobbling together off-the-shelf equipment (like Russia's low-priced booster rockets), renting a launch pad and subcontracting NASA to perform some tasks, like tracking the spacecraft. He estimates that the whole mission could be done for $5 billion.
That's not much money by NASA standards -- the Apollo program cost 20 times as much -- but it's a daunting figure for private investors. To compete for the Mars Prize, explorers will need creative financing. To pay for the Amundsen approach, they'll need to learn from Ernest Shackleton, a charismatic Anglo-Irishman who became the greatest polar salesman.

The Shackleton Sell
ON JUNE 11, 1909, AS HIS SHIP approached the Italian port of Brindisi, Shackleton was pacing the bridge and talking to himself. He was returning to Europe from a failed and nearly fatal expedition. Poor planning had forced him and his men to stop about 100 miles short of the South Pole. Stumbling into ice crevasses, desperately sick and malnourished, the frostbitten men made it back to their ship by taking hourly doses of cocaine-laden "forced march" tablets.
If Shackleton had worked for NASA, he would have faced the scrutiny of Congressional committees and journalists. NASA's officials would have been advising him to be quiet. But as it was, the self-employed Shackleton was eagerly preparing for the European press corps clustered on the dock, muttering phrases in search of what he called the right "catchword."
"I've got it at last!" he finally cried out. "Death lay ahead and food behind, so I had to return."
A true pioneer: a man in 1909 searching for the right sound bite. Shackleton couldn't afford to be unquotable: he paid for his expeditions by mortgaging profits from media ventures. Before leaving for Antarctica, he auctioned off the news and picture rights to London newspapers; upon returning, he dashed off a book that was immediately translated into nine languages. Shackleton turned his expedition ship into a museum and charged admission. He sold special postage stamps with a cancellation mark from the Antarctic. He went on a 20,000-mile lecture tour, mesmerizing audiences with poetry and harrowing tales. Using the new media of his day, he made a phonograph record and showed the first movie of the Antarctic. Other explorers had similar commercial instincts -- Peary designed a brand of Peary North Pole snowshoes and outerwear -- but no one could match Shackleton's verve.
His hustling taught him a lesson that NASA hasn't yet learned: if you want to explore a place with no intrinsic value, you must create value. You need compelling characters and drama -- the kind of risk that NASA can no longer take. Manned missions have become tedious and prohibitively expensive because the agency's bureaucrats must take every possible precaution: one more accident like the Challenger explosion would doom their careers, perhaps the whole space program. A failed Government mission is always treated as a public scandal. When men died on a United States Army expedition to the Arctic in 1884, The New York Times dubbed it "The Shame of the Nation" and demanded that America stop financing this "folly." The paper's crusade helped force the Government to cease Arctic explorations -- and then, two decades later, The Times itself proudly underwrote Peary's expedition.
Folly somehow becomes acceptable if your own money is at stake. In fact, it can be an excellent career move. Shackleton's audacious misadventures in 1909 made him an international idol. His next expedition, when he was marooned in the Antarctic after ice crushed his ship, turned into an even more glorious failure -- perhaps the most astonishing survival epic ever told (and, of course, sold). The worst trips make the best stories. Apollo 11 was a marvel of technical precision; "Apollo 13" grossed $337 million worldwide.
Certainly no sane explorers would wish for disaster on the way to Mars. But whatever happens, they must have a Shackletonian knack for media exploitation. While Mars may be a more expensive goal than the Antarctic ever was, today's global markets offer much bigger returns to the explorer who can seductively package the trip.

Mars: The Sales Pitch
 THE FIRST VOYAGERS TO MARS WOULD spend six months getting there, two years exploring its surface and six months coming home. In selecting the explorers, the natural temptation is to ask: Who has the best chance of pulling through the three-year ordeal? That's the wrong question. That's how NASA produced all those scintillating astronauts. The first question should be: Who has the best chance of pulling the audience through the three-year ordeal?
Fortunately, the market has already come up with answers, starting with the optimum size of the crew. The most successful television shows about isolated groups -- "Gilligan's Island," "Star Trek" and "Lost in Space" -- all enjoyed long runs with rosters of seven or eight people. Sending a family to another world offers classic sitcom opportunities, as demonstrated each week on the new hit "Third Rock From the Sun," but the crew should also include unattached adults.
The Mars expedition leader must ignore the advice of Michael Collins, a former astronaut and the author of "Mission to Mars," a 1990 book proposing a crew of married couples. "An element of stability, of old-shoe comfort, would be introduced by having one's husband or wife to fall back on," Collins argues. "Certainly a singles-bar atmosphere, a charged mixture of sexually unattached competitors, would be a disaster." A disaster for whom? Take a look at the ratings for "Friends."
Each crew member needs the talents of an explorer -- physical stamina, emotional fortitude, technical resourcefulness -- and the charisma of a performer. Call it the Bright Stuff. To find the right candidates, and to generate publicity, the expedition leader can stage televised competitions around the world, testing candidates' physical, mental and telegenic skills: "American Gladiators" meets "Jeopardy" meets "Star Search." Finalists will spend a winter of competition in the Antarctic, the closest equivalent to the frozen plains and mountains of Mars. There, they'll hone their exploration and media skills while living in a model of the mobile home that will carry them through space and shelter them on Mars.
"The habitation module's design is inspired by the Bumble Bee tuna can," Zubrin says. "It's a can 27 feet in diameter and 16 feet tall, divided into two decks. The upper deck is laid out with rooms for the astronauts, a laboratory, an exercise area, a galley and a food-storage area that would double as a solar-flare storm shelter. The lower deck is more of a cargo hold, workshop area and garage for the rover that would explore Mars."
Whether they're traveling through space or living on Mars, the explorers will always be in front of cameras feeding live images back to Earth, which would reassure the audience of the mission's integrity. Unlike some exploring "heroes" -- Peary and Byrd -- the Mars adventurers won't be able to come home with tales of places they never reached. They'll have to make their money honestly. But at least they'll have lots of opportunities for profit. A few possibilities:
Corporate sponsorship. "Mars is a compelling platform for what we in the business call borrowed imagery," says Jay Coleman, the chief executive of the E.M.C.I. marketing company and an expert in special-event promotions. "If you're AT&T, it's a great way to align your brand with high technology and the future. When you see companies like Coca-Cola spending $40 million just for the right to say it's an Olympic sponsor, and then hundreds of millions more to buy time to advertise that fact, you have to assume that they'd pay a lot to be associated with Mars."
Marketing tie-ins. "I'd have a ball marketing the apparel, creating a whole new Mars look, selling the first sneaker to touch down on Mars," says Brandon Steiner, whose New York company is one of the leading sports marketers. "There'd be a collectibles market -- you could break a Mars rock into tiny pieces and mount each one inside a glass case. I'd love to see the spaceship going up with a Nike logo on it. Of course, a model of the spaceship is going to be a great toy, and Mars would be happening for kids in cartoons. If you do everything right, you could net maybe a billion every year of the mission."
Video games. Besides being lucrative -- their grosses exceed movie box-office sales -- video games create celebrities now that CD-ROM's feature real actors filmed on movie sets. The first Mars game, filmed during the explorers' training period, would come out well before the launch.
"Millions of kids will pay to play the game and start to think of the astronauts as their friends," says Tom Zito, the president of Digital Pictures, which has been filming members of the "Star Trek" and "Baywatch" casts for its popular science-fiction games. "Kids will be eager to follow the real mission when it starts on television -- especially if one of the astronauts looks like Cindy Crawford. Then you use video clips from the mission itself to make more games. The ultimate cool thing would be to put a robot with a camera on Mars, so you could send it commands and go out exploring the planet yourself, searching for treasures hidden by the astronauts. At the end of the game, you'd find a statue of Elvis."
Name that peak. Shackleton sensibly affixed the names of his patrons to the geography of the Antarctic. For about $34,000, William Beardmore got his name on a 100-mile-long glacier. What would Rupert Murdoch pay to put his on Mars's 2,800-mile-long canyon? How much for an 18-mile-high volcano named Mount Gates?
Mars on line. Technophiles pay to watch a Martian sunset, join the explorers in chat rooms or track the data streaming back to Earth, like the readings from the machinery converting carbon dioxide into methane. If the converter is running properly, the explorers should have enough rocket fuel to get home; if not . . . well, let's take a look at the crew members' pulse rates.
Mars TV. "The networks won't want to pay for access to the mission," says Av Westin, the producer who developed "Close-Up" and "20/20" at ABC. "But once cable pays and the public gets interested, they'll find a way. They'll probably save the purity of the news divisions by getting their entertainment divisions to put up the money. You want the astronauts doing a weekly news update show -- you know, 'Live from Mars, it's Saturday Night.' Then you want occasional documentaries. You need to produce a sense of drama, the way Geraldo did when he opened the Capone vault on live television, although you'd like it to turn out better than that. You could do a live show with a payoff at the end. You start out asking: 'Is there water underground on Mars? Are there fossils down there? Tonight we'll drill below the surface strata. . . .' "
The most popular television program, though, might be an extraterrestrial version of "The Real World," MTV's weekly documentary chronicling the personal lives of a bunch of young narcissists sharing a living space. To a casual observer, the footage of roommate squabbles seems dreadfully tedious, but it's one of the highest rated programs on MTV, a testament to the strange allure of real-life soap operas.
"The mission gives you a $5 billion set for a drama," says Rosenman, the venture capitalist. "You might even think about giving the explorers scripts, although with the right crew, the reality might be more compelling. We could become riveted to this thing developing between Florence and Greg when she was supposed to be sweet on Homer -- a timeless story of a love triangle, or of someone whose conscience is being tested for elasticity. Once you have a devoted band of addicts, everyone will start to care if Greg and Florence and Homer make it to Mars and back."
The uncertainty of the mission will complicate financing, of course, since investors will be leery of a project that could end at any moment. But if investors take the truly coldblooded, long-term view, they'll realize that even an utter failure -- the loss of all eight explorers on the way to Mars -- wouldn't necessarily mean financial ruin. Like the failed expeditions to the poles, a Mars disaster would fascinate the public, sell books and movies and inspire sequels. New competitors would be tempted by Mars's deadly glamour. Billionaires bored with mountain-climbing expeditions and America's Cup yachts could race one another to Mars. But to succeed commercially, Rosenman says, a Mars mission must at least seem to be grander than a sporting event.
"You can't trivialize this massive effort to reach another planet," he explains. "The ancillaries fizzle if the audience thinks you're doing it just for the heck of it. You need a larger reason to get there -- a Hollywood twist like the Mars mission as the only way to divert an Earthbound asteroid, or chemicals in the Martian soil believed to cure cancer. As with my salvage operation in the Caribbean, the entrepreneur has to ask: What is the motivation? What is the Martian equivalent of those Spanish doubloons?"
That's a difficult question. Mars, at first glance, seems to have nothing of value. But Zubrin is ready with an answer. His plan comes complete with doubloons.

Our Favorite Martians
 ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGES IN science fiction is the conclusion of Ray Bradbury's "Martian Chronicles," published in 1950. It describes a family that has fled a holocaust on Earth. Their spaceship reaches Mars, uninhabited because its civilization of gentle extraterrestrials was wiped out by previous human invaders. The family lands and emerges from the spaceship next to a canal:
"I've always wanted to see a Martian," said Michael. "Where are they, Dad? You promised."
"There they are," said Dad, and he shifted Michael on his shoulder and pointed straight down.
The Martians were there. Timothy began to shiver.
The Martians were there -- in the canal -- reflected in the water. Timothy and Michael and Robert and Mom and Dad.
The Martians stared back up at them for a long, long silent time from the rippling water.
The dream of colonizing Mars, so popular for so long, today seems as quaintly anachronistic as the canals that previous generations of astronomers thought they saw on its surface. But Zubrin, as usual, has a new plan. He and Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center, propose to release chlorofluorocarbons into the Martian atmosphere. They figure that CFC's could jump-start a runaway greenhouse effect, warming the planet, melting its polar caps and thickening the atmosphere with carbon dioxide released from ice and soil. Humans could then walk around the surface without pressurized suits, and as trees and plants produced oxygen the atmosphere would eventually become breathable.
"Relative to the technology we have today, Mars is no more hostile to us than America was to Europeans in the 1600's," Zubrin says. "Granted, the transportation costs are higher -- back then a middle-class person could pay for the passage by liquidating his assets. But the costs will come down quickly once somebody makes the first trip. If a developer could persuade a research station to sign up as an anchor tenant, he could start a small settlement with its own greenhouse and build from there."
To advance his theory, Zubrin likes to quote Frederick Jackson Turner's classic essay on the American frontier. "To the frontier the American intellect owes its striking characteristics," Turner wrote in 1893, arguing that the "stubborn American environment" nurtured creativity because it offered "a gate of escape from the bondage of the past."
Zubrin sees only one new frontier capable of providing that escape again. "Mars is far enough away to free its colonists from intellectual, legal or cultural domination by the old world," he says. "It's rich enough in resources -- water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, metals -- to give birth to a new world. Having a planet of refuge could be of enormous social use. It would reinvigorate civilization on Earth with its new ideas, just as America reinvigorated Europe. In human history, free dynamic societies have existed only during the four centuries of frontier expansion in the West. Without a new frontier, our civilization is doomed to stagnation."
Mars as the new America, Mars as the only hope of civilization: here are some serious doubloons. Here is sufficient motivation to ennoble any Mars mission. And if the Mars-as-America analogy later turns out to be wrong -- if a Mars colony isn't practical during the next few centuries -- the mission will have served a fine purpose anyway. Posterity will enjoy a new exploration saga, probably more stirring than the Vikings', maybe even as good as Shackleton's.
The Antarctic's recent history, in fact, may be the best guide to Mars's future. Although it failed to become a hot spot of colonization after being charted by the polar explorers, Antarctica has nonetheless been a boon to humanity. Government scientists, taking advantage of the risky trailblazing done by private explorers, have set up research stations that have yielded vital data for today's environmental debates. And another group of people has followed the explorers. Arriving in cruise ships during the Antarctic summer, clad in identical bright red parkas, these visitors clamber on the white cliffs and take pictures of one another posing with penguins. Mainly wealthy and elderly, they fatten up on buffet dinners along the shores explored by Shackleton. In his direst moments, stumbling in the snow and popping cocaine tablets, Shackleton probably never imagined that he was risking his life to make a continent safe for geriatric tourists.
If the destiny of Mars, too, is to be an adventure-travel package, an exotic segment of the entertainment industry, then the first humans to land will experience something quite like the famous moment in "The Martian Chronicles." When the explorers disembark in front of a television camera and address the audience back home, they won't have to imagine what future Martians will be like. They'll see the Martians staring back from the monitor of their own camera: local guides showing foreign customers the sights, standing next to an interplanetary tour bus as they pursue the Vikings' third and most enduring desire.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
On Maui, Free Splendor On the Outskirts of Luxury

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
THE famed 50-mile highway that winds around the northeastern coast of Maui to the town of Hana strikes many who drive it as more an amusement park ride than a road -- one hair-raising lane most of the way, with 600 tight curves and 56 battered bridges spanning fast-flooding streams that course down the rain-forested flanks of the Haleakala volcano. Roadside barricades don't look formidable enough to keep a grocery cart from crashing over the sea cliffs to the breakers below; sweeping vistas of the coast tempt drivers to take their eyes off the road, and frequent rain squalls slick the pavement, leaving behind a litter of bright orange African tulip blossoms.
Few thrill seekers reach Hana Town unsatisfied by the trip (which takes about two and a half hours from Kahului Airport on the north coast of Maui). But because Hana is on the rainy side of the island and there isn't much to the little country town (population 1,895) besides a luxury hotel, most day trippers feel let down when the ride is over. In fact, one morning as I was standing at the bulletin board outside the tiny Hana post office, a man in a rented car pulled alongside me and asked, "Which way to the center of town?" 
 I paused, trying to decide how to break it to him that he was in the center of town. Then I tried to cushion the blow by telling him about the barbecued chicken and ribs served as part of the $8.95, all-you-can-eat lunch buffet at the Hana Ranch Restaurant and by describing a red sand beach nearby where he could swim -- if he didn't mind nudists.
I'm fairly sure that, regardless of anything I said, he was going to do what most day trippers do when they reach Hana -- turn around and drive back to the sunny west side of the island, where there is no shortage of shops, resorts and tourist attractions. But I confess that I threw in the nudists to speed him on his way, because most day trippers look askance on clothing-optional beaches. By that time I had been in Hana, on the isolated east coast of Maui, long enough to know that it is nicest when there aren't too many people around.
I spent six nights there. This is longer than I usually stay in any one place, but it gave me the chance to watch Little League tryouts at the Hana Ball Park (which is naturally greener than Astroturf), to sample shave ices (as they call snow cones) in the full spectrum of tropical flavors from Tutu's snack shop at Hana Bay and discuss bait with fishermen on the pier, to sing old familiar hymns in Hawaiian during Easter Sunday services at Wananulua Church (founded by Congregationalist missionaries from New England in 1838) and finally to understand why people put bumper stickers on their cars that say Thank God for Hana.
Actually, people have been thanking God for Hana for at least a millennium -- beginning with the early Hawaiians who settled in large villages along the coast, growing taro, building paved roads and lava-rock temples called heiaus, spinning legends that persist in place names and waving to Captain Cook when he sailed by in 1778.
A century later, planters from Europe and America found the flowing eastern skirts of Haleakala fertile ground for sugar cane, and imported workers to tend the fields from China, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. By the 1930's Hana's population had swelled to an all-time high of 3,500; the Hana Highway had been built; the town had two movie theaters, three barber shops, a Buddhist temple, the landmark Hasegawa General Store (which opened in 1910) and a beautiful ethnically mixed face. Indeed, one of the most striking exhibits in the little Hana Cultural Center near the bay (admission free) is a bank of large photographic portraits of town residents with names like Iwalani Librando Castro, Elizabeth Redo Tanaka and Solomon Hoopai Jr.
But like the heiaus, the sugar mills are mostly unmarked tumbledown ruins now, closed in the 1940's. At about that time, 14,000 acres of stubbly fields surrounding Hana were sold to an entrepreneur from San Francisco named Paul I. Fagan, who planted pangola range grass to feed herds of Hereford cattle shipped over from the island of Molokai and branded with the five-pointed Hana Ranch star. The cattle still graze right above the 96-room Hotel Hana-Maui, which was built by Mr. Fagan in 1946 (but has changed hands several times since). Oddly, steaks sold at the Hana Ranch Store are frozen (and along with all other imported comestibles, extremely expensive), leading one to suspect that lowing cattle are largely set dressing.
These days, high-end tourism seems to be what keeps little Hana tenuously afloat. And I mean high end, because standard rooms at the luxury Hana-Maui cost $395 a night; Sea Ranch Cottages at the hotel have private hot tubs and cost $525.
Hana caters to guests who frequent the hotel and pays rather offhand attention to day trippers, known locally as "rent-a-car tourists." Of course, this posed an irresistible challenge to me because I love to find reasonably priced ways of hanging around the edges of expensive resorts. So a month before leaving, I called Waianapanapa State Park, set on 120 acres bordered by sea cliffs and a small black pebble beach about five miles north of Hana; the park's 12 rustic cabins are extremely popular, which is why I was lucky to get one of them for just a night at $45. Then I phoned several vacation rental firms in Hana and found two options I could afford -- the downstairs unit in a house called Hale Kipa for $90 from Blair's Original Hana Plantation Houses (where I stayed for two nights before moving to the state park), and a little studio apartment at the rear of a bayfront home called Hale Waikoloa for $65 from Hana Alii Holidays (which I booked for my last three nights in town).
Hale Kipa turned out to be a nicely kept, modest, brown-shingled duplex out of sight of the bay but within earshot of the surf. The downstairs unit was a bit dark, and like everyplace else I stayed, haunted by mosquitos (I had packed insect repellent). A wide wood lanai surrounded by blooming heliconias and hibiscus gave way to the spacious interior, which had sleeping quarters with a double bed, a television room cooled by a ceiling fan, a bath and well-equipped kitchen. In the driveway there was a barbecue grill, and at the side a fenced-in hot tub.
I tended to start my mornings on the lanai at Hale Kipa with coffee and a papaya purchased for about $1 at one of the little unattended fruit and flower stands dotting the roads around Hana. Then I'd run the 2.5-mile trail that winds through pastures above the Hotel Hana-Maui, explore the precarious, ironwood-shrouded paths around Kauiki Hill, which forms the south arm of Hana Bay, or climb to the cross honoring Paul Fagan atop an old volcanic cinder cone just west of town. It didn't really matter where I roamed, because there was always something to occupy me -- like watching calf-roping practice at a ring below the headquarters of the Hana Ranch, grocery shopping at the jammed Hasegawa General Store and, best of all, swimming at the red sand beach on the south side of Kauiki Hill. Reached by a steep path, this small beach hugs a dramatically eroded cliff and is fronted by a row of jagged black rocks, forming a beautiful protected pool favored by lovestruck couples, scruffy campers and unself-conscious families frolicking in the buff. (The clothed are welcome as well.)
In the afternoon, I'd take a dip in my hot tub, clean up and then wander over to the Hotel Hana-Maui to admire the displays of coral in the airy lobby and have a mai tai for $7.25 in the Paniolo Bar, where I liked to imagine how the people at the tables next to me had made their money. One night I watched the Hawaiian show in the main dining room featuring members of the hotel staff (free, from a couch near the entrance to the restaurant). On another I splurged on dinner there, choosing one of the least expensive entrees -- lovely Thai chicken in almond and red wine sauce, which came with taro rolls ($23.50), accompanied by a glass of white wine ($7.50).
After living like this for two days, I admit it was something of a jolt to check into Waianapanapa State Park cabin No. 10, a plain green, boxy building set among pandanus trees, with a porch where there was a picnic table, garbage can and mop hanging over the balustrade to dry. Inside was one big room with a kitchen, a table and two single beds, another room with two bunk beds and a bathroom with a shower. Freshly laundered sheets were ready to be put on the beds; the linoleum floor was cracked but basically clean, and spigots yielded hot water. So I put a few red ginger blossoms in a juice pitcher and settled in.
By the time I got around to exploring, the day trippers had all gone home, leaving the rough little black stone beach, lava tube caves and the path that winds along the rugged coast to me and just a few other overnighters in the clusters of cabins in the park. That evening the most luminous full moon I've ever seen rose in the sky, and early the next morning while perched on a little ledge in the cliffs and doing nothing in particular, I saw a whale spout and then breach about a hundred yards out to sea.
To me, a whale sighting is hard to top -- though the remnants of a heiau (listed on the Hawaiian Register of Historic Places) in the front garden of Hale Waikoloa almost did. Beyond the breezy brown house lay a stone-lined curve of Hana Bay, and to the side there was a fish pond. My little studio next to the garage was very private -- one small room (with a bath alongside) holding a plump double bed, small table, television and kitchenette, all nicely finished in wood. Outside my door was a hibachi on which I barbecued a steak one night, a table and chair where I ate a plate of pasta primavera on another and a washer and dryer. The guest book revealed that a young man and woman had decided to get married while staying there.
BY the time I moved into the Hale Waikoloa studio, I'd seen most of the sights in Hana, so I ventured about five miles south to Hamoa Beach, a pretty scallop of white sand with gentle surf, frequented by guests from the Hotel Hana-Maui. South of that, the lush, rolling countryside along the Hana Highway opens up, providing exquisite views of coast and mountain all the way to the Kipahulu area of Haleakala National Park, a finger of land that stretches southeast of the volcano's crater to meet the Pacific about 15 miles south of Hana. In the park I hiked two miles on a popular, well-maintained path up along a streambed to Waimoku Falls, passing through magical bamboo groves along the way, and took a swim in the pools at the mouth of Pipiwai Stream. A mile south, I found the simple, bucolic Palapala Hoomau Congregational Church on an isolated spot near the sea cliffs where I paid my respects at the grave of Charles Lindbergh, who spent his last years on the Hana coast. I turned back toward Hana when the paved road devolved into gravel.
Actually, the rough road continues all the way around the southeast coast of Maui. But I didn't think the little Geo Metro I'd rented (from Alamo Rent a Car at Kahului Airport, for $133 a week) was up to the trip. And, frankly, I needed to get back to Hana, because it was time for my afternoon visit to Tutu's, where for $1.75 you can choose two flavors to coat each half of a huge snow cone. Among other combinations, I tried pineapple-lime. But it is my considered opinion that banana-cherry is the best.
 
The bottom line in and around Hana
During my trip, I spent an average of $102 a day, $70 of which went toward accommodations. In Hana there are a number of activities available -- like kayak-and-snorkel tours of Hana Bay lasting two hours for $59, (808) 248-7711; horseback riding around Hana ($29.95 an hour, for reservations stop at the the social desk in the Hotel Hana-Maui); or three-hour horseback trail rides in the Kipahulu section of Haleakala National Park for $95, for information call Oheo Stables, (808) 667-2222. But those prices discouraged me. Most of what I spent apart from accommodations went toward groceries, available at steep prices from both Hasegawa's and the Hana Ranch Store. If you drive to Hana from Kahului Airport, it's wise to purchase somewhat less expensive staples in the town of Paia on the Hana Highway.

 Getting There
To get to Hawaii in late March, I contacted a consolidator called Cheap Tickets, (800) 377-1000, and got a round-trip fare from New York to Honolulu for $584. I flew on T.W.A., with a stop in St. Louis. However, when I checked in April T.W.A.'s lowest round-trip fare from New York to Honolulu cost $515, traveling on Tuesday or Wednesday, with a 14-day advance purchase.
Should you happen to be going to Hawaii from Los Angeles or San Francisco, check the Sun Trips charter company, (800) 786-8747, which has a round-trip Los Angeles-Honolulu fare of $239. For interisland flights, try Mahalo Air, (800) 462-4256. My trips, from the Big Island to Maui, and from Maui to Honolulu, cost $49 each. Mahalo can also book rental cars; in April the airline got me an economy-class Geo Metro from Alamo at Kahului Airport on Maui for $133 a week. Hana has its own tiny airport, served by Island Air, (800) 323-3345; there are two flights daily to and from Honolulu, priced at $81 each way.
Dollar has an office at the Hana Airport, (808) 248-8237, where full-sized cars are $299 a week; smaller cars can be requested, but Dollar cannot promise their availability.

King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden are to visit Ellis Island on Sept. 10 for the exhibition's official opening. Information: (212) 363-8340.
 
To Quebec by Boat

 Q. We are thinking of traveling to Toronto in July. Do any boats travel from Toronto or a city near Quebec? -- Ben Yen, San Francisco
 
 A. While there are no cruises to Quebec starting in Toronto, there is a six-night, seven-day cruise along the St. Lawrence River originating in Kingston, where Lake Ontario flows in the St. Lawrence.
 The trip, aboard the 66-passenger Canadian Empress, is operated by St. Lawrence Cruise Lines, 253 Ontario Street, Kingston, Ontario K7L 2Z4; (800) 267-7868. Service for this season was scheduled to start last week and the last trip of 1996 to Quebec City is to depart Oct. 19.
 En route, the ship stops for visits to the Antique Boat Museum in Clayton, N.Y.; the Frederic Remington Museum in Ogdensburg, N.Y., and Fort Wellington in Prescott, Ontario.
 The fare, based on double occupancy, is $1,223 to $1,620 (in United States currency), with the rate depending on the location of the cabin and the season.
 To get from Toronto to Kingston, you can drive or take Via Rail. Departure times include 10 A.M. except Saturday and 11 A.M. and noon daily. Running time for the 158-mile trip is 2 hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes. Boarding the ship does not start till 5:30 P.M. The train fare is $71 for first class and $40 for economy, plus tax; if you travel any day but Friday and Sunday and book at least five days in advance, the fare is $24.40.
 Passengers interested in shorter trips from Kingston can take the cruise to Ottawa (five nights) or Montreal (four nights). PAUL FREIREICH

Risking All On a Dream Of Renewal

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland 

 BODY:
AMERICAN ORCHESTRAS ARE FEELING justifiable anguish about the future, but some of them are doing intelligent soul-searching. The Pittsburgh Symphony has gone to its constituents, asked them what they need and offered its services. The St. Louis Symphony has answered the call for more arts education by buying its own school. The problems in Detroit are considerably worse, but this city's orchestra is attaching its fortunes to the Detroiter's dream: urban renewal.
Orchestra Hall, renovated and acoustically sound, reopened six years ago, but its lonely presence on the near-wasteland of Woodward Avenue has carried with it as much despair as joy. Hope comes now in the form of real estate; the performing-arts organization turns entrepreneur and developer and sees salvation in its business acumen. 
 The Detroit Symphony has quietly bought up eight acres of adjacent land in recent years and is going into partnership with the city school system and with one of the area's major employers. First, the orchestra will add to its own building. (Backstage facilities for musicians have been a form of camping out.) The public school system will build a performing-arts high school next door. And the Detroit Medical Center, which is affiliated with Wayne State University and operates seven hospitals, a nursing home and various outpatient centers around the city, will move its corporate headquarters into a new 175,000-square-foot office and retail building.
Symbiosis is the watchword for this triumvirate. Rooftop parking for employees will give way after dark to concert parking for patrons. A restaurant seating 250 is being talked about; galleries and music and book stores are part of the plan. The city is enthusiastic. So is the corporate community. The philosophy for Detroit's renewal goes like this: establish strong enclaves at various points downtown, and they will eventually reach out and join one another.
It is not the first time Detroit has tried to rescue itself from decay. The giant retail complex called the Renaissance Center, which was bought last week by General Motors, was to have revitalized the inner city, but it remains a kind of self-contained fortress, not easy to get to, more or less keeping the rougher neighborhoods around it at bay. Mark Volpe, the Detroit Symphony's executive director, says that Orchestra Place (as the new complex will be called) is designed to reach across adjacent streets and draw the city toward it. It's a nice thought and a big job.
The Detroit Symphony has had a rocky recent history: deficits, labor problems and hostility from lawmakers at municipal and state levels. Elected representatives of heavily black areas have asked what the orchestra does for their constituents and questioned the spending of public money for an organization they see as relevant only to a privileged, mostly white minority. Michigan "outstaters,"people living north and west of Detroit, have traditionally resented the large amounts of tax money poured into this troubled city. Governor John Engler, himself from "outstate," cut the orchestra's annual state grant from $5 million to $2 million. The city's contributions have gone from $800,000 a year to zero.
The Detroit Symphony's problems are familiar but unusually severe. The retreat of the middle and upper-middle classes to the suburbs and the reluctance of prosperous patrons to cross imaginary boundaries at the edge of the inner city at night have not reversed themselves. Musically, on the other hand, the orchestra is on sound footing, with a distinguished music director in Neeme Jarvi, attendance now at about 78 percent and activity in the recording studio.
Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- along with the utility companies, law firms and parts suppliers who share their work -- drive this city. So the fortunes of the Detroit Symphony will forever fluctuate with those of the Big Three. The orchestra raises $8 million in operating expenses a year, $1 million coming directly from the auto manufacturers.
The school, to be built on 2.5 acres donated by the orchestra at a cost of $28 million, comes through a bond issue already approved by the city. The Detroit Symphony's share of the $80-million Orchestra Place project adds up to $52 million, with local banks most likely financing the $30 million office building. Twenty million dollars for the Orchestra Hall extension and $2 million more for added amenities will depend on philanthropy. Quiet commitments have already been made, Mr. Volpe says, but risks exist.
The symphony has been using recent surpluses to pay off an accumulated debt, and like most of its colleagues, it is involved in an endowment campaign. The bill for Orchestra Place will be added on. The endowment, now at $25 million, is aiming, Mr. Volpe says, at "the $40 or $50 million range."
The performing-arts school, four years old and operating in cramped quarters elsewhere, has a current enrollment of 500, which will grow to 800. Symphony musicians will come from next door to help with the teaching; so, too, visiting soloists. Construction on the office building is to start this summer. Hall expansion and the school come a year later, according to present plans.
Current wisdom says that inner-city revivals come less from business and industry than from arts and entertainment. Mr. Volpe points to Cleveland's Playhouse Square and its Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame, and then to Detroit's renovations of the Fox, Gem and State Theaters, the Music Hall and the Detroit Opera House. This is a city whose savage breast has need of soothing, so music, he hopes, will play on.

Freedom's Law
 The Moral Reading of the American Constitution.
 By Ronald Dworkin.
 404 pp. Cambridge, Mass:
 Harvard University Press. $35.
Ronald Dworkin, one of the most distinguished constitutional thinkers of our time, offers us a collection of his previously published essays that is both eloquently written and forcefully argued. It is, moreover, a set of essays whose substantive threads evoke mixed emotions in readers like me who admire his staunch defense of the traditional freedoms of speech and conscience but who question his endorsement of state regulation, often by default, on matters of property rights, economic and religious liberties. His selective invocation of "Freedom's Law" -- freedom of speech and conscience but not of contract and association -- illustrates one of the great unresolved tensions, and weaknesses, in modern constitutional doctrine. 
 Mr. Dworkin divides his essays into three broad groups. Part 1 addresses "Life, Death and Race" and chiefly defends the soundness of the legalization of abortion in Roe v. Wade. Part 2 is devoted to "Speech, Conscience and Sex" and offers an impassioned defense of broad reading of the First Amendment. Part 3, "Judges," reproduces his sustained if overwrought attacks on the Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas -- essays that stand in stark contrast to his affectionate closing remembrance of Judge Learned Hand, for whom he clerked just after law school.
Thematically, these essays are linked together by Mr. Dworkin's frontal assault on the "historical" or "originalist" view of interpretation, which purports to limit the scope of the great constitutional clauses to specific vices identified by the framers. For Mr. Dworkin, what the Constitution says, taken at the highest level of philosophical abstraction, must direct our interpretive efforts. The crabbed imaginations and hidden reservations of the draftsmen count for naught. So what if the authors of the equal protection clause debated its merits before segregated galleries: its underlying principle -- equal concern and respect for all citizens -- drives us inexorably toward the Court's 1954 banning of school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education. So what if states routinely enforced anti-sodomy laws in 1868, at the adoption of the 14th Amendment? Only rank prejudice keeps them in place today. No historical practice can block the inherent moral argument.
Mr. Dworkin's approach works best on pornography and academic freedom. He rightly stresses that freedom of speech is a high-risk enterprise. The Constitution offers no guarantees to the speaker whose most cogent argument falls on deaf ears. Nor does it comfort an audience bound to endure speech harshly offensive to its deepest beliefs. Starting from these premises, Mr. Dworkin effectively demolishes Catharine MacKinnon's ill-conceived and overbroad anti-pornography ordinance, and his fine essay, "Why Academic Freedom?" forcefully explains why private universities, even though not bound by the First Amendment, should reject the "hate speech" codes that could readily inhibit the free and open exchange that nourishes independent thought. His defense of a vibrant, open and tolerant society is one of which John Stuart Mill could be proud.
So far, so good. But Mr. Dworkin should have then marched on to explain fully how the First Amendment digs into the next level of knotty disputes: national security, government employees, public records, use of public streets, parks and facilities. His moral dictates rightly exclude certain irrelevant considerations from the constitutional calculus. But they do not tell us how to incorporate other relevant considerations -- public order, public places and public employment -- into the law. If you want guidance on what books a school board can remove from its libraries and why, you'll have to look elsewhere.
Mr. Dworkin is still less successful in using his libertarian theme to justify a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. The obvious objection to this position appeals to the countervailing interest of the fetus. Mr. Dworkin parries by introducing a contrived and counterintuitive distinction between "derivative" and "detached" condemnations of abortion. The derivative view -- which might better be called the "realist" position -- refers to the fetal interest "in staying alive and a right not to be killed." The detached view protects the fetus only "as an objective or intrinsic good, a value in itself, quite apart from its value to the person whose life it is or to anyone else."
Mr. Dworkin claims that abortion implicates only the weaker, detached interest. But why? Conception is at least as relevant a break point in the unfolding of human life as are consciousness and sensation. If people have, as Mr. Dworkin himself does, ethical qualms about abortion, isn't it because they embrace the "derivative" (or "realist") view? Today the law protects the fetus against attacks by third persons on just that view. Mr. Dworkin's constitutional case, therefore, depends on showing how the mother's interests trump those of the fetus -- a balance Mr. Dworkin never troubles to defend. Indeed, his penchant for philosophical generalization only accentuates the tension in allowing abortions in the teeth of a general prohibition against inflicting harm on others. Mr. Dworkin seeks to bolster his position by noting that the legislature cannot make the fetus into a constitutional person by stipulation, any more than it could a tree or a monkey. But monkey or tree does not become human: a fetus has that potential long before viability.
The chinks in Mr. Dworkin's philosophical armor are revealed by his limited topic menu. "Freedom's Law" does not address the palpable tension between the free exercise and the establishment of religion. To give both religion clauses grand readings risks placing them on a collision course. But giving them no reading at all undercuts Mr. Dworkin's claim to constitutional universality while leaving unaddressed the modern controversies over school prayer, religious displays on public property and public aid to education in religious schools. We need to hear more.
More strikingly, Mr. Dworkin dismisses the Constitution's takings and contracts clauses with the terse observation that conservative judges (he does not distinguish between majoritarian and libertarian) "will naturally interpret abstract constitutional principles in a conservative way, as they did in the early years of this century, when they wrongly supposed that certain rights over property and contract are fundamental to freedom." His ex cathedra pronouncement has no empirical backing. And his curt dismissal of property and contract rights blocks any interpretive answer on how he would sustain the now ascendant distinction between the preferred freedoms of speech and (perhaps) religion and the lesser freedoms of association and economic pursuit.
Why this selective acceptance of freedom? Why not seek the most general moral principle behind the Fifth Amendment, "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation"? Imagine how American law would look if the takings clause reached the common forms of land-use regulation (that is, large lot zoning), or precluded wealth redistribution by taxation. Stunned? But note that some elements of a Lockean defense of property are easily assembled. The framers defended property to reduce the power of the state and, following Madison, to control the dangers of faction. As the guardian of other rights, private property protects both free speech and religious association from government regulation and retaliation and thus advances the liberties that Mr. Dworkin rightly prizes.
Other omitted interpretive issues illustrate the same theme. What is the scope of Federal power under the commerce, bankruptcy or copyright clauses; sovereign immunity or Federal-state relations; Presidential power; or the amendment process? All these issues are getting hotter by the day. And all raise the question of whether and how separation of powers and federalism can help secure essential individual liberties.
Sensing difficulty, Mr. Dworkin tries to meet the charge that his philosophical method assures him of a set of "happy endings" by countering that his constitutional views require him to defend positions that he personally abhors. But to make good on the promise of "Freedom's Law" he would have had to venture forth from his favored bastions to explore the entire Constitution, including those key clauses whose broad sweep goes against his intellectual grain. By sticking so close to his emotional home, Mr. Dworkin illumines one corner of freedom's map, but only at the price of leaving large portions of its terrain unexplored.

HEADLINE: Why Trust Went Out the Window

BYLINE: By Jim Sleeper; Jim Sleeper, the author of "The Closest of Strangers: Liberalism and the Politics of Race in New York," is at work on a new book about race.

 BODY:

IN DEFENSE OF GOVERNMENT
 The Fall and Rise of Public Trust.
 By Jacob Weisberg.
 209 pp. New York:
 Scribner. $22.
A lmost despite itself, Jacob Weisberg's engrossing "In Defense of Government" perpetuates a confusion that has bedeviled other recent attempts to defend the relatively strong public sector that Americans have had since the New Deal. "We need an activist government more than ever to heal the injuries of race and to reverse our growing stratification based on class," writes Mr. Weisberg, a political columnist for New York magazine and a contributing editor of The New Republic. And his preface defends this claim with an account of the Gautreaux program, a court-ordered fair-housing initiative that has successfully placed approximately 7,000 black inner-city Chicago residents in white suburbs. 
 "But if we aspire to use government for such ambitious purposes, we must first repair it," he adds. "The loss of public faith is a complex phenomenon, but it is based on realities. Until we overthrow those realities, we cannot hope to win back the public's trust. . . . Government has a problem of ends as well as means. A fundamental reconsideration is now called for." Liberalism, he writes later, "must recognize that 'social progress,' however noble an idea, is not, and cannot be, the primary function of government."
Well, which is it? Should we "repair" government and reform its means in order to continue its pursuit of "ambitious purposes," as Mr. Weisberg seems at first to suggest? Or should we redefine its very ends in order to "overthrow" the "realities" -- which Mr. Weisberg portrays vividly -- of government's failures to ameliorate racial and class divisions? "It is my contention that while the conservative critique of government is incoherent and at times transparently dishonest, most of the replies liberals have offered are insufficient," Mr. Weisberg writes, promising "to lay out an alternative approach" in the final chapter. While his accounts of conservative hypocrisies and liberal failures are acute, nuanced and sometimes revelatory, his alternative approach comes down to prescriptions for repair and a call to revive "nationalist fellow feeling" through carefully delimited, if energetic, public initiatives.
The early-20th-century Progressive prophet Herbert Croly rides again in this book, as he already has in John B. Judis's "Grand Illusion," Michael Lind's "Next American Nation" and E. J. Dionne Jr.'s "They Only Look Dead." Mr. Weisberg clips Croly's statist, centralist wings more than Mr. Judis and Mr. Lind do: he counsels government to accept rather than try to forestall many of the risks and inequalities that are inevitable in a free society. But like his recent predecessors, Mr. Weisberg means to vindicate an "affirmative government" that does more than provide basic public services and outlaw racial discrimination.
The devil is in the details, however, and Mr. Weisberg's portrait of the Gautreaux litigation against Chicago's shamefully segregated public housing exemplifies his, and our, problem. His father, to whose memory his book is dedicated, was one of the attorneys who prosecuted the suit, he explains, and the author's interviews with its beneficiaries are the book's only direct accounts of ordinary Americans whose faith in government, or lack of it, he wants to address. Mr. Weisberg acknowledges that the Gautreaux program worked only because its champions' ambitious intent to build scatter-site housing projects in white neighborhoods was stymied by massive opposition. That forced the program's implementers to place individual black families quietly in existing housing in white areas, using so few vouchers that only the most disciplined, almost entrepreneurial applicants managed to obtain them. By Mr. Weisberg's own account, these admirable single mothers found decent white landlords and neighbors thanks to a program that had become highly selective, unobtrusive almost unto secrecy and hence impossible to replicate on a large scale.
If there is a lesson here for affirmative government, I'm not sure what it is, and Mr. Weisberg barely returns to Gautreaux in the rest of his book. Americans' loss of faith in court-ordered, bureaucratically driven government is a "complex phenomenon" indeed. Absent fresh public reckonings with race, class and the delicate balance of rights with responsibilities -- reckonings that turn-of-the-century Progressives often fudged and that modern liberals have bungled -- the nation is far from a politically viable alternative to conservatives' outright avoidance of these great challenges.
It is when Mr. Weisberg recounts all this bungling and avoidance that his book is most convincing. His anatomy of the Republicans' and the Democrats' factionalism, their campaign financing and their manipulations of race and class demonstrates that the two-party system doesn't give us the new approaches we need. In one brilliant chapter, Mr. Weisberg foresees a Republican "crack-up" stemming from the irreconcilable if often disguised conflict between the party's libertarian free-marketeers, like the House majority leader, Dick Armey, who seek a minimalist state, and what Mr. Weisberg calls its "authoritarian" conservatives, like William Bennett and Pat Buchanan, who champion government's role as a guarantor of moral and civic order. Meanwhile, Mr. Weisberg ridicules "pseudolibertarians," like Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, who try to paper over the conflict; he likens such Gingrichian flourishes as the Contract With America to the posturing of a "circus weightlifter hefting a plaster barbell" and the exertions of a "crazed used-car salesman."
Mr. Weisberg is equally scathing about "reactionary liberal" Democrats like Mario Cuomo, "economic populists" like Representative Barney Frank and "economic nationalists" like Ruy Teixeira of the Economic Policy Institute, accusing them of demagoguery and an "obsessive" advocacy of economic redistribution. In his view, "paleoliberals" talk the talk of organizing grass-roots movements but resort to courts and bureaucracies to dodge the hard public choices inherent in reforming welfare programs and racial remedies.
By casting as elitists and racists the responsible critics in the Democratic Leadership Council who seek to balance government entitlements with individual responsibilities, the traditional liberals, in Mr. Weisberg's account, have squandered their chance to win broad support for universal public health care, initiatives in education and effective government action against stark discrimination and exploitation. Mr. Weisberg portrays President Clinton's synthesis of these contradictions in his New Covenant as little more than a campaign strategy as disingenuous as Mr. Gingrich's Contract With America.
Mr. Weisberg would curb the liberals' redistributive, protectionist and racialist initiatives in order to restore credibility to limited public interventions against both chronic unemployment and corporate welfare. Liberals, he writes, should abjure governmentalism by accepting the realities of risk, by "underpromising," by killing discredited programs, by curbing bureaucratic extrapolations of vague Congressional mandates and by putting a ceiling on government's claims on the Gross Domestic Product. The best guide to the recovery of national purpose, Mr. Weisberg says, is Croly, but he is unclear about how we might follow him: "Whether a third party is the appropriate vehicle for New Progressives is a matter beyond this book's scope," as is discussion of some other national movement.
New political leadership that convinces most Americans that government is sometimes needed to liberate individuals from exploitive private interests won't come from Mr. Weisberg's own cohort of New Progressive writers but, if at all, from a Theodore Roosevelt, as it did in Croly's time. Such a leader would have to cut through the unresolved contradictions in Mr. Weisberg's book, but he or she would profit by studying it.

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Connie Hogarth;
22 Years as a Champion of Political Causes

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
VIETNAM, Indian Point, disarmament, South Africa, South America -- the list of causes that Connie Hogarth has fought for and been arrested for seems almost endless.
For 22 years, Ms. Hogarth, a resident of Hastings-on-Hudson, has headed the Westchester People's Action Coalition, known as Wespac, a White Plains-based, grass-roots organization, which she helped to found. She has marched on too many picket lines to count and has been arrested about 20 times, both close to home and in Washington. Now, at the age of 69, she has announced her retirement as Wespac's executive director, effective sometime over the next few weeks. But Ms. Hogarth says her days as a political activist are not over. 
 Wespac will hold its annual Music Festival and Picnic on June 29 at Lamont Home, 116 Hawkes Avenue in Ossining. The number at Wespac to call for more information about the event is 682-0488.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Ms. Hogarth:
Q. Your father was a union activist. Tell me about your earliest memories of that.
A. My father, Stanley Holubar, was a motion picture projectionist, but his real love was music -- he played the organ and the piano in the silent movies. When he became involved with projectionism, there was a very strong union and he was very active in it. There were a lot of strikes in the 1930's, which is why the union was effective. Whenever there was a strike or a picket, I would walk the picket line around the theater with them. We had a lot of conversation at dinner about unions and union officials and strikes and the struggles. It was kind of a constant. And I guess at that early age it gives one a sense of your place in the world that goes beyond the family.
Q. Sometimes the reverse happens: a child who is exposed to liberalism goes on to rebel and become a conservative and vice versa.
A. Yes, that's true, but it was there; it wasn't forced on me. It was just something that was so much a part of the milieu. One other thing is my mother, Rose, who is still alive; she was no wallflower either. She was really an early feminist. Throughout my young school years, she was always involved in things and as a personality made her presence and opinions felt.
Q. Looking back on your years of activism, do you think the world is a better place today? Or have we just found new controversies to substitute for old ones?
A. I think it's one set of controversies that are replaced by another. That's never ending, especially when you are striving toward democratic goals. You know, there is one bumper sticker that I love that is on my car: "If the people will lead, the leaders will follow" -- which is to say that certainly in any democratic tradition you can't take anything for granted. If ever that were true we see it now, with the total abuse and absolutely out-of-control campaign financing and how that has affected who our leaders are. I'm hoping Wespac will get more into that issue than it has been.
Q. Is it harder to get people involved in the way, say, people got involved during the Vietnam War? Some of the issues you're concerned with may not strike people as being close-to-home problems.
A. Again, an old saw: think globally and act locally. That has really been a key part of Wespac's strength, I think. What we've been able to do is to create a link between some of the domestic struggles on social issues and our understanding of corporate power and military power. We did that on Central America, on the Middle East and now on Cuba, and it has developed tremendous new understandings, especially for young people. Of course, in the environmental area there is no such thing as a boundary between nations or states, and the oceans don't make a difference when you have something like Chernobyl happening. We think globally about Chernobyl and act locally about Indian Point.
Q. Looking back, is it one of your biggest disappointments that you have not permanently closed Indian Point?
A. It's really not a disappointment because the struggle there is so ongoing. I know we've made a huge dent. There is now a great awareness about the dangers of Indian Point in the metropolitan area. There is also a resurgence of interest locally in shutting it down. And it's becoming more and more clear that economically it's not beneficial to keep the plant operating. It's too bad that health and safety, which should be primary concerns, sometimes aren't as important as whether it's saving us money.
Q. Do you see this as Wespac's key cause?
A. Definitely not. There is really no key cause. There are a number of concerns that move back and forth on the front burner constantly, which is why the spectrum of work is so incredibly broad. For 8 or 10 years our primary concern was South Africa. If you want to talk about successes, as far as I'm concerned for the world we've seen a miracle -- the miracle of South African freedom. When we first started to get into that struggle, it didn't look very hopeful.
Q. What was Wespac's role?
A. A powerful role. As a grass-roots organization, we played an important role in all the protests, civil disobedience actions, at the Consulate, at Citicorp. And with the help of two County Legislators, Ernie Davis, who is now the Mayor of Mount Vernon, and Herman Keith, after a couple of years of pushing and pushing and educating, I would say that Wespac was responsible for the county voting not to put money in banks that did business with South Africa. That was a very enormous victory.
Q. So you took a case that was at first viewed as radical and stuck with it until it became mainstream?
A. Yes, but there are a lot of other causes like that. The gay and lesbian movement in Westchester was really launched at Wespac, and now it's a big operation. That's also true for the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion. They had a desk at Wespac until they grew and the movement, again, is today mainstream. Today we have a Haitian-support group using Wespac and growing.
You asked about major thrusts: for a long period of time, it was Central America and the work we were doing on issues of self-determination in Nicaragua and El Salvador -- fighting the funding for the contras. Then there was the Gulf War that became a major issue. I was also very much involved with the Jesse Jackson campaign and was on the national board of the Rainbow Coalition. I have to say that one of my biggest disappointments was not that Indian Point was not closed but that the Rainbow Coalition, in the context of how it was growing, was not maintained. The potential for change was so enormous, and if ever we need it we need it now. That was one of the saddest things in my life. We had it, and we dropped the ball -- partly because of Jesse, I have to admit.
Q. You've been arrested a lot of times. How do you define when civil disobedience should be used?
A. I think civil disobedience can be abused. You just don't go out and lie down on the street at any time. It has to be the activist's role of last resort. It's when all else fails. When you have leafletted your life out, when you've lobbied your life out, when you've protested with marches and rallies and you have not had movement forward. At that point, you make an attempt to have an impact on people who can understand that the commitment is so powerful and the need is so great. As Martin Luther King established very clearly, this can be a very effective tool for social change.
Q. Any particular cause you were arrested for?
A. The first one was during the Vietnam War. We represented 100 Vietnamese a day who were dying, and we lay down in front of the White House. I was with the New York group on that one. Then there was the B-1 bomber and there were only six of us and we blocked the White House driveway and had to be carried off. Then there was Seabrook, the New Hampshire nuclear Power plant. Then it was Shoreham. And that was another big victory. Then, of course, Indian Point. And South Africa and Central America.
Q. Now what will you do with yourself?
A. Clearly one doesn't change one's total direction. I'm not going to not be politically involved. I may be a little more involved in some of the electoral aspects, in alterative politics. I also want to do some writing, perhaps children's books, and my interest in music is very profound. There is a great deal out there I want to do politically and in the arts.

HEADLINE: Out East, Fierce Rivalry On Radio Dial

BYLINE: By MERYL SPIEGEL 

 BODY:
AS a college student in the late 1950's, Joseph J. Sullivan Jr. spent his summers on eastern Long Island driving a bakery truck and dreaming about starting the first radio station to cover the two forks.
In those days the only stations reaching the East End were in Connecticut, he said. There was WRIV-AM in Riverhead, but its signal was so weak that it did not reach his summer rental house 15 miles away on the North Fork. 
 "My landlady complained that she knew more about the people running for office in Connecticut" than in her area, Mr. Sullivan recalled in an interview.
Almost 40 years later Mr. Sullivan has created the first double station in the area, broadcasting on two frequencies from the same site, WLIE-FM, at 102.5, a country-music station, and WBAZ, 101.7, with a lightcontemporary music format.
WLIE, which went on the air in March, licensed in Bridgehampton, is the ninth FMstation on the East End, according to Mr. Sullivan. The number of stations reflects the tremendous interest in radio for an area of the Island that is still rather meagerly populated, except in the summer.
Broadcasting syndicates and wealthy second-home owners have identified the East End as a place to invest, particularly since Federal laws on radio ownership in one area have progressively become deregulated and the Federal Communications Commission, following a national trend, has released a number of new radio frequencies in the area in recent years.
Most local broadcasters agree that the market is quite lucrative during the summer season, when national advertisers place substantial ads on the air, but many question whether the year-round population can support more than the five stations that have survived up through the 1980's.
Many investors are "dreaming of gold that flows in the Hamptons," said Zoe Kamitses, general manager of WBEA-FM in Amagansett. But, she maintained, they "do not understand the seasonal nature of the business."
Robert Sargent Shriver 3d, a son of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and R. Sargent Shriver, and Derrick Sephas, a lawyer in Manhattan and a former state banking superintendent, started WBEA in 1993.
Business people are creating stations and buying existing operations because "radio is a hot investment," Ms. Kamitses said. "As long as you are breaking even, your equity is increasing."
According to the Long Island Regional Planning Board, the East End's year-round population is growing slowly, mostly on the South Fork. In 1995, there were 108,800 residents -- just 2 percent more than in 1990. During the summer months, however, the number almost triples. And by the year 2000, planners expect the five-year growth rate to increase to 7.3 percent, when there would be 116,800 year-rounders.
Until 1992, one company could not own more than one FM and one AM station in a particular area. But those limits, enforced by the F.C.C., have progressively loosened in the 90's. In February, President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowing one broadcaster to own as many as eight stations in a single market.
While industry experts say investors are responding to the loosening of federal regulations on group ownership, local broadcasters are wary of the new stations' longevity.
Paul Fleishman, general manager of four Long Island stations, including WHFM-FM, 95.3, in Southampton, an affiliate of WBAB-FM, 102.3 in Babylon, called the market in the summertime "very lucrative," but felt the area could "probably support only two or three stations very well." Each area has a finite amount of business, he said, and each time a new station goes on the air "the pie is carved up into smaller pieces."
The household density on the East End is far too small to support the number of radio properties there, agreed Tom Reilly, president of Long Island Multimedia, the owner of WLUX-AM at 540, a new "pop standard" station broadcast from Farmingdale.
Investors from other industries have a "romantic connection" with radio and see it as a chance to become associated with the entertainment business, Mr. Reilly added. It gives them a "certain panache" and a new level of credibility that works to their benefit in the Hamptons, he asserted.
"It's a frequency rush like the gold rush in the late 1800s," said Frank Sundram, the new general manager of WPBX 88.3, the public radio station transmitted from Southampton College. Two years ago, the 14-year-old station boosted its power from 1,000 to 25,000 watts.
Even the public radio arena is becoming more competitive. Last summer, WSHU, a classical music station transmitted from Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., began simulcasting its signal from the WLNG tower in Noyack in addition to locations in Selden and Dix Hills.
As the area grows, investors are hoping they can "hang on till the population catches up," Mr. Sundram added. What costs them $1 million to start a new station now, he explained, would cost $10 million when the market becomes viable.
Many local broadcasters complain that group ownership is homogenizing radio in the area and diminishing original, local programming.
Mr. Sullivan, of Peconic Bay, stressed that although nine stations cover the area, five are truly local, devoted to local news, weather, traffic and public affairs. Those include his two, WBAZ and WLIE, plus WLNG, WEHM and WBEA.
The other four have agreements with larger stations to pipe in programming from outside the area.
Several years ago, Hampton Bays' WWHB began simulcasting WNEW's rock music programming from Manhattan after it was purchased by South Fork Broadcasting, a company headed by Eddie Simon, the brother of Paul Simon.
Last fall, SFX Broadcasting, based in Manhattan, signed a contract to acquire Liberty Broadcasting, owner of 19 radio stations, including the four managed by Mr. Fleishman on Long Island -- WBAB/WHFM, WBLI in Medford, and WGBB in Freeport. Robert F.X. Sillerman is the executive chairman of the broadcasting company and the chancellor of Long Island University's Southampton College. The deal is pending F.C.C. approval and financial closure, Mr. Fleishman said.
As restrictions have eased, the F.C.C. has made available hundreds of new frequencies but it does not understanding the economic consequences, said Barry Umansky, deputy general counsel of the National Association of Broadcasters.
In 1992 the F.C.C. opened four new frequencies for the East End. It was "one of the more egregious examples" of adding stations without considering whether the area could sustain the additional stations, Mr. Umansky added.
Two of the channels have blossomed into stations, including WLIE and WLIR, 98.5, which came on the air in 1993. WLIR is an affiliate of WDRE-FM, 92.7 in Garden City, owned by Jarad Broadcasting of Garden City. It basically broadcasts the same rock format as its parent.
The other two frequencies, in Southampton and Calverton, have not been assigned. Eight companies, including out-of-town syndicates, are competing for those, according to James Crutchfield of the F.C.C.
One group, Women's Broadcaster's Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., is trying to extend a construction permit for another station, which was opened in Montauk before the new frequencies became available.
Local broadcasters say that because the Arbitron Company, which measures audience ratings, monitors a small number of year-round East End listeners, their statistics are not reliable for the area. Arbitron surveys include just 80 to 90 diaries from East Enders, according to Mr. Sullivan.
Shelly Cagner of Arbitron could not estimate how many East End listeners are represented in their quarterly surveys. The service's Suffolk East region is comprised of 160 diaries, she said, but its boundary extends west of Riverhead. East End stations are rated against all other stations on Long Island; the service does not provide separate ratings for the area.
The economic viability of an East End radio station is not a function of ratings, because most of them "don't even show up in Arbitron," explained Mr. Fleishman of WBAB/WHFM. And since there are only four summer months "to make money," he said, "it all depends on how well they can market their product and sell advertising."
Paul Conroy, general manager of WEHM-FM, 96.7, an adult rock station that started with celebrity fanfare in 1993, estimated that the market was valued at $2.5 to $3 million in revenue from local and national advertisers.
He added that WLNG-AM, 1600 kHz, and FM, which have a mix of top 40 hits, oldies and 24-hour live local broadcasts, probably generates the most sales in the region.
The general manager, Paul Sidney, agreed that banks regarded WLNG as the most successful station on the East End. Mr. Sidney, as well as other local broadcasters, would not release sales figures.
Known as a "vanity station," WEHM generated intense attention in 1993 when it began broadcasting from a storefront studio on Montauk Highway in East Hampton, where disk jockeys are visible to motorists who drive by. In the summer of 1993 Billy Joel visited the station to promote his "River of Dreams" album.
When the station was financed by several high profile figures, "people thought the gravy train was going to run through East Hampton with everyone's name on it," Mr. Conroy said.
The owner is the East Hampton Broadcasting Group, whose principals are Michael P. Schulhof, former president of the Sony Corporation of America, and Leonard Ackerman, a real-estate lawyer who represents well-known second-home owners and has owned stations in major markets, according to Mr. Conroy. Other investors include Mr. Joel and Christie Brinkley, he added.
Before going on the air, the owners hired two "high-priced consultants who were well respected from a programming perspective," Mr. Conroy said, but their expectations of the Hamptons marketplace were unrealistic.
"We came on very aggressively," he said. At first the station hired well-known news figures like Liz Smith and Pia Lindstrom. In the first year, the morning program featured Gary Lee Wright, the highest paid on-air personality on the East End, according to Mr. Conroy.
But, after about nine months, when "the dust settled," the management gained a "grasp on reality," and "people got off at stops along the way," he added.
They started to realize that the station broadcasts 12 months a year for the resident population and that for "13 weeks we become the playground for well-to-do homeowners," Mr. Conroy said.
WEHM has since cut back considerably. The station bought out Mr. Wright's contract; reduced the staff,from 32 to 8, and eliminated the news department.
The station initially had live local news 18 times a day. Now one of two disk jockeys writes and reads the local news at the top of the hour from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M.
WEHM has also changed, from "light adult contemporary," to "adult album alternative." After conducting a survey, Mr. Conroy said, "we found out that people didn't want generic radio."
Although the programmers continue to highlight current hits, they often go back to the late 60's, and they never play two current hits in a row.
Last year WEHM turned a profit for the first time, Mr. Conroy said, adding that the station earns 40 percent of its annual revenue from national advertisers who seek the summer crowds.
Although the station contracted, he said, "we've found our niche in the market."
"We've identified our listener and programmed the station to that listener," Mr. Conroy said, adding that the target market was local professionals from 25 to 44, with mortgages and children in local schools.
Down the road in Amagansett, Ms. Kamitses said WBEA went into the black last year, at the end of its third year on the air.
"We didn't start off with a grand scheme," Ms. Kamitses said. "We've been working close to bone from the beginning." She said she built the station on her own without interference from the two absentee owners.
Like WEHM, the station carries its year-round operations with summer sales to national advertisers. About half of its revenue comes from companies that sell products like beverages, movies and cosmetics to beachgoers.
The station has carved out a niche by developing "a marketing concept tailored to the beach," Mr. Kamitses said. And because "more and more of Manhattan is moving out here five days a week," WBEA has created a "Hamptons sound" that integrates local and city tastes of adults aged 25 to 49.
The "hot adult contemporary format" includes hits from the 80's and 90's, as well as "alternative" selections.
WBEA pays close attention to the local mood, she said, adding that it is not a vanity station, and "not a cookie-cutter station from outer space."
The station, Ms. Kamitses said, develops talent from within. "We are the Montessorri School of Broadcasting," she added.
The industry has experienced a complete turnaround, added Ms. Kamitses, a longtime radio professional on the East End. "In the old days," she said, "you wanted to sound like the big guy. Now local is it. You want to make sure you know where you are."
Running a double station is a cost-effective way to create a local radio network. With an investment of $200,000 for equipment that includes a link to two antenna towers, one in Noyack and one in Southampton, Peconic Bay can broadcast two stations from its headquarters, according to the station manager, Lauren Grant. Ms. Grant added that the company was planning to build a studio in Bridgehampton for producing public affairs programs for South Fork residents.
Both stations subscribe to Westwood One, a national programming service based in Los Angeles, and aim for the 25-to-64 group. But their music differs. WBAZ features a "light adult contemporary" format, and WLIE plays strictly country.
Mr. Sullivan said he had considered creating an all-news or oldies station, but chose country because it was the most popular format nationally.
Mr. Sullivan added that most of WBAZ's advertisers had responded well to a new sales effort to buy spots on two stations and double the coverage for less than 50 percent more in charges.
Peconic Bay, Mr. Sullivan's company, and East Hampton Broadcasting are vying for a new frequency in Southampton, 92.9 MHz, along with Connecticut Public Broadcasting, and Sabbath Inc., a religious network from Indianapolis.
If Mr. Sullivan obtains the license, he said, he plans to expand, perhaps with a classical station.
If East Hampton Broadcasting obtains the channel, Mr. Conroy said, it would most likely operate a duopoly similar to Peconic Bay's.
The managements of WEHM and WBEA said WLIE had not affected their listenerships or revenues. Because its programming arrives by satellite and the music has "no local feel," Mr. Conroy said, he is not concerned. In fact, he said, "it will get people talking about radio on the South Fork."
"I'm surprised it went country," Mr. Conroy added. "Just because it is the hottest format nationwide, it doesn't mean it is going to catch on out here, because the East End is unlike any other market in the country."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Mundy Scheme' In Croton Falls

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: CROTON FALLS

 BODY:
LEE POPE is crazy for Brian Friel. How else to explain the unearthing of "The Mundy Scheme," a trifle by the Irish playwright, which ran on Broadway in 1969 for 13 previews and 4 performances.
As owner-producer-curator of the Schoolhouse, an art gallery and an arts center here, Ms. Pope presented Mr. Friel's "Faith Healer" -- another Broadway failure -- in a production by the company Wordplay II in 1994. As a theatergoer, Ms. Pope is a devotee of Mr. Friel's honored plays: "Philadelphia, Here I Come," "Dancing at Lughnasa" and the recent "Molly Sweeney." 
 And as a tireless searcher for unsung plays in unexpected places, Ms. Pope recently found a used copy of "The Mundy Scheme" in an old book shop on Martha's Vineyard.
Herself a find in theater, Ms. Pope operates on pure instinct with an emphasis on pure and a disregard for practicality. She adores Mr. Friel, she said, because of his singular gift for language. And remember that last year, Ms. Pope presented John Steinbeck's "Burning Bright," which is about as obscure as a play by a great writer gets.
"Mundy Scheme" purports to be a political satire though economic is more apt than political and satire is here reduced to the level of a one-joke sketch.
Mr. Friel was not writing about the war in Ireland. His political aspect concerns the use of politics as pejorative, synonymous with guile, deceit and treachery. And the cast of characters consists of the Prime Minister and his scheming aides as well as his daft mother, whom he constantly berates.
Even though it could mean resuscitating the Irish economy, which has been in the pits for 700 years and is being written off as irreparable, the Prime Minister rejects intervention by the United States Defense Department.
Impoverished neutrality is preferable.
Then comes the Mundy Scheme, thought up by a real estate tycoon. It involves the leasing of remote unused land -- thousands of acres -- to be used as graveyards. Bodies will be flown from overcrowded cities the world over to be buried in Ireland, hence forth to be heralded as "The Eternal Resting Place" -- and a new world power.
So goes the scheme. The merchandising spinoffs -- air excursions to include two planeloads a week guaranteed, crematoria supplies -- are endless. So is the in-fighting among the cabinet members with their self-serving deals and manipulations.
No surprise. Mr. Friel was never at a loss for devilish word play -- the Minister of Finance talks of being "on the threshold of a great new abyss" -- but the pros, the cons and the convolutions of the Mundy Scheme, incessantly reiterated, barely sustain the first of two acts.
In a variable cast of 10, Steve Parris is a convincingly duplicitous Minister for External Affairs, and Dan Fitzgerald is an enjoyable mischievous Minister for Finance.
The lively staging is by Johnny Duncan, and therein hangs another tale. It is about how Ms. Pope transported Mr. Duncan from Vancouver, British Columbia, where she happened upon a theater he manages.
"Mundy Scheme" or no, Ms. Pope should not be deterred from scavenging bookstores and discovering directors wherever she goes.
"The Mundy Scheme" by Brian Friel at the Schoolhouse, 1 Owens Road in Croton Falls. Remaining performances today and next Sunday at 4 P.M. and Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. Box office: 277-8477.

HEADLINE: Belated Remembrance of the Forgotten War in Korea

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
IT has been called the forgotten war. Sandwiched between World War II and the Vietnam War, the conflict in Korea was relatively brief and the fighting fierce. Nearly as many Americans (54,259) died in the three years of fighting in Korea as in nine years of the Vietnam War (58,002), but Korean veterans have remained a comparatively silent and unrecognized group.
"It wasn't even called a war; it was called a police action," said Richard M. Hadad of Somers, who served in the 32d infantry and was stationed on Heartbreak Ridge in North Korea. "In addition to the dead, we had about 8,000 prisoners of war taken and about 3,000 who died in captivity. This was a major conflict. It was an infantry war, and it was fought mostly on the ground. It was a brutal war." 
 Until now, the county, which has monuments to honor veterans from World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War, had no memorial to honor those who fought in the conflict in Korea, which lasted from 1950 through 1953. But next month, ground will be broken in Lasdon Park in Somers -- also the site of the Vietnam memorial -- for a Korean War Memorial, which some veterans say is long overdue.
"The memorial is a commemoration of what we have gone through and done," said Seymour Lehman, president of the Westchester Korean War Veterans Association and a Yonkers resident. "If we don't have a memorial put up, no one will remember us, not only as individuals, but as a group, and what we have done."
The Westchester Korean War Veterans Association was formed only last year, though it is now one of the fastest-growing veteran's associations in the state. At the first meeting, 25 men showed up; there are now 157 members.
The fact that the county monument to Korean War veterans, who fought more than 40 years ago, is being built nearly 10 years after the memorial to the more recently fought Vietnam War is testament to the belated recognition that Korean veterans have received, some say.
The memorials in Westchester followed the pattern of those put up in Washington. The national Vietnam Memorial Wall -- a stark and powerful structure with names etched into black granite -- was dedicated in 1982. The national Korean War Memorial, which sits across the reflecting pool near the Lincoln Memorial, was not dedicated until last summer.
In fact, it was during the process of building the county's Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Somers in 1987 that the question of honoring Westchester's veterans of the Korean conflict arose.
"During the process of assembling the Vietnam memorial, I was often confronted with the question, 'Why Vietnam before Korea?' " said Richard W. Dwyer, chairman of the Westchester Veterans Memorial Committee. "I really didn't have an answer. So even during construction, we knew that the next step would be a Korean memorial." Mr. Dwyer said the Vietnam veterans in the county have been very supportive of the new project. The Lasdon Park site will be shared by both memorials, though the Korean memorial site is on an upward slope and will not be within sight of the Vietnam memorial.
The Korean War Veterans Memorial in Lasdon Park, designed by Mr. Dwyer, includes two bronze statues of soldiers on guard at a sandbag wall. It is meant to replicate a Korean War landing zone. Also included in the sculpture is a Korean war-era helicopter, which will be mounted above the rest of the memorial, as if it were carrying wounded American soldiers. A 48-star American flag will wave over the center of the site, from a pole surrounded at its base by plaques bearing the names of the 105 Westchester residents who lost their lives in the Korean fighting.
The monument is expected to cost about $300,000. Mr. Dwyer said his committee has raised more than $25,000 so far. They have received key donations from the Lasdon Foundation, a private family foundation based in Somers, as well as from the Korean Good Neighbor Society, a group of 25 Korean families from Rockland County who Mr. Dyer said wanted to show their gratitude for America's intervention. The committee plans to hold fund-raising events and solicit individual and corporate donations.
Over the last decade historians have debated the question of how to record the Korean War in American history. Controversy exists over whether to label the conflict a victory or a defeat, a brave stand against Communism or a costly stalemate. The delay in constructing a national Korean monument -- it took nearly 15 years for a design to be approved -- reflected the debate over how to commemorate the war. The original design called for 38 soldiers to march up a hill toward the American flag, with the postures and expressions of the soldiers reflecting the course of the war: early defeats, later victories and the final deadlock.
But veterans balked and called for a more patriotic memorial, honoring duty and service. The final design includes soldiers who are larger than life as well as a wall with engravings, and at the top of the incline, the number of the war's casualties, and the words, "Freedom Is Not Free."
No similar debate went on with respect to the Westchester memorial's design, and veterans expressed no ambivalence about the purpose of their service and the importance of their mission. "We did not win, but we did push the Communists back into the north," Mr. Hadad said. "The Communists had taken over the entire peninsula, and our job was to push them back where they came from. We did that, so essentially the fighting and the war was successful. We maintained the freedom of the South Korean people, and they're a thriving economy today."
Mr. Lehman concurs. "Not only did we stop the enemy, but if they had succeeded they would have taken over Japan, Australia and more. Our way of life today is like it is because we stopped them. We were there, and if we didn't stop them, nobody would have."
Mr. Dwyer said that the purpose of the memorial is not to make a judgment on the war but to honor those who served. "It is the desire of the committee not only to recognize the sacrifices of fallen and surviving comrades but to educate the American public of the terrible cost of warfare," he said. "We are not constructing monuments to warfare but the memory of those who served, and the principles for which they died must always be preserved and honored."
Mr. Hadad said it was grossly unfair to judge soldiers for flawed military plans. He said that Vietnam veterans were treated particularly harshly. His son served in the Navy in Vietnam, and together father and son traveled to Washington to visit both the Korean and Vietnam memorials. Now, he and his son will have a memorial they can visit in their own county.
"After 45 years, we're finally getting a memorial to honor us and to honor the dead," Mr. Hadad said. "Everyone sort of forgot about us, and now we're finally being recognized. I'm 66 years old, and I'm happy to be alive. I'm thankful for this country and for what I have. Sometimes I just feel, Why was I spared when so many others over there with me did not make it? I will never forget them, and that's why I support this memorial."

HEADLINE: What's Ahead For the Class of '96?

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, when Alison Slavin first passed under the imposing clock tower at New Rochelle High School here, she felt like most of the other freshman entering that fall -- awkward and overwhelmed. Today, the gargoyles on the clock tower are like old friends to the 17-year-old class valedictorian, but the picture gallery of distinguished alumni inside the school building still sends a chill down her spine.
Even for a class with six acceptances to Harvard University -- Alison is among them -- alumni like the following might seem like a hard act to follow: Dr. Henry J. Heimlich, class of '37, who developed the lifesaving Heimlich maneuver; Don Hewitt, class of '40, executive producer of CBS-TV's "60 Minutes"; Louis R. Rukeyser, class of '50, television journalist and economist; H. Jesse Arnelle, class of '51, lawyer and football athlete, and Alan Menken, class of '67, composer and lyricist, to name only some. 
 How will the members of the class of '96 distinguish themselves? It is a subject very much on Alison's mind these days as she prepares the valedictory charge to her fellow students. Most of the 575 graduates will go on to become the college class of '00 at the start of another millennium -- a new beginning that brings with it many responsibilities, she said.
Alison is a tall girl, the captain of the soccer team, with a quiet earnestness about her -- especially when she talks about the social issues that concern her and her friends. Like some of the other students, she presses hard for more AIDS awareness.
"In part, it is because my uncle died of the disease," Alison explained, adding that she is also worried about some of her friends who do not take the threat of AIDS seriously. Like her friends, the valedictorian is proud of the racial diversity of the student body, which is 47 percent white, 32 percent black and 17 percent Hispanic -- what she calls "a real sample of the world out there."
The ceiling of the front entryway to the school is lined with 65 flags representing the national backgrounds of 2,500 students. In brochures, the school calls itself New Rochelle "International" High School, and many students describe it as a mini-United Nations.
Indeed, some of the students' parents work in consulates in Manhattan. But educators at the sprawling school make a point of the fact that many pupils come from low-income housing complexes in the center of this city of 71,000 as well as from the expensive homes along the Long Island Sound shore and in the north end of town. "There is every problem here, every vision, every interest, every desire and conflict that you can imagine in the student body, and the potential for every level of greatness," said Michael A. Tedesco, a guidance counselor.
"Some kids come from healthy, caring homes, and others are carrying a lot of heavy baggage -- death, divorce, parents with AIDS or cancer," he said. "But tip-top kids know no ethnic, racial or religious limits. Good kids can come from any background if given a chance."
Principal Donald Baughman described New Rochelle's class of '96 as driven -- serious, hard-working and worried about finding their place in a rapidly changing world.
Not a playful or partying class, they are "pushing hard to take us into the next millennium," Mr. Baughman said.
"Maybe there is a sense that things need to be better, although I wouldn't call them crusading kids," he continued. "It's just that they seem so determined to make a difference."
Born in the late 1970's, the class of '96 is statistically still a part of what has been called "Generation X" (from the 1991 book by Douglas Coupland, St. Martin's Press) -- a group with no formal name and what many observers say are few distinguishing characteristics, except perhaps that they follow on the heels of a generation of baby boomers.
But these are students who have seen their parents, the baby boomers, lose jobs and who say that as a result they do not expect to work only for one company during their lifetimes. Melissa Langsam is one of those students. She is a petite 17-year-old who, like Alison, is Harvard bound. A serious student who started a nationally based magazine called "Common Sense" to foster debate, Melissa describes herself as one of the few Republicans in her class, explaining that "politically, most of us are in the closet here."
Most of all, Melissa says she worries about her generation's ability to find jobs in an economy that has downsized workers like her father, a banker.
"We have to make life fair, so everyone who wants a job can get a job," she said. "Kids today have to be prepared."
According to the State Department of Labor, Division of Research and Statistics, Melissa and her classmates are part of a generation that will fare best trying to find employment in the health, business, social and professional services industries, which will see the largest growth in the next decade.
It is also a generation more interested in pursuing education careers than law and engineering, according to a study by the University of California at Los Angeles. A 1995 survey of freshmen revealed the highest level of interest in education careers in more than two decades, with 9.7 percent of freshmen planning to become elementary or secondary school teachers, compared with 4.9 percent in 1982.
The university study, which is the country's longest standing and most comprehensive assessment of student attitudes and plans, also said incoming freshmen have become less interested in keeping up with political affairs, promoting racial understanding or participating in community-action programs.
It is what the survey's director, Alexander W. Astin, a professor at the university's Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, called "a growing sense of powerlessness" among students.
But students at New Rochelle High School seem to defy the statistical trends -- especially in terms of their involvement with social, political and racial issues. Savon Jones, 18, for example, who will attend Fordham University in the Bronx in the fall and pursue a pre-law curriculum, describes herself as strongly political -- although she is not necessarily allied with a party. A member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the president of the Black Culture Club at the high school, she invited the Rev. Al Sharpton to speak at the high school because she said that controversial figures "help people think about the world."
Justin Friedman-Hurvitz has a similar agenda. A dark, curly haired 17-year-old with earrings in both lobes -- who described himself as "the only Jewish kid on the New Rochelle basketball team" -- he plans to attend Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and study radio, television or film. He said he wants to make art that "breaks down the hypocrisy of bleeding-heart liberals, conservatives and members of the Christian Right."
Which of these students will become part of the school's distinguished alumni photo gallery in years to come?
Perhaps it will be Emeka Nwanze of Nigeria, an 18-year-old pre-med student who is on his way to Harvard and wants to become a cardiologist. Or Eytan Oren, 18, who is going to Columbia next year and wants to write music. Or Caroline Ohmer, an 18-year old with the dark looks of her father, a member of the Osage tribe, and her Colombian mother, who will study at the New York Institute of Technology on Long Island to become a teacher.
But social and political concerns among students notwithstanding, many educators in the county, including those at this school, observed that graduates this year were above all concerned about their ability to succeed economically.
"Most classes have personalities," said Dr. Barbara Gruen, coordinator of guidance services for the White Plains School District. "Some are givers, others are into causes. This class appears to be into working hard. Most of all, they're worried about their ability to get jobs."
Dr. Joseph S. Schwartzberg, director of occupational education for the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Valhalla, reported a growing sense of anxiety among students.
"Invariably, what is uppermost in their minds in this rapidly changing world, is, 'Will there be a place for me?' " Dr. Schwartzberg said.

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
Unlocking New Doors With Bonds

BYLINE: By BARBARA J. MOORE; Barbara J. Moore is a managing director in the New York office of the SEI Corporation, a global asset manager.

 BODY:
THE Treasury's adoption of "real," or inflation-indexed, bonds will provide an attractive alternative to conventional bonds for some investors, offering them precise inflation protection not currently available. The new bonds, the Treasury believes, will broaden the market for Government securities and eliminate the need to compensate investors for inflation risk.
In addition, the bonds now open the door for other governmental issuers. 
 State and local authorities with huge infrastructure needs have been crying out for new sources of capital, principally to pension funds and other institutional investors. Some pension funds have been actively seeking so-called economically targeted investments that will promote social welfare while still delivering an economic return, because the ultimate responsibility of pension funds is to current and future retirees.
Current capital improvement programs are frequently deemed to be "for the public good" and hence the interest payable is tax-exempt. The borrowers are thus able to secure financing with interest rates significantly below taxable interest rates. While this creates cheaper financing for public works, it comes at a significant cost to the taxpayer. These costs are beginning to receive closer scrutiny as a staggering amount of infrastructure waits for repair or replacement.
In addition to being quietly expensive for taxpayers, this form of financing precludes participation by pension funds and other tax-exempt investors, who cannot afford to accept interest rates significantly below those in the taxable markets.
The real bonds provide the opportunity to open new sources of financing for infrastructure while saving money for the taxpayer. Assuming the current Treasury payment structure and the suggested 3 percent real rate, the interest paid on real bonds would be about 50 percent of conventional bond payments at the outset. This debt service would gradually increase with inflation or decrease with deflation. Over its life, this financing would probably not be as cheap as current tax-exempt bonds for eligible issuers, but it could be cheaper than taxable bonds because there would be no premium for inflation risk built into the rate.
For projects whose bonds are repaid from tolls or user fees -- bridges, for example, or even baseball stadiums -- real bonds could be ideal. The initial fees could be set lower because the initial interest charge is less. The fees would then rise or fall as interest costs did, in line with inflation or deflation.
Indexing tolls to inflation would also ease a legislative burden. It is highly unpopular to raise tolls, especially in sporadic, "rounded" amounts -- witness the recent furor in New York City over the increase in subway fares from $1.25 to $1.50, versus a smaller percentage increase in commuter rail fares. New toll-collection technology, including automated vehicle identification and multiple-use fare cards like New York's Metrocard, will make it practical and more socially acceptable to collect tolls that rise with inflation.
This application of real bonds can be found in Canada with the Straits Crossing Finance bonds, issued in 1993. The proceeds are being used to build a bridge from the mainland to Prince Edward Island. Real bonds are also being used in Australia to help finance the Sydney M2 Motorway.
Financing toll roads, bridges and other projects on a real basis will be far more socially equitable than the present practice of burdening current generations with inflated nominal tolls and taxpayers with the cost of tax-exempt debt. With inflation-adjusted tolls, today's users will pay the same tolls in real terms as their children and grandchildren.

HEADLINE: IN THE WILD;
Ecotourism: Mixing Dollars and Environmental Sense

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Two incidents from the frontiers of ecotourism:
Item 1: On Sunday, Gil Mika, a state naturalist, was leading a wildflower hike through Wharton State Forest. Just as he was pointing out a flotilla of yellow cow lilies in the Mullica River, he was cut off by a voice booming around the bend. 
 "Spatterdock," called a man in a canoe, using another name for the cow lily as he delivered a nonstop lecture to the two children his boat. "There's some yellow club, those clusters of flowers on the white spikes. Up here you can see some lance-leafed violets . . . " He paddled out of earshot.
Item 2: This month, state tourism officials took half a dozen travel writers from Canada canoeing on the Batsto River as part of a campaign to persuade Canadians -- Canadians! -- to visit New Jersey for its open spaces and unspoiled scenery.
Superfund jokes notwithstanding, nature in New Jersey is more and more becoming serious business. This year, the Division of Travel and Tourism is spending a big chunk of its $2.6 million promotional budget pushing New Jersey as a place of natural wonder, including another wilderness trip for travel writers in June. A workshop on how to identify, protect and market the natural resources of the Skylands region drew 100 people to Warren County last fall.
State Senator Joseph Kyrillos, Republican of Middletown, organized an all-day Senate hearing on ecotourism in March and plans to introduce a series of bills next week to help develop the state's nature-based economy. Cumberland County adopted an ecotourism plan in February that includes everything from zoning changes to the suggestion that someone invent a greenhead pie (named for the vicious biting fly of the Delaware Bayshore) to compete with the shoo-fly pie of Pennsylvania Dutch fame.
Nor are the developments limited to mere plans. The Delaware Bay Schooner Project, a floating classroom docked on the Maurice River, has given school tours of the local maritime industry and the flora and fauna of the Bayshore every weekday day since it began sailing this spring. At the other end of the state, William Sheehan's pontoon boat has shown hundreds of people the marvels of the Hackensack River meadowlands since last June. The American Littoral Society's brochure of spring events this year includes, along with the guided tours of barrier reefs of Belize and Alaskan bear country, a trip to see the Red Knot migration on Delaware Bay.
"We're finally getting past the talking stage of people saying we need to do this and actually doing things," said Michael Catania, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Nature Conservancy, another driving force in the effort to develop the nature business. In the last several years, the conservancy has been erecting observation decks and building trails at the rate that some developers put up condos.
But just how big a part ecotourism -- defined by Ecotraveler magazine as "tourism that helps to create a dollar value on standing trees, live animals, intact cultures and intact rivers" -- can play in local economies remains to be seen. Today it is only a tiny fraction of New Jersey's $23-billion-a-year tourism industry. Its future will depend to large extent on the cooperation of state and local governments, environmentalists and business interests -- not always the most congenial of partners.
One corner of the state already has a fully developed ecotourism economy. In Cape May, bird-watchers spend well over $10 million a year, said Paul Kerlinger, a former director of the New Jersey Audubon Society's Cape May Bird Observatory, who is now an ecotourism consultant based in New York. Birders from all over the world jam the hotels during the spring and fall shore bird and hawk migrations -- what would otherwise be the off-season.
They stock up on ornithological supplies at a shop called For the Birds. They take $165 package tours that include whale- and bird-watching cruises. They go to restaurants recommended in the Cape May Bird Observatory's "Places to Stay, Eat and Shop" list of business that donate to the observatory. They leave Nature Conservancy "business" cards at stores and hotels to let business owners know how important ecotourists are to the local economy.
But what about places not blessed with an existing tourism infrastructure or the cachet of being one of the top 10 birding spots on the continent? The Pine Barrens, for all their million-acre vastness and subtle stands of pitch pine, are not Yellowstone.
Part of the trick, experts agree, is cross-pollination: combining natural and other tourist attractions so visitors stay for days rather than a few hours.
"A lot of people might not want to go out and look at birds all day," Mr. Kerlinger said. "They might want to go antiquing for a while. At the Cape May Bird Observatory, the wife would go out birding and the husband would go out looking at the old buildings in Cape May."
For many would-be entrepreneurs, the government's attempts to striking a balance between protecting the environmental and creating opportunities to capitalize on it still have a long way to go.
But what about the Canadians, who already flock to Wildwood each summer but tend not to stop between the beach and the border? Can they be persuaded to choose the wilds of New Jersey over the great north woods? Susan Melnyk, who runs the New Jersey tourism program in Canada, thinks they may.
"Canadians do tend to do a lot of hiking and biking and birdwatching in Canada," she said. "But sometimes you want to do the same thing, but in a different location."
Felicity Munn, a Montreal-based travel writer who took the state-sponsored tour, said she had found much to recommend: "There were so many spots where you'd want to stay at bed-and-breakfasts and hire a bicycle and ride around, and the canoeing was lovely.
"Before the trip," she said, "I knew nothing about New Jersey except that it was the armpit of America. This really opened my eyes."

Once Grand St. George Hotel Eyed as Student Housing Site

BYLINE: By MARK FRANCIS COHEN 

 BODY:
Empty rooms loom throughout the St. George Hotel, once the largest hotel in the city. Now it is largely vacant, home only to $50-a-night rooms, about 40 elderly couples, and a dim reputation.
But the 12-floor hotel, which is part of an eight-building complex at 100 Henry Street, may get an overhaul if negotiations between a not-for-profit housing group and the hotel's owners are settled. The St. George complex went from being a neighborhood nuisance to a real hazard after one of its buildings was destroyed by a fire last August. 
 Educational Housing Services, which provides housing for 4,000 college students from 10 schools, would like to lease 300 of the hotel's 500 rooms. Last week, George Scott, the group's executive director, said that he was hopeful the deal with the owners, Sholom Drizin and Moshe Drizin, would go through, but that they were still wrestling over an "economic issue."
"They'd like to see it rented for a certain amount," Mr. Scott said. "It's an economic issue we're trying to resolve."
The hotel's owners did not return calls for comment.
Educational Housing Services plans to spend the summer refurbishing the rooms and others parts of the building that will be used by the students, including communal kitchens. Mr. Scott said students from nearby colleges, including New York Law School and Pace University, would be charged about $600 a month for the rooms, which are 175 square feet.
The elderly residents would be allowed to stay, he added.
Mr. Scott said the deal must be completed by Saturday if he is to have enough time to make renovations to the building in time for the fall semester. MARK FRANCIS COHEN

One for All, All for One, on the Beach

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
A SHORE mayor talking about something that sounds even remotely inclusive? Oh my God!"
That, says Ken Pringle, the Mayor of Belmar, is the reaction he has been getting to his recent proposal that Jersey Shore municipalities, many of which do everything they can to keep outsiders from setting foot on their sand, join in a plan to issue reciprocal beach passes, good for any participating town. 
 It's a modest proposal that would apply only to seasonal passes. Still, any talk about increasing public access is heresy in many shore towns, where the exclusivity of beaches is defended with the tenacity of the German garrison at Monte Cassino.
"There's been some support," Mr. Pringle said. "But a lot of what I hear from other mayors is 'Over my dead body.' "
Beyond the chain-link fences, gates and ticket booths that limit access to a good chunk of the 130 miles of New Jersey's coast, though, there is growing statewide opposition toward entrenched local attitudes that the Jersey Shore belongs only to those who own property facing it, and Mr. Pringle says he is aware of the implications.
"There has been a mom-and-pop attitude permeating the Jersey shore for as long as anyone can remember," he said. And he suggested that this summer, as Federal and state tax money pours into the $2 billion Corps of Engineers restoration of New Jersey's eroded beaches, would be an excellent time for shore towns that benefit from "those billions of taxpayer largess" to start paying attention to the world west of the Garden State Parkway.
A 38-year-old lawyer who has lived in Belmar since he was 4, Mr. Pringle wants shore towns to start taking a "macro approach" to common issues -- not just beach management, but also traffic, ocean-front zoning, economic development, growth, marketing and the environment.
A regional beach pass would be a good start, he says, adding, "I really don't think beachgoing patterns would change significantly." The way he sees it, season passes could be issued for a group of adjoining towns, or for all shore towns in a county. They would cost perhaps $10 more than local passes (currently $40 to $55). Participating towns would agree on a formula to share the extra money.
"I don't expect we'll see drunken firemen from Staten Island coming down looking for badges so they can pillage local beaches all summer," Mr. Pringle said. "What this is really about is trying to elevate the level of discussion -- to attempt, at least at some point in the next 100 years or so, to develop a common approach to tourism."
Unlike some of its more exclusionary neighbors, Belmar, a town of 6,500, has always welcomed summer crowds. "In fact, the only thing Belmar was known for in the 70's and 80's was beaches and bars," said Mr. Pringle, who won office in 1990 after campaigning against his predecessor's threat to lease the town beach to commercial operators rather than comply with a court order to lower the beach fees. The order was prompted by a lawsuit by the now-defunct State Public Advocate's office, which had charged Belmar, Avon, Spring Lake, Sea Girt and Bay Head with setting excessive daily fees of as much as $10 a day.
"Frankly, the Public Advocate suit was really a very good thing, in the sense that what it said was, any money you bring in off the beach you have to spend on the beach," Mr. Pringle said. "All of a sudden, politicians lost the incentive to squeeze every dollar out of beach operations to keep property taxes down."
Many shore towns have lowered their daily fees, but continue to discourage day visitors with parking prohibitions and other disincentives. But Belmar began spending all its beach revenue -- it was about $1.7 million last year -- on such amenities as a refurbished boardwalk, new pavilions, restrooms and playgrounds. At the same time, the town cracked down on public rowdiness.
The investments paid off. Today, Belmar is a pleasant, accessible town with a broad, uncluttered beach that attracts families and well-behaved young people. No one misses the bad old days.
Belmar improved its fortunes not by excluding people but by changing its attitudes toward itself, says Mr. Pringle, who thinks the lesson could be applied all along the shore, from the honky-tonk towns to the hamlets hiding behind walls. "Right now, for the first time in generations, the Jersey shore has ocean water quality that rivals anything in the U.S.," he said. "But that's not much good if people walk around with the same attitudes they've always had -- which is that the Jersey Shore is where you go if you can't go anyplace else."

Why Small Stocks Are Leading the Parade

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MANY aggressive investors had mediocre performance in 1995, largely because the small-capitalization stocks in their portfolios dragged them down. But small stocks have barreled ahead of big stocks this year.
"They're catching up to the rest of the market," said Byron Wien, United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley in New York. "Last year, people were more cautious because they were worried about the economy. Now they're feeling more adventurous." 
 The shift in market leadership stems from a confluence of events. Last year, larger stocks were helped along by lower interest rates and a weaker dollar. Economic weakness and corporate earnings growth helped fuel a flight to quality, often to blue-chip, stocks.
By early February this year, expectations began to shift. After a series of cuts in short-term interest rates, including one in late January, the Federal Reserve grew quiet. Since then, long-term rates have been rising instead of falling, bucking the conventional wisdom of just a half-year ago. Last week, the Fed again abstained from rate action.
Likewise, prognosticators who spoke several months ago of gloom and doom on the economic front have been proved wrong so far this year. Government reports on employment, retail sales, industrial production and other indicators have shown that the economy is getting more energetic, not less.
A result has been some astonishing returns for mutual funds that invest in smaller stocks. As a group, the small-company funds returned 18.9 percent through May 17, compared with 12.2 percent for growth-stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago. Of the 37 fund categories tracked by Morningstar, only the precious-metals group has done better than small-company funds.
Sitting atop the list with a return of nearly 48 percent this year is Oberweis Micro-Cap, a new fund managed by James D. Oberweis, in North Aurora, Ill. The fund, begun on Jan. 1, closed to new investors on Wednesday once it surpassed its goal of $50 million in assets. The average market capitalization of the stocks in its portfolio is $120 million, compared with an average of $500 million for its sister fund, Emerging Growth, begun in 1987.
"This is the kind of market environment where investors have been willing to pay increasingly high prices for successful companies," Mr. Oberweis said in a phone interview last week. "The question I have right now is will earnings grow fast enough to justify current P.E. ratios, which are very high, or will we have a market correction."
Another leader among the small-company funds this year is Van Wagoner Micro-Cap, also a new fund. Its manager, Garrett Van Wagoner, set up shop in San Francisco recently after several sterling years leading Govett Smaller Companies. His astounding record continues, with a gain of more than 42 percent this year.
Micro-cap funds are a growing subset of small-cap stock funds. Three years ago, only 17 funds had portfolios whose stocks had an average market capitalization of less than $250 million; today there are 24, by Morningstar's count.
The growth at that end of the market makes perfect sense to Robert E. Kern, who handles smaller equities for Morgan Grenfell Capital Management in New York and who leads the team that manages Fremont United States Micro-Cap. He says the micro-cap market is in a similar position to that of the small-capitalization stock market 15 years ago. The sector is just becoming recognized, and mutual funds are beginning to stake their claims.
Mr. Kern attributes part of the popularity of micro-cap investing to the growth in entrepreneurial ventures, many of which go public. From the investor's point of view, "micro-cap provides opportunities for stock selection in the least efficient sectors of the small-capitalization market," he said, "because there's less coverage by research analysts and few institutional investors."
Not all the funds that buy small stocks fall into the small-company category. The Dreyfus Premier Strategic Growth fund is placed in the aggressive-growth group by Morningstar's method. But the fund invests in small companies, with a median market capitalization of $500 million.
Michael L. Schonberg, who has managed the fund since July 1994, can boast of a 37 percent return so far this year. He points to the broad-based strength in the domestic economy as the prime driver of small-capitalization stocks. Smaller companies tend to do most of their business in the United States, meaning they are directly affected by swings in the economy. In contrast, large, multinational companies tend to have global businesses whose foreign revenues can help offset any slowdown in domestic sales.
The price-to-earnings multiple of the overall stock market is closely related to interest rates, Mr. Schonberg argues. When short-term rates are stable, the market multiple does not change much, so earnings have a greater impact on stock prices. Companies with strong earnings growth tend to outperform in such environments, and with corporate earnings growth tending to slow down this year, small companies have the edge in his view.
Small stocks and big stocks seesaw as market leaders, but each group tends to take the lead for a few years at a time. How long small-company stocks will outperform depends in large part on interest rates, by Mr. Schonberg's argument. Until the Fed pushes rates higher, small stocks will retain their edge.
 Louis G. Navellier, who runs an aggressive small-cap equity fund bearing his name, said that bigger companies gained in early May because of rising long-term bond yields, but that spurt is likely to be a fluke. Earnings growth for the smaller companies is still much stronger, he explained, and a lot of money is moving into that area.
Growth will not be limited to one part of the small-cap market, like the technology sector, Mr. Navellier said. "This is a stock picker's market," he said. "You have to buy the leaders in each sector."

Rents Push Morale Down and Koreans Out

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For 15 years, Chalie Chung, a Korean immigrant, ran his hat-and-glove business out of the same store at 29th Street and Broadway. But rent spiraled until he could no longer afford the increase he was presented with last year, to $15,000 a month from $10,000. So last summer, he moved his business, Charm Creation, three crosstown blocks to 28th and Seventh Avenue. His new rent? $5,000 a month.
Still, he feels a loss. "It is like you live in a house for a long time," Mr. Chung, 48, said. "You have your family there. You see your friends there. It is hard to leave." 
 Korean immigrants and Korean-Americans, by far the largest ethnic group in the Herald Square area, are worrying that a one-two punch of higher rents and a sluggish local and international economy will drive the remaining Koreans out of the business district they helped build. For example, as Mr. Chung's rent has risen, he says, his sales have declined: last year, sales totaled $1.5 million, down 20 percent from 1994.
Koreans have been opening stores near Herald Square since the early 70's, and Broadway from 33d Street to 25th became known for the import-export business. Koreans specialized mainly in costume jewelry, wigs, handbags and hats.
"Landlords are digging their own graves," said Illsoo Kim. "If the Korean business district fades away, I think it would hurt New York's economy." Mr. Kim is the author of "New Urban Immigrants: The Korean Community in New York."
The New York Society of Korean Businessmen says there are as many as 500 Korean-owned businesses in the area and that the numbers have fallen by perhaps two-thirds since the mid-80's.
As in Mr. Chung's case, they sometimes move only a few blocks. But in other cases, they move to Queens or Long Island and even out of state.
"I don't blame them for moving," said Henry Justin of Justin Management, one of the largest landlords in the area. "I can't believe how many other landlords make me look good."
Mr. Justin said, however, that the problem was sour business rather than higher rents. Rents have gradually risen to about $18 a square foot per month. Because he has so many Korean-American tenants with sluggish businesses, he said, he has tried to keep rents at about $14 a square foot.
"When money's flowing like water," he said, "nobody complains about the rent. Now that money isn't flowing, people notice the rent. The Korean community took a tremendous hit when the peso went down because Latin Americans are some of their biggest customers."
Won S. Byun, who has been a wholesaler of sequins and other ornaments since 1971, said, "More and more of us old-timers have to decide whether we stay or go. But we are getting more and more worried." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Fidelity's Managers: Freewheeling No More

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
IT'S one thing to invent the electric light bulb; it's quite another to run Con Ed.
That is the lesson that Fidelity Investments -- and, in fact, the entire mutual fund business -- is learning, as funds replace banks as the repository of Americans' wealth. Although Fidelity grew to be the nation's biggest mutual fund company by emphasizing innovation and an aggressive style, it has now become almost a public utility in the minds of many Americans. So dependability and predictability are becoming more important than creativity -- and Fidelity is struggling to cope with that change. 
 Such shifting public perception ultimately lies behind Jeffrey N. Vinik's announcement last week that he was departing as manager of Fidelity's gigantic Magellan fund.
Whether Mr. Vinik jumped or was pushed, chances are very good that he did not leave Fidelity because his fund had been lagging behind the market for five months. After all, Mr. Vinik had outperformed both the market and most of his peers for several years. And every money manager worth his salt -- including the legendary Peter Lynch -- goes through slumps.
What got Mr. Vinik in trouble was not his underperformance, but how he did it. He made a big bet on bonds -- while running a stock fund. The bet went sour, and there was little chance that the fund's performance could have been salvaged this year.
The bond bet angered investors and investment professionals, who felt that they were paying Mr. Vinik to put their money into stocks. If they wanted to take a flier in the credit markets, they could do that off their own bat.
"People bought Magellan as the premier growth-company fund, and they have not been getting that over the last six months," said Donald R. Dion Jr., publisher of Fidelity Independent Adviser, a newsletter that follows the funds. "There are many bond funds that they can buy."
Twenty years ago, money managers were expected to put their clients' dollars into bonds if that was where they found the best values. Indeed, if really worried, they could put customers' money in the bank.
While fund companies have been busy tightening restrictions on fund managers over the years to get them to stick to their core investments, Fidelity's managers continued to have free rein as long they remained fully invested. What really mattered was total return; nobody really cared how they got it. Fidelity's fund managers were encouraged to take risks and to try new techniques. Among the company's innovative products were funds that specialized in particular industries, funds that invested using a computer's artificial intelligence and a fund that invested to take advantage of big social and economic trends.
Even the managers of more traditional funds were encouraged to seize the "best" investment opportunities, wherever they might be. That is how Fidelity Capital Appreciation ended up with heavy holdings of foreign stocks and how Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ended up with a host of small-cap stocks, and how all sorts of unlikely Fidelity funds ended up with Mexican bonds.
The ground rule under which Mr. Vinik operated was simple: "Be a genius," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Investor, the Chicago fund tracking firm's publication for individual investors. He describes Mr. Vinik as "old-style Fidelity, idiosyncratic and intuitive."
This system worked as long as Fidelity's customers were concerned only with total return -- and as long as the aggressive and unusual investments paid off. But both things changed.
Despite Fidelity's power and its awesome research, it made some big mistakes. When emerging markets plunged in 1994, Fidelity funds suffered. And the firm clamped down on its fixed-income group, which was told, "No more surprises." After two years of lagging performance, the company abandoned the controversial approach of its Capital and Income Fund, which had been active in managing companies emerging from bankruptcy. And earlier this year it reshuffled the management of 23 of its stock and balanced funds to align the managers' skills with the funds' stated objectives.
THAT last change is significant because it signals that Fidelity is starting to pay attention to how managers achieve their results and is trying to make the funds more predictable -- changes driven in large part by changes in the investing public.
While many investors are still chasing the hottest performance they can find, still more are really saving. They will not tolerate certain surprises. If they buy a domestic stock fund, they want it to hold American stocks, just as if they buy a can of tomatoes, they expect it to be full of round red fruits.
Furthermore, in picking funds, many of these investors rely on advice from newsletters or investment advisers, or choose from a limited menu of funds in 401(k) and other retirement plans.
Either way, the funds have to pass muster with professional evaluators, who prefer that fund managers not wander afield. Investment advisers want to be able to compare funds within a category and to devise diversified fund portfolios.
If a fund manager who usually buys the stocks of small companies starts loading up on blue chips, the advisers object. In fact, they often fire you, said Mario Gabelli, a longtime money manager as well as the head of a mutual fund company. This straying from a fund's category has also drawn the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which wants mutual funds to hew more strictly to the investments suggested by their names.
Such changes in the marketplace have left Fidelity with an identity crisis, said Geoff Bobroff, a consultant to the mutual fund industry in East Greenwich, R.I. He suggested that Fidelity might have to split a fund like Magellan into a gunslinging offering for aggressive investors and a more predictable vehicle for retirement plans.
It may be hard for Fidelity to make such changes, and even harder for its aggressive, freewheeling and very competitive portfolio managers. Some of them have already left. Michael S. Gordon, who epitomized the kind of manager Fidelity had long lionized, is leaving with Mr. Vinik to manage money.
"There's a very big challenge here," said Eric Kobren, executive editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter that analyzes the funds. "How do you create an atmosphere that fosters creativity while still maintaining the controls?"
The answer may be that you don't, and that big mutual fund companies will look more like Chase Manhattan Bank or Procter & Gamble -- or AT&T -- than like the old-fashioned money management shops. Aggressive investors will have to turn to small fund families and boutique firms to meet their needs, but the bulk of the savers will be well served.


GRAPHIC: In a series of steps over the last two years, Fidelity Investments has been reining in its mutual fund managers. Not every manager who falls short of his benchmark in total return has been replaced, but those who have strayed beyond a fund's core investments and then disappointed have often found themselves without a seal after a game of musical chairs. Chart provides some examples of the ways in which Fidelity Investments has dealt with several of its managers.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Is Tupperware Dated? Not in the Global Market

BYLINE: By JON E. HILSENRATH 

 BODY:
THE Tupperware Corporation has spent the last 10 years hidden in a cupboard of sorts. As a division of Premark International, a slow-growing conglomerate, Tupperware and its famous plastic containers have often been overlooked on Wall Street.
But Premark will spin off Tupperware on Friday and put it on display on the New York Stock Exchange. Premark shareholders will get one share of Tupperware for every share of the conglomerate that they owned at the end of last week. 
Should today's investors take a shine to a newly independent company whose sales parties seem as dated as Ozzie and Harriet? Though the company is confronted with some competition and changing tastes, the answer may be yes.
One reason is foreign markets. In many ways, Tupperware fits the mold of the many American consumer product companies -- Avon, Coca-Cola, Gillette, Procter & Gamble -- that have flourished in recent years by marketing their strong brands abroad. Tupperware -- which was founded in 1946 by Earl Tupper, a chemical engineer -- has pushed overseas aggressively as it has struggled with declining business in the United States.
The result: In 1995, Tupperware threw about 13 million Tupperware parties, not just here, but in more than 100 foreign countries. Tupperware's sales abroad accounted for 85 percent of the $1.36 billion in total revenue last year and for all of the division's growth. And the overseas possibilities are expanding. In the last 12 months, Tupperware has received permission to begin throwing its parties in two emerging giants of the global economy: India and China.
Second, Tupperware stock seems cheap compared with that of other consumer goods companies. In the weeks leading up to the first official trade on the Big Board, Bear Stearns has been making a "when issued" market, in which Tupperware stock can be traded before its debut. In that market, Tupperware closed on Friday at $44.625. That is equivalent to about 16.5 times the company's expected earnings of $2.70 a share this year, according to a survey of Wall Street stock analysts.
This price-to-earnings ratio is lower than that of the companies usually compared to the container maker. Stock in Avon, which analysts consider the most comparable because the two companies use similar door-to-door sales approaches, was trading at 20.2 times its projected earnings at Friday's close. And Rubbermaid, which also sells plastic household containers, has a multiple of 21.
Tupperware looks even cheaper compared with other global consumer product companies. Gillette, for example, is trading at about 27 times projected earnings.
If the when-issued price foreshadows how the stock will fare once official trading begins, Tupperware may well be a bargain, many analysts and investors said. The low price, they say, reflects Wall Street's unfamiliarity with the stock rather than serious company shortcomings.
"You get a discount coming out of the chute because you don't have a history" with Wall Street, said Susan Potto, an analyst with the Mutual Shares Fund, a large holder of Premark shares.
The 10 years that Tupperware spent as part of Premark adds to the unfamiliarity, the analysts said. The conglomerate also makes such well-known products as West Bend appliances and Hobart food equipment. As a separate entity, analysts said, Tupperware will command a greater following among institutional investors and analysts.
How high might Tupperware stock go? Ms. Potto predicted it might trade at $55 before too long, or 20 times her estimate of 1996 earnings, $2.75 a share. Many analysts expect earnings to exceed $3 a share by 1997, implying a stock price of almost $60 if the market began to value Tupperware at about the same price-to-earnings ratio it has bestowed on Avon and Rubbermaid.
Not everyone likes Tupperware, however.
Many investors were spooked by a downturn in sales last quarter in Tupperware's greater European region. Compared with the corresponding period in 1995, sales in the region -- Europe, Africa and the Middle East -- fell by 15.3 percent. These regions account for more than 40 percent of the company's revenue.
Tupperware attributes the drop to sluggish economic growth in its principal market in the region: Germany. But Matthew Roswell, a consumer products stock analyst with Legg Mason, said the decline could be the first hint that Rubbermaid, which has bought plastics companies in Poland and France in the last 15 months, is beginning to eat into Tupperware's market share.
"I don't think it is going to be as good a business as it has been," Mr. Roswell said of Tupperware's foreign activity.
But Rubbermaid, which had foreign sales last year of $337 million, compared with $1.15 billion for Tupperware, does not have the same presence in Europe that Tupperware has. And Rick Goings, Tupperware's president, said that Rubbermaid's less expensive products did not pose a direct threat to the high-end part of the market that his company was seeking.
Moreover, he said, results from the European region will be strong in the second quarter, though Tupperware will have to give up some of those gains in foreign-exchange losses. Mr. Goings, who came to Tupperware from Avon in 1992, said he foresaw a single-digit increase in sales in Europe in the second quarter and for the year, and a double-digit increase for those periods in Latin America. In Asia, he expects single-digit increases.
Compounding the skepticism over Europe, however, is Tupperware's domestic business. Revenues have fallen as more women have entered the work force and have become unable or unwilling to attend sales parties, and as stores like Wal-Mart have offered cheaper alternative products. In 1995, sales in the United States fell 9 percent, to $208.6 million, and profits dropped 36 percent, to $10.3 million. Domestic sales have fallen in six of the last nine years, for a total decline of 37 percent.
But Tupperware is angling to reverse the trend. It hopes to relieve its local agents of the job of storing and delivering the merchandise, for instance, so that they can concentrate on recruiting more representatives and expanding sales. The company has also taken its parties into the workplace and is peddling its containers in catalogues.
These plans are expected to help. But so will simply taking Tupperware out of the shadow of Premark, Mr. Goings believes. "People need to get to know the stock better," he said. "For many, we've been a great secret."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
At Tax Time, Your Land Rover Might Not Be a Guzzler

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
WITH your 1995 tax refund in hand, you are ready to buy a new car for your business needs. And, like millions of other Americans, what you really want is one of those expensive, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. But you know such a purchase would be impractical.
Guess again. Because of a little-known tax rule, a sport utility can, in the end, be much less expensive than a car. 
 Under the rule, owners of vehicles that are used for business and that weigh more than 6,000 pounds can depreciate a larger portion of the vehicles' value annually than can owners of other vehicles. As a result, the after-tax cost of these heavy vehicles -- not just sport utilities, but also vans and pickup trucks -- can often be less than the cost of many cars of equal or lower price.
Consider a person who buys a $45,000 Cadillac Seville solely for business use. He can depreciate only $3,060 of the car in its first year and, after five years of taking the maximum annual depreciation, he will have written off only $14,460, less than a third of the price. To fully depreciate the Cadillac would take 23 years.
Now look at the buyer of a sport utility vehicle, a $45,000 Toyota Land Cruiser. The amount that can be depreciated in the first year is $9,000. After five years, the owner will have written off $42,408. By the end of the sixth year, the full $45,000 will have been depreciated.
If the car is also used for personal purposes, depreciation can be taken only for the time it is used for business. But the advantage for the sport utility still applies.
The reason for this different tax treatment is just 2,578 pounds. At 6,470 pounds, the Toyota Land Cruiser is exempt from the depreciation caps that apply to the 3,892-pound Cadillac Seville and to every other passenger car on the American market, none of which exceeds 6,000 pounds.
What makes 6,000 pounds so important? The tax code has long given trucks, which are generally costly to buy and to run, more favorable depreciation treatment than it has to cars. A decade ago, Congress picked 6,000 pounds as a simple way to distinguish between trucks and other vehicles.
But legislators didn't reckon with the evolution of the automotive market. "When the depreciation rules changed in 1986 and the limitations were set, the sport utility vehicle market was not what it is today," said Dick Locastro, a tax manager for Coopers & Lybrand in Washington. "Generally, we didn't have a vehicle over 6,000 pounds that could be treated as a passenger vehicle."
That has changed. Among sport utility vehicles alone, many exceed 6,000 pounds, enabling business owners and self-employed doctors, lawyers, sales representatives, consultants and others to use the speedier depreciation schedule. They include the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe, the GMC Yukon, the Toyota Land Cruiser, the Lexus LX 450, all Land Rover models, the AM General Hummer and some versions of the Mitsubishi Montero. The Ford Motor Company plans to introduce larger sport utilities in the next couple of years, beginning this fall with the Expedition, which will probably weigh more than 6,000 pounds.
If their owners meet a variety of other criteria, these big sport utilities offer a second tax advantage. If the owner of the Land Cruiser used in the example met certain requirements for business income, he might be able to deduct part of the vehicle's cost as a business expense. After five years, the owner would be able to write off even more -- $43,416 -- than he would under the accelerated depreciation rules by themselves. Again, the Cadillac and other cars would not qualify for this benefit because they weigh less than 6,000 pounds.
And because vehicles weighing more than 6,000 pounds are considered trucks, they are exempt from the excise tax applied to luxury cars. In 1995, that tax, which is adjusted annually for inflation, equaled 10 percent of a car's cost in excess of $32,000. With the $45,000 price, the owner of the Cadillac Seville would have owed a luxury tax of $1,300 if he had bought the car last year.
The luxury tax, which applies regardless of whether a vehicle is used for business, is more familiar than the 6,000-pound rule. Even accountants are only beginning to discover the latter. "It's not well known," Mr. Locastro said.
Nevertheless, big vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. In 1995, some 1.7 million sport utility vehicles were sold, up 12 percent from the previous year, according to J. D. Power & Associates, the automotive market research firm. So far this year, sales of sport utilities are running ahead of last year's blistering pace.
And large sport utility vehicles -- the ones most likely to exceed 6,000 pounds -- are the fastest-growing part of this segment. In 1995, sales of these "full size" machines rose 32 percent, to 287,535, and so far this year they are running about 70 percent ahead of last year's pace, largely because of the introduction of new models.
With sales like these, the tax clause may not stay obscure for long, Mr. Locastro said. "There must be people out there using it," he said, "because you see a lot more Land Rovers and Hummers out there now."

HEADLINE: Report From North Korea;
Flood Waters Come and Go. Misery Endures.

BYLINE: By TREVOR PAGE 

 BODY:
North Korea's perpetual economic crisis may be turning into famine. Earlier this month, two United Nations agencies reported that "without emergency food imports the consequences are likely to be devastating for large segments of the population." This week, Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, is scheduled to travel to North Korea, where few visitors are allowed. Trevor Page last week returned from six months there as country director for the World Food Program, one of the United Nations agencies. This article expresses his personal view of what he saw.
NORTH KOREA is a land of extremes.
Pyongyang, the capital, regarded as a sort of Valhalla, is where two million of the North Koreans most faithful to their political system live in a surrealistic environment, much like a film set, with tall buildings, broad boulevards and landscaped parks. Since there is nowhere to go on to after Valhalla, those privileged to live in the capital are shrouded from the shortages the rest of the country faces. 
 Sangdan Ri is a collective farm, on the northwest frontier with China, which looks today as though it is straight out of Sudan or the Sahel. It lies engulfed in sand deposited from the Amnuk River by last year's floods.
Between these extremes, some 20 million ordinary North Koreans struggle to make ends meet as the country's food and fuel crisis deepens further.
Lee Sok Fae, a 57-year-old farmer in Sangdan Ri, was one of the 500,000 people who were rendered homeless by last summer's floods, the worst in living memory. Flood waters from the Amnuk River, nearly a mile away, submerged the entire collective farm for a week. For two months, Mr. Lee, his wife, his two children and a cousin were billeted in a school building with other flood victims before they were able to go back to rebuild their home. Cement, timber for the rafters and door frames, and tiles for the roof were provided by the state. Mr. Lee rebuilt the house himself with the help of a few hands from the local work brigade, who were pressed into action under the system labeled Juche, or self-help, on which the country has been built.
Lee Sok Fae went back home, but the collective's rice paddies remained buried under more than a foot of sand. There was no rice crop at Sangdan Ri this year, nor on some 100,000 acres of farmland elsewhere. The loss was all the more devastating because 80 percent of North Korea is mountainous and its food has to be produced on the remaining 20 percent.
Work started last November to repair the breached flood dikes and clear the debrisbut more than half of the repairs remained undone. Mr. Lee and his family have got by on occasional handouts from the state, supplemented by sporadic food aid from the international community.
Spring brought Mr. Lee, his family and the other 20 million North Koreans who live outside the capital some relief. Wild edible roots and grasses were gathered to expand the family soup pot. Farmers in Sangdan Ri said that some varieties, such as chok, a long, bitter, fibrous root, hadn't been eaten since the desperate days of 1951, during the Korean war.
For millions of North Koreans, it is going to be a long, hard haul until October, when the next harvest should replenish the granaries. In the meantime, Lee Sok Fae will have to yank in his belt a few more notches and keep up the grim determination that is expected of North Koreans.
Pak Chong Il is in his early 20's and is an architecture student at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang. He plucked up the courage to approach a colleague and me as we sat talking one Sunday afternoon in a park. Mr. Pak wanted to practice his English, which he has been studying for seven years. His spoken English was quite good, although we never really got past discussing mundane matters like the weather.
What shook me, however, was that fairly early in our conversation I asked him what work his parents did. He said his father had died eight years ago and that his mother, a doctor, had died last year. When I said how sorry I was to hear that, he looked me straight in the eye and said there was no need to be sorry. He said he was not sorry. "Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il would live forever and would always take care of me." He said he had a lot to be grateful for. (The late Kim Il Sung was North Korea's leader; Kim Jong Il is his son and heir apparent).
Most foreigners living in North Korea are not allowed to travel out of the capital. An exception has been made for the few resident relief workers with the Red Cross, UNICEF and the World Food Program. There is also a fledgling expatriate business that is mainly involved in the manufacturing of garments and cigarettes.
One highlight of the week for expatriates in Pyongyang is the Wednesday "expatriate dinner." In an attempt to break the monotony of working in the world's most tightly closed society, everyone tries not to talk shop. Aside from talking about the weather, which is highly changeable, the conversation tends to focus on who arrived on the weekly flight from Beijing, or who didn't get an entry visa.
There are other distractions like the International Club, where Eastern Europeans drown their sorrows every Saturday night as young Arab men dance with each other. Or there is the Tongi restaurant, a sprawling pagoda-like structure on the banks of the Tedonggang River, where dog is the specialty; it is a favorite haunt of Korean and Chinese businessmen. For the residents of Pyongyang, there are the parks and riverfront walks, which cost nothing.

AS the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda understood the value of medals in motivating a sailor. When visiting a ship or Navy base, he liked to arrange an impromptu awards ceremony, the pleasure obvious in his face as he pinned one of those bits of ribbon and brass to a proud sailor's chest.
So when he took his own life this month, apparently over the question of the legitimacy of two Vietnam War combat medals that he had worn for years, veterans may have been dumbfounded, but could understood the mortification that the Navy's highest-ranking officer would have felt. 
 Lieut. Gen. Bernard E. Trainor, a retired Marine Corps general, said that if the Admiral had worn combat medals that he had not earned, "it would have irreparably tarnished him" with sailors, even if it had been an entirely innocent mistake.
The "fruit salad," that accumulation of decorations on a sailor or soldier's chest, serves as a public resume, a biography, a means for one service member to size up another in the blink of an eye. The decorations have an importance all out of proportion -- sometimes, absurdly so -- to the intrinsic value of the nylon and brass they are made of.
During the early history of the United States military, decorations were rare, and handed out only in cases of extraordinary bravery or sacrifice. Many commanders considered them silly affectations, and official portraits of several of the country's most celebrated warriors, including Grant and Sherman, show them without any campaign ribbons or medals at all.
The most famous American military decoration, the Purple Heart, dates to the Revolutionary War, when George Washington presented violet, heart-shaped cloth patches edged with silver braid to men commended for acts of bravery. Only three were ever awarded.
Handing out large numbers of war medals began in earnest only in World War II, when a soldier or sailor could return with a chestful of medals and ribbons, each earned in a different combat zone.
The number of medals exploded in subsequent wars; today's admirals and generals find their uniforms weighed down with decorations, and troops have come to expect an award not just for valor, but simply for having shown up in a war zone.
After the American invasion of Grenada in 1983, the Defense Department handed out 8,600 medals, even though no more than 7,200 troops ever set foot on the tiny Caribbean islands. Many of the decorations went to soldiers who got no closer to Grenada than the corridors of the Pentagon.
Every one of the military's 3.5 million uniformed troops and reservists in 1991 received a medal after the American victory in the Persian Gulf war, and the 540,000 soldiers who were actually dispatched to the Gulf also received campaign medals from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
There was outrage among veterans in 1989, when a Purple Heart, which in this century has traditionally been presented only when a soldier has been seriously wounded or killed, was awarded instead to a paratrooper who had suffered heat stroke during the American invasion of Panama. The Navy awarded combat ribbons to the crew of the guided-missile cruiser Vincennes shortly after they mistakenly shot down an Iranian civilian jet in 1988.
Military historians and many veterans say the phenomenon, known as medal inflation, has lessened the value of all decorations. "Frankly, it dismays me," said Capt. Edward L. Beach, retired, a naval historian and author of the novel "Run Silent, Run Deep." "It's demeaning to me to feel that the medals I earned -- that I thought were so great -- are now a dime a dozen."
Rivalry among the armed services has added to the problem. The Air Force has been handing out nearly twice as many decorations per service member as the Navy, which has added to the pressure on the leadership of the Navy to keep up.
A survey by the newspaper Navy Times found that in 1994, the Air Force handed out an average of 287 decorations for every 1,000 service members, compared to 148 for the Navy and 70 for the Marines. Comparable Army statistics were not available.
The newspaper quoted Rear Adm. Joseph S. Mobley, director of the Navy staff overseeing the awards system, as saying, "We're probably not giving out enough awards -- I think it's the most emotional and motivational tool we have."
John Garavelli, a military awards specialist with the American Uniform Association, said he thought that the proliferation of medals was "pretty harmless so long as the decorations that are really meaningful stay that way, and I think they have been careful about that."
Still, Mr. Garavelli remembers being dumbfounded when he learned in the 1980's that the Army was presenting all new soldiers with a decoration called the Army Service Ribbon. "That one really turned my stomach," he said. According to Army regulations, the ribbon goes "to members of the regular U.S. Army, Army National Guard and Army Reserve to indicate the successful completion of initial entry training."
"Boot camp, in other words," Mr. Garavelli said. "Now we're giving awards for boot camp."

HEADLINE: Big Victory for a Small Frog

 BODY:
It was especially fitting that the California red-legged frog should be the first creature granted protection under the Endangered Species Act when a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress ended last week. Though not nearly as important to the national psyche as the bald eagle, the frog is a minor cultural icon, having reportedly inspired Mark Twain's yarn about a "celebrated jumping frog." The frog's dwindling numbers also signaled a larger problem, the deterioration of the California streams and wetlands that provided its habitat.
The frog is thus an apt symbol of what the Endangered Species Act is supposed to be about -- saving threatened plants and animals whose plights symbolize broader dangers to entire ecosystems. The Federal judge who invoked the act in 1991 to save the spotted owl put the matter nicely when he said the issue was not only the owl but also the survival of the old-growth forests that protected it. 
 There are many in Congress, however, who see the act as an arbitrary Federal weapon used to harass property owners and block economic progress in order to save species of relatively trivial value. This is a cruel caricature, but Congressional Republicans were able to exploit it early last year to shut down the Interior Department's ability to identify threatened species and develop conservation plans for their survival.
The Republicans hoped the moratorium would pressure the Administration to accept a bill radically overhauling the law. As part of this strategy, the House Resources Committee approved a measure last fall that would have gutted the act by making it impossible to protect species on private land and greatly weakening protections on Federal land. The bill has not been brought to a vote, in part because Speaker Newt Gingrich realized his party had already bought itself enough trouble with its year-long assault on the country's other environmental laws.
Congressional moderates are working on a compromise bill that would preserve the act's basic powers but make it less burdensome on landowners. Under the present law, for example, fines and jail sentences can be imposed if landowners do not take steps to preserve the habitat of a listed species. Though such sanctions are rare, many environmentalists believe the law relies too heavily on sticks and not enough on carrots, in the form of financial incentives for sound land management. The act is also badly underfunded, damaging the Interior Department's ability to design recovery programs and, if necessary, to buy private land.
Smart administration of the present law can also minimize what Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt once called the "legal train wrecks" inspired by the act. For years, regulators and environmentalists wrangled with property owners over imperiled habitats, tract by tract and species by species. Invoking a little-used 1982 amendment that encouraged broad conservation plans, Mr. Babbitt promoted negotiations aimed at preserving entire ecosystems.
There have been dramatic successes. Several years ago, the department listed the tiny California gnatcatcher as threatened, which could have put hundreds of thousands of acres of Southern California scrubland off-limits to developers. Rather than face interminable lawsuits, an unorthodox coalition of California officials, conservationists, scientists and landowners spent five years working out plans to set aside as many as 200,000 acres to protect troubled wildlife while freeing developers who build outside the preserve from further liability under the Endangered Species Act.
This agreement may help arrest Southern California's long-term slide toward ecological disaster and make it a far better place to live. If that happens, thank the gnatcatcher -- and the act protecting it.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The New China Consensus

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When people across the political spectrum start giving speeches on the same subject in an election year, it usually means there is sharp disagreement. But in the past few weeks Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, Warren Christopher, Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Charles Robb and Newt Gingrich have all made statements on U.S.-China relations, and what's remarkable is how much they agree in their recommendations. What's going on here? What's going on is that seven years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, a new American consensus on how to deal with China is finally taking shape.
The old U.S. policy consensus on China was shattered in the late 1980's. The collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the U.S. and China of their common enemy, which really was the glue holding together their strategic partnership. At the same time, the Tiananmen massacre shifted the focus in Washington from looking for ways to cooperate with China on foreign policy to looking for ways to alter China's domestic policy. And there went the China consensus. While President Bush wanted to find a way to maintain a strategic dialogue with China, Congress and the public were so outraged over Tiananmen all they wanted to do was punish "the butchers of Beijing." 
 But then two things happened. As China became an ever more lucrative market, Democrats started evolving a new strategy -- one designed to let them have their cake and eat it too. They argued that trading with China was both good business and good for promoting human rights, because it opened China to the world and forced it to adopt some rule of law. As this view gained currency in Congress and within the Administration, the left wing of the Democratic Party, which wanted to isolate China to promote human rights, became marginalized.
A parallel shift occurred on the strategic front. Geo-strategists gradually went from arguing that the U.S. and China had to work together to deter a common enemy -- Russia -- to arguing that the U.S. and China needed to work together to deter a common enemy -- China. That is, China became so big and potentially powerful, with an ability to disrupt everything from Asian stability to the global environment, that U.S. strategic interests mandated that Washington engage China -- no matter how odious its regime. As this argument gained currency, the right wing of the Republican Party, which wanted to protect Taiwan and isolate the Chinese Communists, became marginalized.
And thus was born the new U.S. consensus on China, which says: Give China most-favored-nation benefits to promote commerce and rule of law; intensify the dialogue with China's leadership to find areas of common strategic concern; work with China (using sanctions if necessary), so that it becomes a "responsible" member of the international community and embraces global rules on trade, copyrights and weapons proliferation; deal with China's human rights abuses in a low-key manner; protect Taiwan against any forced unification with China.
If the Chinese are smart, they will seize on this new consensus and meet Washington halfway. In doing so they could defuse the immediate tensions in the relationship -- over trade and arms sales -- and delay the fundamental tension, which is that we want China to become a free-market democracy and its leaders do not.
But here's my fear. What if Washington is knocking on Beijing's door and nobody's home? What if China's leaders are either too consumed by infighting to respond to the U.S. overture, or have lost too much control over parts of their country, like Guangdong Province, or parts of their Government, like the military, to live up to global rules on trade, copyright and missile sales? Or what if the Chinese leaders are now feeling so economically powerful that they think they can bend international rules to China's low standards, rather than having China bend to the world's?
The fact that serious people in America are thinking about China in a serious way is both an opportunity for China and a challenge. Beijing can no longer get by with saying, "If only the Americans had a realistic policy to engage us, then we could have a proper relationship." A realistic engagement of China is exactly what Americans are now talking about. It is up to China to prove that we're not just talking to ourselves. Because if that's the case, then another consensus will eventually take shape here, and it won't be for engagement with China. It will be for containment of China.

HEADLINE: A Focus on Those Displaced by the Fall of the Soviet Union

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 24

 BODY:
With millions of people still displaced or living as refugees almost five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, three international agencies will hold a conference next week in Geneva to address what relief organizations call a colossal problem largely unnoticed outside the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Since the Soviet Union was formally dissolved in 1991, officials say, nearly nine million people have been uprooted, creating one of the largest and most complex migrations ever faced by international agencies. 
 At least two million people have fled regional conflicts like those in Tajikistan and Georgia. Millions more are trying to undo the forced deportations of the Stalinist era or are seeking to flee ethnic tensions that have erupted since the fall of Communism. The ecological disasters of the failed Soviet economy have forced countless others to move in search of clean land and water. Traffickers in people are luring thousands into illegal immigration.
Often, migrants' paths cross as populations are exchanged.
"It is a complicated set of movements and causes which have to be appreciated each in their own right in order to formulate appropriate policy responses," said Arthur C. Helton, director of migration programs for the Open Society Institute in New York. "There are no real mechanisms in the region for planning or preparing for migration or refugee emergencies."
Mr. Helton is among those who are critical of what he describes as the limited scope of the Geneva conference, which is likely to include discussion of which principles should apply to the treatment of migrants and refugees but is expected to stop short of any concrete demands for action. Relief officials say that Western Europeans are resisting calls for a broader legal definition of refugees from the region, fearing that this could upset stricter asylum policies now being introduced.
The conference, to be held on Thursday and Friday, is sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration and the human rights division of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Up to 50 countries are expected to send delegations to the conference, which has strong diplomatic and financial support from the United States.
Russia has been asking for an international meeting on displaced people in the Commonwealth of Independent States since 1993. But many Russian officials have been concerned primarily with the fate of ethnic Russians driven from new nations or barred from citizenship. Russia has also sought money for migrants returning to the federation from former republics.
Officials of the High Commissioner for Refugees' office in Geneva say that from its inception, the conference was intended mainly to provide a forum for refugee issues in the Commonwealth of Independent States and as a spur to better analysis of regional population movements that could lead to the adoption of national strategies for dealing with population movements.
Questions of citizenship must be settled by national governments, these officials say.
John Horekens, director of the European bureau of the High Commissioner for Refugees, said in an interview today that the meeting could not solve all the problems of the region, but it could "at least get a dialogue going."
"This will be a long process," he said.

HEADLINE: America's Hot Tourist Spot: The Outlet Mall

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: DALE CITY, Va.

 BODY:
Strolling past the Saks Off Fifth outlet, Dress Barn and a camera store in the vast corridors of the Potomac Mills discount mall, three college students from France smiled with anticipation as they spotted a shop that sold athletic wear.
When they emerged with their purchases, including the New York Yankees baseball caps that were high on their list, one student, Philippe D'Haucourt, said, "Now that we've seen the tourist sights, we can go home." 
 His quip held more than a kernel of truth. Potomac Mills and many other discount outlet centers have become so popular with foreign and American tourists that they are now bigger attractions than the Liberty Bell, the Jefferson Memorial, the Alamo and many other traditional tourist treasures.
Of the 17.2 million shoppers who spent $358 million last year at Potomac Mills, 30 miles south of Washington in Virginia's historic Prince William County, at least 4.5 million were tourists, according to a survey of mall visitors.
The travel industry defines a tourist as someone who travels at least 100 miles or stays in a hotel or motel overnight.
Under a somewhat looser definition, as many as six million of the visitors could be considered tourists, said Patrick McMahon, director of the Virginia Department of Tourism.
The gigantic enclosed mall, with its 225 shops, is far and away the most popular tourist destination in this tourism-rich state -- well ahead of Arlington National Cemetery, with four million total visitors a year; Colonial Williamsburg, with 2.5 million, and Mount Vernon, 10 miles or so distant, at one million. The only attraction in the region that rivals Potomac Mills in drawing tourists is the Air and Space Museum on the Mall in Washington. It draws 8.4 million visitors a year, although many of those are from the surrounding region.
To be sure, many people combine shopping with visits to historic sites, amusement parks, beaches or family and friends. But many just want to shop, planning vacations solely around that passion.
And that is not unique to Virginia. From Maine to Hawaii, bargain hunters flock to discount outlets, turning what was once an obscure corner of retailing transacted in mostly out-of-the-way locales into a booming industry. With sales at the 331 outlet centers in the United States projected to exceed $14 billion this year, up from $6.8 billion at 186 centers in 1990, outlets are the fastest-growing segment of the retail industry -- and, it turns out, one of the fastest-growing of the travel industry as well.
The trend includes Potomac Mills and 10 other discount megamalls that feature not just manufacturers' outlets, but also big discounters like Wal-Mart and Ikea and "off-price" stores like Marshall's that typically offer overstocked brand-name merchandise from a broad range of manufacturers and department stores.
Whatever their names, the outlets draw huge numbers of tourists.
In northeastern Philadelphia the 215-store Franklin Mills outlet, which opened in 1989, drew an estimated 17.8 million visitors last year, including almost 6 million tourists. That is four times the 1.5 million total visitors to the Liberty Bell, for decades the state's top tourist attraction.
In San Marcos, Tex., the estimated 4.2 million tourists last year at two outlet centers combined far exceeded the total of 2.9 million visitors drawn by the Alamo in San Antonio.
And Pigeon Forge, Tenn., a hamlet of fewer than 3,330 people with 200 outlet shops, drew 10 million visitors last year, a million more than visited the Great Smoky Mountains National Park nearby, the nation's most heavily visited destination park.
George Ku Tours in New Castle, Pa., 55 miles north of Pittsburgh, runs three-day shopping tours to the Williamsburg Pottery Factory near Williamsburg, Va., with a stop at Potomac Mills. "We don't stop at Colonial Williamsburg, since this is an all-shopping tour," said Joan George, an owner of the family business. Buses sometimes return so loaded with packages, she added, that the toilet is used as a storeroom.
Even at Niagara Falls, which has two big outlet malls, shopping often takes precedence over falling water. "You'd be surprised how many bus tours come here for shopping," a spokesman for the visitors' bureau, Tom Darro, said, "and couldn't care less about seeing the falls."
The Travel Industry Association of America recently said shopping was the most popular activity of vacationing Americans last year, and Mr. McMahon has an inkling of the reasons. "The only time many people have to shop," he said, "is when they're on vacation."
To keep tourists flowing in, outlet centers participate in package tours with nearby hotels, golf courses and casinos. In Washington the Gray Line tours feature a daily excursion to Potomac Mills, less than 45 minutes away.
Some conventional malls also draw millions of shoppers. But they tend to be in major urban centers, charge full price and cater overwhelmingly to local shoppers.
The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., a behemoth with more than 400 stores, 50 restaurants, 9 nightclubs and a roller coaster in a space that could fit seven Yankee Stadiums, is one of a kind. Last year it drew 40 million visitors, including at least 12 million tourists, more than Walt Disney World, the Grand Canyon and Graceland combined.
But outlet centers, even spick-and-span Potomac Mills, are usually no-frills places. And no developer today would dream of picking a spot for one without careful regard for tourists. It was not until about 1988, three years after Potomac Mills had opened in what was a largely wooded area, that tour buses and out-of-state cars made their presence felt.
"That's when we began an all-out push to be included in Virginia and Washington's familiarization tours for tour operators, travel agents and travel writers," said L. Kathy Pelino, director of tour and travel for Potomac Mills. That is also when developers who had not already done so began locating outlet centers with tourists in mind.
Yet for all the glass and chrome of the newer malls, the 300 outlet stores in restored factories and buildings in Reading, Pa., are thriving. Credited with being the first multitenant manufacturers' outlet center, Reading's outlets, which started to open in 1974, attract eight million visitors a year, including millions of day trippers from the Philadelphia region, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrive on 10,000 tour buses.
Although outlet shops have been a godsend for Reading, some tourism officials regard them as a mixed blessing. They provide jobs and tax revenue, yes, but critics say they also contribute to sprawl, traffic jams and one-industry economies.
The economic effects are considerable. Potomac Mills provided $3.4 million in retail sales taxes in the 1995 fiscal year, or 20 percent of Prince William County's total sales tax, along with 2,400 jobs.
But Jerome L. McElroy, a professor of economics at St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Ind., who has written widely on the economic effect of tourism, said the benefits of outlet malls and shopping centers were often exaggerated.
"They basically deal in merchandise that is marked up, but to which only a small amount of local value is added, unlike, say, dollars spent touring historic grounds," Professor McElroy said. Switching the emphasis from history to shopping, he said, will inevitably change the mix of visitors and risk eroding the character of a state's tourism appeal.
Almost all outlet centers belong to local and state tourism bureaus. Potomac Mills also belongs to Capital Region USA, a cooperative encompassing Virginia, Washington and Maryland that advertises in Europe.
For as the students from France who are visiting here demonstrate, not only American tourists love to shop. Two German exchange students arrived after a two-hour drive, ready to do some serious shopping.
"I have a large shopping list from my roommates for at least 10 pairs of Levis," said Melanie Roehm of Cologne. Her companion, Christel Orth of Frankfurt, said Germany's few outlet stores were so scattered that "you have to travel all over the country to visit them."
A United Airlines advertising campaign in Europe, intended to promote the carrier's hub at Dulles International Airport, features Potomac Mills prominently. In one advertisement asking "Why Washington?" the airline answered by listing Potomac Mills first, ahead of Capitol Hill and the Smithsonian Institution.
"Our foreign passengers love to shop," Milton Perry, a bus driver for the Gray Line tour to Potomac Mills, said. "They come here from all over, and when they go back to Washington they're loaded down."
Last year 5 of the 4,200 tour buses to Franklin Mills in Philadelphia were filled with Kuwaitis. Gurnee Mills in Illinois attracted groups from Ukraine and Tanzania.
Sawgrass Mills near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which draws an estimated 5.7 million tourists among its 19 million visitors a year, is a magnet for Latin American visitors. Speaking of their free-spending ways, Anne Lipscomb, vice president of marketing for the Mills Corporation, which owns Sawgrass and Potomac Mills, said, "I've never seen so many teen-agers with gold cards in my life."

HEADLINE: Quarrel Imperils Health Care in Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
Since the mid-1970's, the only source of medical care in Cite Soleil, the biggest slum in the poorest nation of the Western Hemisphere, has been a hospital and clinics operated by a private Haitian organization called the Centers for Development and Health. But that has not necessarily made the group or its director, Dr. Reginald Boulos, popular here.
On the contrary, when Dr. Boulos escorted Tipper Gore, who was visiting Haiti with her husband, Vice President Al Gore, on a tour of the centers last fall, their caravan was stoned. Now, citing death threats against him and his 1,500 employees, Dr. Boulos has closed his 114-bed hospital and three clinics and offered to hand them over to the Haitian Government -- which has, to the consternation of Cite Soleil's residents, rejected the proposal. 
 "I believe that 100 percent of the problem is related not to the quality of the health care we were offering, but to politics," Dr. Boulos said in an interview at the headquarters of his organization, known by its French initials, C.D.S. "Politically, this place is a gold mine: more than 200,000 people living in less than two square miles."
As Dr. Boulos, an American-educated Haitian of Arab descent, sees it, the hostility toward him stems from a widespread perception that he is not a supporter of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's former President, and the governing Lavalas movement, which Mr. Aristide continues to dominate. The Haitian Government has repeatedly failed to respond to his requests for police protection, he said, "sending a clear signal to me that they see Cite Soleil as their turf and want me out of there."
Not so, replied Dr. Rudolphe Mallebranche, Haiti's Minister of Health. "It was a problem of financing," he maintained. "Dr. Boulos's international funding was drying up."
Asked for their version of events, aid donors acknowledged plans to channel assistance away from the project beginning in July, but said they were doing so at the specific request of the Haitian Government.
Whatever its cause, the dispute has left Cite Soleil's residents, who are among the most destitute people in Haiti, living in squalor without any organized health care. At St. Catherine's Maternity Hospital, for instance, deliveries of babies have ceased altogether and eight Sisters of Charity have been struggling since mid-April to maintain a few basic services for pregnant women and infants, such as vaccines and food.
"We simply could not abandon these people, so of course we decided to stay," said one of the harried nuns, a Spaniard who was willing to disclose only her first name, Sister Milagros. "Too many children were dying. It was terrible."
On one recent morning, the nuns were forced to turn away a young woman who had come with her listless, emaciated infant, its eyes rolling and unfocused, because they did not have the medicine the child needed. Disheartened, the penniless mother sat in the courtyard sobbing, the baby in her arms, until she was given bus fare to get to a municipal infirmary downtown.
Outside the hospital, graffiti proclaiming that "Boulos = Health" have replaced the slogans that once attacked the C.D.S. director as a "zenglendo," or associate of the Tontons Macoute, the paramilitary thugs who flourished under the 30-year Duvalier family dictatorship and its military successors. Patients say they want the group to come back and run the hospital, whose budget is largely underwritten by the United States Agency for International Development, but they seem unsure of how to do that or where to turn for help in the interim.
"Now I've resigned myself to the fact that I'll get skinny and die," said Sonia Leres, 23, an unemployed mother of two who suffers from tuberculosis, along with her 3-year-old daughter, Carola. "If I can't get free X-rays and medicine here anymore, what am I going to do?"
Dr. Mallebranche said that while he is sympathetic to the plight of the nuns and the residents of Cite Soleil, the Haitian Government can do little for them at the moment. "You can understand that the Ministry of Health, which does not have much money, is not prepared for this situation," he explained. "We have to plan for this, to evaluate the situation at the center."
The director of one foreign aid organization that has long supported the Cite Soleil project said the main problem is one of competence. "We're not going to make fools of this Government and ourselves," he said. "We can't turn over implementation to them because they simply can't do it."
Aid donors here said they sent a joint letter to Dr. Mallebranche recently, warning that $42.5 million in international health assistance was languishing in the Government bureaucracy would be sent elsewhere unless the Ministry began dispensing it. "While he wants all the money to go through his desk, he has no capacity to administer anything," complained one donor in an interview.
Community groups that support the Lavalas movement have long been hostile to Dr. Boulos and his organization. During the three brutal years of military dictatorship that preceded Mr. Aristide's restoration to power in October 1994, they accused him of providing information on his clients to the paramilitary thugs who killed hundreds of people in Cite Soleil as well as of supplying jobs and food to some of the most notorious gunmen.
Dr. Boulos admits to trying not to antagonize the military regime and its agents, but said it was "a conscious decision" taken to avoid the shutdown of the hospital and a program that fed 29,000 people. "There were enough human rights groups making noise, and I felt that my duty as a doctor was to provide humanitarian assistance," he said.
After American troops returned Mr. Aristide to power, the level of acrimony diminished somewhat, and Dr. Boulos was even invited to join a government task force on education. But when the episode involving Mrs. Gore was followed by other attacks, he left the country for four months and began to look more favorably on the idea of shifting the focus of his activities to the Haitian countryside.
"That was an incident designed to embarrass me, and it did," Dr. Boulos said. "It achieved its purpose, which was to put me in a difficult situation with my funding agencies."
Even if C.D.S. were asked to return to Cite Soleil, Dr. Boulos added, he would not do so. The group is expanding its activities in the northeast of Haiti, he said, where local officials are grateful for any outside help and political rivalries are less of a factor.
Nevertheless, "my dream is for the Government to succeed in picking up where we left off in Cite Soleil," Dr. Boulos said. "If all of this stays closed, then we have failed too."

HEADLINE: French Fail To End Unrest Disrupting Central Africa

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

 BODY:
BANGUI, Central African Republic, May 25
A French foreign minister in the 1970's used to be fond of saying that Africa was the last remaining place on earth where Paris could change the course of history by deploying a mere 500 soldiers.
But a week after an army mutiny that turned into a cyclone of looting and protest against an unpopular Government and against French intervention, even the deployment of hundreds more French troops showed no signs of decisively tipping the balance in favor of the elected President, Ange-Felix Patasse. 
 Today the looting moved from the city center, where nearly every business has been smashed and emptied, to the affluent neighborhoods on the banks of the Ubangi River, where most senior diplomats live. Throughout the day, canoes could be seen ferrying freshly stolen goods across the river to Zaire.
French and American diplomats continued discussions today about evacuating scores of their citizens living in isolated parts of the country.
Early today, thieves began ransacking American official residences and the residence of the World Bank representatives, among others, before they were chased off by patrolling troops. "What we are seeing, unfortunately, is just a total breakdown of law and order," said a Western diplomat.
In the devastated city center, French soldiers crouched in defensive positions behind the bullet-pocked walls of businesses destroyed in the looting while hundreds of anti-Government protesters marched today for the third day, defying a ban on public gatherings and angrily denouncing the French presence here.
A bit farther down the principal road, Avenue Barthelemy Boganda, rebellious soldiers, called FACA, or Armed Forces of Central Africa, stayed close to huge mango trees with their automatic weapons in case of an assault on their positions.
Not far from the international airport, next to France's Central African air base here, another march was organized this morning. This one, in favor of the Government, drew a somewhat smaller crowd, and lacked the fervor of the anti-Government demonstration.
Sentiment here seemed to weigh heavily against a leader whose tenure has been marked by incompetence and corruption. Many workers here have gone unpaid for months.
Many people now blame the President for the deaths of at least a dozen mutinous soldiers and an undetermined number of others at the hands of French troops who swooped into action here on Wednesday.
"What is tolerable in ordinary times becomes intolerable when people are hungry and they are not receiving their salaries," said one civil servant, explaining the outburst of popular anger that has destroyed much of this city. "When this happens, it suffices to tell someone that the President is responsible and people start lining up to take action."
Another bystander, drawn to the conversation, said of the intervention: "We are not against an intervention per se, which has protected some people, but rather the form of intervention. "We would have liked to see the French come in here and help calm spirits and not wage a war. Now, people have died at their hands and these bitter memories will die hard."
Others explained their support of the mutineers, whose leaders, enlisted men and junior officers, continued talks today with Gen. Bernard Thorette, the French commander.
"The troops of the FACA were right," said Fernand Gretalita, a watchman on the main boulevard. "The President says he is going to form a broad-based government, but he should have done that long ago. Instead, he surrounded himself with cronies who were stealing money from the country pell-mell.
"It is too bad that this all led to so much violence. Maybe the soldiers should have stayed in their barracks, but now the thieves in the Government must go."
The army mutiny, the second in two months, grew out of an insolvent Government's inability to pay soldiers who were owed several months salaries before their first uprising..
Most other Government employees are owed back pay as well. Two years after a 50 percent devaluation of the local French-backed franc, purchasing power and living standards for almost all but senior officials have plummeted.
"The soldiers, who go into the bush for a month at a time to defend our country from insurgents and poachers from Sudan and Chad and come back to town, are not paid," said Jose Yambi, who spoke near the demarcation line that separates French and rebel positions. "What do you expect them to do? And what of us, the people, who don't get paid and have no guns to back our demands?"
From the start of this crisis, many residents have bitterly criticized the French, who have long wielded tremendous influence here.
Gangs of angry youths, many wielding crude weapons, approached a visitor who walked the streets here today, but their threats evaporated once they were convinced he was not French.
"What we were living was a disguised colonialism," said Appolonaire Bina Doumba, 31, who studied in France. "In every office where anything is decided here, you find a Frenchman. But these events represent an end of that era."
Told that other French-speaking heads of state had applauded the French intervention in support of President Patasse, Mr. Doumba, broke out in a cackling laugh.
"All of those heads of state support Patasse because they are all products of the same French-dominated system," he said as he showed visitors the French Cultural Center, which was burned down the other day. "What do they know about the Central African Republic? Nothing.
"They do what they are told, just like our President, because they have all been bought by France."

The Promise of a Raise For Minimum-Wage Earners

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

 BODY:
Democrats scored an impressive victory, House Republicans got rid of a political toothache and the two million workers at the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage got halfway to a raise last week.
On Thursday the House voted, 281 to 144, to raise the minimum wage to $4.75 on July 1, and then to $5.15 a year later. Another 9.7 million workers getting less than $5.15 would also get a hike. The last vote to raise the wage was in 1989, and inflation has eaten up that increase. 
 Republicans fought to keep the issue from being voted on for nearly two months, but the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hammered vulnerable members with television ads. Ninety-three Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the raise. The issue now goes to the Senate, where the impending departure of Bob Dole may lower the political temperature enough so the subject can be voted on there. ADAM CLYMER

Plane Crash's Ripple Effect

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
After a plane crash, consumer confidence in the airline drops. But after a Valujet DC-9 crashed near Miami recently, travelers questioned the safety of other fledgling, low-fare carriers, even though the crash was the first for an American jet airline established after deregulation in 1978. Airlines like Jet Train saw bookings fall as much as 30 percent. Nations Air decided their its loss was too great and halted service connecting Boston, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Last week it announced plans to enter the charter business. ADAM BRYANT

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Museum Chief Resigns After 13 Years

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Robert T. Buck, who as director of the Brooklyn Museum for 13 years has led it through a period of great expansion and severe budgetary cutbacks, has resigned. He will leave the post on July 1.
"I've been thinking about this for a long time," Mr. Buck said in a telephone interview. "I need to go back to art. I'm an art historian, but lately I've been doing everything but. Fund-raising has become such a crushing part of a museum director's job." 
 Robert S. Rubin, chairman of the museum's board, said he and Mr. Buck had been discussing his possible resignation for several weeks. "I'm very sorry he's leaving," Mr. Rubin said. "Finding a museum director is not an easy job, and I don't expect it to be done rapidly." A search committee is being formed, Mr. Rubin said, and the museum has no candidates.
Linda S. Ferber, the museum's chief curator and the curator of American painting and sculpture, will become acting director until a permanent replacement is named. Roy Eddey, the deputy director, will assume the newly created position of acting president. They will divide Mr. Buck's former duties.
Museum officials said the board had not decided whether to follow institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in appointing a paid president, who would take care of the administrative and business end of the museum, in addition to a director, who would be concerned with curatorial affairs.
During his tenure, Mr. Buck, 57, oversaw a master plan to renovate and enlarge the museum's building on Eastern Parkway, which houses the second-largest art museum in New York City, after the Met. Its expansion has included the addition of 30,000 square feet of gallery space, a 460-seat auditorium and a new 30,000- square-foot space for art storage.
He also helped organize many popular exhibitions, among them "The Machine Age in America: 1918-1941," "Courbet Reconsidered" and "Louise Bourgeois: The Locus of Memory, Works 1982-1993," a smaller version of which represented the United States at the 1993 Venice Biennale. A series of site-specific installations by contemporary artists in the museum's lobby included "The Brooklyn Museum Collection: The Play of the Unmentionable," by Joseph Kosuth, as well as installations by Leon Golub, Chris Burden, Dale Chihuly, Komar and Melamid, Jenny Holzer and Martin Puryear.
Mr. Buck also oversaw the reinstallation of some of the museum's permanent collections, including its Egyptian and African collections. Important recent acquisitions included a rare set of 14 mid-18th-century portraits of the kings of the Inca empire painted by artisans of the Cuzco school in Peru; a 14th-century Florentine altarpiece painted by Nardo di Cione; a promised gift of more than 27 paintings and works on paper by Leon Polk Smith, the New York abstract artist; a bequest of 31 20th-century works from the New York collection of Edith and Milton Lowenthal, and a sculpture by Louise Bourgeois.
While its endowment has grown to $40 million from $12 million over the last 13 years, the museum has been hit by severe cutbacks in city and state funds. In 1991, reductions in city funds caused a $2 million cut to the museum's annual operating budget, leading to the layoff of more than 50 staff members. Budget reductions have also forced the museum to close an additional day each week, so it is now open only five days rather than six.
Until the city and state supplied an $800,000 challenge grant in 1994, which was matched by Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, the museum also had to rotate the opening of its galleries as another cost-cutting measure.
"The last six years, have been extremely difficult, due to the downturn of the city's economic development," Mr. Buck said. "But we've still been able to do some amazing things."
Mr. Buck joined the museum after 13 years at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, where he began as assistant director and was appointed director in 1973.
He received a bachelor's degree from Williams College and a master's degree in art history from the New York University Institute of Fine Arts.
Asked what he plans to do next, Mr. Buck said, "I expect I'll be looking for another post, which may be in another museum, but it also could be with a foundation."

Wesleyan Senior Leaves a Bit of Himself Behind: His Hair

 BODY:
At a school known for political rallies and protests, the president of the graduating class at Wesleyan University made yet another symbolic gesture yesterday during his commencement speech: He cut off his ponytail.
Christopher A. Bellavia, a theater major from Saugus, Mass., urged his classmates to keep questioning the status quo after they leave college. It wouldn't matter, he added, what they looked like. 
 "We have learned," he said, as he began cutting off his ponytail and his fellow graduates began applauding and screaming, "that it is the passion in our hearts that really matters. So let us now go undercover. Let us put on our business suits and dresses. Let us cut or change our hair. They will never see us coming."
Wesleyan's president, Douglas J. Bennet, said after Mr. Bellavia's speech, "Honors in theater indeed."
In the main graduation speech, A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., the retired judge and civil rights activist, told the graduates that the United States can become a greater nation only if its leaders and people do not ignore the plight of others.
"I will make two requests of you," Mr. Higginbotham said. "They are that you always attempt to see those human beings who have become invisible to most people, and that you always try to hear the pleas of those persons who, despite their pain and suffering, have become voiceless and forgotten."
Later, he added, "I trust that you will never sign on to any contract with America that sanctions or promotes exclusion rather than inclusion of the weak, the poor, women, minorities and persons of color."
Mr. Higginbotham most recently served as Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia before retiring in 1993.
Wesleyan conferred 677 undergraduate degrees and 116 graduate degrees. Along with Mr. Higginbotham, receiving honorary degrees were the opera singer Jessye Norman; Nell Irvin Painter, a professor of American history at Princeton University; John C. Sawhill, president of the Nature Conservancy, and Dr. Jay A. Levy, an AIDS researcher at the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco.
 
Cornell University
Cornell University held its commencement ceremonies yesterday for 6,000 degree recipients with President Hunter R. Rawlings 3d praising students for their activism.
Over the last year, the university has been the site of a contentious debate over whether to continue allowing freshmen to live in so-called program houses, dormitories that focus on black, Hispanic and American Indian cultures. The dorms have been criticized as discriminatory.
The university's plans to review program houses drew heated protests, and in his speech to the graduates, the president praised the students' involvement in the issue.
"You've contributed to every aspect of the university and years from now, it will continue to bear the imprint of your Cornell years," he said in words greeted by loud applause. "Thank you for reassuring me the Cornell tradition of demonstrations and protests is alive and well."
For the most part, the ceremony was high-spirited, ending two days of activities which included a convocation speech by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
In his speech, Mr. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, said nature enriches mankind economically, spiritually and culturally.
"We are not preserving those northern forests, as Rush Limbaugh would argue, for the sake of a spotted owl," he said. "We are preserving those forests because we believe they have more value to humanity standing than they would have if we cut them down."

The Devil We Know

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"There are two devils," says Grigory Yavlinsky, the democratic reformer presumably running third in the race for president of Russia. "One is a small devil -- that is Yeltsin. One is a big devil -- that is the Communist Zyuganov."
The 44-year-old free-market economist is explaining the dilemma facing Russian voters as they go to the polls June 16. We are on a telephone line being sloppily tapped by the K.G.B. -- a kind of conference call with clicks and sudden drops in volume. 
 "All the media here," says Yavlinsky, "on the theory of choosing the lesser of two evils, tell the people 'better the small devil.' But they forget that when the small devil overcomes the big devil, he becomes the bigger devil."
Yavlinsky is the victim of media that believe that the only way to preserve their freedom, endangered by a return to Communism, is to manipulate the report. By becoming propagandists -- building up one candidate, blacking out all the others -- almost all Russian national media have been shamelessly committed to breathing new life into Boris Yeltsin.
Polls show the lesser-evil campaign has been working. Yeltsin's support has supposedly grown from single digits to about 20 percent, matching the percentage supposedly achieved by the Communist leader, leaving other candidates in single digits.
Russian polling has a record of being egregiously wrong, and most present polls wildly assume voter turnout of 85 percent. But the press drumbeating of the polls has produced a self-fulfilling prophecy in cities, giving momentum to a Yeltsin comeback. When local polls fail to tout Yeltsin, as in the Urals, they are squelched; in reform-minded Novgorod, where Yavlinsky led Yeltsin substantially, results went unreported.
A few weeks ago, when he was panicked by the possibility of Gennadi Zyuganov getting a majority on the first ballot, Yeltsin called in Yavlinsky to discuss joining government with reformist forces.
The reformer was ready to deal. He would support a Yeltsin recommitted to private property and human rights, to ending the war in Chechnya and to firing corrupt ministers.
The Russian President was at first inclined to accept these conditions, but his palace guard was not. His venal handlers promised control of the polling places as well as media domination, and -- if Communist Zyuganov still outpolled the ballot-box-stuffing Yeltsinites -- a long suspension of the runoff on the pretense that "we wuz robbed."
Evidently Russia's President now believes his own publicity. Last Friday, as Yeltsin dickered with nationalists as well as mafia bankers who wanted a deal with the Communists, Yavlinsky announced that there could be no pre-election coalition between the Kremlin and the reformers.
What should Americans root for? We cannot influence the outcome beyond President Clinton's bear hug of Boris, and his approval of an international loan that let Yeltsin pay overdue salaries to workers. But many of us hate to watch without wishing.
We cannot be for the Communist. After interviewing Zyuganov, I concluded that he was not the stolid apparatchik and lousy campaigner he was cracked down to be; on the contrary, he is an adroit politician, alert and robust, capable of presenting one face to the West and the opposite on the stump. If Communists win, this Russian election could be the last.
Nor should we root for a Yeltsin triumph. As Yavlinsky says: "After leading Russia down the path of corruption; after killing 60,000 people in Chechnya for nothing -- if the people still supported Yeltsin, he would think he's God. There would be no limit to his power."
Yavlinsky's chances are small; the nationalists and militarists offer no hope; what would be the best outcome for Russia and the world?
I'm rooting for a widely split vote on June 16, with even Lebed and Zhirinovsky and Gorbachev cutting into the front-runners, and with Yavlinsky's "I Choose Freedom" campaign running strong.
Then, seeing the nationalist and military browns line up behind the Communist reds, Yeltsin would be forced to sign a public contract with the democrats to build his runoff majority. If he then won and did not double-cross, Russia would take the road of reform.
It's a sharp-angled cushion shot, but it's better than rooting only for the devil we know.

Republican Tax Cutters Being Heard in Their Party
After years when many in Washington focused on deficit reduction, Republican proponents of deep tax cuts are once again getting a serious hearing within their party.
They no longer call themselves supply siders; they are asserting that the condition of the economy and the fight faced by Bob Dole in his Presidential campaign now make the time right to commit to sweeping tax cuts. [Page 1.]
 
From Cheap Books to $24 CD's
A global snapshot of consumers' media tastes in nine countries shows that American exports of movies, nonfiction books, magazines, CD's and television programming are everywhere. But the Japanese love their own pop music and Indians prefer their own movies. And in Paris, despite the rich fare of cinemas and bistros, the French are staying home to watch films on television. [32-33.]
 
'Mission: Impossible' Is Top Gun
Viacom's "Mission: Impossible" was expected to earn at least $52.5 million over the weekend, pushing Time Warner's "Twister" back to No. 2 at the box office. The Leslie Nielsen farce, "Spy Hard," was No. 3. Final figures are due tomorrow. Most Wanted. [34.]
 
Making Music With Brains
In the Media Lab at M.I.T., the composer Tod Machover is working on a model of a brain that would demonstrate a theory of intelligence. Hanging from the top of a triangular prism of metal struts are two large white pods that will eventually be covered with what appear to be soft plastic urchins. On a PC linked to the Internet, a web of neurons appears, flashing different colors as they are touched by the cursor. Nearby, a singer, hitting the right pitch, causes an image of an eye to open on a monitor. The work is part of a huge musical composition, "The Brain Opera," to be performed at Lincoln Center in July. Edward Rothstein: Technology. [31.]
 
New Hope for New York Consumers
In New York City, where arrogant sales clerks and sky-high utility bills are symbols of the economic landscape, greater consumer choice is breaking out all over. A new wave of competition has empowered customers to demand better treatment, and businesses are responding. [1.]
 
Cable's Gains Eclipse NBC's
NBC so thoroughly dominated the 1995-96 television season that even executives at rival networks resorted to comparing NBC to the Chicago Bulls. But cable television continues to take a toll. This season the share of the audience controlled by cable channels surged to a 30 share from 25. The networks' share fell 4 points, to 65. Bill Carter: Television. [31.]
 
Added Benefit of Osteoporosis Drug
The newest drug to fight osteoporosis has been shown to reduce by half the risk of broken hips. The study, financed by Merck, which makes the drug, and conducted by the University of California at San Francisco, suggests that alendronate, whose brand name is Fosamax, prevents hip fractures as effectively as the hormone estrogen does. [20.]

Go Take a Hike -- on the Net
The Internet has many sources of information on national parks, monuments and hiking trails, from Government and other sources. Net surfers with fast connections can even get virtual tours. Taking In the Sites. [34.]
 
Move Over, Dick Tracy
An inventor's combination wristwatch and pepper sprayer probably won't ever become a staple in James Bond's cache of weapons. But William W. Moseley is hoping that it will have broad appeal to ordinary people who want a handy defense. Teresa Riordan: Patents. [30.]

HEADLINE: AN AMERICAN PLACE -- Shifting Allegiances;
Backers of Bush in '92 Are Turning to Clinton

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, May 26

 BODY:
Judith Snow, 57, is the voter Bob Dole must win over if he is to take the Presidency. Mrs. Snow is a Republican, she voted for George Bush in 1992, she runs a small clothing shop in the Republican suburb of North Canton and she is winnable. "I just keep listening to Dole and Clinton," she said. "Some days, you think no, some days yes." But if she cast her vote today, it would be a yes, for Bill Clinton.
Like many people here in Stark County, a strong political bellwether for national politics, Mrs. Snow has been shaken enough by the Republican-led Congress to move to President Clinton for now. In her case, it was Congress's effort to scale back Medicare benefits. Three-quarters of all voters questioned here in a new poll think that cutting Medicare was wrong, including nearly two-thirds of all Republicans. 
 "I have an elderly mother lying in the hospital right now and she has Medicare, but it's not enough," said Mrs. Snow, whose husband is a product coordinator for Diebold, a manufacturer of automated teller machines. "If they have to put her in a nursing home, we'll have to pay for it. My husband and I are five years from retirement and we're wondering how we're going to make it."
As for President Clinton, she said: "I give him credit. If he hadn't vetoed, who knows what would have happened with the budget and Medicare and that?"
To be sure, it is early. But here in this conservative northeastern Ohio county of 370,000, a place that usually votes for the Presidential winner, Mr. Clinton appears to enjoy a considerable lead as the national campaign moves into its summer phase. He is ahead of Mr. Dole by 50 percent to 33 percent among registered voters in a poll of Stark County by The New York Times in collaboration with the Ohio State University School of Journalism and the Northwestern University Survey Laboratory. The margin in Stark County is on target with national polls done in the last week by Newsweek, Time, CBS and The Washington Post, showing President Clinton ahead by between 16 and 22 points.
The poll of 814 adults in Stark County, completed May 5, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Like Mrs. Snow, 22 percent of those who voted for George Bush here in 1992 said they intend to switch to Mr. Clinton this time.
Even if Ohio's popular Republican Governor, George Voinovich, were added to the Dole ticket -- and he is considered a leading contender -- Mr. Clinton still leads here in the poll 49 to 38 percent.
But there are also indicators that Mr. Clinton's numbers are not as strong as they first appear. For someone so far ahead, the President's image among voters is not particularly impressive, with 42 percent favorable versus 34 percent unfavorable. In follow-up interviews, many of those polled sounded like Teresa Barnett, a Republican, who said she was leaning toward Mr. Clinton. "Clinton hasn't done anything that bad, yet," she said.
Stark County, a 90-minute drive from Democratic Cleveland to the north and two hours from Republican Columbus on the west, has long viewed itself as a political swing area, just the sort of mainstream place that would be home to the Football Hall of Fame and the Christian Hall of Fame. The poll seems to substantiate the notion; 35 percent of the residents call themselves Democrats, 34 percent Republicans and 25 percent independents.
The area's economy mirrors the nation's. In 1992, when the recession probably cost Mr. Bush the Presidency, unemployment here was 8 percent. Today it is 5.2 percent, compared with the national 5.4 rate. This is the home of Timken steel and bearings, the Hoover vacuum cleaner and the Diebold A.T.M., and all three companies are prospering. Indeed, W. R. (Tim) Timken Jr. says his company, the largest local employer, is in the best financial shape of its 100-year history.
Economic matters are by far the biggest concern among those polled, and on a whole, people seem to feel they are not doing badly. Thirty-four percent said they were better off than four years ago; 48 percent said their situation was the same, and 18 percent said worse. "I just got home from working 13 hours at Timken," said Sally Beans, 51, who has been promoted in the last year and counts herself better off. "I used to be a data-entry operator -- now I'm a time and process product handler." Ms. Beans voted for Mr. Bush in 1992 but leans toward Mr. Clinton now.
John Durkin, 24, a college student at Kent State University and a cook, is another Bush voter in 1992 who is moving to Mr. Clinton. "I'm making more money and my friends are making more," Mr. Durkin said.
After supporting Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the 1980's, Stark voters backed Mr. Clinton in 1992, giving him 40 percent to 35 percent for Mr. Bush and 24 percent for Ross Perot. In the poll, when Mr. Perot is added, Mr. Clinton receives 40 percent, Mr. Dole 29 percent and Mr. Perot 20 percent.
The Perot voters here would be more likely to vote for Mr. Clinton than Mr. Dole in a two-way race.
If Stark County has any political tilt, it is probably slightly more Republican and conservative than the nation. In the last 30 years, the one election here in which voters strayed from the national outcome was 1976, when they supported the Republican, Gerald Ford, over Jimmy Carter.
All of this makes poll results on the conservative Republican leadership in Congress striking. Forty-six percent here give Speaker Newt Gingrich an unfavorable rating, compared with 19 percent favorable. Asked who was to blame for the Government shutdowns in the Washington budget battles last winter, 45 percent blamed the Republican Congress, while 27 percent faulted President Clinton.
Stark County has a long anti-tax history that seemed right in step with the forces that gave the Republicans control of Congress in 1994. Seven times here, beginning in the 1980's and continuing through November 1994, Stark voters defeated an increase in the county sales tax, forcing dramatic government cuts.
But since 1995 there is evidence here of some softening of that anti-tax attitude. In 1995, Stark voters passed the sales tax increase, and then this March voters in seven of nine local school districts supported measures to increase their taxes.
In the poll, 69 percent here said the Republican Congress's effort to reduce financing for job training programs for laid-off workers was a bad idea; 59 percent opposed Congress's cuts in legal aid for the poor.
Mr. Clinton seems to have succeeded in identifying himself as a proponent of such programs, without appearing too liberal. Diane Metzger, 38, a Republican from Louisville, a conservative suburb that is 99.6 percent white, said she voted for Mr. Bush in 1992 but now likes Mr. Clinton. "I think he's not a liberal Democrat -- I think," she said.
Still, if Mr. Dole seems weak here, his supporters can find a fair amount of hope in the poll. Character problems continue to dog the President. When asked whether Mr. Clinton has more honesty and integrity than most people in public life, 34 percent answered yes.
Bill Jones, a quality assurance manager, is switching to Mr. Dole from Mr. Perot to make sure his vote against Mr. Clinton counts this time. "Clinton and his White House are the most politically corrupt since Nixon," Mr. Jones said. "Clinton goes down the tubes for me when it comes to sincerity -- everything he does is for political gain."
While Mr. Dole's numbers are not stellar, many voters have not made up their minds on him. He is rated favorably by 27 percent, versus 29 percent unfavorable with 45 percent saying they "don't know" or are "undecided."
With the divisive primaries over, there are signs that things are improving for Republicans. People here watch television stations in Cleveland. For months they saw nothing but Democratic advertisements bashing Mr. Dole. The last few weeks Republican advertisements have appeared, showing Mr. Clinton making his now infamous comments about realizing belatedly that he had raised taxes too much.
Even on an issue as divisive as abortion, the Republicans appear to be moving toward common ground. When Bob Craven, head of the small Christian Coalition chapter here was interviewed by a reporter in January, he said all abortions should be banned. He said then that he planned to vote for the best person regardless of electability and Alan Keyes was his favorite candidate.
By the March primary, he voted for Mr. Dole, and now Mr. Craven says, "There is some room in the Republican platform for discussion." Recently Mr. Craven was elected to the county's Republican central committee.
John Green, a University of Akron professor of who specializes in religion and politics, sees hope for the Republicans. "You don't want to bet the family farm on it yet," he said, "but I see indications that the Christian Coalition could moderate its views enough for the Republican coalition to hang together."
 
How the Poll Was Taken
 The poll of the Canton, Ohio, area is based on telephone interviews conducted April 20 to May 5 with 814 adults throughout Stark County, Ohio.
Collaborating with The Times in polling Stark County were Prof. Paul J. Lavrakas, director of the Northwestern University Survey Laboratory, and Prof. Gerald Kosicki of the School of Journalism at Ohio State University.
A random sample of telephone numbers in Stark County was provided by Survey Sampling Inc. of Fairfield, Conn. Within each household one adult was selected by a random procedure to respond to the survey. The interviewing was conducted by the Northwestern University Survey Laboratory of Evanston, Ill.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adults in Stark County, Ohio.
 
 Throughout the Presidential election year, articles in this series will examine Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County, a political bellwether for decades.

NEW YORK
 
Why Is That Man Smiling at Me?
In a region where the arrogant sales clerk and the sky-high utility bill are stock symbols of the economic landscape, consumer power is breaking out all over, or is poised to. As companies that once avoided New York have entered the city with services the suburbs take for granted, a new wave of old-fashioned competition has enabled customers to demand better treatment, and businesses, from telephone companies to grocery stores, are giving it. [Page 1.]
 
Out for Blood in Arverne
The Rockaways might appear the perfect place to spend the summer, but with a salt marsh, wildlife sanctuary and standing water in vacant lots, they have possibly the worst mosquito problem in New York City, especially in Arverne. One woman is raising bats, which love mosquitoes. Some local officials are complaining that the city endangered residents' well-being when it stopped spraying several years ago. [21.]
 
Roller Coaster Injures 2
A wheel fell off the Jumbo Jet roller coaster on Coney Island Saturday night, injuring two riders and once again raising questions about the safety of rides at city amusement parks. One passenger, who received 14 stitches in her head, recalled her terror as the car skidded and people began screaming. The accident evoked memories of a more serious one last summer when 13 people on the Hell Hole ride were injured, two of them critically. [21.]
 
Murder, Manslaughter, Mayor
New York City's Mayor is not only the city's putative police commissioner and sometime judge, but he also seems to insist on being prosecutor in chief as well. After the Bronx District Attorney filed manslaughter instead of murder charges against a man implicated in the death of a police officer, Mayor Giuliani angrily offered to take over the case. His offer is politically useful, but charging murder and getting a conviction are two different things. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [21.]
 
Another Burst Water Main
A 92-year-old water main on the Upper West Side of Manhattan broke, briefly sending a stream down Broadway and marking the second time this month that a burst pipe in Manhattan has closed streets and disrupted subway service. The break, after a veritable deluge near Times Square three weeks ago, raised concerns about the condition of the 6,000 miles of water mains. It also brought a promise of increased efforts to inspect pipes near transportation networks. [23.]
 
Inmate Disturbance at Rikers
About a dozen inmates on Rikers Island staged a protest by igniting their blankets and throwing them into a corridor, creating a plume of smoke that overpowered six corrections officers and two inmates, prison officials said. [23.]
 
3 Die in Crash off Bridge
Three men were killed and a fourth was critically injured when their speeding car flew off an exit ramp of the Queensboro Bridge, the police said. Officials said the car plunged the equivalent height of a three-story building to an empty lot. [22.]
 
Brooklyn Museum Head Leaves
Robert T. Buck, who as director of the Brooklyn Museum for 13 years has led it through great expansion and severe budget cutbacks, plans to leave his post on July 1. [13.]
 
REGION
 
G.O.P. Giving Pataki Trouble
Governor Pataki is finding himself locked in an all-but-declared war with legislative leaders over the budget, a fray that is isolating him from his fellow Republicans and placing much of his agenda at risk. Senate Republicans are resisting his budget-cutting plan, partly because this year, they and the Democrats all face re-election together, and partly because state legislators are feeling a need to distance themselves from a public backlash against Congressional Republicans. [21.]
 
A Ponytailed Point
At a school known for political rallies and protests, the president of the graduating class at Wesleyan University made yet another symbolic gesture during his commencement speech: He cut off his ponytail. Christopher A. Bellavia, a theater major from Saugus, Mass., urged his classmates in Middletown, Conn., to keep questioning the status quo. It wouldn't matter, he added, what they looked like.
 
And Cornell University held its commencement ceremonies for 6,000 degree recipients, with President Hunter R. Rawlings 3d praising students for their activism. [26.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Computers for Summit High
Mayor Walter D. Long and friends in the suburb of Summit have a dream for the coming millennium: providing personal laptop computers for all Summit's high school students and teachers by the year 2001. Mr. Long and other community leaders have organized a campaign to raise $5 million from Summit's residents and businesses in the next five years to accomplish that goal. The money would buy the notebook-sized computers for Summit High School's 800 students and 100 teachers, beginning this September with incoming freshmen. [24.]

HEADLINE: Choices and Smiles for New York Consumer

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
From the window of his small stationery supply store at the Avenue of the Americas and 18th Street in Manhattan, Michael Jacobs saw his world transformed as giant retail stores, one after another, moved into the once vacant and grimy strip of warehouses where he had operated his store since the mid-1970's. The new stores, with their employee uniforms and their emphasis on smiling, suburban-style service and vast selection, changed everything -- the buildings, the neighborhood and, in the end, Mr. Jacobs himself.
He recreated his 2,800-square-foot shop in the megastores' image. He bought uniforms and name tags for his employees, and walkie-talkies so they would not have to shout to one another over customers' heads. He began accepting returns. He extended his hours, opened on Sunday for the first time, and last Christmas hired his 14-year-old son, Andrew, as doorman. Every new touch, Mr. Jacobs admits, was borrowed from the bigger players across the avenue. 
 "I made it into the 20th century by following these other stores," Mr. Jacobs said. "It's like going to college for getting the customer in your store -- you have to pick up and steal these little ideas."
In a region where the arrogant sales clerk and the sky-high utility bill are stock symbols of the economic landscape, greater consumer choice is breaking out all over, or is poised to. Some of the effects may not be positive -- more competition, consumer experts say, probably means more business failures, for one thing. But as Mr. Jacobs's story shows, a new wave of competition is empowering customers to demand better treatment, and businesses from telephone companies to grocery stores are giving it.
"It means getting at eye-to-eye level with the customer," said Stan Sorkin, a vice president of Pathmark Stores, which operates 17 suburban-style supermarkets in New York City and plans to open eight more in the next five years. Mr. Sorkin takes the eye-level idea literally: the customer-service booths in Pathmark stores have all been lowered by 18 inches, so that shoppers do not feel looked down upon.
The economy in the New York area, and particularly the city itself, has traditionally had a split personality: poor service, limited selection and high prices, especially in poorer neighborhoods, coexist with encyclopedic choices in other areas, like home delivery of expensive foods. A kind of island economy mentality, with expectations of scarcity amid plenty, has been reinforced by habit, politics, high taxes and land prices, and zoning regulations that city officials and business people say inhibited the entry of competitors.
The new pattern of consumer choice has been spurred partly by Government deregulation and technological innovation, but it is mostly the result of old-fashioned competition, as companies that once avoided New York have declared its barricades worth surmounting.
Last year, Wal-Mart came to the New York region for the first time, opening two huge discount stores on Long Island. Office Depot entered as well, opening three of the four largest stores in its national chain in New Jersey and Long Island. The Old Navy Clothing Company came to the Avenue of the Americas, and plans to open stores in the Bronx and Brooklyn later this year. Fairway brought supermarket-scale shopping to Harlem. Stop and Shop arrived from New England, bent on expansion.
The change goes beyond retailing. A new company has opened in Stamford, Conn., selling natural gas under utility competition rules that took effect in New York State on May 1. Orange and Rockland Utilities plans to begin a pilot program this summer to let customers choose their electricity supplier. Nynex, which consumer groups say has one of the worst telephone service records in the nation, is merging with Bell Atlantic, which has one of the best.

More Choices, More Demands
Experts say that consumer choice, once established, tends to be self-perpetuating, attracting new customers while raising the expectations of old ones. That in turn puts pressure on businesses to keep up with their customers' demands, as well as with one another.
"Consumers have a higher expectation of what companies are going to do for them," said Jerry DeSanto, director of information and investigations at the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. "If you walk into a Gap, you assume you're going to get good treatment, and the competition is so fierce for your dollar, that if you go anywhere else, they'd better be as good."
New competitors say that businesses in New York have generally been slower than elsewhere in responding to consumers' changing demands. That spelled opportunity.
"Stores became more customer friendly elsewhere in the country, and as that gap widened, it made it more appealing to come here," said Don Sussman, the vice president and general manager of the Long Island-New Jersey division for the Stop and Shop Supermarket Company. Stop and Shop, based in Massachusetts, bought a 17-store Mel's Food Town chain on Long Island last year, and is now building its first four new stores in the region, all on Long Island.
Some of the bigger established businesses in the city have bent with the winds. Macy's and Lord & Taylor have liberalized their return and exchange policies since the late 1980's, either by extending time limits for returns or eliminating the restrictions altogether, according to surveys by the Better Business Bureau.
Companies also say that keeping up with consumers does not simply mean being nicer. In many cases better customer service means materially different service.
The new Pathmark stores, for example, will all feature lines of prepared meals to reheat at home. And a Wal-Mart spokesman said that getting customers out of the store without long waits has become as important as attracting them.
Mr. Jacobs has found that shoppers lured from outside the neighborhood and even the suburbs to what was known as the Ladies' Mile are different from the local customers that his store, Jam Paper and Envelope, once depended on. Because they do not live nearby, they will come back only if they want to. That changes everything.
"You only get one crack at them," Mr. Jacobs said. "If you want them back, you've got to make them happy."

No Guarantees Of Survival
But the expanding menu in the region does not guarantee a world of sweetness and light. Better service or not, some businesses in the region will undoubtedly fail. And some, like the deli and variety store that were on Mr. Jacobs's block, will be physically displaced by new merchants. Others simply might not find a way to compete in the new era.
And for some businesses, like utilities and telecommunications, experts say the picture is still developing. With the passage of the Federal Telecommunications Act, heightened competition among telephone companies is expected to drive down long-distance rates. But local service rates are generally expected to go up, and the result may be a wash.
The merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic, while holding the promise of better service for Nynex customers, also represents a net decrease in competition, making consumer experts cautious about the long-term benefits.
"If you're a Nynex customer, the grass is always greener wherever you go, but I'd much rather see Bell Atlantic coming in and competing," said Robert Ceisler, executive director of the New York Citizens Utility Board, a nonprofit consumer group. "Everyone's talking about competing, but merging with another Baby Bell is not competition."
Utility deregulation, which is progressing in all three states in the region -- fastest in New York -- is expected to help mainly big business users of electricity in the early years. Utility experts say residents should expect lots of new choices in coming years, as utilities try to repackage and customize their services -- combining, perhaps, telephone, cable television and electric or gas service on a single bill. But they say rates could remain stubbornly high, or even go up.
Competitive markets mean greater business risks, which mean higher capital borrowing costs. Analysts say those costs could postpone or eliminate rate reductions. Residents of the New York region -- especially customers of the Long Island Lighting Company, Con Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities -- already pay some of the highest energy rates in the nation, according to Georgetown Consulting, a Connecticut firm that works with local regulators.
"I think you are going to see the utilities try to get closer to customers and try to provide better service, but it will be the larger customers first," said Michael D. Dirmeier of the Georgetown firm.

The New Dynamic Takes Hold
Still, there are clear indicators that the new dynamic of competition is taking hold, bringing economic growth and improved service.
Total retail sales rose in New York City in 1995, after falling steadily since 1988, according to figures from the Department of City Planning. Retail sales outside the city declined. Both changes were slight, but the implications are profound -- the first time such a pattern has emerged since at least 1982, city officials said. The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is now pushing a revised zoning plan intended to keep that momentum going by encouraging new retail uses in manufacturing zones.
In another sign of change, about 2,000 new jobs are expected from the new generation of huge Pathmark stores. It is the company's first expansion in the city since 1988.
And in Harlem, where Fairway Market opened earlier this year at 133d Street and 12th Avenue, smaller groceries at first howled that the new store would drive them out of business. But in the world after Fairway, local stores are becoming better, cleaner and cheaper to win back shoppers.
"Fairway is showing that there is the capacity in low-income neighborhoods to support good food stores, and that's putting pressure on the stores in the neighborhood to begin to serve the consumer better -- prices have been affected," said Pamela Fairclough, a project manager at the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit group. "I think those operators are kind of realizing that they kind of have to get their acts together."
In Stamford, the 12 employees of Keyspan Energy provide further evidence of competition-fueled growth. The company began advertising for the first time last month on radio and in newspapers, urging customers to rethink their natural gas supplier. Under deregulation, consumers can buy gas from whatever company they want at whatever price they can negotiate without changing the utility that actually delivers the service to their house or business.
Keyspan is also an example of the surprising turns that the competition can take. The company is a subsidiary of Brooklyn Union Gas, but part of its mandate is to woo customers away from its own parent. Brooklyn Union officials say it is an arrangement in which everybody can come out ahead: Keyspan buys the gas more cheaply than Brooklyn Union can because it pays lower Connecticut taxes; the savings is passed on to the customer; Brooklyn Union, which makes its profit on the actual delivery system anyway, and not the gas itself, makes its customers happy.
Orange and Rockland Utilities also plans to offer industrial customers the option, beginning July 1, of buying their electricity from another source. The pilot program will be extended to some residential customers next January.
On a smaller scale, competition has created new jobs at Mr. Jacobs'slittle empire, Jam Paper and Envelope. He hired two employees when he expanded his hours. And then he implemented all the changes inspired on the Avenue of the Americas -- from uniforms to shopping baskets handed out at the front door -- to his two other Manhattan stores. His workforce has expanded by 6, to 26.
And the improvements, he said, build on one another. He encourages his employees to become spies on their lunch hours, scouting out the newest customer-service techniques in the big stores. When an idea is tried out, he said, the employees appreciate getting more attention, and feel they have made a contribution.
"I can't foresee the next thing, because I'm not as smart as the big guys," he said. "But I know it when I see it."

HEADLINE: Two Missions in Africa, but a Common Complaint

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: BANGUI, Central African Republic, May 26

 BODY:
In the space of two months, two foreign military interventions, one American, the other French, have been mounted to extract Westerners from violence that has all but destroyed two African capitals.
In Monrovia, Liberia, United States forces swooped onto the grounds of the seaside American Embassy complex early in April, defending an area extending no further than the mission's high white walls. 
 Occasional blasts from the marines' machine guns were enough to prevent wayward militiamen from seriously threatening the embassy or interfering with an evacuation exercise that quickly flew some 3,000 foreigners to safety abroad.
Here, in the Central African Republic, France mounted the latest of many military interventions in its former African colonial empire, sending in troops after several days of an open revolt by this country's soldiers, the second army mutiny in two months over unpaid salaries.
The French troops, rushed in from bases throughout this region and from France itself, flew over this city, opening fire with deadly effect on mutineers from helicopters and zooming about Bangui in tanks and armored personnel carriers.
In short order, Paris too had pulled off the successful evacuation of about 3,000 French citizens and other foreigners. But the sweeping French action, whose only limiting perimeter was the sluggish Ubangi River that separates this country from neighboring Zaire, came too late to prevent a wave of looting that has left this riverside town, with its sleepy colonial charm, in ruins.
But as different as the recent American and French military operations in the western half of this continent appear to be on the surface, what Africans say unites them is a complete failure of the outside powers to hear out the people affected by the crises about their own wishes and needs.
Liberians, for instance, complain bitterly that Washington's display of power and logistical prowess did little to help a severely distressed people whose close ties to the United States date to the founding of their country by freed American slaves 150 years ago.
"The United States is taken as a serious power all over the world except when it comes to Liberia," said Richard Gbomey, who sought refuge on the crowded and exposed grounds of a United States Embassy annex, where teenagers' daily gunbattles raged just a few yards away last month. "They are not even ashamed about protecting their embassy and watching us through the fence while we get killed by stray bullets."
But the Liberians, however disappointed, still look toward the United States in times of crisis. In contrast, most Central Africans met in two days of walking about this devastated city were anything but thankful for a French intervention that killed a sizable but still undetermined number of people.
As much as the death toll, Central Africans deeply resented what they saw as the latest reminder from an overbearing France of the sharp limits of their sovereignty. Paris may have said it was defending an elected leader against yet another African coup d'etat, but many people here saw things differently.
Yet again, they said over and over in angry streetcorner conversations, France, for reasons of its own, was vetoing the verdict of a people against a Government that in two years in office has earned a reputation as hopelessly ineffective, deeply corrupt and intolerant of dissent.
"The French colonized us, but they have seldom rendered us any service," said Gregory Mamelosson, a 35-year-old tailor who spoke in the shade of a tree near the camp where the leaders of this country's mutiny, who have become popular heroes, remained holed up.
"Under their thumb, this country's economy has not developed, and regimes come and go, but things never change," Mr. Mamelosson said. "Meanwhile, they are exploiting us, stealing our diamonds, manipulating our leaders and giving us nothing to show for it."
Late today, the mutinous soldiers here announced that a tentative settlement had been reached to end the country's nine-day crisis. Shortly afterward, the country's President, Ange-Felix Patasse, speaking on the radio, said that he had agreed to a general amnesty for the soldiers and said he would be forming a government of national unity.
The difference in the American and French interventions lies in part in their recent histories on the continent. For the United States, after the disastrous intervention in Somalia in 1992, the minuscule scope of the Liberian operation seems dictated by an official horror of getting involved in sticky African crises, no matter how tragic they might be.
For France, decades of colonial rule and 36 years of heavy-handed post-colonial domination have bred instincts that Africans say border on contempt for those governed. And bilateral ties between Paris and its African clients, they say, have degenerated into secretive, corrupting compacts with local leaders whose concerns for the common man are at best secondary.
During the length of the latest wave of crisis in Liberia's nearly seven-year civil war, Washington seems to have grappled little with questions of its responsibility, historical or moral, to a small African country that is the closest thing there has ever been to an American colony on this continent and where perhaps 200,000 people have been killed in fighting. The American role in Liberia expanded dramatically in the 1920's, when the Firestone rubber company bought up much of the countryside to create the world's largest rubber plantation.
Just this week, State Department officials issued a ringing condemnation of the behavior of the West African peacekeeping force in Liberia, singling out recent evidence that it had helped organize the smuggling of stolen aid vehicles and other equipment out of the country.
There has never been much official discussion, however, of the more than $500 million in United States aid given to and mostly stolen by the former Liberian dictator, Samuel K. Doe, whose elections in the 1980's were some of the most blatantly rigged in the continent's history.
Speaking off the record, officials looking back on that time now acknowledge that Washington was far more preoccupied with maintaining its presence in a country that served as an important cold war communications base than it was in advancing the cause of democracy or good governance in Africa.
For France, meanwhile, which under the Government of President Jacques Chirac has occasionally expressed reservations about the wisdom of pushing African countries too quickly toward democracy, the Central African crisis has briefly opened a rare discussion of the corruption that dominates the affairs of many of Paris's African clients.
One of many such analyses to appear in Paris this week, this one in the French news agency Agence France-Presse, spoke of an "explosion of official corruption" in Central African Republic and bluntly asked why France, the country's biggest patron, had never bothered to insist on financial accountability from its African clients.
As welcome as this question is for opposition politicians here and in many other countries throughout French-speaking Africa, it does not go nearly far enough. For them, France's entire relationship with Africa is ripe for re-examination.
"France is imposing its solution here in a country where it has always pulled the strings," said the Central African opposition leader Abel Goumba. "But as usual, the Central African people are not being informed of anything.
"Outsiders can impose their solutions with force time and again, but until our countries not only have elected governments, but are governed democratically, these kinds of situations will never end."

HEADLINE: End Near for 179-Mile Bus Trip to High School

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: STUDY BUTTE, Tex.

 BODY:
For years, high school students in southern Brewster County, a vast West Texas outback of desert and mountain along the Mexican border, have laid claim to an odd and generally unwelcome title: commuters on the longest school bus ride in the United States.
But now the students' daily, exhausting ordeal, a 179.6-mile round trip on bus plus as much as 35 miles more by car to get to their homes off dirt roads, seems to be coming to an end. The hamlets of Study Butte (pronounced STOO-dee byoot), Terlingua, Lajitas and Panther Junction are getting their own high school. 
 The planned opening this fall of Big Bend High School arises from a determined -- and continuing -- fund-raising drive that began a year and a half ago. And for parents and many of the students, it is a cause for unmitigated celebration.
"It's exciting," said JoAnn Klingemann, a 16-year-old who just finished her sophomore year. "Just the thought of it -- being able to wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning to go to school, rather than 5 o'clock. A lot of kids can't even imagine it."
The two-hour bus ride from Terlingua to Alpine High School was a chronic source of complaint for just about everybody here and, more seriously, was enough to cause some of the roughly two dozen students who took it each year to drop out.
"I just couldn't deal with the ride anymore," said Charley Barnes, 19, who gave up last year after he finished his junior year. "You ride it once or twice and you think, 'Gee, that's a pretty view.' But it's nothing like having to ride it every day. I started to have back problems. It got to where I was having headaches every day."
But now Charley, who plans to be a "self-employed artist" someday, said he hoped to get his diploma by going to the new high school this fall.
Still, teen-agers being teen-agers, there are at least a handful of students here who have decided they are unhappy that the bus will stop running.
"It's kind of hard to explain," said Justin Wells, a 15-year-old who just finished his first year at Alpine High. "I wasn't crazy about the bus, but I'd still like to go back to Alpine. Now I've got a lot of friends there. And I was thinking of going out for the basketball team and all."
Nobody is yet envisioning traveling sports teams for Big Bend High, or, for that matter, a full-scale library or science lab. But the Terlingua district and the adjacent district covering the Big Bend National Park have managed to raise $148,000 in cash and in-kind services, enough to erect a Spartan, six-room school.
The foundation is being poured in early June, and residents plan to build the school over the summer; if it is not completed, high-school students will begin the year by taking classes in the late afternoon and evening in classrooms at the Terlingua Common School, which covers pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade.
The fund raising started in December 1994, a few weeks after an article in The New York Times described the students' daily journey and some residents' wishes for a local high school. Kathy Killingsworth, the principal of the Terlingua School who is about to become the district's superintendent, said the district received several calls offering help, and residents decided to form the nonprofit Big Bend Educational Corporation.
As other articles appeared, more help came. A man who read about the bus ride in The Dallas Morning News donated 320 acres of land in West Texas, which the corporation sold for $18,000 -- "not exactly Manhattan prices, but it sure helped," said the Rev. Judith Burgess, vicar of the Big Bend Episcopal Mission, who heads the corporation.
The National Enquirer ran a story, and more contributions came in. A company in Ohio called to donate a septic system. A hardware store in Fort Stockton, Tex., donated the fencing. And before long, Big Bend High was ready for construction.
Much work remains to be done. And whether the high school will be able to afford some of the grander plans afoot, like a two-way video link to other schools, remains to be seen.
The district is still extremely poor, though it is growing, which should make a high school an increasingly sustainable proposition. The hamlets of Terlingua, Lajitas and Study Butte had populations of 25, 6 and 120, respectively, in the 1980 census but now the communities have a combined year-round population of about 700, with much of the economy built around hikers, rafters and other tourists.
The Terlingua region has had other claims to fame, some welcome -- it is the site of a popular annual chili cook-off -- and others less so. It was recently in the news as the site of a cabin owned by David Kaczynksi, the brother of the suspect in the Unabomb case, Theodore J. Kaczynski.
Ms. Killingsworth acknowledged that some students were glad not to have to ride the bus but still worried about feeling isolated at Big Bend High. "Alpine is the big city to them," she said.
But now the marathon here is over, and just which students will have the new longest bus ride is a matter of contention: education officials in both Wyoming and New Mexico report school routes that are around 75 miles one way.
"These students did something remarkable, but I'm glad for their sake that they can go to school closer to home," said Judy Probst, a third-grade teacher at the Terlingua school. "I probably would have had an eighth grade education if I lived down here as a kid."

HEADLINE: Updated, Drive to Cut Taxes Regains Currency in G.O.P.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
After years in the political wilderness, while official Washington focused on deficit reduction, Republican proponents of deep tax cuts are once again getting a serious hearing within their party.
They no longer call themselves supply siders, preferring the designation "pro growth," because of the perceived failure of their policies in the Reagan Presidency. And they have updated their 1980's approach for the political realities of the 1990's, seeing their best opportunity since 1980 to make their ideology central to the Republican agenda. They are arguing that both the condition of the economy today and the political fight faced by Senator Bob Dole in his Presidential campaign now make the time right to commit to the sweeping tax cuts they advocate. 
 And Mr. Dole, long one of their strongest foes in the party, is listening this time. He appears to be moving toward a tax cut, perhaps a 15 percent across-the-board reduction in the marginal tax rate, the percentage paid on the on last dollar earned.
Trailing President Clinton in the polls and still trying to define his economic message, Mr. Dole displayed his willingness to refocus his policies when he met last week with Steve Forbes, whose unsuccessful Presidential campaign was built on a flat tax.
Advisers to Mr. Dole say that if he is elected he is expected to embrace a long-term, fundamental overhaul of the tax system to bring rates down. But more immediately he appears to be settling on a tax cut within the existing system as a "down payment" on long-term change, one adviser said.
Some Republicans, feeling they were burned once when supply-side tax cuts contributed to soaring budget deficits, remain wary. And Democrats have promised to attack any large-scale tax-cut proposals by asking which popular programs Republicans would trim to pay for them.
Economists continue to cast doubts on some of the central tenets of the supply siders' philosophy, like the argument that tax cuts will lead to higher savings rates. Wall Street would almost certainly punish any tax-cutting program that threatened to undo the progress made on the deficit by pushing up interest rates.
Still, Mr. Dole is leaning heavily for economic advice on a group of Republican Senators, including Connie Mack of Florida, Robert F. Bennett of Utah and Spencer Abraham of Michigan, who favor a much stronger emphasis on tax cutting.
Strong support for the 15-percent cut has come from Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan and Bush Administration official. Mr. Bartlett's tax-cut strategy could also win the support of some Dole staff members, several of whom are former aides to Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary who is the current Republican standard bearer for the "growth" wing of the party.
To some degree, the supply siders have been chastened by their experience in the Reagan years, when tax cuts and continued increases in spending led to budget deficits that have yet to be controlled.
For the most part, the supply siders have dropped their argument that tax cuts can fully pay for themselves by generating greater economic growth. Most economists believe that that position, labeled "voodoo economics" by George Bush, was ultimately disproved in the 1980's. And few of them still adhere to the hard-line supply-side position that budget deficits do not matter.
But supply siders point to what they consider the success of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey in slashing both spending and taxes as a model for what can be achieved in today's political environment.
"There was a period when Republicans were embarrassed by the deficits, and through a conspiracy of silence allowed the Democrats to blame Reagan," Mr. Bennett said.
"Then the realization that the Clinton tax increases had slowed growth has caused a lot of Republicans to come out and say that maybe on the growth side Reagan had it right, and that we just needed more restraint on the spending side," Mr. Bennett said. "Dole has now figured out that you can have growth and still focus on the deficit."
There is a general consensus among economists that the American economy is currently not capable of growing any faster in the long run than 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year, a rate that is sluggish by historical standards.
The supply-side case is built on the argument that the economy is not growing at its full potential in large part because of a high tax burden.
President Clinton, of course, has a different argument, that the slow but steady growth rates, low inflation and low unemployment rates of the last few years show that the economy is as sound as it has been in decades.
While there is no clear economic consensus about the precise benefits of tax cuts, the supply siders are throwing out an election-year barrage of statistics to make their case. Mr. Bartlett calculated that Federal taxes as a percentage of total economic output last year were just slightly less than the record 20.8 percent they reached before Ronald Reagan won the White House in 1980.
Supply-side adherents say the economy needed the kind of lift a "pro-growth" policy can provide now more than ever before. Unless the economy can sustain higher growth rates, they contend, not only will people have trouble improving their living standards, but longer-range problems like paying the Social Security bill for today's working baby boomers will be close to insoluble.
Moreover, they say, a "pro-growth" strategy makes good political sense by providing a powerful way for Republicans to capitalize on the economic anxiety felt by so many Americans. In particular, a tax reduction proposal would provide the Republicans a way to sharpen their criticism of Mr. Clinton for supporting a tax increase in 1993.
"What we should be saying is that the anxiety is coming about because of the high tax burden on the economy," Senator Mack said. "We are for lower marginal tax rates. Lower marginal tax rates allow the worker to keep more of his paycheck and businesses to keep more of their profits and to put that money back into investment that creates more jobs and opportunity."
None of the Republicans have dared to begin listing where they would look for additional budget cuts to pay for any rate reductions.
Indeed, supply siders acknowledge that they face a big job in convincing doubters that a big tax cut will not lead to rising budget deficits. But with both Democrats and Republicans committed to balancing the budget by 2002 they said they could make a credible case that tax reduction and controlling the deficit could go hand in hand.
"Now, unlike in the 1980's, we have done a reasonable job of beginning to restrain the growth of spending," said Senator Abraham, who advocates the 15-percent across-the-board cut. "A tax cut that's growth oriented and dynamic in impact, against a backdrop of spending restraint, is not going to explode the deficit."

Where Pushkin Still Lives

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Culturally haughty visitors who are sick of their own low standards love to sneer about the declining state of Russian literature -- and literacy. Yes, Sidney Sheldon and Stephen King are far more popular here than Pushkin or Dostoyevsky.
 But books are sold by the wagonload on half this city's streets. They are affordable, plentiful and often very good. They are also sold, with increasing success, in the type of small, personal independent bookstores that in America are going the way of the dime novel. 
 To the extent that one can rely on best-seller lists -- the art of economic surveys is still in its infancy -- self-help books about everything from health to cooking are the top sellers.
 But fiction is the soul of the 19th of October bookstore, whose name reflects the day Russian's greatest literary hero, Pushkin, graduated from school. The store is in one of Moscow's few remaining traditional wooden houses not far from the center of the city.
 "We have about 3,000 steady customers," said Mark I. Friedkin, the store's owner. "It is such a lie that people no longer love good literature here." he added. "They wait in line to get it." At the 19th of October, there is almost always a crowd scanning the titles (Yeats in translation, a new biography of Stendahl and another of Nabokov, poetry from St. Petersburg and a memoir and letters from the labor camps of Siberia). There are dictionaries of prison slang and histories of physics. More than a dozen literary journals are on the shelves; so are Russian emigre newspapers from Paris and New York. Mr. Friedkin display about 400 titles at a time. They change often and most books cost less than $5.
 "I don't know where else to find any of this," said Valentina Yarkolina, a 26-year-old student from Tula, as she scanned the works of 15 poets. "It is wonderful. It is a gift." MICHAEL SPECTER

The Best of Times

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
One more sneer at the 1950's and I'm going to kick the TV set right in the kidneys. The 1950's was no worse than any other 20th-century decade and far better than most, and TV should abandon its smug assumption that because the cars looked silly and hair was worn short it was a contemptible time.
This fiction was unfolded again last week in a PBS show celebrating the incomparable wit, comedy, humor -- whatever you want to call it -- of Mike Nichols and Elaine May. Since they came along in the 1950's the show spent a lot of footage painting the Fifties as a wasteland whose intellectual drabness was relieved only by the appearance of Nichols and May. 
 Television, of all the media, should know better. Sure Nichols and May were terrific, but so were Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner and Howie Morris, and they were terrific for a whole hour that had to be produced live on television every week.
Television also provided the top-drawer comedy of Ernie Kovacs, Jackie Gleason and Jack Benny. It also produced an extraordinary run of original live television dramas. Nothing like them has been done since.
Edward R. Murrow, not yet stifled by CBS's timidity, produced with his "See It Now" series possibly the best news documentaries TV has ever done.
Ancients still remember this era as "the golden age of television." Well, let's not overdo it. It was also an age that begat the sitcom with its ghastly canned laughter, and it apparently left millions of now graying Americans permanently scarred by their failure to live up to standards set by the Cleaver and Ozzie Nelson families. I am glad I am too young to have seen such mind-rotting claptrap.
You can argue the politics of the Fifties either way. The Red hunts probably made many Americans behave more swinishly than they normally would have. Efforts to desegregate the schools produced odious, shameful and disgusting displays of human meanness.
Blacks -- the respectful word was "Negroes" -- were sorely oppressed. So were homosexuals.
On the other hand, when the military establishment proposed using tactical atomic weapons to rescue surrounded French troops at Dienbienphu, President Eisenhower told the Pentagon the country was not going to get bogged down in a war in Vietnam. Many a decade has since passed without providing us with another President nervy enough to say no to the Pentagon.
Economically, it was truly a golden age. With a single wage earner a middle-class family could afford a house, a car, all the latest household appliances, take an annual vacation and have two-and-a-half children. The hospital bill per birth was approximately $300.
Now of course it takes two incomes to match the 1950's standard of living, even if you hold the family down to a single child.
I could go on piling up evidence that the Fifties were about as good as you can hope for from one of our decades, but please don't think it was the best of all possible decades. It wasn't.
The best decade wasn't a decade at all, but the 15 or so years from 1900 to about 1915. There is no name for this delightful time span, probably because Americans lucky enough to have enjoyed it hadn't yet started to measure out their lives in decades. Anyhow, what would you call the first 10 years of a new century? "The single-digits-and-teens decade"?
The Fifties, despite all its wealth and peace and backyard barbecue and pregnancies, was not in a league with the first 15 years of the century. And no other decade comes close. Not the downsizing-and-desperation Nineties in which we now hunker down wondering when the blow will strike.
Not the so-called "Roaring Twenties" with its execrable gin straight from the bathtub. Certainly not the Depression Thirties. Unless you really believe that letting it all hang out is the solution to the problem that flummoxed Plato, you will not wish to linger in the Sixties.
The sour Seventies? Certainly not. Possibly the Eighties. What fun President Reagan was. How exhilarating the rise in the national debt, the rush to bankruptcy. As for the Forties, who would choose to be at grips with both Hitler and Stalin?
But ah, those first years of the century. The music, the sunlit landscape. No war in sight. You could believe in progress, for the last time in 100 years.

HEADLINE: Charles S. Dennison, 78, Adviser To Governments on Many Issues

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Charles Stuart Dennison, an executive who advised governments from Washington to Senegal on economic development, the environment, science and technology and other policy issues, died last Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 78.
A Santa Fe resident for the past eight years, Mr. Dennison formerly lived in Manhattan and Washington.
He suffered a long illness, his family said. 
 Mr. Dennison's business career grew to reflect his interest in international affairs. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations for nearly 30 years and a strong advocate of private investments in Third World countries.
Born on March 21, 1918, in Manhattan, he studied international relations at Columbia and New York Universities, although he never earned a degree. In 1936, he entered an executive training program at the General Motors Corporation. He then became a junior executive at the United States Steel Export Company.
In World War II he served with the "Screaming Eagles" of the Army's 101st Airborne, where he became a captain.
After the war, as an executive with several companies in the United States and abroad, he traveled to London, Australia, Panama, Senegal and other countries. At the request of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, he set up a large privately owned fertilizer plant in India that helped lessen the country's food shortages.
He was a member of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Science Advisory Committee and, as a Presidential adviser on the world's food supply, worked with the United Nations Environment Program. He was also an executive with the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization in Rome, the National Academy of Sciences, the Council of the Americas and the Organization of American States.
He lectured and held seminars at universities and governmental conferences around the world. He was a board member of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and contributed articles to the journals Foreign Affairs, Asia and others.
Mr. Dennison is survived by his wife of 45 years, Carol Krueger Dennison; a daughter, Deborah of Santa Fe and a stepdaughter, Laura Hardie of Brooklyn.

A New Way to Measure an Exhausted Bull

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Is the Q ratio signaling that the end is near for this great bull market?
The what? 
 If you're an economist, you didn't ask the second question. The Q ratio, devised by James Tobin, the Yale economist who won a Nobel prize for his work, is a ratio of the total market value of stocks and bonds compared with what it would cost to replace the assets of America's corporations.
There are good data on this since World War II, when the Federal Reserve began calculating the numbers on an annual basis. On average, stocks and bonds sold for about a 30 percent discount to what it would cost to replace the companies' assets.
But now those financial securities sell for at least 70 percent more than the replacement cost. That level has never been seen before, and to some analysts, it is a warning of excessive overvaluation.
Andrew Smithers, a British economist and proprietor of Smithers & Company, a pension consulting firm, is sounding the loudest alarm. "Professor Tobin received a Nobel prize for his work, and the U.S. stock market may thus be said to be making a bet of approximately $3 trillion that he should return his laurels," Mr. Smithers said in a report to clients. "I expect him to be justified in keeping them."
But Mr. Smithers, in an interview, conceded that there was no way to know just when the bubble might burst. The Q ratio, he said, was a good valuation measure, not a way to time the stock market.
Barton Biggs, the chief strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, agrees. "It is an indication that stocks are very risky, because they are very expensively priced," he said.
Mr. Biggs said he had studied the numbers, and the only thing he could come up with to possibly modify them is that they do not take into account the value of franchises and brand names, which perhaps are worth more now than before. Certainly, one could duplicate every asset of the Coca-Cola Company, from bottling plants to office desks, without creating a company as valuable as Coca-Cola if one did not get the right to use the name as well.
Mr. Tobin's work showed that the profits on invested capital, measured by its current value, should return to normal levels eventually, simply because figures well away from normal will produce an investment boom. Eventually, all that investment will create competition, eroding whatever was producing high rates of return.
And what does Mr. Tobin think about all this? He said that he had not seen Mr. Smithers' work but that the current Q ratio did seem to imply that stock prices are higher than they ought to be.
"Another implication is that it ought to generate an investment boom," he said. "You don't have to sell much of your firm to get the money you need for an investment project."
It is conceivable that the current figures are exaggerated because the replacement costs are underestimated. And it is also true that while a lot of companies are selling stock to the public, as would be expected if prices really are ridiculously high, some are also buying stock back and making acquisitions for cash. Neither would seem reasonable if valuations were that extreme.
The figures for the Q ratio are computed annually by the Federal Reserve, with the 1995 figure due out soon. Morgan Stanley estimates it will be about 1.71, and adds that if a figure were to be computed now, taking into account just how much the stock market has risen, it would be around 1.8. That is, assets now sell on Wall Street for about 80 percent more than it costs to make them.
If one assumes that the stock market will eventually fall back to the norm of about 70 percent of replacement value -- or a ratio of 0.70 -- that implies a stock market drop of about 60 percent. That would leave the Dow Jones industrial average at less than 2,500 points.
Mr. Smithers said he had estimated Q values back to the 1920's and had concluded that the stock market was considerably more overvalued now than it was in 1929.
To Mr. Biggs, the Q ratio is a good reason to cut back on American stocks, and substitute foreign ones. To Mr. Smithers, even foreign stocks may not be immune to the consequences of what he thinks will be a huge crash.
A major reason stocks have gone up, of course, is that American investors have done well in stocks and do not see other investments as offering high returns. Real estate has not boomed recently, and interest rates on bonds and bank deposits are far less than where they have been.
That logic, it turns out, has been compelling even to one who might be expected to be especially impressed by Mr. Tobin's Q ratio. What, Mr. Tobin was asked, had he done with his own money?
"I haven't taken it out of the market, if that's what you're asking," he replied, adding that he thought investor psychology was an important consideration. And anyway, he added, "the alternatives don't look all that attractive."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Fall 9.6% As Foreign Demand Weakens

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Orders for American-built industrial tools fell 9.6 percent in April from the month before as foreign demand dipped, a trade group said today.
Last month's orders were tepid compared with orders in March, and represented the first decline since February. Still, orders were up 18.8 percent from a year ago. 
 Machine tool orders declined to $437.60 million in April after rising 14.6 percent, to $484.30 million, in March, the report by the Association for Manufacturing Technology showed. Demand for the year ended in April was 6 percent ahead of the year that ended in April 1995.
If that trend persists, orders for all of 1996 could climb above 1995's record levels, the association said.
"We're pleased to see machine tool orders continuing to outpace 1995 levels," said Albert W. Moore, president of the trade group.
Economists follow orders and shipments of machine tools -- used to shape and assemble metals in products from diesel engines to dishwashers -- to gauge industrial output, consumer demand and business investment.
April's decline in machine tool orders comes amid conflicting signs for the manufacturing sector.
Orders for big-ticket items fell 1.9 percent in April, the third decline in four months, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Yet the durable goods report also showed pockets of strength. Orders for autos, industrial equipment and primary metals rose in April. Indeed, once transportation equipment was excluded, durable goods orders advanced 1.7 percent last month, the Commerce Department said.
In machine tools, domestic customers reduced their orders by seven-tenths of a percent in April while demand from abroad plunged 47.6 percent, the association said.
The drop in exports did not drag down the overall April figure all that much because exports make up only 15 percent of total orders. Indeed, the yearlong trend paints a different picture, with surging exports and domestic demand moderating in line with subdued economic growth in the United States.
By category, orders for metal-cutting tools, like drills, fell seven-tenths of a percent, to $326.8 million, while orders for metal-forming tools, like stamp press machines, dropped 28.6 percent, to $110.8 million last month.
Machine tool shipments rose 6.3 percent in April, to $480.1 million. The backlog of orders, which tracks pent-up demand for tools, fell 1.9 percent, to $2.149 billion.

For Steel-Wool Maker, Chinese Lessons

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Peter N. Neustadter was drawn to China in the late 1980's, as were so many other American businessmen eager to participate in its booming economy and reap the benefit of cheap Chinese labor. He arranged for a company in the Guangzhou region of China, close to Hong Kong, to manufacture the shards of steel wool that have replaced asbestos fibers in automotive brake pads.
For a while Mr. Neustadter was pleased, and Durawool Inc., his Queens-based company, prospered by selling the Chinese-made material to brake makers in North America and Asia. But now he is embroiled in a legal dispute with a former employee of the Chinese company, who set up a competing business, and Mr. Neustadter faces growing pressure from start-ups there. 
 Earlier this year, a Federal court in Charleston, S.C., issued a preliminary injunction banning the import of the competitive material from China until a trial can be held.
Like the better-known trade battles involving pirated music compact disks and computer software, this case revolves around the vast differences between the United States and China in protecting intellectual property. But it may be even more of a cautionary tale for the typical American business attracted to the siren song of China. And some experts say that such fundamental gaps will produce many more such disputes as the two economies become increasingly reliant on each other.
"There is a cultural difference," said Hans Brechbuhl, managing director of the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan Business School. "Americans are very specific, and the details of a contract are the basis for a relationship. The Chinese are the exact opposite. The overall relationship is most important and if something in that relationship changes, they will blow a contract."
Both sides agree on the basic facts. In 1989 Durawool signed a contract with the China Metallurgical Zuhai Sez United Corporation to produce the chopped steel-wool fibers that Durawool would market outside China. A key figure in the deal was Zhang Ye, an English-speaking engineer at Zuhai. Mr. Zhang was deeply involved in establishing the steel-fiber plant and was trained by the American company to operate it efficiently. At Durawool's request, company executives at Zuhai signed an agreement not to disclose information about the production equipment or process. But Mr. Zhang did not sign the papers.
Mr. Zhang left Zuhai in the early 1990's and helped organize a new company, Sunny Steel Wool Ltd., using the same basic machinery and processes as Zuhai. Mr. Neustadter protested what he called infringement on his proprietary knowledge and technology, but agreed to buy some of the Sunny plant's output to control marketing in the West.
Sunny soon sought Durawool's clients, faxing offers of lower prices to brake manufacturers. At that point, Mr. Neustadter rejected a shipment from the company and the two accused each other of breach of contract. Mr. Neustadter, whose company has production plants in South Carolina, China and Ukraine, said the experience has taught him that "signed contracts in China are meaningless."
Nor, he said, is it possible to protect confidential processes in a country where legal patent and copyright protections are routinely violated. "As soon as you get on an airplane, your product is being copied," he said.
But Mr. Zhang, through his American lawyer, insists that he has done nothing wrong.
Some experts contend that Mr. Neustadter was naive in thinking that a confidentiality agreement alone would protect his technology. He did not pay sufficient attention, they say, to keeping talented employees like Mr. Zhang satisfied.
"Many companies are reluctant to educate Chinese employees in the United States for fear they will get a better offer," said Mr. Brechbuhl, whose institute studies nations that are moving from a planned to a market economy. "They need to talk to these individuals and ask them what it takes to make them happy."
Mr. Zhang made little effort to hide what he was doing. After establishing Sunny, he asked Mr. Neustadter to visit his plant and proposed selling chopped fibers to Durawool. "He had duplicated my process and was even using the Durawool name," Mr. Neustadter said.
As a "damage-control" measure, Mr. Neustadter said, he agreed to buy five million pounds from Sunny's factory over several years. "The idea, he said, "was that this fellow would not do any more steel-wool machines and go into another business."
But, Mr. Neustadter said, "nothing went right with the agreement," and Durawool ruptured the relationship for good in 1994 when it refused to accept four shipping containers of Sunny's steel wool.
Mr. Neustadter said his only hope rests with the American legal system, which would at least block Sunny from shipping its product to the United States. "The term Chinese law is an oxymoron," he said. "There is no legal system in China, as we know it. As least courts here can control American ports."
But Fleet Freeman, the American lawyer for Mr. Zhang and Sunny, said Mr. Neustadter had only himself to blame and that Mr. Zhang had not violated any Chinese law.
"Yes, Zuhai signed a confidentiality agreement," Mr. Freeman said. "But does it bind Zhang Ye? According to our consultant, probably not." He said that Chinese law does not allow for blanket protection of processes; each drawing or engineering specification to be protected must be individually marked, which was not done in this case.
Mr. Freeman said Durawool sold at least six more steel-wool machines in China to other companies, and it was the subsequent oversupply of material that drove the price down and hurt Durawool's business, not simply Mr. Zhang's competition.
By inviting Mr. Neustadter to his plant, Mr. Freeman said, Mr. Zhang demonstrated that he thought his operation was legitimate. "The invitation shows that Zhang Ye felt in his own mind he had done nothing wrong," Mr. Freeman said. "Otherwise he would not have extended the invitation." And Durawool's technology, he said, is based on patented German machines, leaving it little meaningful technology to protect.
The ultimate outcome of the dispute is still up in the air. The judge in South Carolina, David C. Norton, issued the preliminary injunction after finding that "there is a strong likelihood" Durawool will prove that it had trade secrets and that Sunny had used those secrets against it. But he also decided that 11 of the 17 charges in Durawool's complaint should be sent back to China for arbitration.
While labor is far cheaper in China -- a well-paid factory worker in the booming economic development zones might make $75 to $90 a month -- Mr. Neustadter said that the main reason to locate there was to draw on local expertise and buy supplies at an attractive price.
"The steel-wool process is pretty automated, so there is not a lot of labor involved," he said. "The Chinese are pretty good at working with iron and steel."
For all his disenchantment with Mr. Zhang, Mr. Neustadter said, the experience has not entirely soured him on doing business in China. The key, he added, is to develop a lasting relationship with a local partner, not simply a contractual deal. "We have a very successful joint venture near Shanghai," he said.

HEADLINE: Making It in New York City

 BODY:
Few postwar trends have devastated New York City more than the collapse of manufacturing, which has hollowed out neighborhoods and eliminated at least 700,000 jobs. In recent years, however, a contrary trend has occurred. Smaller manufacturers, often operated by immigrants, are sprouting everywhere. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is right to try to encourage the trend by promising to cut costs for these new businesses. At the same time, his administration calls for giving big "super stores" access to some areas now set aside exclusively for manufacturing. That approach could also stimulate the economy and widen the choices for consumers.
In the early 1970's, the city tried to keep its manufacturers by barring housing and commercial enterprises from its manufacturing districts. The theory was that competing development in these areas would drive up property values and rents, forcing the manufacturers to shut down or flee. 
 A generation later, it is clear that the city's strategy has failed. It now makes sense to let big stores -- including hardware, housewares, supermarkets and general stores like Kmart -- into the city. Lobbyists for small businesses are opposed, but consumers will welcome the chance to shop in places already popular in the suburbs.
Under the Mayor's plan, stores as large as 200,000 square feet could open in areas now zoned for manufacturing without going through cumbersome approval processes, as long as they are built in areas with adequate transportation. The City Planning Commission argues that more than $3 billion in retail sales are lost because New Yorkers now go to the suburbs to find similar stores. Smaller stores may find the competition difficult, but the record in other communities is that smaller operations can survive if they offer distinctive goods or better service.
Meanwhile, even as the city looks to new uses for manufacturing districts, it is also finding that some of the smaller manufacturers can operate safely in areas now zoned for commercial, retail and residential development. Large garment manufacturers may have fled, but small specialty shops that make purses, ties or other high-quality goods have sprouted to take their place. The city's big bakeries have mostly shut down, but lots of little bakeries have opened. Small operations in the telecommunications, software and computer field have already transformed Manhattan into what some call "silicon alley." Many steps can be taken to encourage even more growth in these areas, such as lifting costly and cumbersome government regulations .
Tax relief might also help these industries, and to that end Mr. Giuliani is offering business and selective sales tax cuts. But can a city already strapped for cash afford these cuts? Some of Mr. Giuliani's other proposals may be more realistic -- improving freight access to Kennedy International Airport, ending the erratic enforcement of traffic and parking restrictions, streamlining the permit process and targeting job-training funds to business sectors that promise growth. As a report by the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University points out, the city must also insure that its schools turn out a skilled work force, that its transportation links are maintained and that it continues to be a magnet for immigrants with an entrepreneurial spirit.
No one knows the long-term trend for the city's economic base, but one of New York's great assets -- its reputation as a place where industrious and creative people want to live and work in close proximity with each other -- will survive only if the city does not take it for granted. With these new initiatives, the city sends a signal that it will fight for its future.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Web Magazine at a Halt And Seeking Readers' Aid

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
The Web Review, one of the best- known of the magazines found only on the Internet, has stopped publishing and has issued an unusual appeal for financing that draws on two models of voluntary contributions.
Bowing to users' hostility to subscription fees on the World Wide Web, the review said that it would consider an alternative system like that of public radio, where some supporters pay and the product is free to all, or like shareware, where users who benefit from a computer program are expected to send payments voluntarily. 
 Pioneers in publishing on the Web are in an economic quandary that is expected to kill many more sites before the computer network becomes a truly mass medium. So many sites are free that only a few with special niches have been able to charge users a fee.
Web Review began last July and was published weekly with a daily update. Known as a Webzine, because it had no paper counterpart, it was one of the major forums on the Web. An issue might contain a lament about the dearth of poetry on the Web, or a rant about the spate of news coverage of pornographic or bomb-building sites.
The magazine said its main audience was Web professionals -- site builders, administrators and programmers who could check for the latest on esoteric topics like virtual reality modeling language or vector-based animation technology.
On May 17, visitors who tapped into the Review's site found a "Dear Reader" letter from the publisher, Dale P. Dougherty, announcing the Webzine's final issue, because advertisers were not covering publishing costs.
The letter said that Web Review would return in June if 5,000 readers would pay $19.95 for a six-month subscription. "How will we know if we don't ask?" the letter said.
"You are voting on the future of the Web and what you will find there," it added. "Web Review is not alone in having these problems."
In an interview from the Review's office in Sebastopol, Calif., Mr. Dougherty said there was only a 40 percent chance that readers would provide enough support for the publication to continue, but he said he remained hopeful.
"Restricted access is an annoyance, if nothing else," he said. "The public radio or shareware model would be a nice way around that. You want the casual users to pick you up, but you have to convert some of them to paying customers."
In a note posted at the Web Review site on Friday, the magazine said it had received 1,000 responses in a week, 700 from readers who said they would pay. The note said some complained the price was too high, and some asserted "they would never pay for information on the Web."
Betty J. Lyter, a senior research analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said a site like Web Review was unlikely to find a paying audience. "People are still site-hopping," she said. "They don't want to tie themselves to one by paying."
Ms. Lyter said Web Review's fate demonstrated the peculiar economics of Internet publishing. "The barriers to entry are relatively few, but the barriers to success are enormous," she said. "A few companies are building brand identities that will be very difficult for other companies to penetrate."
This summer, The Wall Street Journal will begin charging for access to its Web site, and the Microsoft Corporation plans to start Slate, an on-line magazine of politics and culture that will charge a subscription fee.
A satiric article in the April issue of Wired magazine called "The Great Web Wipeout," speculated that such content-rich sites might not prove economically feasible and that the Web would revert to its roots as a global jam session of chat rooms and personal home pages.
The Web Review's parent company, Songline Studios, produces Ferndale, an interactive soap opera. America Online Inc. holds a minority stake in Songline.
Mr. Dougherty said 12 people had worked full time on Web Review. He said the company laid off about 10 of its 25 employees; the rest will work on other electronic publishing projects. The magazine said its archives would remain open at:

HEADLINE: Health Costs Are Growing More Slowly, Report Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Health care spending grew more slowly in 1994 than in any year since 1960, the Government reported today.
National health care spending totaled $949.4 billion, or 13.7 percent of total economic output -- the gross domestic product -- in 1994, the Department of Health and Human Services said. The growth in health spending in 1994, 6.4 percent, was "the slowest recorded in more than three decades," it said. 
 Just three years ago, the Congressional Budget Office was estimating that health spending would account for 15 percent of the gross domestic product in 1994.
"It is still too early to state categorically that the long-term surge in health care costs is over," said Katharine R. Levit, an author of the report on health spending. But "indicators for 1995 show little change from the 1993-94 trend."
In an interview, Ms. Levit, an economist at the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, said the trend appeared to be "fairly steady" this year. "We don't expect large changes in the 1995 data," she said.
The department attributed the deceleration of health spending in 1994 to the greater use of managed care and the expectation of Federal action to control health costs. In fact, Congress rejected President Clinton's ambitious health plan and did not pass an alternative.
The new Government data were published today in Health Affairs, a health policy journal sponsored by Project Hope, an international health education organization.
National health spending rose 6.4 percent in 1994 and 7 percent in 1993, compared with 12.9 percent in 1980 and, on average, 11.3 percent a year from 1970 to 1994. Health spending continues to grow faster than the economy as a whole, as measured by gross domestic product, which rose 5.8 percent in 1994, the study said.
The new data are consistent with surveys showing that the cost of employee health benefits in private industry has leveled off. But spending continues to rise at robust rates for Medicare, which provides health care for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid, for low-income families.
Government programs accounted for 44.3 percent of all health spending in 1994, "the highest level ever recorded," the study said. The figure for 1989 was 40.5 percent.
"This shift occurred because Medicare and Federal Medicaid spending increased more rapidly than private spending did," the study said. The Government's contribution would have appeared even larger if the study had taken account of indirect subsidies like tax breaks for health insurance and for employee health benefits, Ms. Levit and other economists said.
Spending for Medicare benefits increased 11.8 percent in 1994, whereas spending under private health insurance plans rose only 4 percent, the Government said. Republicans have asserted that Medicare ought to follow the example of private employers and make greater use of managed care.
But the authors said the disparity between Medicare and private insurance did not prove that Medicare was less able to control costs. For one thing, they said, the number of Medicare beneficiaries increased 1.8 percent in 1994, to 36.9 million, while the number of people with private health insurance declined by 0.1 percent, to 184 million. "Thus, one would expect Medicare benefits in aggregate to grow more rapidly than private insurance benefits," the article said.
In addition, the article said, Medicare is more likely than private health insurance to cover items like home health care and skilled care in nursing homes, for which outlays have grown rapidly.
After adjusting the numbers to permit meaningful comparisons, the authors found a smaller but still significant difference in the growth of spending for health care financed by Medicare, compared with spending growth for private insurance. Medicare spending rose an average of 5.6 percent for each beneficiary in 1994, while spending increased, on average, by just 3.6 percent for each person covered by private health insurance, the study said.
The authors of the study, Ms. Levit, Helen C. Lazenby and Lekha Sivarajan, work in the office of the actuary at the Federal Health Care Financing Administration.
The article also makes these points:
*Health care spending in 1994 averaged $3,510 a person, up 5.4 percent from $3,331 in 1993. Spending has increased 30.6 percent since 1990.
*Spending for hospital care rose only 4.4 percent in 1994, the third consecutive year in which the increase has slowed. Hospital prices continued to rise, but the use of hospital services for each patient, on average, declined for the first time in more than a decade.
*"Prescription drug price increases measured by the Consumer Price Index tumbled from 10 percent in 1990 to 3.4 percent in 1994," in part because of greater use of generic drugs, mail-order pharmacies and programs to manage the cost of prescription drug benefits.
Spending for home health care rose 13.8 percent in 1994, about three times as fast as spending increases for hospital care and doctors' services, the article said. Medicare and Medicaid financed more than half of all home health care. But the total spending for home care, $26.2 billion, was much less than the amounts spent on hospitals ($338.5 billion) and doctors ($189.4 billion).

HEADLINE: Pro-Western Albanian Chief Claims Victory in Chaotic Election

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, May 27

 BODY:
In the most chaotic election in Eastern Europe since the fall of Communism, the Western-backed Albanian leader, Dr. Sali Berisha, claimed victory for his party of former Communists today despite concerns by international monitors about fraud and intimidation at the polls.
President Berisha, who had been rewarded by Washington with military and economic aid for his coolheadedness toward the explosive issue of the Albanian population in the Balkans, waged a strongman campaign. 
 He passed a law late last year that barred some prominent opponents from running because of their Communist past even though he was a senior Communist Party official himself. He criticized the opposition party as a "red front," and banned its final campaign rally here.
Toward the end of voting on Sunday, the main opposition party said it was withdrawing from the election before the counting started.
In pulling out of the election, the Socialist Party and its opposition allies said they would not recognize the new Parliament. The move appeared to leave Albania with a likelihood of one-party rule.
Election monitors from the European Union and the United States said they witnessed instances of police intimidation, open ballot boxes and voters' casting more than one ballot. In a district in the capital, the voting was held in the living room of the local leader of Dr. Berisha's Democratic Party.
One election monitor, Fabrizio Migliaccio of Italy, said he was stunned that in seven districts he visited in the seaside town of Durres, "basic violations" of the electoral process were made in front of him. They included more than one person being in the voting booth, unsecured ballot boxes and the stuffing of the boxes with ballots.
But Western officials, dependent in the last four years on Dr. Berisha to preach calm among the Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population of the Serbian province of Kosovo, appeared eager today to give the President the benefit of the doubt.
At a news conference today, Dr. Berisha thanked the West. "We won because we enjoyed the powerful support of our great friends in Europe and the United States," he said.
Western officials said it appeared from independent counting that Dr. Berisha's Democratic Party was a winner of the election anyway. It seemed, they said, that the Democratic Party polled more than 50 percent and the Socialist Party under 25 percent, with smaller parties failing to gain enough for the Socialists to form a coalition.
There was more support for the Democratic Party than expected and less for the Socialists than expected, Western officials said, but they said the voter fraud was not enough to have tipped the scales decisively.

HEADLINE: Japanese Look at the Possibility of a Military Role in Asia

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 27

 BODY:
For half a century, one of the great taboos of public life here has been any discussion of a Japanese military role beyond Japan's shores.
Now the taboo has given way to an open debate, even prompting some calls for a revision of the "peace Constitution" that the United States imposed after World War II. Just as important, for the first time the Government is examining what it would be willing to do if a war broke out elsewhere in Asia, particularly in Korea. 
 Some scholars and diplomats say it is now an open question whether Japan will gradually move toward a more muscular foreign policy, backed by increasingly powerful armed forces. This might take decades, they say, but would eventually transform East Asia by shaping Japan into a military superpower as well as an economic one.
The taboo on security issues has eroded steadily in the last few years, but the crucial breakthrough came with the meeting last month in Tokyo between President Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Mr. Hashimoto pledged that Japan would review the 18-year-old guidelines limiting cooperation with the United States military in a war.
"There is less taboo in Japan in discussing security questions, and that's a good thing," said Sadayuki Hayashi, the Vice Foreign Minister.
The benefits of a review were evident when Mr. Hayashi was asked whether Japanese hospitals would be allowed to treat American soldiers if they were wounded in a nearby war. Mr. Hayashi paused and shrugged.
"I don't know the answer to that," he said. "And there are hundreds of questions like that."
Among the concrete issues that Japan is preparing to resolve with the United States are these: In another Korean war, would American military planes be able to use Japanese civilian airports? Would Japanese military planes or warships be able to pick up refugees in Korea? If Japanese ships or planes were about to be fired on in international waters, would they be allowed to fire back? If an American warship were attacked, would Japan be able to come to its assistance?
One of the obstacles to a larger security role is the sensitivity of Japan's neighbors, particularly China and North and South Korea, all of which have horrific memories of Japanese wartime atrocities.
Even the tiny steps that Japan has taken in the last few years -- such as sending peacekeepers to Cambodia and military relief specialists to Zaire -- have provoked a bit of nervousness in Asia.
Still, ever since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 made clear that international respect comes from joining in security operations and not just paying for them, Japan has become increasingly willing to send troops abroad as part of relief or peacekeeping operations.
Another barrier to a more activist policy is Japan's Constitution, which renounces war "and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes." The United States drafted that language after World War II.
But these days it is Japan that is clinging to its peace Constitution, while the United States is encouraging Japan to play a role in international security. Two years ago, with fears of a war between the West and North Korea growing, the United States informally asked Japan to provide minesweepers in case of a war. Japan responded that it could not, because of the American-drafted Constitution.
Japan's formal position is that the Constitution bars it from exercising the right of "collective self-defense." In other words, it could defend itself if invaded, but could not contribute to an international blockade of North Korea or even intervene to help an American ship under attack in international waters.
Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former Prime Minister who advises Prime Minister Hashimoto on security matters, said he was urging a revision of this interpretation.
"For the time being, I believe we should proceed with changing the interpretation of the Constitution," Mr. Nakasone said. "But in the medium to long term, we should think of revising the Constitution."
For now, Mr. Hashimoto has made clear that he has no plans to move toward collective self-defense, and the United States insists that it is not trying to push Japan in that direction.
"We stay out of that," said Ambassador Walter F. Mondale. "We think that those kinds of debates can be helpful for Japan. But we're proceeding on the basis that the current Constitution and policies will apply."
Still, the idea of scrapping the Constitution may be gaining ground. The largest-circulation newspaper in Japan, Yomiuri Shimbun, a respected mainstream daily, last year published a draft of its proposed new constitution for Japan, and the opposition leader in Parliament, Ichiro Ozawa, has endorsed the idea of constitutional reinterpretation to allow collective self-defense.
The bulwark of opposition to any military role for Japan has been Asahi Shimbun, the second-largest newspaper in Japan and one that caters in particular to liberals and intellectuals. But while the editorial pages still condemn the idea of a broader security role, the news pages, particularly articles written by the newspaper's Washington bureau chief, have embraced the idea.
Likewise, it is no longer so shocking to mention the possibility that Japan might one day arm itself with nuclear weapons. Kiichi Miyazawa, another former Prime Minister, said in an interview that the newly fortified security partnership with America would "forestall the argument inside Japan that we should go nuclear, should be a big military power."
To be sure, the debates for now in Japan are likely to focus not on issues of developing nuclear weapons or even on collective self-defense. Rather, they will concern more mundane matters, like legislation under consideration that would allow Japan to use troop ships to evacuate refugees abroad in a crisis, like a war on the Korean Peninsula.
That proposal is controversial because the ships would be armed. Sending unarmed ships into a war zone might seem foolish, but World War II traumas linger in Japan in the form of a deep anxiety about exerting military force abroad, so many people would rather seem foolish than threatening.

HEADLINE: Nintendo Capitalism: Zapping The Markets;
Fast Electronic Trading Brings Increased Volatility

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
It's 7:29 A.M. high above South LaSalle Street and Patrick Beimford, the chief bond strategist of Zurich Kemper Investments, is poised like an orchestra conductor in front of three electronic screens. He and more than a dozen highly paid young traders and portfolio managers scan intently.
Then, exactly at 7:30, multicolored electronics flash the Government's eagerly awaited tally of consumer prices and retail sales for April -- favorable figures, as it happens, for the bond market that prompt an almost instant flurry of staccato barks and orders. 
 In a twinkling on this Tuesday morning, Mr. Beimford directs the purchase of 3,000 June futures contracts on the 30-year Treasury bond, a transaction involving control of securities worth $300 million and one that is intended to protect the firm against interest rate moves. "We're going from short to neutral," he explained.
Mr. Beimford and his crew are part of a computer-linked, worldwide network of traders and investors whose split-second reactions magnify every smidgen of economic news, from a trade association traffic survey and counts of people newly applying for unemployment benefits to the growth of payrolls and changes in interest-rate policy announced by the Federal Reserve.
This Nintendo capitalism, as the marriage of microchips and mathematics has been dubbed, has led to increasingly volatile markets in recent years, especially for fixed-income securities. And now the longstanding concern about wide swings in the market has broadened into a debate over whether such volatility actually harms or benefits the real economy in which houses are built, wages are paid and college tuitions are financed.
Day after day, the chief raw material for trading-room hyperkinetics is the mundane, detailed reports from the Government intended to facilitate public appraisal of economic performance. But that lofty goal seems overtaken by the split-second decisions of traders caught up in a process of mass psychology.
"You have to try to understand things relative to what people are expecting -- and trade off that, not try to find out the ultimate truth," said John E. Silvia, Zurich Kemper's chief economist. At critical moments he is usually within shouting range of Mr. Beimford and other traders. "This gives an almost existential quality to the market, with perception being reality."
With this mindset, it's probably unavoidable that bond traders act as a herd, often overreacting and discovering in hindsight that they have driven rates too low or too high -- extremes that may have an almost immediate practical effect in an economic world of point-of-sale information systems and just-in-time inventories.
Today's high-tech super-efficient financial markets have "the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pace throughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago," Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told an audience in Frankfurt earlier this month. He specifically cited the way the currency market punished Mexico for policy errors by battering the peso in late 1994 and early 1995, but his comments seemed to reflect a growing sense among policy makers that they are captives of the market rather than its masters, leaving the Government mostly to provide a final backstop against catastrophe.
"You could say it's really the bond markets that run the country, not the President and not Alan Greenspan," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Chase Regional Bank.
But trading at cyberspeed may hold some advantages. Indeed, many experts argue that it makes possible a greater liquidity of capital worldwide, with long-term benefits outweighing the risks of short-term error. And it serves as an instant referendum on the actions of Government policy makers, forcing them to face up to potentially costly mistakes much faster than before.
"It makes people nervous and it costs some people money," said James E. Annable Jr., chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "But you get efficiency from deep, liquid markets."
Mr. Beimford and his Zurich Kemper colleagues, though presiding over $45 billion of mutual fund assets, actually are among the less frantic players in this intense everyday drama, a process largely removed from outside scrutiny.
The main work of Zurich Kemper's classic "buy side" operation -- as opposed to more feverish "sell side" banks and trading houses -- is to pick bonds and stocks for semi-permanent inclusion in their numerous portfolios, shunning big speculative exposure of their own. In buying the 3,000 Treasury contracts on May 14 after the 30-year bond had spurted nearly three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000, Mr. Beimford unwound half of the firm's hedge against holdings of portfolio tax-exempts.
But even in this comparative island of calm, watching Mr. Beimford and other Zurich Kemper strategists anticipate and respond to the daily parade of Government and other numbers over parts of a recent three-day period point up the ever-tighter relationship between the gauges of economic performance and the market verdicts on them that feed back to the economy.
At a 7:15 A.M. meeting of his fixed-income strategists on the day before the consumer price and retail sales data were released, Mr. Beimford expressed a basically negative long-term view of the bond market, even though he mused that prices might work a bit higher -- and interest rates a bit lower -- in the short term.
He had become progressively less optimistic as prospects vanished over the winter for a balanced-budget agreement and as a report of a ballooning of payroll jobs in February indicated that the economy had skirted recession and thereby dimmed chances for further easing of monetary policy. Finally came the May 2 report that the economy expanded at a unexpectedly robust rate of 2.8 percent during the first quarter.
"That number put a big kink in our entire economic outlook," Mr. Beimford said, prompting a decision to shorten by about half a year the duration -- a refined gauge of average maturity -- of his $34 billion fixed-income portfolio.
And despite the relatively soft Consumer Price Index and retail figures for April, at a 2:30 meeting the Zurich Kemper interest-rate committee raised its target range for the Treasury's 10-year and 30-year bonds by one-quarter of a percentage point.
With its earlier action, Zurich Kemper had contributed a bit to the upward lurch in long-term interest rates that blunted the usual springtime pickup in the real estate market and brought mortgage refinancing to a near halt, an unusually clear example of the market's sway over the economy.
At the same time, the lift that the consumer price and retail sales reports gave the bond market was quickly reflected in a higher stock market, developments greeted by Steven H. Reynolds, Zurich Kemper's chief stock strategist, as a chance to get a better price for the cyclical paper, chemical and steel stocks he has been disposing of recently. "We'll wait a day or two and sell a little stock into that strength," Mr. Reynolds said.
His view is that just as the markets became overly pessimistic about the economy early in the year, they now seem to reflect unwarranted optimism about 1996 growth.
This suggests to Mr. Reynolds and his portfolio managers that stocks are headed moderately higher, buoyed by a drifting down of interest rates, which places them somewhat at odds with the view of Mr. Beimford, the bond chief.
"Portfolio managers have a lot of latitude," observed Mr. Silvia, though he said differences were typically more a matter of timing or emphasis than outright disagreement.
Thus, Gary A. Langbaum, who manages $3.6 billion of stocks and bonds for Zurich Kemper, raised his holdings of shares in banks and other financial services companies, which may be able to fatten their spreads if market rates drift down. He bought $5 million to $8 million worth of each of four issues, saying that if the inflation report had been high he would have bought them later in the week at lower prices.
Similarly, Tracy McCormick Chester, another portfolio manager, confirmed her belief that interest rates have peaked and decided to fill a gap by buying shares of a money-center bank. She's been cashing in profits racked up lately in retail stocks, a strategy seemingly borne out by the report that sales eased three-tenths of 1 percent in April, the first decline this year.
But while stock market gyrations do affect the economy -- though even the October 1987 collapse did not bring on recession -- what really counts is the action taken by bond market people like Mr. Beimford and others who make their living trying to stay one step ahead of what often seems like irrational competition.
"Sometimes I just throw up my hands" because of exaggerated responses to trivial or inconsistent data, said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist in New York for Nationsbank, a primary dealer in Treasury securities and an active "sell side" operation with many clients like Zurich Kemper.
But whatever the excessive gyrations in the short run -- and Mr. Levy is dismayed at the recent proliferation of regional statistics and surveys that he says adds to such volatility -- most specialists seem to agree that the high-tech trading serves an important purpose.
Even when traders overshoot, their mistakes can be corrected, so long as the financial system is open enough that homeowners, for example, can jump in as they did when rates tumbled in 1993 and take the occasion to refinance.
Such cases, in fact, suggest that market volatility tends to limit, rather than exaggerate, swings in the economy by shortening the process by which economic actors respond to market signals. That is the way David W. Mullins Jr., a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve who is now an investment manager in Greenwich, Conn., sees it."Feedback mechanisms," he said, "tend to be inherently stabilizing."

HEADLINE: Survey Points To Growth In Job Market

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The job market is expected to improve this summer, led by a pickup in construction industry employment and continued strength in the Midwest, according to a new survey.
The study by Manpower Inc., the nation's leading temporary employment company, found that 27 percent of the businesses surveyed expected to increase employment in the third quarter, up from 26 percent in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 1995, 28 percent intended to expand their work forces. 
 "There is a very early indication in our new figures that an improvement in job formation may be under way," Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower's chief executive, said yesterday in a statement.
"While the projected growth is still relatively cautious, we see a quarter-to-quarter increase in activity that was not present a year ago," he said. "It is too early to tell if the growth in the job market can be sustained."
Among the companies surveyed, 7 percent expected staff reductions in the third quarter and 63 percent intended to leave employment at present levels; 3 percent of the companies were undecided.
Nationwide, 40 percent of construction companies planned to increase employment, leading all industries. Next were wholesalers and retailers -- 32 percent plan additions -- followed by producers of durable goods, at 29 percent.
Companies in the Midwest reported the biggest increase in hiring plans. Thirty percent intend to increase employment in the third quarter.
The West is second, with 28 percent, followed by the South with 26 percent and the Northeast at 25 percent.
Manpower based the survey results on telephone interviews conducted with managers at about 16,000 businesses in 484 United States cities.

HEADLINE: Most U.S. and Foreign Markets Take a Holiday

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Asian stock markets were little changed yesterday as holidays in the United States and most of Europe greatly thinned trading.
Japanese stocks fell on light volume as doubts over the immediate outlook for the economy clouded the market. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 98.67 points, or nearly five-tenths of 1 percent, at 21,699.76. 
 But today, Tokyo stocks were revived, with the Nikkei up 244.77 points, or 1.13 percent, to close at 21,944.53. Still, some analysts seemed to be betting that an overall sluggishness would dominate trading.
"A weaker tone will remain in the market for a while, with no active buyers appearing," said Kiyoshi Kimura, general manager of the research department at Societe Generale Securities in Tokyo.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index of 33 leading stocks gained 62.53 points, to 11,081.69, but turnover fell to a low for the year. This morning, the index declined very slightly, easing 4.32 points -- less than one-twentieth of 1 percent -- to stand at 11,077.37.
"Everybody's just waiting for the U.S. to reopen," said Alan Au of PW Asia Brokerage in Hong Kong.
All financial markets in the United States were closed in observance of Memorial Day. In Europe, most markets were also closed for national holidays. Exchanges in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland were among the relatively few open.
Trading was slow in Canadian and Mexican stocks, both closing slightly higher. The Toronto Stock Exchange index of 300 stocks edged up 5.65 points, or one-tenth of 1 percent, to 5,235.50. The main Mexico City index rose 14.05 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 3,327.24.
The exchange rate of the dollar slipped in Tokyo and in limited European trading, then rebounded early today. This morning in Asian trading, the dollar sold for 108.125 Japanese yen, up from 107.75 yen in Milan late yesterday and from 107.80 yen on Friday in New York. The dollar traded at 1.5440 German marks, up from 1.5420 marks both yesterday in Europe and late Friday in New York.

HEADLINE: STRANGER ON THE BLOCK -- A special report.;
At Center of 'Megan's Law' Case, a Man No One Could Reach

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

DATELINE: HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J.

 BODY:
Her name was Megan. Most people do not know his name.
He confessed to strangling and raping her in 1994, the police say. She had just finished first grade. He lived across the street. His is the story of what the country fears. 
 He had pleaded guilty twice before to sexually assaulting small children. In 1981, a judge had labeled him a "compulsive, repetitive sexual offender." Then, after he had served more than seven years for his two crimes, he and two other convicted child molesters quietly moved here, into a neighborhood of split-level homes where people tend their gardens and their children well. Not long afterward, Megan Kanka was killed.
Megan's death has become part of the national psyche. A dozen states have passed laws named for her requiring that communities be notified when sex offenders move in. President Clinton signed a national "Megan's Law" on May 17.
The courts and the public have begun a long debate about whether such laws will work and are constitutional. This spring, the Random House Webster's College Dictionary added "Megan's Law" as a new term in the language.
His name is Jesse K. Timmendequas. He turned 35 last month. He is a slight man with the same dirty blond hair and the same nervous preoccupation with himself that people who knew him as a teen-ager in Piscataway remember.
Mr. Timmendequas (pronounced tim-MEN-duh-qwas) is in jail in Mercer County, N.J., awaiting trial for the killing. Prosecutors will seek the death penalty. He pleaded not guilty. He did not respond to a request for an interview, and his lawyer declined to answer questions for this article.
But public records across New Jersey and interviews with people who knew him and with psychologists, detectives, lawyers, a judge and other professionals who dealt with him fill out a picture as never before. It is a picture of the type of sex offender who defies efforts at rehabilitation, one who, because of Megan's death, has become a catalyst for a national change in the laws.
At a restaurant off the Garden State Parkway one recent afternoon, one of his victims described the bitter memories he left behind. She is a bubbly 22-year-old college student. It has been 15 years since Mr. Timmendequas attacked her.
She described the turmoil she felt when she heard who was accused of killing Megan Kanka.
"I wanted to kill him myself," said the young woman, who spoke on the condition that her name not be used. "They didn't stop him the first time."
She was attacked in 1981 after Mr. Timmendequas lured her into the woods with the promise of firecrackers. Yellowed police records include Mr. Timmendequas's admission that he ran away afterward, thinking he had choked her to death. "After she turned blue, I became scared," he said, according to a police transcript. "I dropped her and I thought she was dead."
The young woman was attacked when she was 7, the same age as Megan Kanka when she was strangled with a leather belt 13 years later. Both girls bit down on their tongues as they struggled for breath.
The stranger in the neighborhood had appeared pleasant, if ineffectual, over the years to people who did not know about his secret thoughts. He helped an elderly man next door move furniture. "He was one of those quiet kids," remembered Mark Ciardi, a classmate in the Piscataway High School class of 1979.
Cases against him stemming from assaults in 1979 and 1981 were routine in the legal system. He benefited from plea bargains in both cases. Because children often make poor witnesses, prosecutors can be reluctant to take molestation cases to trial.
There is no evidence that he benefited from treatment offered him through the years. At one point, he failed to go to counseling even though a judge had ordered him into therapy as the only way to avoid jail. Some who knew what little he would reveal about his thoughts believed there was a danger he would attack children again.
"I didn't think he would kill someone," said Rashmi Skadegaard, who was director of psychology at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Avenel, N.J., where Mr. Timmendequas served six years. "But I certainly thought somebody was going to be his victim."
State law-enforcement officials have repeatedly said that, without a notification rule, the state has no role after any sex offender like Mr. Timmendequas completes a sentence.

The First Attack
 
Two Little Girls, And a Stranger
If anyone had been watching at about 4:30 on a fall afternoon in Piscataway in 1979, nothing would have seemed unusual. Two kindergarten girls were playing a few doors down from the modest but neatly kept suburban house where one of them lived. Jesse Timmendequas, 18, rode by on his bicycle.
He later told the police he was heading toward the apartment he shared with his mother, Doris Gorman, and her four other children in a rundown building three blocks away, on William Street in the New Market Pond area. Across William Street from where the girls were playing, a wooded embankment led to a stream.
To the extent that people remember Mr. Timmendequas at all from those days, it is as someone who seemed not to fit in. "Jesse was just there," said a Piscataway school administrator who would only speak with a promise of anonymity. "He occupied a space. Nobody even really knew him."
A few days after Mr. Timmendequas' 1979 arrest, a Piscataway detective, Richard Hand, wrote in a police report, misspelling the suspect's first name: "Jessie to my knowledge is known to hang around with boys much younger than himself, ages 10, 12 and 13 years of age. He has had several problems with the younger boys over in the pond area, New Market Pond, where he has had fights with them and throwing a few of them into the pond."
According to one person who has seen psychological reports prepared after that arrest, Mr. Timmendequas said then that he remembered as traumatic an incident when he was 8: A group of older girls took his clothes away and forced him to walk home through the streets.
That Monday afternoon in October 1979, after he rode up William Street on his bicycle, he persuaded the two 5-year-old girls to go off with him in search of ducks. Mr. Timmendequas, according to the police report, took them by the hand and led them toward the embankment.
At the bottom -- the police report does not say why -- one of the girls broke away and ran for help, leaving him with the other kindergartner.
"When we got down to the bottom of the hill by the brook, I knocked her down and then pulled her pants down," Mr. Timmendequas said in a statement he gave after the police confronted him the next day.
He told the police he just wanted to look at her vagina. But the little girl said he had smelled her. Then, she said, "I started to cry and he put his hand over my mouth."
By then, a neighbor who had been alerted by the other 5-year-old was on her way across William Street. Mr. Timmendequas and the little girl ran back up the hill. "She started to cry," his statement said, "and I ran back up the hill and got my bike and took off towards home."
Later that fall, Mr. Timmendequas pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated sexual assault. Judge John E. Bachman of State Superior Court in Middlesex County concluded that, "While he certainly has mental or psychiatric problems, these seem to be of the type which can be dealt with best in an outpatient setting," and gave Mr. Timmendequas a suspended sentence on the condition that he go for counseling.
Court records show that he did not live up to those terms. Cited for violating the terms of his sentence, he served nine months in the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Center.
 
The Second Attack
 
Out of Jail, Back on the Prowl
By the end of June in 1981, he was out of jail. He had an apartment in Dunellen, not far from Piscataway.
About a quarter-mile from his apartment, there was a patch of woods. At the far edge of the woods was Middlesex Borough's public pool and tennis courts. Even now, neighbors let their children play alone there because it seems safe.
That was where two 7-year-old girls, best friends, were playing the day Jesse Timmendequas came up to them. He asked if they wanted firecrackers for the Fourth of July. Mr. Timmendequas would later tell police he had waited in the area about an hour before he saw the girls, according to a transcript of his statement.
One of the girls panicked, got on a bicycle and went screaming off in search of their mothers. In his statement, Mr. Timmendequas described what happened next with the other child.
"We walked down the trail a little bit and I grabbed her around the throat," he said, "and pulled her off to the side of the woods and when she started to turn blue I let her go and ran and that's it."
An officer asked if he had been aroused. "Yes. A little bit," the transcript quotes him saying.
Mr. Timmendequas, who had just turned 20, said he had been sexually interested in little girls for about a year. An officer asked if he knew what had caused that. "No," was all he answered.
The girl's mother found her unconscious in the woods. The police were called. When Mr. Timmendequas walked out of the woods on the Dunellen side, a police car was waiting. A small stream separated that area from the scene of the assault. Mr. Timmendequas' blue jeans were wet from the knee down.
In the hospital, the doctors concluded no sexual contact had occurred. The girl's father, who sat next to her during the recent interview, said he and his wife have never been able to wipe away the image of their daughter with blue marks on her neck where she had been choked. On her stomach was a black and blue handprint where her attacker had gripped her.
When Megan Kanka was killed all those years later, the father said, he felt he knew what his family had been spared. "As the years go by," he said, "you store it in the back of your mind. When this happened all I could think of was, 'That could have been my daughter.' "
 
In a Program
 
Sitting Silently Through Therapy
For the incident in Middlesex, Mr. Timmendequas was charged with five felonies including kidnapping and attempted murder. But as is often true in such cases, the charges were difficult to prove. The prosecutor, Joyce Munkacsi, said in an interview that the little girl remembered nothing that would establish the sexual aspects of the case. And the girl's parents hoped to avoid a trial.
Mr. Timmendequas "seemed to want some type of assistance," said Ms. Munkacsi, now a judge in Middlesex County.
They bargained. Mr. Timmendequas would plead guilty to attempted sexual contact and attempting to cause serious bodily injury and would be sent to New Jersey's center for sexual offenders at Avenel.
The other charges were dropped. The maximum prison term was 10 years and the judge in the case, C. Judson Hamlin, imposed it, finding that Mr. Timmendequas "constitutes a danger to the public at large and to young children in particular."
Judge Hamlin specified that Mr. Timmendequas should serve the maximum. But as everyone with experience in the New Jersey courts knew then, a 10-year sentence really meant 6 years 8 months with credit for good behavior. Since then, partly as a result of this case, legislators have been under pressure to change laws to make criminals serve more of their sentences.
In an interview, Judge Hamlin said he had no illusions that he could make Mr. Timmendequas less of a risk. "I had no thought there was going to be some magic that was going to happen," he said, "which is why I tried to warehouse him as long as I could."
Avenel's therapeutic approach to sexual offenders has been criticized for years by some officials who say it coddles offenders and does not provide adequate treatment. Supporters say its therapy represents the only chance that some child molesters and rapists who are destined to return to the streets can gain enough insight to control themselves.
But both sides say that all sex-offender treatment programs are particularly frustrated by the many offenders who do not open up to treatment. People who were at Avenel at the time say Mr. Timmendequas never seemed engaged in therapy.
A former inmate testified before a New Jersey legislative task force on Avenel in 1994. Some inmates refuse to go to treatment at all, he said.
"You have other people like Jesse Timmendequas, who will go to a group and sit there," said the inmate, who testified with his identity kept confidential. "They sit there silently, whether it is someone else who has the floor or when the therapist says 'It's your turn to have the floor today.' They kind of muddle their way through."
Edward D. Balyk, a therapist at Avenel, remembered Mr. Timmendequas.
"He was a pouter," Dr. Balyk said. "Then he'd go hide. He spent a lot of time in bed."
 
The Death of Megan
 
Three Molesters Move In Next Door
At Avenel, Mr. Timmendequas met the two other sex offenders with whom he eventually moved to Megan Kanka's street. One was Brian R. Jenin, five years older than Mr. Timmendequas. In one case involving an 11-year-old boy, according to court records, a judge in Burlington County found that Mr. Jenin had "joined the Big Brother organization so he could have access to young boys. So he could sexually molest them."
The other was Joseph F. Cifelli, who was six years older. In 1976, Mr. Cifelli had been charged with carnal abuse and sodomy of a 5-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty to three counts of impairing the morals of a minor.
Mr. Cifelli's and Mr. Jenin's crimes are the types of acts covered by "Megan's Law." Corrections officials in New Jersey say they think both men have stayed out of prison since their release from Avenel, but that since they moved away from the Kanka's block after her slaying, their whereabouts are unknown.
For a time after Mr. Timmendequas was released from Avenel in 1988, he worked at the Montgomery Township Parks Department as a laborer. In 1991 and 1992, he told the police, he and Mr. Jenin lived together in San Diego. Then, they moved into the two-story house with white aluminum siding on Barbara Lee Drive that was diagonally across the street from the Kankas' house. The house belonged to Mr. Cifelli's mother, who was 72 and had Alzheimer's disease.
Mr. Cifelli had lived there as a child and had returned there in 1987 when he was released from Avenel. He and Mr. Timmendequas got jobs in Princeton Township mowing lawns at parks and playgrounds. Mr. Jenin described himself as an unemployed travel agent.
Some of the neighbors knew about Mr. Cifelli's past. But Megan's mother, Maureen Kanka, who had lived here 16 years, said no one told her about it. She had no reason to worry that evening in the summer of 1994 when Megan went out to look for a friend who lived in the house next to Mrs. Cifelli's.
For 23 hours after that, neighbors and police searched. They checked parks and trash bins. They used dogs trained to follow a scent. Mr. Timmendequas helped hand out fliers of the little missing girl.
When the police searched house to house, Mr. Cifelli and Mr. Jenin could prove they had been out doing errands when Megan had disappeared. Mr. Timmendequas seemed nervous, was perspiring heavily and chain smoking, the police wrote in their reports.
As they learned about Mr. Timmendequas' record, they called around New Jersey. From Middlesex Borough, Detective Sgt. Robert F. Schwarz drove south to Hamilton Township. Back in 1981, Patrolman Robert F. Schwarz, new on the force, had arrested the young Jesse Timmendequas who had tried to strangle the little girl in the woods.
At Hamilton Township's police headquarters, Detective Schwarz introduced himself to Mr. Timmendequas, who, he said, seemed relieved to see a familiar face. Within a few hours, Mr. Timmendequas told the police he had killed Megan while raping her. He was afraid she would tell her mother that he had touched her and tried to kiss her, according to portions of his statement.
Mr. Timmendequas agreed to take the police to Mercer County Park, where, he said, he had left Megan's body in a pile of weeds. Detective Schwarz rode with him. As he described the little girl's death in the car, the detective said, there was no moment when he expressed sorrow for her.
"Even then," Detective Schwarz said, "he was only concerned about himself: 'How much time am I going to get?' Everything was about himself." In the back of the patrol car, Mr. Timmendequas lay down so Megan's neighbors would not see him.
Prosecutors have said in court that Mr. Timmendequas got Megan into the house by offering to let her pet his new puppy.
Mrs. Kanka, her husband, Richard, and their two other children no longer have to look at the house where Mr. Timmendequas lived. Through their bay window, they now see a small park that has been built in Megan's memory where the house was.
Mrs. Kanka speaks often around the country, lobbying for the law and warning parents to take care of their children. She has asked for permission to address jurors at Mr. Timmendequas' trial, to ask them to impose the death penalty. "They need to understand," she said, "that people get hurt when something like this happens. And it's not something that goes away. It's not any better now than it was the first day."
Even now, she cannot bring herself to speak his name.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Tap Asian Market, And 2 Nations Bid for Plant

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 27

 BODY:
In Thailand, where the country's bargaining position is strong, the official attitude is studied nonchalance. In the Philippines, where officials are desperate to get into the game, almost anything goes.
The game is auto manufacturing in the world's fastest-growing market, and both countries are bidding for a plum: the first full-scale assembly plant to be built in the region by the General Motors Corporation. 
 The company expects to make a decision next month, and depending on a number of variables, the plant could cost from $500 million to $1 billion, said Andrew Andersz, a G.M. spokesman in Singapore. He declined to offer more specifics but industry analysts said the plant was expected to produce well over 100,000 small cars a year and provide 2,000 or more jobs.
In the Philippines, where the auto industry is young, the plant could generate thousands of additional jobs among subcontractors and suppliers.
The decision on where to put the plant is important for the two countries but also crucial for G.M., which sees Asia as its biggest growth market in the decade ahead. John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said this month that his company planned to capture 10 percent of the Asian market by 2005, up from 5 percent now.
Southeast Asia along with China lies at the core of G.M.'s strategy. Vehicle sales in Southeast Asia increased fivefold from 1980 to 1995, Mr. Smith said, while acknowledging that American auto makers had initially missed an opportunity in this region and that the Japanese had a strong foothold here now. "The Southeast Asian countries are looking for alternatives to Japanese vehicles," he said. "We do have this opportunity to take market share."
At first glance, Thailand is the natural choice. Already a regional center with a growing number of new or planned auto plants, including those of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, its eastern seaboard is turning into a little Detroit.
The competition between Thailand and the Philippines offers a glimpse at the pattern of development in a rapidly industrializing region: growth feeds on growth.
"If G.M. does come, it means Thailand will have really become a car hub in this region," said Chakramon Phasukavanich, deputy secretary general of the Thai Board of Investment. "But even without G.M., we can be a car hub."
John Bonnell, regional director for the market research company Automotive Resources Asia, added: "The G.M. plant would be much bigger for the Philippines than for Thailand. It would transform the picture."
In the Philippines, where the auto industry is negligible, General Motors executives have been met with a hungrier attitude.
"I offered them 50 hectares of low-lying undeveloped area right next to Subic proper," said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay Free Port at the former United States naval base 100 miles north of Manila. "They said the land was too soft. So I put them in a chopper and took them to another area. They were pretty amazed at how fast we were handling it. And I offered to develop the area -- power, water, communications and land development -- and I offered it to them rent-free for five years."
The Government is also offering a package of tax breaks, including a tax holiday for the first eight years, duty-free import of machinery, a waiver of local-content rules for car exports and a Government-financed training program for auto workers.
For General Motors, the move is as important as it is for the host nations. If Asian economies continue to grow at close to 8 percent a year, the regional auto market could equal or better that of the United States, at 16 million vehicles a year within the next decade, predicted Victor Sun, a regional auto analyst for Peregrine Brokerage Ltd. in Hong Kong.
G.M. defines the market as extending from Japan and South Korea in the north to New Zealand in the south, but excluding the Indian subcontinent. The company currently has plants in Indonesia and Taiwan that assemble about 20,000 vehicles a year for domestic markets.
Outside Japan and South Korea, Thailand has emerged as the region's leading auto maker, producing 580,000 vehicles last year, including 330,000 pickup trucks, which makes it the second-largest producer of pickups after the United States. By the end of the century, Thailand aims to be producing one million vehicles a year, Mr. Chakramon said.
This translates into a broad base of hundreds of automotive component manufacturers, a major attraction in contrast to the Philippines, where the industry is mostly limited to transmissions and some other components.
"What Thailand is really offering is that there is already an automotive component infrastructure here," said Richard Stampfle, president of the Lear Seating (Thailand) Company. "You don't need to build one. You can go out and buy your parts."
His company, a unit of the Lear Corporation of Southfield, Mich., is one of the component manufacturers ready and waiting for General Motors in Thailand.
This growing manufacturing presence here, along with the network of roads and ports, continues to attract still more factories. In addition to most of the major Japanese manufacturers, Chrysler recently began producing and marketing its Jeep Cherokee here and Ford, together with the Mazda Motor Corporation of Japan, is building a factory to produce compact pickup trucks.
With these advantages, Thailand is wooing General Motors primarily with the package of incentives it offers to all companies that choose rural areas away from the congested capital of Bangkok.
The package includes tax exemptions on export earnings for the first eight years, followed by a 50 percent tax reduction for the next five years, as well as an exemption from tariffs on machinery imports for the first two years.
At the request of General Motors, Thailand has also agreed in principle to finance a $15 million automotive training institute as long as it is open to other manufacturers, Mr. Chakramon said.
In its greatest concession, Thailand has acceded to a request by the company that it lift a 54 percent local-content requirement for all auto makers by July 1998, 18 months ahead of a deadline for such a move set by the World Trade Organization.
"That means we are really trying to please General Motors," Mr. Chakramon said. Although the shortened deadline would apply to all manufacturers, he said, it is a concession Thailand has in the past refused to other companies, which meant they had to invest in local production lines for parts and components.
He said Thailand had declined to match the offer by the Philippines of rent-free land, adding, "We don't have free public land to give away."
And he said Thailand had also turned down a request by General Motors for an exemption from the nation's 20 percent import tariff on components because of a need to protect local manufacturers.
"We have a couple of hundred auto parts makers in the country and we have to give them some protection," he said. "We have agreed to abolish the local-content requirement and if we slash the duty tariff as well, I think they will be in trouble."

A Top Property Developer Is Arrested in Japan
A leading Japanese real estate developer has been arrested in a growing investigation into the roots of Japan's debt crisis. The arrest of Kichinosuke Sasaki, president of Togensha, comes as big property debtors and the banks that lent them billions of yen face increasingly sharp public criticism.
Mr. Sasaki and his wife have been accused of obstructing an auction sale of a piece of land near Mount Fuji in eastern Japan. [Page D10.]

Growth in Health Costs Slows Down
Health care spending grew 6.4 percent in 1994, a slower rate than in any year since 1960, the Government said. National health care spending totaled $949.4 billion, or 13.7 percent of total economic output -- the gross domestic product -- in 1994, the Department of Health and Human Services said. Just three years ago, the Congressional Budget Office was estimating that health spending would account for 15 percent of the gross domestic product in 1994. [A13.]

Chinese Lessons for U.S. Company
Durawool, an American steel-wool maker that was attracted by the advantages of doing business in China, is embroiled in a legal dispute with a former employee who became a rival, in a case that shows the differences between the United States and China in protecting intellectual property. [D10.]
 
Tool Orders Decline 9.6%
Orders for American-built industrial tools fell 9.6 percent in April from March, a trade group reported. But tool orders are still higher than a year ago, pointing to resilient strength in manufacturing. [D6.]
 
Survey Sees Increased Hiring
The job market is expected to improve this summer, led by a pickup in construction industry employment and continued strength in the Midwest, according to a new survey by Manpower Inc., the temporary employment company. The survey found that 27 percent of the businesses surveyed expected to increase employment in the third quarter. [D6.]
 
Japan Open to Chip Trade Talks
A Japanese Government official left the door open for negotiations with the United States about semiconductor trade before the upcoming expiration of the two nations' existing computer chip trade agreement. [D6.]
 
Canadian Scrutiny for Hollinger
Canadian regulatory officials plan to take a hard look at Conrad Black's aggressive moves to expand his newspaper empire in Canada. They said they would examine whether Mr. Black's proposal to acquire all of the newspaper publisher Southam Inc. would give his company, Hollinger Inc., too much control over the Canadian press. Hollinger already owns 38 of Canada's 106 dailies, though most of its papers are small. [D2.]
 
This Is I.B.M.?
The members of Spinal Tap, a parody of a British heavy-metal band, always insisted that no one would ever want them for a commercial. They have, of course, been proved wrong: I.B.M. has hired the actors who portray Spinal Tap to appear in commercials that promote the company's role in the 1996 Olympic Games. [D8.]
 
Promoting an Ad Group
The American Advertising Federation is seeking to raise its profile with a new slogan, a new logo and a new campaign. The difficulty has been communicating the broad focus of the federation's activities. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D8.]
 
Web Site Seeking Subscribers
The Web Review, one of the best known magazines that are found only on the Internet, has stopped publishing and has issued an unusual appeal for subscribers that draws on two models of voluntary contributions. [D2.]

HEADLINE: Wage Study Was Based on Faulty Research

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Reading Alan S. Blinder's article "The $5.15 Question" (Op-Ed, May 23) on raising the minimum wage, it amazes me that anyone is still talking about the New Jersey "fast-food" study in light of the drubbing it took from the media and the economic community after the Employment Policies Institute exposed its flaws last year. 
 Mr. Blinder contends that the authors of the study "are among the most careful empirical researchers in the economics profession," yet ignores the fact that the data set supporting the study were collected by way of a cold-call telephone survey. This unconventional, unscientific and unreliable method of research was the undoing of the study, which was proved wrong by looking at the actual payroll records. By relying on an inexact phone survey that asked only one question about employment, the researchers reported employment shifts that defy explanation.
For example, a Wendy's restaurant in Pennsylvania shriveled from 30 full-time employees in February to no full-time employees in November of the same year. A Burger King in New Jersey ballooned from 6 full-time employees to 29 full-timers in the same nine-month period.
These are just two of dozens of bizarre employment shifts found in the study. The telephone surveys proved to be 100 percent inaccurate when compared to the actual payroll data.
Their phone survey couldn't even accurately track the expected price shifts after a wage hike. The researchers reported the price of a "regular" hamburger in various Wendy's restaurants as increasing or decreasing as much as 88 percent.
This sloppy research may represent a "quantum jump in quality" to Dr. Blinder, but to the rest of us it's just plain wrong.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the debate over Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's welfare reform plan, one thing is clear: There is a distressing gap between what Governor Thompson practices at home in Wisconsin and what he advocates for the nation.
 Since taking office in 1988, Governor Thompson, a Republican, has spent lavishly on helping welfare recipients find jobs. It has worked. Since 1986, the welfare rolls have dropped by 33 percent (a strong economy has helped as well). This success is the most persuasive evidence to date that spending adequately on welfare pays off in the long run.
 
 Yet on the national level, Governor Thompson has been leading the fight to cut Federal financing of welfare and begin a program of giving states block grants. Such steps would effectively prevent other states from following Wisconsin's lead.
 Consider how Wisconsin has paid for its gains. In 1988, the state cut welfare grants by 6 percent. Mr. Thompson persuaded Washington to let him spend all the savings -- the Federal share as well as the state's -- on welfare reform. Thus, Wisconsin's quickly became the best financed plan in the nation, spending $10 million in 1988, $33 million in 1989, and $48 million in 1990. Last year, the state budgeted $58 million. *(All figures are in 1994 dollars.)
 Lawrence Mead, a conservative professor of public affairs at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, showed that Wisconsin's welfare caseload didn't increase during the 1989-1992 recession, largely because many welfare mothers were enrolled in job training and placement programs. So while Governor Thompson trumpets block grants and spending cuts, his experience argues against his prescriptions.
 Now, with President Clinton's endorsement, Wisconsin is seeking Federal waivers to put its full-scale plan in place. This promising plan would involve creating thousands of government jobs for those who can't find private ones; providing rehabilitation services for those unable to work; sending all child-support money collected directly to custodial parents rather than to the state, and giving child- and health-care subsidies to all low-income working families, not just to those that have been on welfare.
 The plan is not without its problems. It ends the guarantee of benefits to poor families and imposes a five-year limit on cash assistance -- changes that are bound to increase child poverty. But on the whole it's a serious attempt to get people off welfare and into the workplace, the sort of strategy both political parties say they support.
 But it would cost a lot of money, as even Governor Thompson admits. If allowed to proceed, the state expects initially to spend 13 percent more per year than it does now. It could be much more. With Wisconsin's unemployment rate at only 3.7 percent and with a supportive Legislature, this may not be a problem. But if Federal spending is cut, what will states in less enviable positions do?
 It was no too long ago that both political parties seemed to understand the importance of financing welfare reform. In November 1993, 162 of 175 House Republicans co-sponsored a bill that authorized creating 2.6 million public-service jobs for welfare recipients at a cost of $12.7 billion over five years. But since the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, both parties have been committed to cutting billions of dollars from welfare programs. Even President Clinton has fallen into line.
 If the cuts go through, states won't have the money to create jobs or provide vocational training and day care. Mostly what they'll be able to do is drop people from the rolls. Even Governor Thompson will tell you that's not real welfare reform.

HEADLINE: City Awarded 4 Contracts To a Defunct Corporation

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
A construction company that failed to pay state taxes and was stripped of its corporate standing nearly two years ago has since won four contracts, worth more than $600,000, from the Fire Department and another New York City agency.
The Fire Department, the Mayor's Office of Contracts and the City Comptroller's office were all apparently unaware that the state had terminated the corporate status of the company, Ciprietti-Tolisano Associates, when they approved and registered the four contracts. 
 The city cannot legally sign a contract with a defunct corporation, aides to City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said. The forced dissolution of a corporation also renders any existing city contracts invalid, according to the Comptroller's aides.
Unwittingly signing a contract with a corporation that has been dissolved by the state for failing to pay taxes could expose the city to many risks, the Comptroller's office and several independent lawyers said. For one thing, if the quality of the work is poor, the city would be hard pressed to sue a nonexistent corporation, they said.
Fire officials now say they have begun to review Ciprietti-Tolisano's current and future contracts.
The city agencies' failure to check the status of Ciprietti-Tolisano, which is based in the Westchester town of Tuckahoe, before awarding the contracts is the latest example of serious problems in contracting by the Giuliani administration.
Just last Friday, administration officials canceled the award of $2.5 million in contracts to nonprofit agencies to help immigrants, amid charges that city officials had broken rules to steer the contracts to politically favored groups.
Two months ago, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani terminated welfare contracts worth $43 million in response to reports that city bidding rules had been broken and relatives of administration officials had obtained jobs with the well-connected agency that won the contracts.
The murky legal standing of Ciprietti-Tolisano Associates first came to light late last month, when The New York Times reported that the company was to be a major subcontractor on an ambitious, $31 million effort by the Fire Department to hire private companies to maintain, repair and renovate hundreds of Fire Department buildings.
Ciprietti-Tolisano did not disclose -- as it was required to on a city contractor's questionnaire -- that it had owed $4,875 in state franchise taxes since 1991 or that its corporate status had been terminated in September 1994 by the New York Secretary of State.
The company also did not disclose, as required, two tax liens from the Internal Revenue Service -- one for $30,106 in unpaid Federal payroll taxes and the other for $12,691 in unpaid Federal unemployment insurance taxes.
Early this month, just days after The Times reported that Ciprietti-Tolisano had been tentatively selected to participate in a contract to maintain firehouses, the company paid its overdue state franchise taxes, state officials said. On May 10, the company's corporate status was restored.
But in November 1994, just two months after the corporation was dissolved by the state, the city gave final approval for three contracts to Ciprietti-Tolisano. Work on one, awarded by the Department of General Services for rebuilding the floor of a firehouse, has been completed. Work is still under way on two others that were granted by the Fire Department -- one, worth $355,000, for the installation of structural steel in a renovation of the Fire Department's main vehicle-repair center in Long Island City, Queens, and another, worth $55,000, for repaving and upgrading a parking lot for fire marshals in the Bronx.
The fourth contract, for renovations to the Fire Department's library on Randalls Island, was awarded in May 1995.
Senior officials in the city's Law Department did not respond to more than a half-dozen messages over the last week seeking comment on the contracts. But the city's Department of General Services in an unrelated case determined in 1993 that a plumbing contractor whose corporate status was terminated by the state could not conduct business in New York and was ineligible to bid for city contracts.
Fire Department officials acknowledged that they were unaware of the company's overdue taxes and its corporate dissolution until they were told about them in late March by a lawyer representing unionized repair and maintenance workers, who are challenging the department's proposed contract to privatize building maintenance.
Fire officials said that Ciprietti-Tolisano had performed well on its contracts but that the department had begun reviewing the company's current and future contracts in light of its failure to disclose unpaid taxes and the corporate dissolution.
The owners of Ciprietti-Tolisano, Robert Ciprietti and Mario Tolisano, could not be reached for comment.
Under the $31 million contract tentatively awarded late last year to a Brooklyn construction company, Volmar Construction, Ciprietti-Tolisano was to maintain and repair about 60 firehouses and other department buildings in Queens.

HEADLINE: Co-op City Suffers While Its Board Bickers;
An Election Focuses on a Battle for Control As the Complex's Management Is Investigated

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
Once upon a time, in an urban hamlet called Co-op City, the governing board members worked together in harmony, love and happiness, united in their zeal to improve the apartments, gardens and parking garages of the nation's largest cooperative housing development.
Or so it was supposed to be. 
 But in New York City, where the rancor on co-op boards often exceeds that of the ugliest of political wars, it is only natural that the biggest complex, in the northeastern section of the Bronx, would provide one of the liveliest battlefields. And it has.
In what has been dubbed the "Monday Morning Massacre," five heads rolled last July when the board president dismissed five top managers in one day. And in the 10 months since, the board members and their employees have taken to name-calling and lawsuit-filing as they feud over erupting toilets, the hiring of lobby attendants and the burning question: who cut down the complex's 20-year-old willow tree?
"They said it was diseased, but I never believed that," Iris Herskowitz Baez, the board's first vice president, says darkly.
But behind the bickering is a deadly serious battle for control of the all-volunteer governing board, which controls $256 million in coveted contracts for the complex's plumbing, landscaping and legal fees. This week, as the board president, Gretchen B. Hazell, faces the voters in the complex's elections, she finds herself the target of two state investigations probing the firing of the managers and the distribution of some of the contracts.
The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which subsidizes and oversees Co-op City, has questioned Ms. Hazell's decision to award a $175,000 contract to the law firm of a prominent fund-raiser for and friend of Gov. George E. Pataki, a move that critics say was intended to help shield her from state scrutiny. The state has also questioned why the managers were dismissed and why Ms. Hazell's associates were hired at the complex soon after she was elected. After hearing the allegations, the State Comptroller's office recently initiated its own audit, saying that "improper financial and management practices may have occurred at Co-op City."
Ms. Hazell, who vehemently denies any wrongdoing, says she welcomes the audit because she believes it will bring to light the illegal activities of her enemies on the board. "I've literally begged the state agency to come and audit our corporation," she said. "There have definitely been improprieties going on, but they don't involve me."
And as the board continues to battle, Co-op City's underground pipes continue to burst, and one of its cement garages continues to crumble. Management is $27 million short of the money needed for repairs, and many of the 55,000 residents continue to fear that their complex will continue to deteriorate while the board bickers. At stake, some residents say, is the future of the sprawling cooperative development, which since 1968 has offered working families affordable, spacious apartments with lawns dotted with sun-dipped marigolds and scenic views of Manhattan's glittering skyscrapers, all the while mirroring within its own population the ethnic changes and tensions transforming the Bronx.
The towers first attracted white people who had abandoned their walk-up apartments in the South Bronx for Co-op City's high-rises with elevators, air-conditioning and shopping centers. But as the Bronx changed, the complex changed, and today, Co-op City is 43 percent black and 18 percent Hispanic, Census data show. The complex's community rooms, once used primarily by Jewish social and religious clubs, now also house the Spanish-American Club which plans bowling trips and scholarship drives and the African-American Association which hosts jazz concerts and commemorates the birthday of the Harlem Renaissance poet, Langston Hughes, and other notable black Americans.
The transformation has not come without strain. In the 1980's, the co-op board openly advertised for white residents, fearful that the influx of new residents would create an all-black complex. And five of the six managers who were dismissed -- two are white, two black and one Hispanic -- have filed a joint complaint with the state's Division of Human Rights, accusing Ms. Baez, a white woman, of discriminating against black employees and Ms. Hazell, a black woman, of discriminating against white employees, charges that both women deny.
But while the complexion of the people has changed, the residents are still overwhelmingly middle class. The black and Hispanic families are nurses and teachers and secretaries and real estate brokers who earn about $40,000 a year -- a third more than the mostly elderly white people living there and more than a third more than the average household in the Bronx, Census data show. With a $9,000 down payment and a $619 monthly maintenance fee, the Co-op City offers all residents, white, black and Hispanic, a community with common gardens and shopping centers where silver-haired octogenarians gossip and giggling teen-agers buy cherry ices for 75 cents.
"It's a lovely place to live in, but it's being run down in all the crossfire," said Frances Riback, a retired secretary. "Everybody wants to be a big boss and meanwhile we're taking our lives in our hands whenever we walk in the garage."
Indeed, the board members campaigning for office this week have played on residents' fears. "Help save Co-op City!" screams one flier. "Co-op City is becoming unsafe, unclean and unprofessionally managed!" Another placard, referring to the toilet troubles, reads: "Doesn't anyone care that more than 1,000 homes were severely flooded out?"
"This has always been the way station for people who aspire to the American Dream," said Ms. Hazell, the embattled board president. "It's not a bad stop. It's just that people -- mostly the politicians -- who try and make it bad."
The controversy began on July 31 when Ms. Hazell dismissed the director of operations, the director of human resources, the director of public safety, the director of restoration and the director of community events just two months after she was elected president. The general counsel, who happened to be off that day, was let go as soon as he came back to work.
She said she wanted a new team of managers and blamed the old ones for having selected the contractor ultimately responsible for installing the 1,000 overflowing toilets. "We decided we were going to get rid of some of these managers who were not doing their jobs," Ms. Hazell said.
But the old managers said they fell out of favor because they refused to hire Ms. Hazell's friends and to support the questionable contracts that she and her colleague, Ms. Baez, wanted to award. "They wanted to dictate everything from who should get contracts to what kind of trees we should plant," said Frank Garcia, the fired manager of operations.
The Division of Housing and Community Renewal sided with the managers and ordered Ms. Hazell to reinstate them along with general manager, who had been suspended. But Ms. Hazell refused, and the D.H.C.R. began proceedings to remove her from the board, completing its fact finding in January. Its final decision is still pending.
And that is when Ms. Hazell, a lifelong Democrat, decided to run for state assembly -- as a Republican. Immediately, her critics began speculating: Is she trying to curry favor with the Republicans to save her political skin? And when she awarded the $175,000 legal contract to the law firm of Robert J. Costello, a long-time Pataki friend and fund-raiser, on Feb. 15, the day she lost the election, the speculation and accusations went into overdrive.
"The Republicans made a deal with me?" scoffs Ms. Hazell in response. "Let me tell you something, the Republicans have never made me any kind of deal. I have been a lifelong Democrat, they are right. My party, I called my party, and they never returned my call. They didn't support me. The Republican party, they at least gave me the opportunity to run."
And as for the law firm, Ms. Baez said that Mr. Costello's firm was recommended earlier by one of the ousted managers and with good reason.
"We have a Republican administration and we have a Republican Mayor," Ms. Baez said. "It stands to reason that you want to reach out to a firm that has the ear of the administration."
Both blame the investigations and accusations on the disgruntled employees and their seven supporters on the board. "It looks like a conspiracy," Ms. Hazell said. "They want to get us out."
And indeed, relations between the two opposing board factions -- eight on one side and seven on the other -- have steadily deteriorated over the last year. Ms. Baez, for instance, has taken to calling opposition board member Clarence Powell "Inspector Clouseau," belittling his background as a retired homicide detective by comparing him to the bumbling policeman portrayed by the late actor Peter Sellers. And Mr. Powell, in turn, has hinted that he might call Ms. Baez "Miss Piggy," in an unkind reference to her girth.
The State Comptroller's office, which began its investigation of the more serious allegations in April, expects its audit to take six months.
But the voters will finally get their say tomorrow. The ballots will be counted and, some residents hope, the board will finally put aside its bickering and get back to business.
But Laura Manfredi, a 29-year-old musician who has lived in Co-op City since she was a little girl, is not so optimistic. She believes that even if the embattled president is voted out that a new leader will simply mean new battles and new intrigue.
"They're all nuts and they've always been nuts," Ms. Manfredi said of the board members. "Every year, it's the same kind of craziness, just a different set of names."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges as Lower Rates Are Seen for Bonn and Tokyo

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a 17-month high against the German mark and six-week high against the Japanese yen yesterday, lifted by speculation that interest rates in Germany and Japan would remain weak.
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 108.85 yen, up from 107.80 yen on Friday and the highest since it was at 108.95 yen on April 12. The dollar rose to 1.5464 marks, from 1.5420 marks on Friday, highest since a rate of 1.5660 marks on Jan. 6, 1995. The British pound rose to $1.5131 from $1.5120. 
 Global currency trading was limited on Monday, with financial markets in the United States and most of Europe closed for national holidays.
The dollar's rise followed a rally late last week after Eisuke Sakakibara, head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's international finance bureau, indicated that higher interest rates in Japan were not likely in the near future.
Speculation that he had also privately told Japanese executives he foresaw the yen weakening to 130 to the dollar also helped the dollar.
Those gains were extended yesterday after Japan issued two weaker-than-expected economic reports, which traders said further confirmed that Japan would not push up interest rates soon because its economic problems persist. Lower rates make a currency less attractive.
"These figures showed that there will probably will be no change in policy in interest rates until the economy turns around," said Steven Flanagan, vice president at Credit Agricole in New York.
Against the mark, the dollar gained on speculation that the German Bundesbank might lower interest rates at its policy-making meeting tomorrow to spur a turnaround in the slumping economy.
The mark also came under pressure against other European currencies as well, namely against the Italian lira and British pound.
The lira was particularly strong yesterday on comments Prime Minister Romano Prodi made indicating that the timetable for the European single currency should be maintained.
His comments followed a meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in which the two leaders said that slowed economic growth in much of Europe would not interrupt the process leading to a single European currency by 1999.

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
IT is almost as if many people cannot live without an in-your-face vice that flouts admonitions to lead a healthier life. The latest to achieve celebrity status is cigar smoking. In clubs and restaurants, at special parties and on city streets, the air is being filled with acrid cigar smoke by people with money to burn, from stars like Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Nicholson and David Letterman to corporate high-achievers.
These highly visible and influential image makers threaten to stymie the significant progress that has been made in curbing smoking, the nation's most costly health-damaging habit. These cigar aficionados are society's trend setters. Can the less affluent be far behind? 
 George Burns's survival to 100 despite the cigar as his constant companion or the lack of a Government health warning on cigar packages may have prompted many in their 20's and 30's to take up the habit, convinced that cigars are safe. But studies have shown otherwise. While smoking cigars may not be quite as deadly as cigarettes, which are more often inhaled, there is no question that cigars can cause cancer and other deadly diseases, even if the smoke is not inhaled. And the sidestream smoke emanating from cigars that bystanders cannot help but inhale is at least as carcinogenic as the smoke from cigarettes.

 The Resurgence
When cigarette smoking took a nose dive after the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health in January 1964, millions of Americans switched to cigars, producing a consumption peak that year of 9.1 billion. Then, as cigarette smokers backslid or found cigars an unacceptable substitute, the stogie suffered a gradual decadeslong decline, falling to a low of 2.1 billion in 1993.
It has been a growth market ever since, especially for the sellers of premium cigars, the kind that cost about $2.50 a piece or more. Retailers report annual sales increases of 50 percent or more for premium cigars for the last two years, with no slackening in sight. A glossy magazine, Cigar Aficionado, with half a million readers, is further evidence of the smoking frenzy. Private cigar clubs, cigar cruises, cigar nights for sampling brands while sipping cognac and expensive dinner parties for cigar smokers only are helping to glamorize the habit.
The cigar industry estimates that more than 10 million Americans, 99.9 percent of them men, now regularly smoke cigars, an increase of about 2 million since 1993. And, with industry advertising now focusing on women the way cigarette companies did two decades ago, the men are being joined by a growing number of women who, by taking up cigars, may be putting their lives on the line in the pursuit of equal opportunity.

 The Health Risks
The American Lung Association cites a number of myths about the "safety" of cigar smoking, among them that cigars are a safe alternative to cigarettes, that cigar smoking is not addictive and that smoking cigars does not cause lung cancer or chronic pulmonary disease.
These are the facts:

 CANCER Cigar smoking causes cancer of the larynx, mouth, esophagus and lungs. Over all, men who smoke cigars have death rates from cancer that are 34 percent higher than those of nonsmokers. Studies that followed the fates of cigar smokers and nonsmokers over many years have shown that cigar smoking raises the risk of dying from cancers of the larynx, mouth and esophagus by 4 to 10 times. These rates are similar to those associated with cigarette smoking and are believed to reflect the fact that when cigars are puffed the smoke is held in the mouth and upper airways.
Researchers who examined cells from the larynx, the voice box, found that 99 percent of cigar smokers had "atypical cells," the first step toward malignancy, while only 25 percent of nonsmokers had them.
The chances of developing lung cancer are indeed lower for cigar smokers than for cigarette smokers, largely because most cigar smokers do not inhale. But lung-cancer death rates among cigar smokers are about three times as high as they are among nonsmokers. The risk rises with the number of cigars smoked each day, and studies in other countries indicate that for those who inhale cigar smoke, the lung cancer risk is comparable to that of cigarette smoking .
Dr. I. T. T. Higgins and colleagues at the American Health Foundation, a nonprofit research organization in New York City, have pointed out that "when cigarette smokers switch to cigars or pipes, they usually have been found to continue to inhale in the way they were accustomed to when they smoked cigarettes." For this reason, they say, "no health benefit should be anticipated from switching." These researchers found in a study of more than 6,000 people that even 30 years after quitting cigarettes, those who took up cigars faced almost five times the nonsmoker's risk of developing lung cancer.

 CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE Cigar smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to develop chronic obstructive lung disease, although again the risk is lower than that of cigarette smokers. Several studies that followed smokers and nonsmokers over a period of years showed that cigar smokers face an increased risk of dying of lung disease that may be as much as 360 percent as high as the risk for nonsmokers. An autopsy study of the lungs of 1,443 men who died in six New York and New Jersey hospitals found that the rate of emphysema among cigar smokers was five times that of nonsmokers.

 HEART AND BLOOD VESSEL DISEASE Nicotine, the addictive drug released when any tobacco product is used, does not have to be inhaled to damage the heart and blood vessels. Nicotine can be absorbed into the blood stream through the mouth. This drug speeds up the heart and constricts blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the heart. Two European studies showed an increased risk of heart attacks in cigar smokers, and a study of 25,000 men in Sweden found that cigar smokers were five times as likely as nonsmokers to die from a ruptured aorta, the body's main artery. And a study of 7,700 men showed a threefold increased risk of stroke among cigarette smokers who switched to cigars.

 PASSIVE CIGAR SMOKE According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the sidestream smoke from cigars is a more insidious poison than that from cigarettes. Particle emissions, which include carcinogens, from one cigar exceeded those from three cigarettes, and carbon monoxide emissions were 30 times as high.
When a cigar is smoked in an office, the agency's standard of 9 parts carbon monoxide per million parts of air can be exceeded in 20 minutes.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Fades a Bit, but Home Resales Rise

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Although consumer confidence waned a bit in May, many professional forecasters remain upbeat about the economy, seeing no recession at least through next year.
And despite rising mortgage rates, sales of previously owned homes rose five-tenths of 1 percent in April to the second-highest level on record, a real estate trade group reported. 
 The unexpectedly strong housing report renewed concerns in financial markets that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates to slow the economy to avoid fueling inflationary pressures.
But the consensus of 38 professional forecasters calls for moderate economic growth and low inflation through 1997, David Berson, president of the National Association of Business Economists, said in releasing the survey taken this month.
"Unemployment will remain fairly stable for the next year and a half," said Mr. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association.
Consumers were less upbeat.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, reported that consumer confidence weakened in May for the first time this year as expectations about business conditions, job prospects and income growth slipped.
Fewer respondents expect job prospects to improve and fewer believe their incomes will rise, the board said in releasing its survey of 5,000 households nationwide.
The board's consumer confidence index fell to 101.2 this month, down from a revised 104.8 reading in April, which was a six-year high.
The high level of confidence during April helped push up sales of existing single-family homes for the third consecutive month, the National Association of Realtors said.
Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.22 million in April, the association said, second only to the rate of 4.26 million in December 1993. Many economists had expected sales to dip to about 4.04 million.
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.93 percent in April, up from 7.62 percent in March, but rates were well below the 8.62 percent of April 1995, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported.
But rates have now risen above 8 percent, and analysts said the higher borrowing costs might be starting to curb housing activity.
Cheryl Katz, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York, noted that only the Northeast had higher sales, which she said might reflect a rebound from weather-depressed activity during the winter.
"Given the lack of activity in the other regions, the housing sector may finally be showing signs of slowing due to the rise in interest rates," she said.
The realtors' association said it expected existing-home sales to fall from their March-April pace but remain strong through the summer.
In the survey of business forecasters, the consensus was for 2.2 percent economic growth this year, up from the 1.9 percent prediction of February..
But growth in gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of the nation's economic health -- would decelerate slightly to 2.1 percent in 1997, according to the survey. The G.D.P. grew 2 percent in 1995.
Mr. Berson said the forecasters expected inflation to rise 2.9 percent this year and 3 percent in 1997.

HEADLINE: U.S. Warning 3 Foreign Companies Over Investments in Cuba

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will send letters Wednesday advising private companies in Mexico, Canada and Italy that they may be subject to punitive action because of investments in Cuba, American officials said today.
The letters will be the first actions taken to carry out legislation intended to punish companies that use properties confiscated by Cuba from American citizens or corporations. 
 The letters will be sent to Grupo Domos, a Mexican telephone company; Stet, an Italian telephone company; and Sherritt International Corporation, a Canadian company that mines nickel and cobalt in eastern Cuba, said officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Other companies are also believed to be doing business on confiscated property, the officials said, but the initial advisory letters are being sent only to the most prominent concerns.
The two telephone companies are said to be operating on property owned by I.T.T. Sherritt is said to be using sites owned by Freeport-MacMoRan Inc. of New Orleans.
The companies will be informed that their investments in Cuba could mean that United States visas will be denied to their top officers, major shareholders and immediate family members.
The sanctions are allowed under legislation enacted March 12. It was sponsored by the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana. They said its primary goal is to discourage foreign investors in Cuba as a means of encouraging economic and political reform there.
The legislation has caused a storm in Canada and Mexico and among American allies in Europe. All contend that the United States has no right to dictate whether non-American companies can invest in Cuba.
Mexico's Foreign Minister, Jose Angel Gurria, recently called the legislation "a very, very dangerous precedent." Canada and Mexico say the legislation is a violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Cuba has given high priority to attracting foreign investment as a means of reversing its economic decline, which dates back to the collapse of Communist rule in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
In addition to denying visas, the legislation also gives Americans access to courts in the United States to sue foreign companies doing business on confiscated properties. It gives President Clinton the authority to waive the provision at intervals of six months if he concludes it to be in the national interest. Mr. Clinton has until July 15 to decide whether to exercise his waiver authority.
As for the visa denial provision, the officials said, foreigners subject to terms of the provision will be formally notified in about a month that they will no longer be eligible to hold or to obtain United States visas. They would then have 45 days in which to divest themselves of the properties or file an appeal.
If they are found to be in violation after the 45 days, their names will be placed on a customs "watch list" at all ports of entry.
Initially, the Clinton Administration opposed most provisions of Helms-Burton because of the opposition of allies. But it had a change of heart in February after Cuba shot down two Miami-based private planes belonging to a Cuban exile group over international waters north of Cuba.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A stock index of black-owned companies has been soaring.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin 

 BODY:
IT certainly is not as well known as older, well- established cousins like the Standard & Poor's 500 index or the Dow Jones industrial average, but for the last 18 months a little-noticed market measure has outstripped the performance of both.
Inaugurated in December 1994, and available on Bloomberg Financial Markets, the Bloomberg/Color of Money index tracks the performance of nine publicly traded companies that are owned and operated by African-Americans. 
 None of these companies, which collectively had revenue of less than $500 million last year, is a household name. But investors more concerned about results than fame would do well to consider that so far this year the index of these stocks has risen 39.3 percent, compared with a gain of 11.6 percent in the Dow and a 9.1 percent rise in the S.& P. 500. Since its inception, the index has performed even better relative to better-known peer groups.
From the end of December 1994 through yesterday, the Bloomberg/Color of Money index is up 92.8 percent, versus a 46.4 percent rise in the S.& P. 500 and 48.9 percent rise in the Dow.
Kelvin Boston, who produces "The Color of Money," a personal finance show syndicated on Black Entertainment Television and PBS, was a moving force in creating the index. He found a willing collaborator in Burton Waddy, a media syndication executive at Bloomberg.
The connection with Bloomberg offers a vehicle through which "traders and investors can get an idea about what is happening with publicly traded African-American companies," Mr. Boston said.
Mr. Boston, a former financial planner for IDS/ American Express, added that "most African-Americans have been taught that investing in stocks is like gambling. That is just not true, and through the index we will be able to share with the public some exciting stories."
Two of the nine stocks in the index, United American Healthcare and BET Holdings, the parent company of Black Entertainment Television, trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Two others, Pyrocap International and American Shared Hospital Services, are on the American Stock Exchange. The remaining five -- Envirotest Systems, Carver Federal Savings Bank, Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Granite Broadcasting and Ault -- are on Nasdaq.
Some of these companies have produced staggering returns so far this year.
Pyrocap, a tiny specialty chemical manufacturer, has seen its stock price double so far this year; that run came after a two-month suspension from trading on the American Stock Exchange that ended Feb. 15. And shares of Ault, a designer and manufacturer of external power supplies and battery chargers, have surged almost 240 percent.
But others have not done as well, despite the rally in the stock market this year. Carver Federal is off more than 12 percent on the year while Caraco Pharmaceutical is down 19 percent.
To guard against big swings in the index when some of the larger-capitalized stocks like BET Holdings and Granite Broadcasting made big moves, the nine companies in the index have been given the same statistical weighting. (The Dow and S.& P. 500 are weighted by size or capitalization, the price times the number of shares.)
But this equal weighting also allowed a low-priced stock like Pyrocap to push the index a lot higher with a relatively small price move in dollars. Pyrocap's jump this year is based on a move from $1.1875, to $2.375 yesterday. Five of the stocks were trading at less than $5 a share at the beginning of the year and four still are.
While part of the impetus behind the index's creation was to further the financial education of African-Americans and other minorities, there are other, more hard-boiled reasons as well.
"I see this as a business decision," said Tony Chapelle, publisher and editor of Securities Pro, a monthly newsletter that tracks developments relating to minority-owned and operated businesses. "For a variety of reasons, investors have a need to know about various market niches. And there are investors out there who have clients who are predisposed to investing in black-owned companies."
Mr. Chapelle said that liquidity was a problem with some companies in the index, given their small size, and that could make it harder to trade the stocks. "To be sure, there is some risk," he said. "Don't jump in unless you have done the necessary research."
Steve Washington, a portfolio supervisor to the American Diversity Growth Trust, a unit investment trust that invests in a combination of African-American owned companies and companies that make products popular with minority consumers, has made investments in the five biggest stocks in the index -- BET, Caraco, Granite, United American Health and Carver Federal.
"This trust was set up to capitalize on the economic and demographic growth of minority populations," he said. "Minority populations and urban consumers are growing faster than the population as a whole. That is a legitimate theme for any investor, and can add to the performance of your portfolio."

HEADLINE: Spreading the Economic Word;
Black Pulpits, a White Businessman and Buying Power

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
Strong in faith but weak in economic leverage, prominent black church leaders are joining hands with a little-known white conservative businessman in a secular alliance to cash in on black spending power.
Five denominations representing more than 15 million members -- nearly half of America's black population -- will use the power of 43,000 pulpits next month to urge their flocks to buy products and services endorsed by the Revelation Corporation of America, the for-profit merchandising creation of John B. Lowery, a Memphis developer. 
 If substantial numbers of parishioners heed the call, Mr. Lowery said, Revelation could quickly become a highly profitable public company controlled by church leaders, who have pledged the corporation's income to the cause of black home ownership.
According to the plan, substantial sums also would be funneled to local churches whose members buy the food products, durable goods, travel packages, auto and home financing and insurance that will be offered through Revelation. And Mr. Lowery, without apology, says he hopes to reap a personal fortune, as well.
"If I make any money, that means the churches will be making a lot more," the 40-year-old entrepreneur said. His company, Lowery-Riggan Inc., holds 30 percent of Revelation's stock and controls three of 10 board seats, while the five participating denominations own 70 percent of the stock and hold seven seats. Mr. Lowery said Revelation would charge no membership fees and would stand or fall on its ability to convince buyers that they were being offered bargains.
Backers praise Revelation as an opportunity to revive deteriorating minority communities, where little mortgage money is available. But already, detractors are asking uncomfortable questions about the project. They question the wisdom of associating mainstream black churches with a little-known business operator with no experience in mass-marketing. And they worry that steering blacks to Revelation's corporate partners could harm established black businesses like insurance companies and car dealerships.
The National Baptist Convention, U.S.A.; the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church; the American Methodist Episcopal Zion Church; the National Baptist Convention of America, and the Progressive Baptist Convention have all joined the marketing plan.
But the three other major denominations belonging to the Congress of National Black Churches have declined to take part. Bishop John Hurst Adams of the African Methodist Episcopal Church is an outspoken opponent. "I think it is inappropriate for black churches to turn their constituents over to a white businessman about whom we know so little," he said. "I do not view a project that enriches whites as a form of black empowerment. The first and most glaring reservation I have is, 'Who is this John Lowery?' "
While the answer to that question is complicated, in part because of Mr. Lowery's past connections, the bishops who have signed on with Revelation say they are impressed by his business acumen. In the five months since Revelation's plans were announced, the Memphis developer says, he has persuaded several major corporations to take part as vendors, including the Progressive Insurance Company of Cleveland, which will write auto insurance, and several more are waiting in the wings. By June 17, he said church members will be able to dial an "800" number to register with Revelation, and starting Aug. 1, five million Revelation coupon books will be distributed to them, each containing 50 discount coupons on food and other household and toiletry items redeemable at neighborhood groceries. New books will be handed out every month, and a sample catalogue of products and gifts will be available by Christmas, he said.
"We're charging our advertisers $10 per 1,000 coupons to be in our books," he said. "Our cost is $3 per 1,000, which means Revelation collects $7 on every 1,000 coupons issued even if not a single coupon is redeemed." By that formula, Revelation would earn a minimum of $21 million on coupons this year, he said.
If things go well, Mr. Lowery calculated Revelation could take in $126 million in the first 24 months of operation, with expenses totaling only $6 million because the corporate partners would bear most of the costs. One-third of the net would go to participating local churches and the balance to the corporation's building fund to help people acquire low-interest mortgages for new homes or commercial buildings in black neighborhoods.
Membership-based marketing is hardly new. CUC International Inc. in Stamford, Conn., is probably the biggest commercial provider of discounted goods and services, with 46 million members; its "Entertainment" coupon books are popular fund-raisers for churches and other groups. And Mr. Lowery says he is patterning Revelation on the American Association of Retired Persons, the Washington-based nonprofit group representing more than 33 million older Americans. The A.A.R.P. earned $146 million in commissions in 1994 by lending its name to insurance and other programs sold to its members.
Black churches have always played significant political and social roles in the lives of their members, but their economic initiatives for decades were generally limited to matters like burial funds and financial help for widows and orphans.
Outside the church, attempts to organize national self-help groups had checkered histories. Booker T. Washington's National Negro Business League, formed to aid small black businesses, met resistance from both whites and black leaders like W. E. B. Du Bois, who objected to Washington's acceptance of racial segregation.
Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association attracted a large following in the 1920's with its message of economic self-reliance and racial pride, but it fell apart after Garvey's conviction on mail-fraud charges. His ideas continued to influence political thought and church-based sects, however, notably black separation groups like the Nation of Islam, which operates a number of retail stores in an attempt to keep money circulating inside black communities.
Now, the chronic economic problems of inner cities and growing skepticism that government can improve conditions have focused black church leaders' energy on economic development.
"Traditionally, the black church has preached salvation and hope," said William H. Graves, Presiding Bishop of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the five denominations taking part in Revelation. "The time has come to help with the economic self-empowerment that Martin Luther King Jr., talked about."
The idea for Revelation grew out of a four-year collaboration between Mr. Lowery and Bishop Graves to put up housing on weed-choked fields owned by Mr. Graves's church in Memphis, the town where King was murdered in 1968. With banks' being unwilling to finance development of the site and property taxes' going unpaid, the land was threatened by foreclosure. Mr. Lowery negotiated a deal under which his company, would build three-bedroom houses, with the city helping to finance down payment loans for buyers.
The project's success -- Lowery-Riggan has put up 190 homes so far -- prompted the two men to discuss setting up a for-profit business that would help low-income blacks get housing, Mr. Lowery said. In time, they drew up a proposal for the creation of Revelation and, last year, took it to the Congress of National Black Churches.
And while some church leaders harbored doubts, others, like Dr. Henry J. Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., saw more hope than threat. "John Lowery came to us with a workable plan, asking for no capital from us and offering great potential," said Mr. Lyons, who holds the unpaid position of president of the new venture.
There is little in Mr. Lowery's background to suggest he would become a champion of black self-help. He grew up in the semirural reaches of Colliersville, a distant suburb populated by white-flight refugees from Memphis. His chief business partner in Lowery-Riggan, which he says grossed $50 million last year, is his former father-in-law, Charlie Riggan, a rough-cut Oldsmobile dealer in Colliersville.
Mr. Riggan, a large, gregarious man who favors bright Hawaiian shirts and Hush Puppie shoes, keeps a collector's one-shot derringer on his office desk behind the car showroom and regales his customers with rural witticisms likely to offend the politically correct.
In 1992, when a pending divorce from Mr. Riggan's daughter threatened to break up the business partnership, Mr. Lowery says, he took a leave of absence to run the district office of Representative Harold E. Ford, a black Democrat.
Though he was a conservative Republican who had never voted for a Democrat, he says, he was chosen for the job because of his money-raising skills and business contacts. He says he made his first million dollars by age 24 by building apartment houses and later developed hotel projects for two high-flying brothers in Tennessee banking, Jacob F. Butcher and C. H. Butcher. He met the Congressman at parties the Butchers were hosts for at University of Tennessee football games, he recalled.
After their banking network failed in 1983, the Butchers eventually went to prison for defrauding depositors of $20 million, and Representative Ford faced Federal charges of accepting bribes in the guise of $1.5 million in business loans from the brothers. Mr. Ford's first trial ended with a hung jury. By 1992, when Mr. Lowery went to work for him, the Congressman was raising money to pay the huge costs of an impending second trial in which he was acquitted.
Mr. Lowery makes no bones about concluding that anyone who found a way to tap the "last great financial frontier" -- black spending power -- stood to make a lot of money. "When I really started thinking about it, I saw it held a lot of economic promise for John Lowery," he cheerfully acknowledged
He says he has invested $1.2 million from his own pocket in Revelation's start-up costs. And he has recruited two heavy hitters to help organize the new company: Prudential Securities Inc., the investment-banking unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, to act as financial adviser; and the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, a unit that the General Motors Corporation is spinning off, to create a computer system.
Besides Progressive Insurance, which signed a contract with Revelation last month, Mr. Lowery said he expects to reach agreement soon with the Norwest Mortgage Company of Des Moines to handle home mortgages.
Some black leaders say they could not care less about Mr. Lowery's race, politics or money-making ambitions. What matters, they say, is whether he can deliver to the black community. Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that with Federal dollars drying up for social programs, the black community is forced to choose pragmatism over ideology. "Right now we need people who are doers, so we've put aside political badges," he said in a telephone interview.
Others caution that the alliance faces entrenched obstacles. Dr. C. Eric Lincoln, professor emeritus of religion and culture at Duke University, pointed out that black ministers and their congregations were famously independent.
"Even if it's a good idea, even if it's logical, it will not fly unless it has strong local support," Dr. Lincoln said. "The church is the last institution blacks control and no white is going to be allowed to be seen as running the place."

HEADLINE: A U.S. Firm Is Said to Deal With a Serb Tied to Crimes

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 28

 BODY:
The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, may not have many friends left in the outside world, but he apparently has a few in the American accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick.
Bosnian Serb leaders say a subsidiary of the firm signed a "mutual cooperation" contract this month in Pale, the Serbian stronghold, with Dr. Karadzic, who has been indicted on war-crimes charges. 
 The reported contract, the amount of which was not disclosed, is aimed at jumpstarting the moribund economy in Serbian-held Bosnia. The contract, if it goes into effect with the current Bosnian Serb political leadership still in place, would defy calls by the Clinton Administration to shun those leaders.
The reported deal would help in rebuilding the area's infrastructure, including revamping of the road network and establishing a rail link that will run through the narrow Posovina Corridor, which links the two main parts of Serbian-held Bosnia. Much of the effort will center around repairing the hydroelectric system.
The American consulting firm Barents Group, a subsidiary of KPMG Peat Marwick based in Washington, along with the Swiss firm Interchem Investments, based in Zug, signed agreements after two days of discussions this month, Bosnian Serb leaders say.
Reached by telephone in New York today, KPMG Peat Marwick said any agreements had been put on hold until the leadership dispute in Serbian-held Bosnia was clarified.
Referring to the self-styled Serbian republic in Bosnia, Peat Marwick said in a statement that Barents "will not undertake any privatization work in Srpska until the government leadership issue in that country is resolved and a leadership acceptable to the international community is in place." It added, "Barents Group is interested in working in Srpska, consistent with the Dayton accords and the suspension of sanctions by the U.S. Government to support efforts to rebuild the region."
Late today, Peat Marwick said in another statement, "Barents Group is not performing any work and will not do business with the current regime in Srpska."
Bosnian Serb officials, who said today that they were not aware of any suspension, praised the contracts as an important step in the creation of a separate, viable Bosnian Serb economy.
"Everything is going ahead, as far as we know," said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The agreements, if carried out, are significant not only because they would start to rebuild the war-ravaged area, but also because of the veneer of respectability they would confer on Dr. Karadzic, whom the Clinton Administration would like to force from power.
"These are two very important agreements for us," the Bosnian Serb leader told a gathering of Serbian officials this month, according to a tape of the announcement of the deal obtained today in Pale. "We believe our drive to privatize and develop in the coming months will increase with the help of these companies, which have worldwide experience."
"We want to privatize," Dr. Karadzic said. "We want to achieve an effective, free society and a free economy. KPMG will help us to establish a new methodology for our privatization."
The president of the Swiss company, Berndt Robertz, reached by telephone in Switzerland, defended his company's deal. And Swiss diplomats said there was nothing illegal about the contract he signed.
Mr. Robertz said it was too early to tell how large the contract would be and what equipment would be supplied. "We are not making contracts with single people, but governments," he said. "We make agreements to help people. We handle medical supplies and do some engineering and consultancy work. We do not supply military equipment."
Dr. Karadzic said the initial focus of the effort would be the hydroelectric system.
On the tape, Dr. Karadzic said: "We can start today to rebuild a hydroelectric plant with 1,200 megawatts. This plant alone is worth $1.2 billion. One of the best investments in the world is an investment in the hydoelectric facilities in Republic of Srpska. The investment will be paid back in three and a half years."
Among the other projects discussed with the two companies were the refurbishing of oil refineries and pipelines in Modrica, a town in Serbian-held Bosnia.
"The thing that is the most important for us now is to connect our country's infrastructure," Dr. Karadzic said on the tape. "This will enable us to develop in all of the Republic of Srpska."

HEADLINE: A Dominican Everyman As Unlikely Movie Hero

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
For almost a year, they've been lining up outside theaters, often ignoring tropical downpours, to see the film that has captivated this entire country. Residents of some isolated peasant villages have even strung up sheets in the town square and rented projectors so that they, too, can see "Nueba Yol."
But the movie, said to be the most popular in the history of the Dominican Republic, is as much a New York production as a local one. Shot both here and in Manhattan, it is the tale of a naive and befuddled Dominican immigrant's bittersweet experiences in a foreign city, where, he is told, "you can pick up dollars like heads of lettuce." 
 For moviegoers here, the sheer novelty of a film that features Dominicans in sympathetic leading roles and not as criminals, servants or other marginal figures is perhaps its strongest selling point. Like the Dominican immigrants who have cheered the film in New York, they are shocked to find one of their own portrayed as no less heroic than a Sylvester Stallone or an Arnold Schwarzenegger character.
"People here are not accustomed to seeing themselves in movies, so they feel that going to see this one is a patriotic act," said Luisito Marti, the popular Dominican comedian who plays Orodoto Balbuena, the movie's protagonist. "I think they have taken to it because they feel 'this is ours.' "
The character Mr. Marti plays in "Nueba Yol," which takes its title from the local mispronunciation of "New York" (noo-AY-bah YOLE) is one of the most familiar and beloved in this Caribbean nation of 7.5 million people. Since 1982, Balbuena has been a regular in comedy sketches on a popular television program called "The Noon Show," always scheming to get to the United States, but inevitably meeting with frustration at the very last moment.
The prospect of finally seeing Balbuena reach the land of his dreams was irresistible to his fans here and in New York, where the bulk of the scenes were filmed. Once word got out about what Mr. Marti and Angel Muniz, who wrote and directed "Nueba Yol," were up to, Dominican immigrants in Washington Heights eagerly offered their apartments and their advice.
"The level of enthusiasm was so high that sometimes when we were in New York we had to stop filming right in the middle of scenes," Mr. Marti said over lunch here. "Dominicans would be walking by and suddenly get all choked up to see that Balbuena had finally made it to New York, so they'd barge right into the scene to embrace me."
Balbuena, Mr. Marti said, is a kind of Dominican everyman, which is precisely the source of his appeal. "In every barrio of every city in the Dominican Republic there are Balbuenas," he said. "He's the guy who dreams of bettering himself but hasn't been given the chance to study, who survives by the grace of the Holy Spirit and thinks his only chance of not dying in complete poverty is getting to New York, where he will do any kind of honorable work, no matter how dirty or demanding, to make a living."
As many as a million Dominicans have made their way to the United States over the last 30 years. "It's hard to find a Dominican without a relative who lives in New York," Mr. Marti said. So Balbuena's misadventures, which end with his returning to a little house here, chastened but unbowed, resonate widely here.
"It's very funny and at the same time very real," said Fabio Fleury, who recently returned after a sojourn of 14 years in the United States, most of it spent parking cars at a Manhattan garage. "It captures that feeling of wanting a better life but ending up in a place that doesn't belong to you, which was exactly what happened to me."
"Nueba Yol" evolved out of a chance meeting a couple of years ago at Newark International Airport, which found Mr. Muniz enthusiastically pushing the idea of a feature film on a doubtful Mr. Marti. ("I thought he was out of his head," the comedian admitted.) From the start, both men agreed that the theme had to be immigration, a subject that had long been on Mr. Muniz's mind and that he knew from personal experience.
"The first time I left the Dominican Republic, I was 16, and thought I was on my way to Hollywood to be an actor," said Mr. Muniz, who is 36. But he was stopped by immigration officials in Puerto Rico and forced to return here, where he worked as an actor, writer and director for Dominican television.
He eventually made his way to New York, where he discovered that he could not learn English "because you would go to school for one hour, and then speak Spanish for 23 hours a day." So he moved to Holland, Mich., where he lived with a cousin, enrolled in a community college and two months later met his wife, Dawn, whom he described as "an all-American girl from the Midwest."
Some of the funniest moments in the movie, Mr. Muniz somewhat sheepishly admits, are based on incidents he recalled from his own days as a newcomer in New York. In one typical replication of the culture shock that Mr. Muniz went through, Balbuena hears the buzzing of an apartment intercom, but thinks it is a fire alarm and flies into a state of panic; another scene shows him almost getting arrested in a drug raid because of language difficulties.
"A lot of the scenes were autobiography," said Mr. Muniz, who now lives in a Philadelphia suburb and speaks fluent English. "When I was writing, I went back to my own experience, my own feeling of dislocation, a lot. So it was really Balbuena interpreting me."
For his part, Mr. Marti said the success he had long enjoyed as a performer, first as a percussionist in the orchestra of the merengue star Johnny Ventura and then as a singer and comedian, meant that "I have been privileged never to have to abandon my country." But in portraying Balbuena he was able to draw on the experiences of a sister, various aunts and uncles, cousins and, above all, his own father.
"I'm from a poor family, and like 99 percent of all Dominicans who leave the country, my dad wanted to improve our economic condition," Mr. Marti said. "Like the majority of Dominicans, he also dreamed of coming back here and buying a little house for himself. But he ended up working at the Taft Hotel for nearly 20 years, and he died in New York."
Using the movie's success in New York, where it had a nine-week run, as a lure, Mr. Muniz is working on deals to have "Nueba Yol" shown elsewhere: it is now playing in Miami and New England, and is to open in Phoenix in early June, and Texas, California and Chicago in the summer.
"I started making this movie for Dominicans, and hoped that if other groups would go see it, it would turn out to be contagious," he said. The response has convinced him that he was right, he said, and that he can now make other movies about immigration.
"In movie terms, this is a subject that has barely been scratched, so I want to do a trilogy in Spanish before moving on to making movies in English," Mr. Muniz said. "Just waiting for a bus in Manhattan with someone, you can hear the most amazing stories."

Nissan Posts $814 Million Loss for Year

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 28

 BODY:
The Nissan Motor Company reported today that its group net loss narrowed in the latest fiscal year, and the company and analysts said they expected a return to profitability this year as conditions improved at troubled foreign operations.
Results for the parent company alone, which reflect operations in Japan, recovered strongly in the latest fiscal year. But losses in Mexico and Europe pulled down group results, which reflect all the company's operations. 
 Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker, said its group net loss narrowed to 88.42 billion yen, or $814 million, in the year ended March 31, from 166.05 billion yen in the prior fiscal year. Group sales rose 3.5 percent, to 6.039 trillion yen from 5.834 trillion yen.
Helped by healthy sales in Japan of Nissan's newly remodeled cars, the parent company recorded net income of 3.63 billion yen, in contrast to a loss of 61.04 billion yen a year earlier.
"Returning to group net profit is our major business target for this year," said Nissan's managing director, Koichi Takagi.
Company officials and outside analysts said that goal was achievable. Helped by a stabilizing peso, the Mexican subsidiary is expected to record a profit for the year. And the European operation is also beginning to move toward a recovery.
Nissan said that the parent company's auto sales rose 4.5 percent in the fiscal year, to about 1.76 million units, although exports fell slightly. The company expects domestic auto sales to rise 3.4 percent in the current fiscal year.
Aiding the increase in Japanese sales was the new Cedric/Gloria luxury car series, whose unit sales climbed 14 percent. Nissan released seven new models during the year. At the same time, it cut production costs, resulting in savings of about 140 billion yen, Mr. Takagi said.
"The parent company has completely left the darkness of the tunnel," Akira Tanaka, an analyst for the Yamaichi Research Institute, said. "Now everything depends on the recovery of Mexico and Europe."
Mr. Tanaka said he agreed with the company's forecast that the Mexican unit, which incurred a loss of 35 billion yen in the latest year, would swing to a moderate profit, "unless something weird happens to the peso." The subsidiary was hit by the peso's plunge in late 1994 and the subsequent Mexican economic contraction.
Nissan said that production at the Mexican plant was rising as the company increased exports to the United States.
Nissan reported a loss of 65 billion yen from its operation in Europe, where the yen's strength and restructurings by European auto makers have eroded the competitive edge of Japanese manufacturers.
In order to lessen the debt burden of the Spanish unit, Nissan Motor Iberica S.A., and help finance a restructuring, Nissan provided capital to the subsidiary during the fiscal year.
With the remodeling of its main European Primera automobile in September, Nissan hopes to set off a recovery in sales and profits in the region. "I don't think we can get rid of the loss during the current year, but we definitely want to do it next year," Mr. Takagi said.

HEADLINE: Suit Says Racial Bias Led to Clustering of Solid-Waste Sites

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 28

 BODY:
In a rare test of Federal civil rights law, a group of residents in Chester, Pa., sued the State of Pennsylvania today, accusing its environmental agency of discrimination for concentrating the city's waste-processing sites in their black-majority neighborhood.
The complaint, filed in Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, argues that in granting permits for five waste treatment centers and transfer stations in their community since 1987, the state has violated the equal-protection laws of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In the same period, the state has granted permits for two other plants in two predominantly white areas outside Chester, in Delaware County. 
 In Delaware County, neighborhoods with black majorities have eight commercial-waste sites, and predominantly white neighborhoods have three.
"This is environmental racism," said Jerome Balter, a lawyer with the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia who represents the plaintiffs. "In granting permits, the state never inquired into the nature of the community or the number of other facilities in the area."
While a growing number of community groups around the country have claimed discrimination in recent environmental lawsuits against states and corporations, experts in environmental law say this is one of perhaps only three instances in which a state has been sued under Federal civil rights law by plaintiffs who accuse the state of violations in the permit-granting process.
Neither of the other two cases has gone to trial. One of the cases, in Michigan, involves a wood-burning plant; a partial settlement was reached in February that resulted in reduced operations at the plant and more monitoring of the plant for compliance with emission standards. The other case, in North Carolina, involves a waste-water plant; that lawsuit was dismissed in 1993 and was refiled two months ago.
"Our case only involved one facility," said Kary L. Moss, director of the Maurice and Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, a nonprofit civil rights organization in Detroit involved in the case against the wood-burning plant. "But the Chester case may be the first one involving a group of facilities." The center represented residents of Genessee County, Mich., against the state and the Genessee Power Company, the plant's owner.
The Chester lawsuit makes no claims of adverse health effects suffered by residents living near the plants, even though the plaintiffs cite statistics showing higher mortality rates in Chester, compared with all of Delaware County. It says Chester residents make more complaints to the state about air pollution, compared with residents of other Delaware County communities.
Instead, the lawsuit argues a narrower issue, that when the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection granted an operating permit to a fifth waste-treatment plant in one Chester black-majority neighborhood, the residents suffered discrimination.
Under Federal guidelines, each state establishes its own emission standards, which become the Federal regulations for that state; those rules are enforced by a state agency. But because state environmental agencies get financial assistance from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, citizens have the right to sue under a 1984 regulation that says any jurisdiction receiving Federal E.P.A. money "shall not use criteria or methods of administering its program which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, national origin or sex."
A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Chris Novak, said that officials there would not comment until they had seen the lawsuit.
The Federal E.P.A. was not named as a defendant in the case.
Chester residents have been fighting with the State of Pennsylvania ever since Delaware County landfills began approaching capacity in the 1980's. Before 1987, only one treatment plant, Delcora Sewage, operated in a Census Bureau tract along the Delaware River that includes a neighborhood of small but neat row houses where some residents have lived for decades. That tract, less than half a square mile, has a population of 566, and almost three-quarters of the residents are black.
But by last year, state officials had granted permits to one transfer station and four disposal companies. The permit for the transfer station was later revoked. Thermal Pure Systems, which sterilized contaminated medical waste, recently ceased operations. And Soil Remediation Systems, the last to gain a permit, in 1995, has not yet begun construction.
But neighborhood residents say the combined effects of the four companies that still have the right to operate and the emissions that they generate when they are operating have made living in the area intolerable. They complain of constant sore throats, headaches, itchy skin and asthma.
"We have become acceptable risks," said Zulene Mayfield, one of 18 individual plaintiffs in the case and chairwoman of a group that is another plaintiff, Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living. "We do not have the comfort of our homes, and residents are tired of the noise, the smoke, the dirt and the trucks."
Even with only two plants currently operating, one a huge plant that burns trash six days a week, a walk through the neighborhood results in a nearly constant assault on the senses. The air is thick with acrid smells and, often, smoke. Dump trucks rumble through throughout the day, which residents say has caused structural damage to houses. Noisy locomotives that serve refineries a mile away run along a rail spur between the plants and the facing houses on Front Street. Conditions often force residents to flee inside from their front porches and seal their windows. Property values have plummeted.
"This used to be a really nice place to live, but now it's like living next to a nuclear plant," said King McDonald, a 65-year-old retired truck driver who has lived in the area for 30 years and is a plaintiff in the case.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PARTNERS IN ARKANSAS DEAL CONVICTED BY JURY

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 28

 BODY:
In the first trial of the Whitewater investigation, a jury today convicted President Clinton's former business partners of fraud and other crimes for a chain of bad loans issued by an Arkansas savings and loan association in the 1980's.
James B. McDougal, the owner of the savings association, was convicted on 18 felony counts, and his former wife, Susan, was convicted on four felony counts. The third defendant, Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas, was convicted on one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud, both felonies, and announced that he would resign by July 15 to prepare his appeals. As a result, the President's home state will now be governed by a Republican, Lieut. Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is also a candidate for the United States Senate. 
 The verdict, following a 12-week trial in which President Clinton and Mr. McDougal were the only witnesses to testify for the defense, was a victory for the staff of the Whitewater independent counsel just as it was coming under heavy criticism by supporters of the White House as being partisan.
The independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, said in a Washington news conference that he was "encouraged" by the verdict, the first in the 30-month-old Whitewater investigation, which remains open.
Before the McDougal-Tucker trial, the independent counsel had struck nine plea agreements, including one with former Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell, who admitted stealing from the law firm where he had worked with Hillary Rodham Clinton, and others with a string of minor figures, most of them associated with Mr. McDougal's savings association.
President Clinton said he accepted today's verdict and expressed personal sorrow for the defendants, a White House statement noted simply that Mr. Clinton had not been charged in the case. [Page B8.]
When the President was asked this evening whether the jurors had not believed him, he replied: "You ought to ask them that. I doubt that. I doubt that that's what was going on."
But the guilty verdicts were unwelcome news at the White House, which has recently had some success in leaving the matter behind for the Presidential campaign. Republicans quickly seized on the result.
"At 5 P.M. today, the cover-up began to unravel as Clinton's hometown jury found Clinton's partners guilty," said Speaker Newt Gingrich's spokesman, Tony Blankley, who called a reporter.
Moments after the verdict was announced, the nine women and three men who had deliberated for seven days left the crowded courtroom here, taking their tabbed loose-leaf notebooks and reams of heavily scribbled legal pads with them, along with any thoughts they may have had about the credibility of the President's two and a half hours of videotaped testimony.
In a statement read by a Federal marshal, the jurors said they wanted to assure the public that "we have served with pride and integrity."
While the defense had put great hopes in Mr. Clinton's testimony, the jurors' vote -- in which they accepted 24 of 30 counts -- seemed to indicate that it did not outweigh the all the evidence offered by the prosecution.
Several jurors said this evening that they believed the President's testimony and did not believe the testimony of David Hale, the main prosecution witness. Nonetheless, these jurors said, they voted for the convictions because there was so much evidence other than Mr. Hale's testimony that implicated the defendants.
"David Hale perjured himself on the witness stand," said Colin C. Capp, an automobile salesman on the jury. "The President totally discredited Hale's testimony. But the documentary evidence against the three was overwhelming."
Mr. Hale is a confessed felon who told the jurors that he had conspired with the McDougals and Mr. Tucker to issue fraudulent loans of about $3 million. Mr. Hale also said he had issued one of the Federally backed loans after Mr. Clinton had sought it, an accusation that the President adamantly denied.
Federal investigators revealed at the trial that almost $50,000 of the $300,000 loan Mr. Hale issued to Mrs. McDougal had ultimately wound up paying for expenses for the Whitewater land venture. On all the charges involving the loan in which Mr. Hale said the President had a role, the jury came back with guilty verdicts against the McDougals.
"I don't know if they disbelieved the President -- maybe they just didn't believe me, I don't know," Mr. McDougal said on the courthouse steps.
In his comments, Mr. Starr played down the significance of Mr. Hale's testimony by noting that the case had been built primarily on a complicated paper trail.
"We obviously are gratified by the verdict," he told reporters outside his office building, across the street from the Justice Department. "It was an elaborate documentary case, not just a testimonial case, and that required dutiful attention."
Mr. Starr has had to fend off criticism in recent weeks about his continuing to work as a private lawyer while also running this case. He seemed to have that criticism in mind when he said today that his role in the office had not been to make all decisions unilaterally.
"What we have instituted in this office, as I have said publicly before, is a very careful, elaborate, deliberative process," Mr. Starr said. "It is not the judgment of one individual. It is the judgment of a group of professionals."
Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican candidate for President, was cautious in his response to the verdict. "I haven't commented on Whitewater since Day 1, so I won't comment on today's whatever," Mr. Dole said today. "I've just sort of stayed out of it. The White House has been saying, 'D'Amato, Dole, all this stuff,' and I have never made any comment."
Not all Republicans were so restrained. Mr. Blankley said, "It is a black night at spin control central in the White House."
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who has served as chairman of a committee investigating Whitewater, said tonight: "For those who said that there's no there there, the verdict in Little Rock says that they're wrong. It validates the work of the committee and its efforts to uncover how it is that millions and millions of taxpayers' money was lost in a system that benefited political cronies."
Under a compromise worked out between the Republicans and Democrats in Senate, Mr. D'Amato's committee must complete its work next month, and the Senator said he would hold to that agreement.
"We're going to conclude our work by June 14, and the report will be made available on the 17th," he said.
Senator D'Amato said the verdict showed "that there is more to that than just being political."
For Mr. Clinton, the first sitting President since Gerald R. Ford to provide testimony in a criminal case, the spectacle of his participation so concerned him that he ordered his lawyers to take steps in court to prevent the public release of his videotaped deposition.
But the outcome today is not expected to be the last time Mr. Clinton will have to testify in a case brought by Mr. Starr, as defendants in a second case, set to begin in June, have already issued a subpoena for the President's testimony. In that case, the owners of a small Arkansas bank that held deposits of Mr. Clinton's have been accused of hiding contributions to several campaigns, including Mr. Clinton's campaign.
Mr. Clinton is expected to be questioned in that case about his 1990 decision to appoint one of the bankers to the Arkansas Highway Commission, a plum patronage post. That banker is accused of hiding illegal campaign contributions before that appointment.
Other aspects of Mr. Starr's inquiry also remain open. For example, he is still reviewing the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of some billing records from Mrs. Clinton's former law firm in early 1994, records that had been sought by investigators. A White House aide said she had found the records in the book room of the White House residence, a few paces from Mrs. Clinton's office, in August 1995. They were turned over to investigators this year, nearly two years after the first subpoena was issued for them.
Mr. McDougal had once been a close political ally and business partner of Mr. Clinton. But in the last four years, he has been a source of political difficulty. He drew the President into the case by obtaining a subpoena requiring Mr. Clinton to testify in order to challenge the credibility of Mr. Hale, a pivotal player in most of the counts against the defendants.
Six of those counts concerned an improper $300,000 loan Mr. Hale had issued in 1986 to Mrs. McDougal through his Federally backed company, Capital Management Services.
Investigators have said nearly $50,000 of the loan wound up paying the expenses for the 230-acre Ozarks land venture at the juncture of Crooked Creek and the White River that Mr. McDougal named Whitewater. Federal regulations at the time permitted Mr. Hale to approve such loans only for economically disadvantaged borrowers, under a Federal program.
Mr. Hale testified that he had issued the loan after it had been requested by Mr. Clinton and that the Governor had insisted that his name not appear on any documents in the transaction. Mr. Hale also said that Mr. McDougal had sought that loan and others to take care of the "political family" in Arkansas.
Mr. Clinton was called to refute Mr. Hale's testimony and raise questions about his character. Defense lawyers calculated that the jury would decide to take the word of the President over that of an admitted felon who is about to enter prison.
On the last day of the trial, after Mr. McDougal had testified for two days, defense lawyers played the testimony of the President. Videotaped a few days earlier in the room in the White House where Roosevelt had in another era charted the course of World War II, Mr. Clinton steadfastly denied that he had ever discussed any business with Mr. Hale.
Prosecutors had accused the McDougals and Mr. Hale of a variety of fraud violations involving a complex web of loans that prosecutors asserted had been intended to loot both the McDougals' savings association and Mr. Hale's investment company. Both institutions were backed by the Federal Government, and the losses from the two were ultimately borne by taxpayers.
During the trial, the prosecutor, W. Ray Jahn, sketched a portrait of a series of fraudulent land deals, typically at vastly inflated prices intended to generate false profits and through the use of front-men.
The fraudulent transactions included eight loans of more than $3 million from Madison and Capital Management in the 1980's. One of the central deals was an $825,000 loan that Madison, with the assistance of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Tucker, lent to an associate of Mr. Hale.
Mr. Tucker faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 for each count on which he was convicted. He is facing a second indictment on Federal bankruptcy fraud charges.
On each of 15 counts on which he was convicted, Mr. McDougal faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The other three counts carry a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
Mrs. McDougal also faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 on three of the counts against her, and two years in prison and a fine of $250,000 on the fourth count.
 Mr. Clinton was asked whether the jurors had not believed his videotaped testimony, in which he denied accusations by the Government's main witness, David Hale, that Mr. Clinton sought an improper loan when he was Governor of Arkansas.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 30, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the conviction of President Clinton's former business partners, in the first trial of the Whitewater investigation into a failed savings and loan association, omitted a word in some editions and thus misstated the question to which the President was responding when he said: "You ought to ask them that. I doubt that. I doubt that that's what was going on." (A related article, about the White House's response to the verdict, also reflected the error.)
