HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Tough Opera For Tough Times

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
Facing a sinking economy, opera companies and orchestras large and small across the United States report severe deficits and are starting to panic. As the directors of many of these institutions ponder what to do, one of their number, Pamela Rosenberg, the tenacious general director of the San Francisco Opera, is absolutely clear about what not to do.
 "We are not going to get through this economic downturn and come out the other end by replacing quality with mediocrity," Ms. Rosenberg, who has set the company on course to becoming America's most adventurous opera house, said in a recent telephone interview. "If we are going to be worthy of support, we have to make a difference in people's lives." 
 Companies that typically react to economic uncertainty by playing it safe and catering to subscribers would be wise to heed Ms. Rosenberg's example. Despite recent announcements from her office of dire budget deficits and cutbacks in some programming, she is determined to implement her bold artistic vision. 
To understand why her supporters are betting that she will prevail, consider how she came to this prominent post in the first place.
She didn't want the job when the opera's board approached her more than three years ago. Though an American, Ms. Rosenberg had spent most of her career, some 35 years, running houses in Europe. At the time she was winning praise and creating a buzz at the Stuttgart Opera in Germany for innovative programming rich in modernist fare, as well as for championing experimental directors and younger singers. For all its past glory, the San Francisco Opera had become stodgy, as Ms. Rosenberg said publicly. No matter what the board members were telling her, she doubted they truly wanted a shake-up. Moreover, accustomed to running a government-subsidized house, she didn't relish the prospect of fund-raising. But in the end the board convinced her.
On taking charge last year Ms. Rosenberg, 57, implemented "Animating Opera," a five-year creative plan to present series of works related to broad themes like "Outsiders or Pioneers?" And "Seminal Works of Modern Times." She reconstituted the rehearsal schedule to allow more time to prepare challenging operas, notably Messiaen's visionary, complex, five-hour "St. Francois d'Assise," which received its American stage premiere by the company in September in a hauntingly modern production. An impressive cast and inspired orchestra were under the direction of Donald Runnicles. 
Far from intimidating audiences "St. Francois" drew the strongest attendance figures of any San Francisco Opera production so far this season, even beating out "Turandot" with Jane Eaglen. The last three performances were sold out. 
And who was its biggest booster? Karl Mills, the president of the board. An investment adviser, Mr. Mills is an ebullient opera buff in his early 40's who, company officials report, attended five out of six performances of "St. Francois." 
"Actually, it was four and a half," he admitted in a recent interview. "I was so moved. Lots of people who had apprehensions were just blown away, not only by its artistic impact, but its spiritual impact. It left a void that is hard to imagine filling." 
 Asked whether convincing audiences to spend five hours at a modern opera was difficult, Mr. Mills responded, "It's better than five hours of watching CNBC these days; it's better than a lot of what people spend five hours on."
No sooner had the production closed when the announcement came that the company was saddled with a $7.7 million deficit on an operating budget of some $60 million for the year. Looked at in a national context, the gap was hardly out of line.
For the first time in a decade the acclaimed Cleveland Orchestra is in the red, by some $1.3 million, roughly the same as the deficit at the Philadelphia Orchestra. Despite showing profits for 14 out of the last 17 seasons, the Chicago Symphony is now $6 million in the hole. Some smaller institutions are facing catastrophe. The San Jose Symphony, which tried to stave off bankruptcy by canceling its 2002-3 season, recently announced that there was no choice but to dissolve after operating for 123 years.
Still, at the San Francisco Opera it did not help Ms. Rosenberg's mission when, after the deficits were made public, Mr. Mills was widely quoted as saying that the company would have to take "a more conservative view" in the future. But Mr. Mills said he was referring to budget projections and administrative costs, not to artistic plans and commissions. Ms. Rosenberg asserts that the cost of mounting the Messiaen had nothing to do with the shortfall from last season's budget. The debt, it would seem, is truly a case of "It's the economy stupid!"
San Francisco, once a center for blue chip corporations, was pummeled by the dot-com bust. Most foundations in the area reported 50 percent declines in their endowments, said Elizabeth Connell Nielsen, the opera company's director of public relations. The state's deficit forced a 60 percent cut in the California Arts Council budget. 
And Sept. 11 was especially debilitating for the San Francisco Opera because of the company's unusual schedule. Its house is shared with the San Francisco Ballet, and in 2001, 9 of 11 opera productions were performed between Sept. 9 and the end of November. 
Ms. Rosenberg rightly maintains that putting on challenging and unfamiliar recent works does not necessarily cost more than sticking with the standards. Naturally, the rehearsals involved eat up funds. But so would a grandly traditional production of "Aida." 
Out-of-town critics and opera buffs have been flocking to the city for intriguing offerings like the recent daring production of Janacek's "Kat'a Kabanova" with the soprano Karita Mattila in the title role. In an effort to keep the house full and attract new audiences, Ms. Rosenberg also instituted a student rush ticket policy that students have rushed to embrace: two hours before the performance any unsold seat goes for $15. "What we are doing here is not just good for the San Francisco Opera," Mr. Mills said. "It puts San Francisco artistically on the world stage; it's worth fighting for." 
Still, something had to give. So, reluctantly, Ms. Rosenberg has shelved two works for next season that would have been company firsts. A production of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Coq d'Or" from the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, which would have had to be boosted a bit with added choristers for San Francisco's larger War Memorial Opera House stage, will be replaced with the company's familiar David Hockney production of Mozart's "Magic Flute." And Achim Freyer's wildly inventive Stuttgart production of Weber's "Freischutz" is being canceled. These moves should save some $2 million.
Even with these cutbacks the season will still offer some unusual operas: Virgil Thomson's iconoclastic "Mother of Us All," Busoni's monumental "Doktor Faust," Janacek's wistful "Cunning Little Vixen" and Shostakovich's gritty "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk." This is not status-quo repertory. 
Ms. Rosenberg is staunchly committed to the "Animating Opera" series, which in the next few seasons will offer two daunting Berlioz works, the complete "Les Troyens" and "Benvenuto Cellini," as well as Janacek's seldom-heard "From the House of the Dead."
"The Faust Project," a series of operas that reflect the Faust legend, still includes a commissioned work from the composer Lewis Spratlan, who won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize in Music for a concert version of Act II of his opera "Life Is a Dream" (which has yet to be staged).
And on Dec. 11 Ms. Rosenberg announced the commissioning of "Doctor Atomic," an opera centered on J. Robert Oppenheimer, from the composer John Adams, the librettist Alice Goodman and the director Peter Sellars, the team that created "Nixon in China" and "The Death of Klinghoffer." The new work is scheduled for a 2005 premiere. 
In comparison the Lyric Opera of Chicago, a company with a larger endowment and a smaller deficit, is also dropping two works that would have been house firsts in a "pre-emptive strike," according to its recent announcement. But the Lyric is playing it safe, replacing "Benvenuto Cellini" with Gilbert & Sullivan's "Pirates of Penzance" and scrapping a Montemezzi rarity, "L'Amore dei Tre Re," for a Gounod war horse, "Faust."
One can only hope that the Lyric Opera isn't turning away from its bold recent history that includes presenting the premieres of two operas by William Bolcom; giving a second chance to Martin David Levy, whose "Mourning Becomes Electra" fizzled at its 1967 Metropolitan Opera premiere but sizzled in its revised version in 2000 at the Lyric; giving John Harbison's "Great Gatsby" a second hearing after its Metropolitan Opera premiere; and presenting a knockout production of Britten's "Billy Budd" last season.
It's interesting to note that the San Francisco Symphony, while having to contend with the same struggling economy as its neighboring opera company, is operating in the black. Why the difference?
For one thing the orchestra is a less expensive enterprise. Last season's budget was $45.5 million. But other factors are involved, said Karen Ames, the director of communications. Opera companies must plan four and five years in advance in order to secure the desired singers, directors and conductors. "We're not as hurt by an underperforming concert on an off week," Ms. Ames said. The next week may bring a surprise success, as happened recently when four performances of Wynton Marsalis's oratorio "All Rise" were a "massive sell out," Ms. Ames said. 
And the San Francisco Symphony's endowment, which is three times the size of its current annual budget, provides a cushion. The opera company's endowment is precariously low, just half the size of its operating budget.
Most important, the orchestra has a dynamic public persona in its conductor, Michael Tilson Thomas, who has won audiences to innovative programming that balances compelling performances of established repertory with lots of edgy, hip and important contemporary music. And Mr. Thomas, who arrived in 1995, had a crucial period during the boom years in which to introduce himself. Ms. Rosenberg always expected it would take her three or four years to reanimate audiences along with the company's repertory.
In the aftermath of 9/11, people everywhere, including some often-obtuse arts institutions, were compelled to ask critical questions: What is this organization here for? How is what we do relevant?
The economic downturn may compel company heads to ask these questions anew. "Especially in times like these," Ms. Rosenberg said, "challenging art can give people real sustenance; it can make people come together and think."

HEADLINE: Risky Korea Strategy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 If the United States is successful in its strategy of isolating North Korea ("U.S. Readies Plan to Raise Pressure on North Koreans," front page, Dec. 29), and actually brings that country to economic collapse, it is likely that the North Korean government will do what most dictatorial governments do in such a situation: it will start a war. 
 That would serve to distract the populace from their internal difficulties and give them the hope of plundering South Korea or, perhaps, Japan.

HEADLINE: Russia to Shut Monitoring By Europeans In Chechnya 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 31 

 BODY:
Russia announced today that it would shut down the mission in Chechnya of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ending any permanent international monitoring in the republic after the mission's mandate expires tonight. 
 Also today, a Russian military court acquitted an army colonel, Yuri D. Budanov, who was accused of murdering an 18-year-old woman in Chechnya nearly three years ago. The move ended a long, contentious trial that was considered a test of the country's willingness to prosecute abuses by the military. 
 Representatives of the 55-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation, which is devoted to managing conflicts and other crises across Europe and Central Asia, negotiated intensely to renew the mission. But Russian officials insisted that the mandate be limited to providing relief aid. 
The small mission, in the northwestern Chechen city of Znamenskoye, has overseen dozens of relief and economic projects, but the group has also criticized Russian forces for abuses against civilians.
Human Rights Watch in New York said the Russian decision, following the closure of Chechen refugee camps in the Russian region bordering Chechnya, "raises serious human rights concerns."
"Closing down the O.S.C.E. mission is part of Russia's strategy to cut off scrutiny of human rights conditions in Chechnya and portray the situation as normalizing," said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch.
Rights advocates in Russia were similarly dismayed over the acquittal of Colonel Budanov, which followed a finding by psychiatrists that he was temporarily insane when he seized Elza Kungayeva from her home, took her to his quarters, cut off her clothes with a knife, beat her and then strangled her before ordering her body hidden.
The court in Rostov, in southern Russia, ordered Colonel Budanov to undergo psychiatric treatment, but it was not clear for how long.
"What can be said about justice in Chechnya?" Arsen Sakalov, a leader of the Chechnya Justice Initiative, a legal advocacy organization, said in an interview from the neighboring republic, Ingushetia. "Everything that happens proves that there is no justice there."
In a case that had attracted intense scrutiny, the verdict appeared timed to minimize public attention. The court announced its decision late this afternoon after many Russians had already left work to devote themselves to New Year's Eve, the most thoroughly observed of holidays here. Wednesday and Thursday are public holidays.
The parents of the dead woman did not attend the proceedings today. They now live in a Chechen refugee camp near Ingushetia's capital and could not be immediately reached for comment. The family's lawyer, Abdullah Khamsayev, said he would continue to press for Colonel Budanov's prosecution, appealing to Russia's highest court and, possibly, to the European Court of Justice.
Russian forces have been repeatedly accused of grave abuses during the war in Chechnya, but few have ever been seriously investigated, let alone prosecuted, according to Russian and international rights groups.
Colonel Budanov was the highest-ranking officer tried on criminal charges stemming from those abuses. The case against him dragged on for more than two years.
The colonel and his lawyers acknowledged that he had killed Ms. Kungayeva but said he did so in an emotional rage, believing that she was a sniper who had killed members of his unit. He had been drinking heavily. Charges that he had also raped her were dropped early on, even though an initial autopsy concluded that she had been raped.
Late last week, an assistant to the chief military prosecutor, Col. Aleksandr A. Derbenev, questioned the psychiatric evaluations, saying he believed that Colonel Budanov was in control of his actions. The Kungayev family's lawyer also argued that the fact he ordered subordinates to bury Ms. Kungayeva's body indicated that he knew he had committed a crime. 
Colonel Derbenev called on the court to sentence Col. Budanov to 12 years in prison for murder; if convicted, he faced a maximum of 20 years. 
Despite public outrage over the killing, Colonel Budanov won broad sympathy and support, especially from active and retired military leaders, who argued that he was unfairly prosecuted for extremes that occurred in war.
Asked how an officer suffering from insanity could have been allowed to serve in the army, Arkady G. Baskayev, a former commander now in Parliament, told the Ekho Moskvy radio station today, "The fact is that in Chechnya and the war there you have particular conditions in which very different things happen."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Tax policy is not just an economic tool. It's also a partisan weapon.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." Her new book, "Look and Feel: How Style Became Substance," will be published in June by HarperCollins. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
CONGRESS and the Bush administration are promising Americans tax cuts in the new year. What form those cuts take will spark fierce debate.
 Tax policy is not just an economic tool. It's a partisan weapon. And its power, whether to improve economic performance or slay political opponents, depends on the details. 
 Political considerations are already distorting two good economic ideas. The permanent campaign is transforming potentially significant tax reforms into flashy favors that enhance press releases more than economic growth.
The first good idea is ending the "double taxation" of dividends. Under current law, a publicly held company calculates its pretax profit, pays its taxes, and then pays any dividends out of after-tax profit. Shareholders then pay income taxes on the dividends.
This tax treatment creates all kinds of distortions. Because interest payments are deductible and dividends are not, the tax code encourages companies to raise capital by borrowing rather than issuing dividend-paying stock.
The dividend tax also leads businesses to pile up retained earnings in cash -- and sometimes to use that extra cash for unwise acquisitions -- rather than turn over profits to shareholders.
With fewer companies paying dividends, investors who want steady incomes are pushed into bonds. Those who want to avoid high taxes look for capital gains rather than dividends. This, in turn, skews the market toward growth stocks rather than steady earners. And by discouraging payouts that require cash profits, the tax code implicitly rewards financial funny business that only looks good on paper.
Correcting the dividend-tax distortion is not simple, because the tax code affects both public companies and their shareholders. But many stockholders do not pay taxes on dividends, because their shares are in tax-sheltered pensions or retirement accounts.
The biggest distortions are on the corporate side, where the tax code biases decisions about how to raise capital. To spur better decision-making and, hence, economic growth, lawmakers should make dividends, like interest payments, tax deductible for corporations.
But getting rid of a big distortion requires a bigger tax cut than getting rid of a small one. Thanks to all those tax-sheltered accounts, exempting dividend income from individual taxes could cost only half as much as making companies' dividend payments tax-deductible. Exempting only part of the dividend from taxation, as the Bush administration is expected to propose, would cost the Treasury even less. And most policy makers would rather keep the money in Washington.
Giving individual investors a break on their dividend income already subjects politicians to demagogic attacks as friends of the rich. Cutting corporate taxes, even to eliminate distortions, is politically dangerous.
In a campaign, "my opponent supported tax breaks for giant corporations" is even nastier than "my opponent supported tax breaks for wealthy investors." Sounder tax policy hardly seems worth the trouble.
The second good idea gone bad is cutting the payroll tax, which takes 6.2 percent of everyone's paycheck from the first dollar of income up to a limit, set in 2002 at $84,900. Employers pay an equal amount for the privilege of employing people. The employer tax does not show up on the FICA line of your pay stub, but it nonetheless increases the gap between what you take home and what you cost the company.
Reducing the payroll tax would give every worker an immediate tax break and encourage companies to hire (or retain) employees. It's a winning idea whether you're looking for a Keynesian jolt to consumer spending or a supply-side boost to hiring. And it would particularly benefit low-income workers, who pay little or nothing in federal income taxes but still owe payroll taxes.
The problem arises in defining what it means to "cut the payroll tax." A permanent rate reduction, the ideal reform, is not what lawmakers have in mind. The most common suggestion is a one-year exemption on the first $10,000 or $15,000 of income. This idea has two problems.
To spur either spending or long-term hiring, income tax cuts need to be permanent, not short term.
Of course, employers and workers would appreciate even a one-year break, especially a large one. The idea is a political winner, but a temporary cut does little to encourage hiring or spending.
Companies aren't likely to expand their permanent work force if the after-tax cost of new workers is going to shoot up a year later. And consumers generally base their spending on what they expect to earn over the long term. They save windfalls, including tax rebates, and borrow to cover temporary shortfalls.
This principle, which is known in economics as the permanent income hypothesis, may explain why the 2001 tax rebates don't seem to have stimulated spending as much as boosters had hoped.
A temporary rate cut might not do much to help the economy, but at least it wouldn't do much harm. A lump-sum exemption, by contrast, could actually hurt low-wage workers.
Instead of hiring one full-time person for $20,000 a year, employers would suddenly find it much cheaper to hire two half-time employees for $10,000 each. There would probably even be less paperwork -- and fewer health benefits to cover.
A temporary lump-sum exemption may win some short-term good will among middle-income voters, who are less likely to lose their jobs to part-time workers. Lawmakers who care about spurring full-time employment, increasing consumer spending, or helping low-income workers would instead make a long-term commitment to lower payroll tax rates.
But politicians, like the rest of us, respond to incentives. Until voters reward subtle but sound tax reforms, lawmakers will keep turning out the flashy favors that pay.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Seeks Reform by Following the Money 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Dec. 31 

 BODY:
Waving reams of fiscal data, a small man in a gray suit charged the barricades of Palestinian reform here today. 
 It may have looked like the arid presentation of an annual budget, to the legislature of the Palestinian Authority. But it amounted to something more revolutionary. 
 First, because there was a 2003 budget proposal at all. 
Second, because it was being disclosed publicly, in detail.
Third, and most striking, because it included seemingly bland provisions that if enacted would have major consequences for the conduct, not only of Palestinian governance, but also of the Palestinian uprising.
Take, for example, one apparent yawner: direct deposit of police salaries. This measure would strip Palestinian security chiefs of the control they now have over their forces' pay, which some have used to build unaccountable fiefs. It would also twist shut what students of the Palestinian Authority say is a tap for financing some Palestinian militants.
The man in the gray suit, Salam Fayyad, has been praised by both American and Israeli officials since he was appointed to his post as Palestinian finance minister by Yasir Arafat in June. 
That is something of a problem for the finance minister, a former official of the International Monetary Fund who was educated in Lebanon and Texas. Palestinians consider the Bush administration biased in favor of Israel. The 27-month-long conflict has made them suspicious if not contemptuous of any change -- and any Palestinian -- conforming to American and Israeli demands.
When these concerns about outside influence were mentioned to Mr. Fayyad after his presentation, he became so exercised that he dropped his black satchel and began jabbing the air with one index finger.
"I'm talking about public funds -- public money -- the people's money!" he said in rapid-fire English. "We should manage the funds in an honest way. Tell me if this is not inspired by the Palestinian people. Tell me if the Palestinian people do not benefit from this."
Palestinian legislators, many of whom have chafed at corruption in the Palestinian Authority, said they expected the budget to pass within a month, and then for the real fight to begin: to enact its provisions against officeholders vested in the status quo.
"Either he will submit to their demands, or resign," Jamal Shobaki, the chairman of the legislature's economic committee, said of Mr. Fayyad, expressing what he called a common fear among reformers. "What we want is a third way -- that he neither submit, nor resign."
Mr. Fayyad, who is 50, smiled when told of the comment, and said he knew a third way. "When you hit a wall," he said, "you go through it."
Mr. Fayyad, who has presented Mr. Arafat with his budget, is careful to emphasize his loyalty to the Palestinian leader. Yet his proposals, if enacted, would remove levers of patronage and contracting that Mr. Arafat has relied on for years to run the Palestinian Authority, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and his dominant faction, Al Fatah.
As a result, Israeli officials reacted to the proposed budget with skepticism, along with rare praise for a Palestinian minister. "Everything that Fayyad is trying to do is well appreciated and is the right thing," said Raanan Gissin, the spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. "But it's like full gas in neutral, as long as the money eventually reaches Arafat."
But Mr. Arafat appears to be somewhat boxed in by his finance minister. It would be a serious blow to the Palestinian Authority's remaining credibility abroad -- including in Europe, which has given the Palestinians considerable funds -- if Mr. Fayyad felt forced to resign.
Although he said he supported reform and democracy, Mr. Arafat did not speak about the budget as he addressed supporters here today, the anniversary of Al Fatah's founding in 1965.
A Western diplomat said Mr. Fayyad had "thrown down a gauntlet in front of the security services," adding that this "puts the authority in a very difficult position because of Fayyad's international credibility."
In this diplomat's appraisal, Mr. Fayyad appeared to be recruiting sidelined Palestinian institutions -- the budget, the legislature -- for wide-ranging reform, using the budget proposal to lend precision to popular but rather amorphous ideas for change.
No budget was issued for 2002, and before that, the details of the budgets were not disclosed. Mr. Fayyad made a point of posting his $1.28 billion proposal on a new Web site, which was also started today (www.mof.gov.ps). 
He said his budget assumed that the Palestinian economy would contract by about 7 percent next year. He said the Palestinian G.D.P. now amounted to slightly under $2 billion. 
While he referred to the devastating impact of Israel's offensives into Palestinian areas, he spoke more about what Palestinians could do to take control of their fiscal destiny, peppering his presentation with words like "transparency," "audit," and, repeatedly, "credibility."
Mr. Fayyad, who was raised in the West Bank town of Tulkarm, was for several years the representative of the I.M.F. to the Palestinian Authority, and he appears to have been storing up ideas of what he would do if he was in charge. 
Among other changes, he said he would ensure compliance by all ministries with Palestinian laws about procurement. He specifically referred to the purchasing body for the security services, which Palestinians call the Rock. Experts say the Rock is used to generate kickbacks and patronage for security officials. 
Mr. Fayyad called its relationship to the security agencies "a clear violation of the law" and said it "should not, and will not, be allowed to continue."
The proposal would advance several efforts he has already undertaken, like putting auditors in all the ministries and consolidating multiple investment and commercial operations in one closely watched fund.
Mr. Fayyad, who has a doctorate from the University of Texas, served as a scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis and as an I.M.F. official in Washington. He has little popular support, but he gained some credibility in August, when he found himself trapped by a renewed Israeli siege of Mr. Arafat's compound. 
The Israelis came in so swiftly, after back-to-back suicide bombings killed seven people besides the bombers, that he lost his cellphone and briefcase. They were crushed by a tank inside the taxi in which he had arrived at the compound.
Before American pressure forced the Israelis to withdraw, Mr. Fayyad spent 10 days in the compound, sharing a small, airless bedroom with Mr. Arafat and two other officials. At one point, he recalled, the Israelis demanded that everyone evacuate the compound, saying they were about to demolish it. "I thought to myself, 'This is it,' " he said.
Contrary to Palestinian rumor, Mr. Fayyad is not an American citizen. Chain-smoking, as usual, in Mr. Arafat's compound today, he said he knew some Palestinians viewed him as "this guy who came from the I.M.F."
But he shrugged that off. "I know who I am," he said. "Our people deserve respect, and if I can contribute to that, what more can I ask for?"

HEADLINE: Outfoxed by North Korea 

BYLINE:  By Leon Fuerth; Leon Fuerth, national security advisor to Vice President Al Gore from 1993 to 2000, teaches international relations at George Washington University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
We're beginning the new year in a deep fix.
 The Bush administration's decision to refer North Korea's revival of its nuclear-weapons program to the United Nations is a reasonable but transparent effort to sidetrack the issue in hopes of avoiding another military crisis on the eve of war with Iraq. It is unlikely that the United Nations will take meaningful action in this situation, since no power other than the United States possesses the means to back up words with action. 
 Even if the administration's strategy of isolating North Korea works, at best it would amount to a partial tightening of sanctions against a country whose economy is already moribund. The only additional threat available is the denial of food aid for the people of North Korea, an act that would take the United States into new moral territory. 
The administration now is in the awkward position of choosing to give war with Iraq priority over the most serious threat to stability in Asia since the last North Korean nuclear crisis a decade ago. Moreover, the North Koreans are moving to develop their nuclear stockpile with such dispatch that the administration's delaying tactics appear to have little chance to succeed. With the last of the international inspectors ejected yesterday and the possibility of a mothballed plutonium reprocessing facility coming back on line in the next month or two, North Korea is giving itself the means to produce ever-greater numbers of nuclear weapons, and no subsequent agreement will be able to reverse that fact.
There is still a lingering hope that all this will turn out to have been an attempt by North Korea to get the Bush administration to make major concessions. If that's the case, either the United States or North Korea will have to give way. Unfortunately neither of these scenarios looks likely. And absent either outcome, North Korea is on course to becoming a nuclear power. If the North Koreans are successful, the consequences will be severe.
North Korea already is in a position to provide nuclear technology to other states or to terrorist groups. In any event, we should expect that it will continue to develop the ability to deliver nuclear weapons by ballistic missile. And no long-term comfort can be found from the relatively limited capabilities of North Korea's current missiles, which can still threaten our allies, including Japan. What's more, North Korean weapons engineers can gradually develop longer-range rockets and lighter warheads, giving the country true intercontinental ballistic-missile capability.
While it's uncertain how far North Korea's missiles will be able to travel, it is certain that the Bush administration now faces an immediate loss of credibility. Its report on National Security Strategy, released in September, claims the right of pre-emption as a means to deal with the type of threat that Iraq is said to represent by virtue of its efforts to build weapons of mass destruction. There is no sign, however, that the administration plans to use this doctrine against North Korea, which poses a danger to the vital interests of the United States by virtue of what it has already accomplished.
The administration's special addendum to its National Security Strategy, the "National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction," published in December, states on its opening page: "We will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes and terrorists to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons." But there is no sign that this new unconditional doctrine will be directed against North Korea. Another line in the addendum states that "effective interdiction is a critical part" of the American strategy to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles that deliver them. But, again, the administration, after seizing a North Korean vessel in the act of smuggling North Korean ballistic missiles into Yemen, elected to release the ship and its cargo. American officials cited reverence for international law, but such a justification, so unusual during the administration's first weapons-proliferation case, takes the teeth out of its tough pre-emption policy. With what lesson for North Korea?
So on the way to war with Iraq, the United States has been caught out by North Korea -- which apparently saw its opportunity in our distraction and seized it. This drama is far from over, but with each day North Korea moves closer to its goal of either forcing the administration to negotiate or enhancing its ability to produce weapons of mass destruction. 
Either way, the balance of power in the Far East is likely to be upset. If the president negotiates, he will send a message that the key to respectful attention from his administration is blackmail. If he can't stop North Korea from pursuing its nuclear ambitions, the only effective remedy would be military action.
War on the Korean peninsula is almost too horrible to contemplate, although the Clinton administration certainly confronted it when dealing with North Korea's nuclear program in the early 1990's. (Then, as now, the North Koreans were preparing to begin a process that would give them enough plutonium to build nuclear weapons serially.) If North Korea proceeds today, we would then be faced with a ruthless government in a position to increasingly threaten its region. This threat could cause a number of states, including South Korea and possibly Japan, to question whether American security guarantees are still the most reliable means for their defense and survival.
One political reminder from this episode is the danger that can come from tough talk. When using words as weapons, a leader must be prepared to back up his rhetoric with force. The president's nomination of North Korea as a member of the "axis of evil" in his last State of the Union message now looks like a bluff that is being called. And the outcome of the administration's diplomacy is that we are preparing to fight a war with a country that might eventually acquire nuclear weapons, while another country is closing in on the ability to go into mass production.
Like it or not, the administration needs to test the theory that North Korea is trying to force the United States into negotiations. That would be bitter medicine for the administration to swallow, but in view of the alternatives it would be wise for the administration to reverse course and engage with North Korea. However, if such a process doesn't stop the North Korean nuclear enterprise, and quickly, then the administration must either accept a monumental blow to the security of the United States, or prepare for a second major military enterprise in Korea -- one that would take place simultaneously, or nearly so, with action against Iraq.

PERSON: Mary Wesley 

HEADLINE: Mary Wesley, Wry Novelist Of British Mores, Dies at 90 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Mary Wesley, the popular British author whose sensual and often bitingly witty novels were not published until she reached her 70's, died on Monday in Totnes, Devon, her hometown in rural southwest England. She was 90.
 Born Mary Aline Mynors Farmar, an Army officer's daughter, she was a lifelong writer who made her debut in 1968 with two books of fiction for children, "Speaking Terms" and "The Sixth Seal." But her first novel for adults, "Jumping the Queue," did not appear until 1983. 
 It was written in the years after the death of her second husband, Eric Siepmann, a journalist she married in 1952 and whose name she kept for the rest of her life. (Known as Mary Aline Siepmann, she adapted her pen name from her great-grandmother's name, Wellesley.)
Her husband's death had left her nearly penniless, with a teenage son to raise. "Jumping the Queue" tells of a middle-aged widow contemplating suicide and reflecting on her life as she encounters a fugitive wrestling with the same decision.
The novel offered original characterizations, playful allusions to sex and comic seriousness. It was critically acclaimed and despite its morbid theme, drew readers to her work.
Books by Mary Wesley then appeared almost annually through the 1980's and into the 90's. They often dealt with growing up middle-class in England, but American readers sought them, too, and many are still in print in the United States. Her last, "Part of the Scenery," was published last year in Britain.
Ms. Wesley created "an idiosyncratic fictional world, a middle-class English world," Michiko Kakutani wrote, reviewing the novel "Second Fiddle" in The New York Times in 1989. Her books' "bright comic surface belies a dark subtext of sin, incest, murder and betrayal," Ms. Kakutani wrote, adding that "cuckoldry and sexual gamesmanship thrive in her novels, and a chilly air of malice (or at the very least manipulation) that's reminiscent of Muriel Spark's work hovers over her characters."
Born in 1912, Mary Farmar attended Queens College in London and the London School of Economics and Political Science before marrying Charles Swinfen Eady, a baron, in 1937. The marriage ended in 1944. She worked in the War Office during World War II, and her later writings reflected her wartime experiences.
She was the mother of three sons: William Siepmann, from her second marriage, and Roger and Toby Eady, from her first.
Unfazed by her late-blooming popularity, she once said that her chief claim to fame was "arrested development -- getting my first novel published at the age of 70."

HEADLINE: Mexican Officials Report Threats by Zapatista Rebels 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 31 

 BODY:
The Zapatista rebels, after long silence, were stirring today, the eve of the ninth anniversary of their armed uprising against the Mexican government and its free trade accord with the United States. 
 The North American Free Trade Agreement eliminates tariffs on most agricultural goods on Jan. 1. Across Mexico, people fear that a flood of cheaper, government-subsidized American imports will ruin hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmers. A national coalition of farm groups called off plans today to blockade the border with the United States after the secretary of the economy, Luis Ernesto Derbez, raised the possibility of renegotiating elements of the pact. 
 Mexican government officials in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, where the Zapatistas maintain their strongholds, said reports of planned rebel actions were rife. 
They included threats to seize a tourist ranch outside the town of Ocosingo, the scene of the heaviest fighting between the group and the Mexican Army in January 1994, said the American owners, Glen Wersch and Ellen Jones, in telephone interviews. 
Officials from the American, British, German and Dutch Embassies in Mexico City have advised their guests to leave the site, Rancho Esmeralda, which lies a mile from both a Mexican Army base and a Zapatista community. 
"We're about to have everything in the world taken away from us," Ms. Jones said. "The police are saying they can't come until our ranch is trespassed on. There is no law here."
She said she and her husband were summoned to a meeting with their Zapatista neighbors 18 days ago and told that their ranch would fall "under the authority of the Zapatistas," who wanted tourism banned in the area. The Zapatistas, she said, demanded the title to the ranch, a popular destination for American and European travelers listed as one of the top 10 places to stay in Mexico by the Lonely Planet travel guide.
Mr. Wersch said he would sit tight. "We'll be here tonight," he said. "I haven't seen any word from the army. They have a front-row seat on the problem."
Other threats, unconfirmed, included plans to seize a bridge across the Usumacinta River. The bridge, at Boca de Cerro, near the Chiapas-Tabasco state line, is the site of a proposed hydroelectric dam that, if built, would flood peasants' farms and unexplored sites of Mayan ruins.
The Zapatistas also plan a march on the town hall in Ocosingo at dawn on New Year's Day.
The Zapatista movement rose up on Jan. 1, 1994, and fought pitched battles with the Mexican Army before retreating into isolated communities in the mountains and jungles of Chiapas. The group has said and done little since its leaders came to Mexico City last year seeking passage of an Indian rights law. Though President Vicente Fox strongly backed the law, the Mexican Congress eventually passed a diluted version of the bill that satisfied few. 
The group's leader, who calls himself Subcommander Marcos, has alienated many of his supporters outside Chiapas by publishing a long and, in many eyes, bizarre attack on a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon. The judge is best known for his legal pursuit of the Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and for his drive on the Basque separatist group known as ETA. 
Subcommander Marcos called Judge Garzon "a grotesque clown" in a letter published on the Internet and in a Mexico City newspaper, and ridiculed his attempts to prosecute members of ETA, which has carried out bombings and other attacks in the name of a Basque homeland for four decades. 
The judge replied with a letter accusing the Zapatista leader of standing for "false rebellion, violence, lies, ignorance."
What this spat has to do with the poverty of people in Chiapas remains obscure. "The Zapatistas have nothing to gain from picking so many fights," said Carlos Monsivais, a Mexico City writer and historian sympathetic to the movement.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Shows Unexpected December Drop 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in December, the Conference Board, an industry research group, reported yesterday, as the outlook for employment worsened, energy prices rose and the stock market slumped. It was the sixth time in seven months that consumers' sentiment soured, the group reported.
 The group's consumer confidence index dropped to 80.3, from a revised 84.9 in November, the only month the index had risen since June. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 88.0 in December. 
 David Watt, an economist for BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto, said Americans' surprisingly pessimistic view was shaped by an abysmal holiday shopping season, the increased likelihood of a war against Iraq and higher prices for gasoline and heating oil.
Tensions with North Korea over that country's nuclear weapons program made matters worse, Mr. Watt said, as did falling stock prices.
Lynn Franco, director of the board's research center, said, "The major factor dampening consumers' spirits has been the rising unemployment rate and the discouraging job outlook."
"Until there is an improvement in labor market conditions," Ms. Franco said, "there is not likely to be a significant upturn in consumer confidence."
The outlook for jobs was particularly grim, with 20.2 percent saying they expect fewer jobs to open up in the next six months, a rise from 18.8 percent in November. Those expecting more jobs fell to 15.1 percent, from 15.4 percent.
Income expectations were dour, with 18.7 percent of consumers anticipating a rise in their incomes, down from 19.4 percent a month ago.
The number of consumers rating current conditions as good fell to 14.6 percent, down from 16.1 percent in November, while the number sizing up the conditions as bad remained steady at 26 percent, the Conference Board said.
On the positive side, the number of consumers who said they expected an improvement in business conditions grew to 20.8 percent, from 20.3 percent a month earlier. Respondents who held the opposite view declined to 11 percent, from 11.3 percent in November.
The board's index is based on a monthly survey of some 5,000 households.

HEADLINE: Backstage at the Pataki Inaugural 

 BODY:
For the beginning of his third term, Gov. George Pataki plans a low-key inauguration today in Albany. That is understandable, given the state's current condition. New York faces a deficit of $2 billion in its current budget with another $10 billion next year. After two terms in office, he still has far more unfulfilled promises than accomplishments. And despite his drumbeat about how, after Sept. 11, 2001, we all have to weather these difficult times together, the truth is that the state of New York State is Mr. Pataki's mess, and he has now been granted one more term to clean it up. 
 Obviously New York is not the only state suffering financially at this point. Across the nation, legislators and governors who slashed taxes and raised spending in good times are wringing their hands, trying to figure out where to cut or who to tax in order to deal with growing deficits and worsening economic news. But the most responsible states began tackling the problem far earlier than Governor Pataki. Running for office last year on a feel-good budget, he used surpluses and drained one-time bonuses to camouflage the widening holes. The governor acknowledged that the state was facing a $2 billion deficit exactly one month to the day after his re-election. Then he began hinting at taxes, layoffs and cuts, all of which should have been on the table far earlier. Worse, he began pushing to use money from the tobacco industry settlement to boost the state's borrowing power, a quick fix that only adds to long-term problems. 
 Mr. Pataki's legacy is on the line. All his bragging rights on environmental issues will slip away if New York State's financial health deteriorates under his care and he fails to rise to the other challenges facing him today. The same holds true for the other parts of his long-pending agenda. All his vaunted health care improvements will be forgotten if the level of education suffers and the rebuilding of downtown Manhattan descends into a bureaucratic muddle. His plans for campaign finance reform and humanizing the Rockefeller drug laws and reforming the judiciary will fade into lost rhetoric unless these bills become good and workable laws.
Mr. Pataki's inaugural ceremony is rightfully muted this year. He has many promises to keep before he can start to celebrate.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Wall St. Down a3rd Year, Leaving Fewer Optimists

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States plunged in 2002 amid fears of war and terrorism, a weak economy, rising oil prices and dozens of corporate scandals. It was the third consecutive annual decline, the first time that has happened in 60 years.
 Making matters worse, the average stock fell further in 2002 than it had in either of the previous two years. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted its worst year since 1974; many big technology stocks slipped into the single digits, and some dropped to prices below $1. 
 And Wall Street's mood is bleak. At the end of 2000, most investors were optimistic that a return to quick gains could not be far off. A year ago, many remained resolute, feeling that stocks and the United States economy had withstood the Sept. 11 attacks and were poised for recovery.
Now that optimism has disappeared almost entirely. After two decades in which stocks suffered only brief and mild downturns -- interruptions in profitable years -- the depth of the bear market has shocked many investors, especially those who were not shareholders in the 1970's, the last time stocks endured a prolonged setback.
But even longtime professional investors say they have been dismayed by how much stocks, which were mostly flat yesterday on the last day of the year, have fallen from their peak in March 2000. Since then, the Wilshire 5000, the broadest market index, has dropped 43 percent, leaving investors $7.4 trillion poorer -- a potential loss in wealth of $26,000 for every American.
This year, the Wilshire dropped 22.1 percent; the S.& P. 500 index dropped 23.4 percent; the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 16.8 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index -- most punished among the major gauges -- fell by 31.5 percent.
"To my way of thinking, this bear market, traversing almost three years, is certainly worse than the 1973-74 break," said James M. Weiss, former chief investment officer of State Street Research. Mr. Weiss, who now runs his own money management company, began working on Wall Street in 1972. "We're at a point of maximum frustration here," he said.
Hugh Mullin, co-manager of the $20 billion Putnam Growth and Income mutual fund, said, "I think people are much more pessimistic than they have been in a long time."
Mr. Weiss said he thought the bear market could be divided into three phases. The first, in 2000, was a necessary correction to the bubble in technology stocks in the late 1990's. The second, he said, in 2001, came as a result of the broader recession and profit slowdown. At the end of 2001, Mr. Weiss and many other professional investors were expecting that 2002 would be a positive year.
"There was every reason to believe that the factors that led to the onset of the bear market had pretty much run their course by a year ago at this time," he said. But the optimists did not anticipate the scandals that threw into question the integrity of many corporate financial statements.
"We have concluded a three-phase bear market and we didn't need to have the third phase," Mr. Weiss remarked.
Enron had already collapsed and filed for bankruptcy protection by the beginning of 2002. But despite complaints from short sellers that corporations had used accounting gimmickry to inflate their profits, many investors thought the crisis at Enron was an isolated case. Then, as the spring wore on, journalists, analysts and regulators began to question the accounting used by dozens of other companies, including General Electric, a market bellwether. The crisis peaked in June, when WorldCom announced that it had inflated its cash flow by $3.9 billion, a figure that has since been raised to an estimate of $9 billion.
James Chanos, a hedge fund manager who played a major role in unearthing the overstated profits at Enron, said WorldCom's announcement in June ensured that 2002 would be another losing year.
"The scale of the fraud which was disclosed was so massive and so blatant that it really gave rise to the idea that one couldn't even rely on cash flow statements anymore to ascertain corporate health," Mr. Chanos said. "Prior to WorldCom, I think Wall Street always felt that with enough due diligence in the cash flow statements and financial analysis, one could always be certain where the financial health of a company might lie. Post-WorldCom, I think we all had to reassess that."
In the month after WorldCom's disclosure, the S.& P. 500 dropped 195 points, or 20 percent, to 797.70 on July 23, its third-lowest close of the year.
Over the next month, stocks rallied, but by then the economy -- which had showed strong momentum during the first part of the year -- slowed sharply, in part because the market's plunge discouraged companies from raising capital for new investments. Projections for corporate profits dropped quickly, and stocks followed. On Oct. 9, the S.& P. 500 fell to 776.76, its lowest close of the year.
Since then, stocks have rallied, but only slightly. And Charles L. Hill, the research director for Thomson First Call, which compiles analysts' profit estimates, said he thought that 2003 could be another disappointing year.
In 2002, Mr. Hill was prescient, repeatedly warning that estimates were too high and that investors would be disappointed if they expected that a big earnings recovery would support a rally.
Looking at forecasts for 2003, he said earnings growth would once again be weaker than investors hoped. Analysts are continuing to cut forecasts for the first half of this year, Mr. Hill said. Six months ago, they expected that corporate profits would grow 25 percent, year over year, in the first quarter of 2003. Now, they have cut that forecast to 12 percent.
By the time quarterly earnings are announced in April, Mr. Hill said, growth could be as low as 5 percent. Considering that profits fell 17 percent in 2001 and rose only 1.6 percent in 2002, that level of recovery is anemic, he said.
"A lot of talk at the beginning of the year was, 'We don't have three years in a row of down markets, so the odds of having a down third year are minimal,' " he recalled. "But we've never in our lifetime had a bubble as big as this one. You shouldn't be surprised that we had three down years, and you shouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be four."

HEADLINE: Out The Door 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; Maureen Dowd and Thomas L. Friedman are on vacation.

 BODY:
Merry Christmas. Get lost.
 That, essentially, was the message Robert Pagein received from his employers -- make that former employers -- at Verizon Communications. 
 Mr. Pagein, who is married and has a year-old son, was a field technician who had worked for the phone company for four years. One of the lures of the job was its stability. The pay wasn't great, but it was steady. If you were disciplined you could pay your bills, take a vacation every year or so, and put a little aside. 
That's the way it works in theory. In reality, Mr. Pagein was one of 2,400 Verizon workers in New York who were shown the door just a few days before Christmas. Those workers formed the bulk of a pre-holiday wave of terminations that claimed the jobs of 3,500 Verizon employees in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.
Mr. Pagein will not be destitute. His wife is working and he has a college degree. But the cold-blooded way in which he and his fellow workers were lopped off the employment rolls by Verizon, and the phenomenal gap that exists between the compensation available to the company's ordinary workers and the fabulous, multimillion-dollar packages taken home by executives at the top of the Verizon pyramid, has shaken his faith in a system he believed in.
"I'm 36 years old and grew up in Lefrak City Queens ," he said. "As a working-class guy I kind of accepted long ago that I wasn't going to make a fortune or anything like that. What I figured was that if I worked hard, if I became a cop or I joined the phone company or something like that, at least I would have a regular working-class or middle-class life. At least you'd make your 50 grand or 55 grand a year. The government would take out your taxes, but you'd have something left over."
Mr. Pagein's comforting belief in a system that looks out for the ordinary worker evaporated with the arrival of his layoff notice. As a not-so-merry Christmas and then a not-so-happy New Year approached, he found himself thinking more and more about the big bucks -- the tens of millions of dollars -- being pocketed by top Verizon executives like Ivan Seidenberg and Larry Babbio.
It's one thing to acknowledge that there are inequities in the system, he said. But it's "really tough" to accept that you can be thrown out of work by executives who take extraordinary sums out of a company whether their business decisions are wise or not.
"We were laid off, effective immediately," he said. " 'Merry Christmas, thanks for working at ground zero and breathing the dust. . . .' They told us we were heroes and used the pictures of us at ground zero to sell themselves. Now we're out."
Last spring Verizon reported a first-quarter loss of $500 million. The company attributed the loss to a tough economy and a $2.5 billion write-down for bad investments. By the third quarter it was reporting earnings of $4.4 billion. But officials said the layoffs, the first in the history of the New York telephone company, were inevitable because the economy is still in trouble and competition is increasing.
Company officials said the total compensation in 2001 for Mr. Seidenberg, Verizon's chief executive, was $13.4 million, and for Mr. Babbio, $24 million.
Figures released by the Communication Workers of America, which represents the laid-off employees, showed that from 1997 through 2001, Mr. Seidenberg collected more than $56 million in salary, bonuses and stock options, and that Mr. Babbio, the company's vice chairman, collected more than $78 million.
Those numbers were on Mr. Pagein's mind as he and his family spent Christmas at his grandmother's home in Flushing. "I kind of Scrooged on the presents," he said, "Everybody knew. It was, like, 'Well, don't expect Robert to bring anything because, you know, he just got laid off.' "
He added: "It's tough to take. These guys took their outrageous, outrageous bonuses and we're out on the street. I guess you don't notice the inequities so much when you're working because then, at least, you've got something."
Mr. Pagein said he would go on unemployment for a while and use that time to look for a different career. "Part of the pain I'm feeling right now has to do with some of the others who were fired." he said. "Some of them were the only income earners in their family. They seem shell shocked."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Comeback Kid Finding Help This Time Around

BYLINE:  By NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON 

 BODY:
At age 7, Lennwood Pergerson decided that New York City was the place to be. "On Wednesdays, my mother and I would ride the wicker-seat trains into New York," he recalled. "We'd go shopping and eat at the Port Authority when it was fabulous. I couldn't get over it."
 More than 40 years later, Mr. Pergerson, 50, is still in New York. He still wants to live here, to thrive here. Only now he spends his Wednesdays looking for a job and a place to live at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 At 16, while he was still in high school, Mr. Pergerson left the genteel Princeton, N.J., suburb where he grew up and set out for the bright lights of the big city as the frontman for a bluesy rock 'n' roll band. With his husky radio-ready basso, seasoned by years of hard living and hard partying, it is easy to imagine him belting out his signature song, "Dark End of the Street."
The blues come easily to Mr. Pergerson. With his stories of friends laid low by Vietnam, drug addiction and AIDS, Mr. Pergerson knows the blues all too well. But with the highs and horrors of New York night life behind him, Mr. Pergerson, would rather sing the gospel of faith and redemption.
"I'm lucky," he said. "I lived a tragedy, but now I can see light."
Back in the 1970's, when disco was the rhythm of the night, Mr. Pergerson, was, to use his favorite word, fabulous. "I was a bad boy, and a fun guy that did it to the max," he said. "But I was prosperous because I had to pay for all those outrageous clothes."
He toured as a roadie with the disco singer Gloria Gaynor for about a year. And Mr. Pergerson often found himself in the center of all the decadent action. "In those years, we just didn't believe there could be anything more horrible than Vietnam," he recalled. "So the bar and after-hours scene was all about rampant drugs and sex, all in the name of the beat."
Until that beat started to falter.
In the late 1970's and early 80's, Mr. Pergerson said, he noticed that some people were starting to get sick. The randomness of it all reminded him of the draft lotteries that were held on Saturdays back in his small suburb, and it seemed, as it did then, that it was only a matter of time before his number came up.
But while many in his circle of friends died of AIDS, Mr. Pergerson never got ill. He was a disc jockey into the late 80's. 
After that, during the economic boom of the 90's, he took up bartending, serving up a good time. "If someone was feeling down, I could make them feel all right," he recalled. In the summer of 2000, he was hired as a bartender and server at Pizzeria Uno at the South Street Seaport, just east of the World Trade Center. He outpaced his younger colleagues, and in short order, he was doing all the big parties.
But as with with the Vietnam War and the emergence of AIDS, Sept. 11 changed everything. All of a sudden, nobody was in the mood to party, certainly not within view of the devastation at ground zero. Like so many other New Yorkers, Mr. Pergerson lost his job.
At first, he remained optimistic. He did not worry because he had never had a problem finding steady work. "I'm the comeback kid," he said. "I thought to myself, 'I'll be getting a job; I don't need any assistance.' "
But in a weak economy, even comeback kids can find themselves looking for help, and for work, without finding either. He was out of work for six months when he turned to the Brooklyn Bureau's Community Response Center last March.
There, he met an employment specialist, Sharon Greenberg. "Mr. Pergerson was always very upbeat and followed up on every lead," she said.
He was also trying to get assistance from FEMA. He described that process as akin to "digging a ditch in Bosnia and going through the long way just to get them to answer their phones."
Diana Naftal, a social worker at the Brooklyn Bureau, began helping him in his effort to get FEMA aid in mid-May.
"Once I met Lennwood, I had an immediate bond with him," Ms. Naftal said. "I was impressed with his creativity and his drive. He kept his expenses low and came to us for only basic needs."
After months of wrangling with FEMA representatives, Mr. Pergerson received rental assistance in June.
In addition, over the past year, the Brooklyn Bureau has tapped Neediest Cases to provide him $1,110 for emergency help with rent, utilities, food and transportation.
Mr. Pergerson is looking for a bartending job or work in the community development sector. And he is looking for an apartment, because the Brooklyn building he lives in is being sold. 
But in the meantime, he says, he has been fortunate to find a supportive team of advocates.
"I remember my mother handing money to a stranger in the Port Authority when I was a little boy," he said. "People have been good to me, too, and have shown me that hope and help are right here in front of all of us."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WEAPONS; 
South Opposes Pressuring North Korea, Which Hints It Will Scrap Nuclear Pact

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 31 

 BODY:
North Korea strongly suggested today that it would withdraw from a treaty that prohibits it from making nuclear weapons, the latest in a series of fast-paced moves to remove its nuclear program from international controls. 
 "North Korea is not currently able to meet its commitments under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- this is the fault of the United States," Pak Ui Chun, North Korea's ambassador to Russia, said at a news conference in Moscow today. On Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry accused the United States of "ditching" a special 1994 agreement that had kept North Korea bound to the treaty. 
 If North Korea abandons the treaty, which would take 90 days from a formal declaration, it would be under no obligation to allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Last week, the North said that it would expel the inspectors, and today they were made to leave the country. 
Without the inspectors, the outside world can now rely only on satellite photos and statements by North Korea to guess at what work is being done at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, 55 miles north of Pyongyang. 
"We were the eyes of the world," Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the agency, said after the two inspectors, a Chinese woman and a Lebanese man, arrived in Beijing. "Now we virtually have no possibility to monitor North Korea's nuclear activities nor to provide any assurances to the international community that they are not producing a nuclear weapon."
Shortly after South Koreans elected the liberal candidate in the Dec. 19 presidential election, the North Koreans disabled cameras and broke seals that for almost a decade had restricted their access to facilities capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. 
Nuclear technicians quickly started work on reopening two facilities: a small reactor and a fuel reprocessing plant. Outside experts estimate that the plant is capable of producing enough plutonium for five bombs by late spring.
"I don't know what is worse: pulling out of the NPT or starting to reprocess," Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University, said today. "They may have chosen a totally new strategy: to acquire some form of nuclear deterrent as quickly as possibly, and then try negotiation from a position of strength." 
In Moscow, the North Korean ambassador charged today that the Bush administration, which has labeled North Korea, along with Iran and Iraq, as part of an "axis of evil," had "threatened us with a pre-emptive nuclear strike." 
"In these circumstances, we also cannot fulfill the nonproliferation treaty, the basic clause of which is the obligation of nuclear states not to use the nuclear weapon against states which do not possess it," he said. 
The North Korean ambassador recalled that in 1993 the North announced plans to pull out of the treaty. But, the next year, the signing of an agreement with the United States prompted the country to suspend its official withdrawal. Under the agreement, the United States and South Korea agreed to build two light-water power reactors in North Korea. It is harder to make a nuclear bomb with this technology.
This year, however, the Bush administration confronted the North Koreans with evidence that they had secretly continued work on their nuclear weapons program despite that agreement. Tensions have escalated since, and the United States has met resistance from some Asian allies as it tries to contain the North. 
Last weekend, Bush administration officials floated the idea of "tailored containment" against North Korea, or a ring of economic sanctions by its neighbors. But today, South Korea's President-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, told reporters that he opposed the policy.
"I am skeptical whether so-called 'tailored containment' reportedly being considered by the United States is an effective means to control or impose a surrender on North Korea," said Mr. Roh, who takes office Feb. 25. "I doubt if the policy would work in controlling North Korea.
"Success or failure of a U.S. policy toward North Korea isn't too big a deal to the American people, but it is a life-or-death matter for South Koreans," Mr. Roh said at his transition committee office. "Therefore, any U.S. move should fully consider South Korea's opinion." 
On Monday, South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, also expressed opposition, noting that four decades of economic sanctions have failed to bring down the Communist government in Cuba. 
As a measure of South Korea's commitment to economic engagement with North Korea, Kim Yoon Kyu, president of Hyundai Asan Company, left here Monday for a five-day visit to North Korea, where he will discuss a groundbreaking date for a huge South Korean-financed industrial park at Kaesong and an inauguration date for overland bus service across the demilitarized zone to the Mount Kumgang tourism resort, owned by Hyundai.
On Monday, the Bush administration seemed to back away from the sanctions idea. 
"I don't think anybody has suggested at this point imposing sanctions," the State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, said at a news briefing. "The secretary has not asked any nation to take economic action against this desperately poor country, North Korea."
With nervousness gradually spreading to markets here, South Korea's stock market fell 4.5 percent on Monday, its largest single-day drop in a decade. 
Tonight, in what could reflect Mr. Roh's calming influence, turnout for an anti-American rally was far below the one million figure originally cited by organizers. Although the rally overlapped with New Year's Eve festivities that traditionally bring at least 100,000 people into downtown Seoul, only about 20,000 are believed to have attended the rally. 
South Korea's protest movement was fueled by the court martial acquittal in late November of two American soldiers of charges arising from a traffic accident that killed two teenage girls. President Bush has apologized several times for the incident, most recently in a telephone conversation with Mr. Kim on Dec. 13, when he conveyed his "deep, personal sadness and regret" over the deaths.
South Korean protests have prompted talk in the United States -- in Congress and on newspaper op-ed pages -- that the alliance should be reviewed, and if South Korea, a democracy, does not want the 37,000 American troops stationed here, it may be time to start withdrawals.
During the fall presidential campaign, Mr. Roh said he wanted the American troops to stay here, distancing himself from statements he made a decade ago when he wanted the Americans to go home.
But on Monday, Mr. Roh brought up the possibility of American troop withdrawals during a meeting with South Korea's top military command.
"I hear such talks coming out again these days," he told the generals. "I wanted to ask whether you have a long-term plan on how the South Korean military could make up for a possible reduction."

HEADLINE: 9 Northeast States File Suit Over New Rules on Pollution 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 

 BODY:
Nine Northeastern states filed a legal challenge today in federal court here to new air-pollution rules for power plants and other industries, just hours after the Bush administration published those rules.
 The states' attorneys general said the rules, which were tentatively announced last month, constituted the most serious effort at rolling back the landmark Clean Air Act since it was enacted more than 30 years ago. 
 They said they wanted to make a strong, swift objection and filed their legal petition for review after seeing the new rules on a government Web site this morning.
The rules, published today in the Federal Register, concern a program known as New Source Review. The changes would allow thousands of aging coal-fired power plants and other industrial sites to upgrade without having to install costly antipollution devices. 
Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general and an organizer of the suit, said, "The Bush administration has taken an action that will bring more acid rain, more smog, more asthma and more respiratory disease to millions of Americans."
The Environmental Protection Agency, which published the rules, defended them and said the administration followed proper procedures in issuing them administratively rather than seeking legislation.
"We reaffirm that we strongly believe that these rules will be positive for the environment," Joe Martyak, a spokesman for the agency, said. "We feel strongly that at the end of the day, what we've done is the right thing as well as a valid action. To say this is gutting the Clean Air Act is absolutely incorrect. It is strengthening these provisions."
The utility industry criticized the suit. The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council issued a statement saying that "the Northeast attorneys general reflect a minority opinion," shaped more by economic concerns than by environmental problems.
In addition to the published rules, the administration issued a new proposal that would expand an exemption allowing power plants and other industrial facilities to escape pollution controls. The suit filed by the states did not address that proposal.
Their one-page petition, filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, did not state the grounds for the challenge. But legal advisers in the states said they would argue that the rules violated the Clean Air Act and that they could not be made without the consent of Congress.
The states' legal action escalates a struggle between utilities and clean-air advocates that has been waged since the Clean Air Act was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon. Industries have complained most recently to the Bush administration that the current rules, begun under President Bill Clinton, were choking off new investments in power-generating plants and discouraging energy-saving efficiencies.
Because the administration had made its intentions clear when it announced the rules last month, the attorneys general had time to prepare their coordinated legal response. Expecting that the administration would publish the rules during the holidays, when few people would be paying attention, the attorneys general signed their documents in advance and delivered them to Joseph Curran Jr., the attorney general of Maryland, whose aides filed them in court here today.
"We could have waited," said Peter Lehner, chief of the environmental protection bureau in Mr. Spitzer's New York office. "But this is the first time there has been such a major retreat on clean air, and the states believed it was very important to respond aggressively and quickly."
Mr. Lehner said he expected other states to join the suit in the next month. The nine that filed today were Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.
The filing puts Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in an awkward position.
As the governor of New Jersey, Mrs. Whitman had joined other states in seeking relief from Midwestern power plants whose smokestack pollution drifted eastward. Now, as head of the agency promulgating the new rules, she is in the position of defending those rules.
Both Mr. Spitzer and Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut, have said that the rules proposed today would undermine their hand in prosecuting and settling the dozens of enforcement cases that as governor Mrs. Whitman had joined in bringing.
"They feel like they've been sold out by her now that she's gone to Washington," said John Walke, a clean air expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
In those enforcement cases, the states, the E.P.A. and environmental groups asked judges to order companies to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on pollution controls, based on the New Source Review program that the states says the environmental agency is now proposing to weaken. Mrs. Whitman said in a recent interview that the new rules did nothing to compromise the enforcement suits. "Those are very important to me," she said. "Those cases are still going forward."
Industry groups, which had pushed for the rules that were published today, hailed them and attacked the attorneys general. The National Association of Manufacturers said the rules would "help further clean air and boost energy security" and "provide business planners with greater certainty as they work to increase production and limit air pollution in a cost-effective manner."

Many Offers Hernandez Can Refuse

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Jose Hernandez had the best year of his 10-year career last season and cannot find a team that will give him more than one year and $2 million.
 The Mets, who need to fill a hole at third base, are among four teams that have been talking to Hernandez's agent. But like everyone else, they are trying to secure a player's services at a bargain-basement rate. 
 Hernandez's experience as a free agent has not been unique. In recent weeks, agents have told of their clients' receiving multiple offers, but the offers have been exactly the same or similar. And all have been well below any market in recent years. 
"Years ago we called this collusion; now we call it coincidence," one agent said facetiously yesterday. But he added: "In this environment they have reason to say they have to show restraint. We've been hearing the same story from everyone."
Alan Nero, Hernandez's agent, said all of the offers he had received were for one year in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million. The last time he was a free agent, in 1999, Hernandez signed a contract with Milwaukee that paid him $10 million for three years, plus the $25,000 bonus he earned for making the 2002 National League All-Star team.
"What has happened," Nero said, "is this market, from the players' point of view, is very depressed. Players have to decide whether they want to take massive paycuts or wait their turn. In Jose's case, he feels he's coming off a career year, and he doesn't feel he should have to take a paycut."
The Mets, San Francisco, Colorado and Cincinnati are the teams that have pursued Hernandez, 33.
 Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, will not discuss negotiations with a particular player, but it is clear he wants to put together the left side of his infield as cheaply as possible. He signed Rey Sanchez -- for a $1.3 million salary and the chance to earn $700,000 in bonuses based on playing time -- to keep shortstop warm for Jose Reyes. He would like to get Hernandez for a similar total.
The Mets had Bill Mueller on their list of prospective third basemen, but he lost interest in them when Phillips would offer no more than one year. A report circulated among general managers and agents yesterday that Mueller had agreed to a two-year, $4.5 million contract with Boston, but Mueller's agent, Dave Meier, said they had no deal. "We're talking to them, but we're not there yet," he said.
Dan O'Dowd, the Rockies' general manager, acknowledged that he had been talking with Nero about Hernandez. Asked about the low, similar offers Hernandez received, O'Dowd said: "I can only speak for ourselves. We just don't have a whole lot of money to work with."
Referring to circumstances clubs and free agents find themselves in, he added, "We're getting into the beginning of January and people don't have jobs, and we have limited resources."
Agents believe the combination of the number of players still seeking jobs and the reduced amount of money available for payroll is the precise situation the clubs have strived to create. With spring training about six weeks away, clubs feel, players will become uncomfortable with their unemployed status and accept the lower salaries the clubs want to pay them.
Ned Colletti, the Giants' assistant general manager, declined to discuss any offer the Giants might have made to Hernandez.
"We're looking for someone who has some versatility, and Hernandez has as much versatility as anyone out there," Colletti said, but added: "We haven't really had a conversation since before Christmas. It's been kind of quiet."
As the day progressed yesterday, Nero spoke with O'Dowd and learned that the interest in Hernandez had been reduced by one team. "It appears they're going in another direction," Nero said of the Rockies.
Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager, did not return a call to discuss the Reds' degree of interest in Hernandez. Phillips said Monday that patience was called for, and that he would not panic in his quest for a third baseman.
The interested clubs might think their slow pace could spur Hernandez to grab one of the low offers, but Nero said he did not expect his client to panic either.
"At this point he's not motivated to accept any of the offers that are out there," Nero said. "We've decided we will be very patient. We won't be rushing into something that is not quite acceptable. Jose Hernandez has worked a long, long time to be where he is, and we'd like him to be treated appropriately. We're going to continue to wait."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Challenge 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 31 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki begins a third term Wednesday facing a fiscal disaster so deep that it puts pressure on him to undo many of the accomplishments of his first two terms.
 The governor's critics on both the left and right say his predicament is partly of his own making, because he and the Legislature spent much of the state's cushion of savings over the last 12 months to avoid cutbacks just before the election. 
 For his part, Mr. Pataki has offered few concrete proposals for how he will deal with a shortfall in the $89.6 billion budget that most analysts project will be at least $8 billion, though he did impose a freeze on hiring last year, trim agency spending in December and ask the Legislature to authorize billions in new bonds. 
The governor, who was sworn in tonight in a small ceremony and is to give an inaugural address at noon on Wednesday, has kept up a brave face and optimistic banter through the election and its aftermath. He has said again and again that he handled a similar crisis in 1995 and could do it again. "It presents enormous challenges," the governor said on Monday, "but we faced enormous challenges in 1995."
Yet 1995 was a very different year. The economy had just come out of a recession and was on the brink of a five-year boom that would flood state coffers with income tax surpluses even as the governor cut income tax rates. The deficit was smaller as well, about $5 billion, and Mr. Pataki had inherited it from his predecessor, leaving him free to slash away at programs to balance the books.
This time, though, the economy is crawling out of a recession like a snail from a pit, and the large incomes on Wall Street that once fueled the state's spending are not likely to return for some time. The recession had already started when hijacked airliners destroyed the World Trade Center, a blow that displaced or eliminated about 300,000 jobs and threw the state economy into a tailspin. 
The state has not recovered. Budget officials now expect that tax revenues in the fiscal year ending March 31 will be $2 billion less than planned. A gap four to five times that large looms between revenue and projected spending in the next fiscal year.
So Mr. Pataki, who managed to cut taxes and at the same time increase spending during most of his first two terms, must now consider raising taxes he has sworn to hold down or cutting back many of the programs he has said he cherishes, like property tax subsidies for homeowners, record levels of school aid and health insurance for the poor.
"It's going to be a very difficult period for the city and for the state and for all New Yorkers," Mr. Pataki said on Monday. "We have a number of factors that have never happened before that have come together. We've had the stock market decline. We've had the investigations into the Wall Street companies, the financial service industries. We have the attacks of Sept. 11, which still have a profound economic impact on the state. We have a national recession."
Conservative critics of Mr. Pataki say he missed an opportunity after the terrorist attacks to rein in spending, which he and the Legislature had allowed to grow at three times the rate of inflation in the four previous budgets. A month after the attacks, the Legislature passed a budget that raised spending 5.1 percent above inflation. 
Then, rather than cutting spending in this year's budget, the governor and legislative leaders chose to use billions in reserves and other one-time revenues to finance another modest spending rise, about 3 percent above inflation.
"All of that was about side-stepping tough decisions until after the election," said E. J. McMahon, an analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute. "The problem is, the longer you put off doing something the worse it gets."
Some Democrats say the crisis would have happened eventually even without the terror attacks. They charge that the governor created the problem by locking the state into future tax cuts during the boom. Next year, for instance, about $200 million worth of new tax reductions are slated to take effect.
"You can't spend five years doing massive budget increases and massive tax cuts without hitting the wall sooner or later," said Senator Eric Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat.
To complicate the coming legislative session, the governor must also negotiate the renewal of the city's rent laws, which caused a firestorm in 1997 when they were last revamped. If history serves as a guide, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the leader of the Democratic majority in that chamber, will not negotiate a budget until the rent laws are renewed.
In addition, Mr. Pataki must re-negotiate with the Legislature an extension of the Health Care Reform Act, a mammoth law that employs a variety of special taxes and revenue streams to pay for health care programs outside the normal state budget.
This, too, promises to be a tough fight, since Mr. Pataki has already proposed to back bonds with one of the acts' fund streams, about $1 billion a year from a court settlement with tobacco companies, lobbyists say. 
If he diminishes programs financed under the act, like drug subsidies for the elderly and money to recruit and retain nurses, he risks the wrath of one of his staunchest supporters in the election, Dennis Rivera, the head of the state's largest health care workers' union. 
Buzzing about Mr. Pataki's head like mosquitoes are a number of other sticky issues. Advocates of reducing the state's stiff mandatory sentences for drug crimes can be counted on to hold the governor to his promise to do something on that issue. Environmentalists are enraged that the state fund for cleaning up toxic waste sites has not been given money for new sites in two years. Civil libertarians are clamoring for the state to raise the pay of public defenders finally. 
Much of the governor's response to these problems will depend on his ambitions for his future, political strategists said. He is not one to discuss his political strategy publicly, but those close to him say he still nurses an ambition for national office if the circumstances prove right. He has not promised to serve out his term, nor has he given any hint about whether he will run for re-election. "I don't know whether I will seek a fourth term," he said recently.
To make himself more attractive to the national Republican Party, Mr. Pataki may want to swing hard to the right, cutting spending, laying off workers and pinching some of the programs for the poor, like Medicaid. He definitely will push harder to pass antiterrorism legislation he submitted last year. He certainly will want to avoid raising income taxes.
On the other hand, the governor may try to avoid the outcry such moves would elicit in a state as liberal as New York through some combination of borrowing and raising certain taxes and fees. Indeed, he has taken pains in recent days not to rule out tax increases. Some union leaders, economists and liberal Democrats have been urging him to increase the income tax on the wealthy temporarily, a step that states like Connecticut and North Carolina are considering.
"He ran to the left," said Herman D. Farrell, the chairman of the state Democratic Committee. "Is he going to continue or now go back and recapture the right?"
One thing seems certain, legislative aides said. The state is running out of tricky accounting maneuvers. The last two budgets spent nearly all the reserves that had been built up during the boom years of the late 1990's. The cupboard is bare. 
The tobacco bonds would bring in $4 billion, but that is not enough to plug the giant hole the governor faces, Democratic and Republican legislative aides said. What is more, the state can reap the windfall of that borrowing only once, so the bonds would do nothing to keep the state's books balanced in the long run. 
"We are at the end of the rainbow in terms of how many more gimmicks we can do," one senior aide to the Assembly Democratic majority said, insisting on anonymity. "He just masked what the state's fiscal problems were because he didn't want to lose the election. Now those chickens are coming home to roost."

HEADLINE: Express Buses To Raise Fares A Dollar, to $4 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The fare on city-subsidized private express buses will rise to $4 a ride from $3 in April as part of a deal to preserve the service on weekends and holidays, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday.
 The city also won a 90-day reprieve from a Bronx bus company that had threatened to suspend express service on Jan. 10, a situation that would have stranded 15,000 riders a day. Mr. Bloomberg said the company, New York Bus Service, would keep its buses rolling while the city tried to get the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to take over the private lines. 
 The fare increase surprised some City Council officials, who had reached an agreement with the mayor in November to preserve the $3 fare. The authority said "complicated issues" would have to be resolved before it would take over the private bus lines. 
The city spends about $98 million a year subsidizing seven private bus companies that operate in areas not served by the authority. Mayor Bloomberg said the authority, which runs its own express buses in addition to its regular city buses and the subways, is better suited to run all bus service in the city.
The mayor has spoken of trying to persuade the authority to take over the private bus lines for months, but yesterday he appeared to be jump-starting what is likely to be a set of complicated negotiations by giving himself 90 days to close a deal.
"I would hope that 90 days is more than adequate," the mayor said.
Mr. Bloomberg said it does not make sense for the city to continue subsidizing the private bus companies, which depend on the subsidies to turn a profit. 
"The economics are such that you can't make enough money from the fares to cover all your costs and have a profit," the mayor said. "And when it comes to the city or the state subsidizing private companies, you then have an odd mixture of public-private divided authority and responsibility. It has clearly not worked in this city to have the private bus companies provide service."
The sticking point in the negotiations to get the transportation authority to take over the bus lines is likely to be the amount of the city subsidy. Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that he hoped to negotiate a deal that would reduce the subsidies.
But the transportation agency, a state-controlled authority, did not appear eager to assume an additional liability of $98 million a year; the authority is weighing a subway and bus fare increase to offset its own deficit.
"The M.T.A. is always interested in improving transportation services in the region," said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the authority. "There are complicated issues that must be resolved. Any takeover would have to be done so that it would not add a further burden to our current customers."
Putting the seven bus companies under the control of the authority could yield administrative savings. The top executives at the seven city-subsidized companies earn a total of more than $1.8 million a year, according to an article in Newsday in 2002; under a takeover by the authority, most of those salaries could be dispensed with.
Transportation experts said the authority might be able to use its purchasing power to win better deals on expenses like gas and maintenance than small companies could.
The city has some assets it could use in the negotiations: it owns most of the 4,600 buses that the seven private companies use, and some of the bus depots as well. City officials and officials for the authority declined to discuss what elements might be involved in a deal to get the authority to take over the bus lines.
Edward Arrigoni, the chairman of New York Bus Service, which serves the Bronx, said he had planned to suspend service on Jan. 10 if he could not reach an agreement with the city on covering drivers' pensions. He said that he had agreed to keep the buses rolling for 90 more days at the request of the mayor.
In the Bronx, many commuters expressed relief that the threatened shutdown had been avoided, at least for now. 
"It's just a relief knowing they'll be here," said Evelyn Sanchez, 47, who was waiting for a bus yesterday in Co-op City. "It would've messed up my life big time if they'd have stopped running. It may sound stupid saying it, but nobody seems to understand how important one little bus can be."
Daniesha Craig, 29, who was standing next to her and was headed into Times Square for the New Year's Eve festivities, said she would gladly pay more money to keep the buses running. "That money's in my pocket now," she said. "I would have done almost anything to keep these buses going. I use them like the subway: every day, two times a day. I would've been sunk if they had shut them down."
In November, as part of the budget negotiations, the City Council reached an agreement with the mayor to hold express bus fares steady at $3. The mayor said yesterday that the fare increase was needed to preserve weekend service on the express lines.
The higher $4 fares will be charged every day on all seven private bus lines, city officials said, even though two of the lines do not provide weekend service. Fares could also go up in April for the authority's express buses, officials said, as part of a proposed fare increase for subways, buses and express buses run by the authority.
Christopher Policano, a spokesman for the City Council, said: "We're glad that weekend service and New York Bus Service will continue. But we have serious concerns about raising fares, as we are opposed to an overall M.T.A. fare increase. We're going to be fighting that fare hike, and, if we're successful, discussing with the mayor ways of avoiding this particular fare hike."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 3, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about plans to increase the fare on subsidized express buses included an erroneous figure provided by the city for the number of buses used by the seven private companies. It is about 1,325, not 4,600.

HEADLINE: Preaching to Save Shoppers From 'Evil' ofConsumerism 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Some people may be upset that retail sales failed to meet expectations during the holiday season. Not Bill Talen.
 For the last four years Mr. Talen, also known as Reverend Billy, has been performing from the theaters of Bleecker Street to the Starbucks on Astor Place, exhorting people to resist temptation -- the temptation to shop -- and to smite the demon of consumerism. 
 With the zeal of a street-corner preacher and the schmaltz of a street-corner Santa, Reverend Billy, 52, will tell anyone willing to listen that people are walking willingly into the hellfires of consumption. 
Shoppers have little regard for how or where or by whom the products they buy are made, he believes. They have almost no resistance to the media messages that encourage them, around the clock, to want things and buy them. He sees a population lost in consumption, the meaning of individual existence vanished in a fog of wanting, buying and owning too many things.
"Consumerism is a dull way of life," he says. "We're all sinners. We're all shoppers. Let's do what we can."
It's an act, a kind of performance art, almost a form of religion. He named it the Church of Stop Shopping. As Reverend Billy, he wears a televangelist's pompadour and a priest's collar, and is often accompanied by his gospel choir when he strides into stores he considers objectionable or shows up at protests like the annual post-Thanksgiving Buy Nothing Day event on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
The choir, which is made up of volunteers, includes people like David Glover and his daughter, Zena, from Brooklyn. There is also Beka Economopoulos, who once sang at the White House, and Meredith Manna, who came in courtesy of one of the keyboard players. When they erupt in song, it is hard to ignore: "Stop shopping! Stop shopping! We will never shop again!"
Other performers preach the same gospel, with their own twists. Ange Taggart, who lives in Nottingham, England, turns up in places like Troy, N.Y., to go into a store, buy a lot of things, and then return them. She recently filled a cart with Martha Stewart products at Kmart, then put them on the conveyor in a certain order, so that when she got her receipt, she said, the first letters on the itemized list spelled "Martha Stewart's hell."
There is also Andrew Lynn, who created Whirl-Mart last year. He gets a group of people together, everyone with a shopping cart, and they stroll the aisles of Wal-Mart or Kmart, putting nothing in the carts. When store managers tell him to take his protest elsewhere, he tells them: "This isn't a protest. We're performing a consumption-awareness ritual."
There may be something to it, too. Psychologists at the University of Rochester and at Knox College in Illinois have published studies concluding that people focused on "extrinsic" goals like money are more depressed than others and report more behavioral problems and physical discomfort.
Some economists have also addressed the phenomenon of rich people who feel poor. Juliet B. Schor of Harvard University, the author of "The Overspent American" (Basic Books, 1998), says people are frustrated because they compare their lives with what they see on television. Robert H. Frank of Cornell reached a similar conclusion in "Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of Excess" (The Free Press, 1999).
It's not that Reverend Billy thinks no one should ever buy anything; on a recent afternoon, he himself was seen purchasing a ream of printer paper and a bottle of wine. It is the futility of shopping he is trying to address -- the futility of leaning too heavily on the material at the expense of the spiritual and emotional.
That mission has given focus to his art, his politics and even his religion. Raised by what he calls "strict Dutch Calvinists" in Rochester, Minn., he made his way to New York in the early 1990's. He had his epiphany in 1999, when protesters disrupted the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle; he discovered the potential of drama to send a political message.
He discussed the revelation with a friend, Sidney Lanier, an Episcopal minister and cousin of Tennessee Williams who had used theater to evoke social reform themes in the 1960's. Mr. Talen soon realized that after years of producing Spalding Gray and others, he suddenly had an act of his own.
Mr. Lanier said he suggested a man of the cloth as a vehicle for Mr. Talen's message. "I encouraged him," he said. "I said, you have a kind of Calvinist preacher in you that wants to come out."
Mr. Talen, even before he developed the character, said he admired the cadence and the poetry of good fire and brimstone. Child labor, environmental damage and evidence of union busting by big retail chains, all to deliver low prices to consumers, provided plenty of material for any pulpit. "I sense right now that our lives are getting absurd," he said.
On a recent evangelical side trip, Mr. Talen ventured into the Kmart on Astor Place, where speakers blared Elvis and Tom Petty Christmas carols. His own face blank, he began to look for smiley-faces, which he considers one of the most nefarious of marketing tools. He found them on signs, on children's pajamas, on stickers. Few of the shoppers, however, were smiling, he noticed. And that is part of the problem.
"The smile has been so thoroughly appropriated by transnational capital," he said. "They discovered that smiling makes money." 
When he left Kmart, he walked down Lafayette Street, bellowing now and then in character about how creeping consumerism threatens the fabric of society, in the form of chain stores, sweatshops and more.
But to the public, it mostly just means more stuff to buy at a good price. Indeed, it is no surprise that Reverend Billy has not had much of an impact. Even this year, considered to be a particularly disappointing Christmas shopping season, Americans are still expected to spend almost $1 trillion at stores, restaurants and auto dealers in the last three months of 2002, up perhaps 3 to 4 percent from the year before.
"They don't care!" Reverend Billy shouted to no one in particular on a dark stretch of Lafayette Street, as people carrying shopping bags from J. Crew, Macy's and the Gap poured into a nearby subway entrance.
"They do care," a bearded man beside a scaffolding replied. "They just have a bad attitude."
"Hallelujah!" Reverend Billy said. He says that a lot.
The Reverend Billy made his first formal appearance at the Disney store in Times Square, circa 1998. He was driven away in a police car, his wrists still cuffed to a large statue of Mickey Mouse. The store has since closed.
He has found other targets; in general, he selects large global companies that he feels are inappropriately seizing control. In 1999, he zeroed in on Starbucks. He was pleased to discover later that he had become the subject of a company memo.
"Reverend Billy sits quietly at a table with devotees and then begins to chat up the customers," the memo, dated April 24, 2000, reads. "He works the crowd with an affirming theme but gradually turns on Starbucks. Toward the end, he's shouting." And it adds: "According to a store manager, he may stand on your tables."
Audrey Lincuff, a Starbucks spokeswoman, confirmed the authenticity of the memo -- and disputed the accuracy of Reverend Billy's message, at least as it pertains to Starbucks. "We consider ourselves to be locally relevant where we do business," she said, "and work very hard to weave ourselves into the fabric of the community by associating and working with nonprofit groups and other community groups." The company's goal, she added, is to "connect with our customers not only on a business level but on things that are important to them in their lives."
Reverend Billy says he tries to remain relatively low key. "I'm against a lot of political people who have become fundamentalists themselves," he said. He doesn't like the anti-fur people who ridicule pedestrians in fur coats or hats, for example. He is a latte drinker, though he doesn't order it at Starbucks.
He wants to help awaken desensitized shoppers, he says, because "they are underestimating the complexity and beauty of life." And besides, "they are definitely underestimating the impact of shopping."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
President Makes Case That North Korea Is No Iraq

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Dec. 31 

 BODY:
President Bush drew a sharp distinction today between the nuclear standoff with North Korea and his confrontation with Iraq, saying he was certain that weapons projects in North Korea could be stopped "peacefully, through diplomacy." He said that Saddam Hussein, on the other hand, "hasn't heard the message" that he must disarm, or face military action.
 Answering questions on his way into the only coffee shop in this one-stoplight town near his ranch, Mr. Bush issued no demands that North Korea halt the nuclear programs it has threatened to restart, and he did not mentioned the ouster today of the international inspectors who have monitored activity at the country's primary nuclear site. 
 "I believe this is not a military showdown, this is a diplomatic showdown," the president said, on his way to get a cheeseburger and to chat with his neighbors here. 
But the president's tone and his warnings changed noticeably when he turned to Iraq. He cited Mr. Hussein's effort to build a nuclear weapon in the early 1990's and said that as of now "we don't know whether or not he has a nuclear weapon."
Assessing the nuclear capability of both North Korea and Iraq has been among the most difficult tasks facing Western intelligence agencies. The Central Intelligence Agency and Britain's intelligence service have publicly estimated it would take Iraq five years to develop such a weapon -- or a single year if Mr. Hussein was provided with fissile material. North Korea already has two weapons, according to C.I.A. estimates, and could build five or six more in the next six months if it reprocessed its large stockpile of spent nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium.
Adding to the pressure, North Korea took another step today toward removing its nuclear program from international controls by strongly suggesting it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Page A9. 
The signals Mr. Bush sent with his comments were particularly significant because the administration has come under increasing criticism, from Democrats and some Republicans, for playing down the significance of North Korea's actions while plowing forward in the confrontation with Iraq. 
In The New York Times today, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote that unless Mr. Bush had classified evidence of greater Iraqi military capability than was known to the public, "the threats from North Korea and from international terrorism are more imminent than those posed by Iraq."
Mr. Bush took issue with that view today. Asked whether the United States could afford the $50 billion to $60 billion it would cost to wage war with Iraq, an estimate his budget director offered on Monday, he said, "an attack from Saddam Hussein or a surrogate of Saddam Hussein would cripple our economy." He added, "A Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is a threat to the security of the American people."
In contrast, he said nothing about his view of the threat posed by Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader.
During his presidential campaign, Mr. Bush often cited the possibility of an attack by North Korea as a reason that the United States needed a missile defense system. North Korea already has a significant arsenal of missiles that could reach South Korea, Japan and 100,000 American troops stationed in Asia; Mr. Hussein is believed to possess only Scud missiles with far more limited range.
Nevertheless, Mr. Bush talked at some length today about his worry that Iraq could find a way to attack the United States, either directly or indirectly. As he spoke, a crowd of Crawford residents and curious tourists gathered around the entrance of the coffee shop.
In his comments, Mr. Bush also addressed for the first time the F.B.I. alert issued two days ago, asking Americans to keep a lookout for five people, all of Arab descent, it is searching for in the United States. Mr. Bush said he had authorized the F.B.I. to put out an all-points bulletin. He did not refer to the men as terrorism suspects, but said, "We need to know why they have been smuggled into the country." 
Mr. Bush's comments today about North Korea and Iraq seemed to suggest that he has concluded that Mr. Kim can be persuaded to reverse course under threat of economic pressure, a method that Mr. Bush says has failed with Iraq. He twice noted that in a meeting at his ranch this fall with President Jiang Zemin of China, the two leaders promised to work in concert to deal with the North Korean government.
"Right here in Crawford, we had a dialogue where we both committed ourselves to working in a way to convince Kim Jong Il that it's not in his country's interests to arm up with nuclear weapons," Mr. Bush said, standing in front of the coffee shop in a light windbreaker, after a morning of working around his ranch. "And I believe that can be resolved peacefully." 
China has denounced North Korea's actions, but it has stopped short of saying it will join in any economic sanctions against the country -- a critical omission, because China is one of the North's most important trading partners.
In discussing Iraq, the president told reporters, "I hope we're not headed to war." But he quickly added: "We've got a military presence there to remind Saddam Hussein, however, that when I say we will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him if he chooses not to disarm, I mean it. And we will continue to work to resolve the situation on the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful way."
In private, some of Mr. Bush's aides offer a more explicit explanation of the difference in the administration's approach to the two countries. They argue that the North's existing nuclear capability, and its ability to wreak enormous damage on Seoul with its conventional weapons, has led them to conclude that the United States has no viable military options, at least without risking the rekindling of the Korean War.
Mr. Hussein, they contend, is the more dangerous of the two men, seeking regional domination rather than just survival. They say he must be confronted before he obtains the kinds of weapons of mass destruction that Mr. Kim already possesses.
One of Mr. Bush's senior national security officials argued over the weekend, however, that the United States was not putting North Korea on the back burner while it dealt with Iraq, and did not need to do so. "We can handle both," the official said.
Mr. Christopher's article today suggested that no president, even in a White House as disciplined as this one, could manage that feat.
"Anyone who has worked at the highest levels of our government," he wrote, "knows how difficult it is to engage the attention of the White House on anything other than the issue of the day."

HEADLINE: Land of Opportunity? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A Dec. 30 letter writer correctly points out that the unskilled and unpropertied immigrants of 150 years ago could find employment in manufacturing, while those of today are faced with a stagnant economy and the cold comfort of the welfare rolls. 
 The sad irony is that many of those manufacturing jobs have gone overseas, chasing lower wages and less regulation, to some of the very countries that the contemporary immigrant has left in search of a better life.
Several rungs have been removed from the ladder of upward mobility, and America is no longer the land of opportunity that it once was. 
Perhaps our rhetoric should change to match the realities, and the Statue of Liberty's inscription should read "Stay home and work in the maquiladora -- there's nothing for you here anymore."

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
An Emperor Is Reinvented, A Director Is Criticized

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 1 

 BODY:
Qin Shihuang's fearsome exercise of power 2,200 years ago has been compared to the actions of Napoleon and Stalin, and his bloody legacy remains a raw wound in today's China.
 The Qin emperor was a military adventurer who unified the country for the first time by subsuming six warring states and began to build the Great Wall. Ruthless, he imposed absolute order by executing those suspected of disloyalty. Modern artists approach the subject with caution, in part because Mao Zedong saw the founding emperor as an inspiration and the Communist Party still views the ancient leader as a pointed allegory. 
 So when Zhang Yimou, China's best-known and arguably most talented director, chose the Qin court as the setting for his big-budget martial arts epic "Hero," expectations were high. The director of "Raise the Red Lantern" and "To Live," Mr. Zhang has often explored the emotional whiplash inflicted on common people by China's tumultuous history. He has also infuriated the Beijing government and found himself blacklisted, while delighting many critics. 
But "Hero," despite its complicated subject, has delighted Beijing's mandarins, who are submitting it as China's nominee for best foreign film at the Academy Awards. And it has infuriated some Chinese critics, who have panned Mr. Zhang's plot for promoting a philosophy of servitude.
" 'Hero' does not have the courage to present the massacres Qin Shihuang ordered in the name of peace under heaven," said Tou Jiangming, writing in The Sat-China Weekly. "The history so often questioned by modern thinkers is ignored by Zhang Yimou."
Or as a critic using the pen name Bu Tong put it in The Beijing Youth Daily: "Zhang Yimou's movie has a deep servility inside. He tried to understand what the world looks like from the ruler's standpoint."
This is a little like Fellini suddenly promoting Victorian values. Most of Mr. Zhang's earthy films view the world through the powerless, people stuck in anonymous villages who rely only on inner dignity and intense passions to guide them through a world that takes them for granted.
"Hero" is something new. Mr. Zhang, 51, set out to prove that he could make a Hollywood-style blockbuster that appealed to both Chinese and foreign audiences, while retaining his artistic touch. He may have succeeded.
But he did something else new as well, whether because he needed government support to produce a film of unprecedented cost and scale for China or because he wanted the police to do more to help him fight rampant piracy: he made a movie that those in China's propaganda apparatus are thrilled to promote. After its premiere in mid-December in the Great Hall of the People, the deputy director of the state film bureau, Zhang Pimu (who is no relation to the director), called it "artistic, entertaining and thoughtful."
The $31 million production has an all-star cast of Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi. It has aerial martial arts choreography like that in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," the runaway success directed by Ang Lee. Miramax backed "Hero" and will release it in the United States early in 2003.
Like Mr. Zhang's early films, "Hero" is lyrical. From the lakes of Jiuzhaigou to the forests of Inner Mongolia, Mr. Zhang mixes spectacular natural scenery with his own cinematic vision, producing a colorful slide show of fine art.
The moment of truth in the story, written by Mr. Zhang and two others, comes when Jet Li, playing a nameless assassin, makes a gravity-defying assault on the king of Qin. (The king has not finished subsuming all rival states and creating the Qin empire.) The assassin decides, with a split second to spare, that his highest calling is to abandon his personal quest and let the king unify China. The written Chinese characters "Tian Xia," all under heaven, are the movie's coda.
The king of Qin appears as a misunderstood leader who dispatches his black-armored cavalry to slaughter his neighbors but suffers quiet agony at the pain he must inflict for the common good. 
Mr. Zhang's king even sheds a tear for his converted assassin when, with a flick of his wrist, the king orders his execution.
The historical Emperor Qin left little evidence of his compassion. He replaced feudalism with a merciless monarchy. He killed Confucian scholars and burned their books.
The emperor's ruthlessness left him few admirers until Mao. "Please don't slander Emperor Qin Shihuang, sir," Mao wrote in a 1973 poem. The Communist leader praised the emperor for suppressing Confucian orthodoxy, which Mao despised for its intricate morals.
Today, Qin's rule is not a forbidden subject. But it remains sensitive, particularly after Chen Kaige, Zhang Yimou's peer, covered the same historical ground as "Hero" in his 1998 film, "The Emperor and the Assassin."
Mr. Chen portrayed the emperor as a Shakespearean tyrant whose brutality covers inner shame. The opening scene is of Qin soldiers exterminating a family. To disguise his bastard birth, the emperor does away with his father.
Though the censors allowed it, Mr. Chen was roundly criticized for neglecting the emperor's full record -- his unification of the nation and the building of the Great Wall.
Mr. Zhang has offered varying explanations as to why he took a more sympathetic view. In interviews surrounding the national release of the film, Mr. Zhang initially disavowed any ideology. "The only test of a film's success, especially a martial arts film, is whether it can keep the audience's attention for 90 minutes, not its metaphysics," he said.
But he also explained that he aimed to break the mold of martial arts movies. Too often, he said, they center on the hero avenging a master's death. He wanted his hero to have transcending values. "I wanted to write about people with warm blood," Mr. Zhang said. "People who have faith and ideals."
So what are these ideals? Mr. Zhang quoted a well-known phrase attributed to a Song Dynasty official named Fan Zhongyan: "One should be the first to worry for the future of the state and the last to claim his share of happiness."
Mr. Zhang has not commented on the movie's metaphor for modern politics. But Tony Leung, the Hong Kong actor who plays a peace-loving warrior in the film, made the connection. In an interview with B International, a Hong Kong-based magazine, Mr. Leung said he applauded the message of "peace and human kindness" in "Hero," then reflected on the Beijing government's suppression of a democracy movement 13 years ago.
"During the June 4 incident, I didn't join any demonstrations, because what the Chinese government did was right -- to maintain stability, which was good for everybody," he was quoted as saying.
Mr. Leung later said that his comments had been taken out of context and that he was speaking from the perspective of his character in the film. "My interest is in making movies, not politics," he said.
Mr. Zhang has never been a dissident. But until recently he seemed to enjoy flirting with the limits of China's artistic tolerance. "Red Sorghum," "Raise the Red Lantern" and "Ju Dou" were all set in the pre-Communist era. They were all banned domestically after they were made, though all have since been released. Censors objected, most likely, because they portrayed China as violent, backward and capricious and suggested that the condition was not merely a byproduct of its pre-Communist politics. 
In "To Live," Mr. Zhang extended the theme to Maoist China. The 1994 epic, which won the Cannes Palme d'Or award, is the tale of a couple tumbling through successive historical calamities of China's civil war, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. It has never been legally shown here.
But over the past eight years, as China's economy became more prosperous, Mr. Zhang's films became less provocative. In "Not One Less," which he directed in 1998, a young village schoolteacher goes to great lengths to retrieve a student who ventures into the big city to find work. The teacher's success depends on a soft-hearted official who runs a television station and takes a Rockwellian shine to the peasant girl.
Recently Mr. Zhang has also accepted some official duties. He directed movies to promote China's bid to be host of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and its entry to stage the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai.
He said in a recent newspaper interview that he no longer cares what the critics say because he gets attacked no matter what he does.
"Only one film I've done in my life has not been attacked," he said of his promotional movie for the Olympics competition. "And that's only because Beijing won."

HEADLINE: The Boys in the Bubble 

BYLINE:  By James Ledbetter; James Ledbetter, business editor of Time Europe, is author of the forthcoming "Starving to Death on $200 Million: The Short, Absurd Life of The Industry Standard."

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The year that just ended will be remembered as a year when the failures of America's corporate governance and accounting procedures became widely apparent. But a full reckoning of the Enron-WorldCom era must also take into consideration the ways in which the business press failed, too.
 The late 1990's witnessed an explosion of business media. CNBC became the most profitable cable channel in America. New magazines and Web sites sprang up: Business 2.0, Red Herring, The Street.com and the publication I worked for, The Industry Standard. All purported to untangle the mysteries of the burgeoning Internet economy. 
 Yet for all that increased attention, it's difficult to say that the enlarged business media played a decisive role in exposing the shortcomings of American corporate practices. Indeed, too often the new magazines and Web sites acted as incurious cheerleaders, championing executives and innovative companies without questioning their books. Do a search, for example, of the word "Enron" in the databases of those publications prior to 2000 and you'll find little but praise for its market innovations. 
The mainstream media, too, did its share of hyping the technology boom, but no one did as much evangelizing as the so-called new economy publications. They preached about how technology created new paradigms. But they were frequently slow to note when technology didn't work, or markets didn't exist, and they relied far too much on a handful of self-interested bankers for information.
The billions that poured into Internet companies in the late 1990's usually came through the hands of venture capital firms or large Wall Street brokerage houses, each of whom had a vested interest in the company's success, or at least its rapid growth. But they were often among the only people who had studied the industry closely enough to have an informed opinion, and so they were the ones we called. With the benefit of hindsight, it's now clear that I and others were wrong to rely so heavily on sources who had so much at stake.
I had begun to get an inkling of this in early 1999: while writing about the merger of two large Internet music retailers, I sought a comment from one of the bankers following the stock of the newly formed entity. Yes, he acknowledged, the merger had taken too long to complete, and in the meantime Amazon.com had taken the lead in online compact disc sales. But, he insisted, the management team was solid and the company was on track. I was impressed, and put his endorsement in my story.
In a matter of weeks, I noticed, the bank had dumped all its stock in the merged retailer. I resolved never again to rely on analysts, but I confess that I didn't bring this epiphany to the attention of my colleagues or my readers.
Another part of the problem was that our own businesses were too far inside the beast we were covering. The Industry Standard, which began publishing in 1998, had the same start-up mentality as many of the companies it covered. Inevitably, some of their worldview rubbed off on us. At exotic conferences in Aspen and Barcelona, our management mingled with the leaders of high-flying tech firms, some of whom were simultaneously advertising in the magazine, sponsoring a section of our Web site, speaking at magazine-sponsored conferences they had helped pay for, selling us software and giving colorful quotes to our reporters. This was not a formula for sustained independence.
As we grew -- The Industry Standard sold more advertising pages in the year 2000 than any magazine in America -- we inherited some of the dot-com hubris as well. We spent millions on television advertisements, without being able to track whether they actually brought in subscriptions. The magazine's very success was sometimes a distraction that blurred the difference between us and our sources. Our competitors, too, acted brashly; both Red Herring and Business 2.0 had so many pages of advertising that in order to publish a respectable amount of editorial content in certain issues they simply reproduced articles they had already published. (One editor went so far as to defend the practice, arguing that his magazine had acquired lots of new readers since the articles had first been published.)
The storm of information surrounding the Internet boom was blinding. So many words and press releases were swirling around that it was impossible to know if anything anyone said made a difference. This depressing suspicion was made real for me one morning, when I appeared on CNNfn, the cable network's financial channel, to discuss the state of the market for initial public offerings. I had specifically told the producer that while I could discuss some Internet offerings, I was not an expert on the market for I.P.O.'s. No matter: when I turned up on the screen, the words "I.P.O. analyst" showed up beneath my head.
As if that wasn't bad enough, the anchor then asked me a question about a company called Bamboo.com that was scheduled to issue stock later that week. Unfortunately, I had never heard of Bamboo.com, so I found myself improvising.
Here's what I said, warts and all: "Bamboo.com is a specialized technology and Internet company that does certain kinds of currency exchanges. Internet currency exchanges, I should say, come up with a specialized currency just for the Internet and it's one that people are looking at. I'm not convinced that's an absolute winner."
It's not just the grammar that was off. Bamboo.com was an online real-estate company that specialized in a technology that allowed for 360-degree images on the computer screen. Could I have said no comment? Sure, I suppose, and I was furious with myself.
Equally disturbing, though, was the fact that it just didn't matter. The stock doubled in value on its first day of trading, and no one from the company ever bothered to contact me to correct my error. The froth of stock trading during that period obscured the facts and, it seemed, even the need for facts.
It would be wrong to blame the news media alone for the business debacle. If a company sets out to mislead regulators and investors, and finds a prestigious accounting firm willing to sign off on baked books, it's extremely difficult for an outside reporter to uncover the truth, especially on deadline. And there were plenty of occasions when The Industry Standard and others did diligently expose practices of tech and financial companies that seemed less than above-board; we wrote about questionable sales tactics at America Online and tried to curb enthusiasm for Priceline's discount grocery service, which has since failed.
But on balance I think even the best new economy journalists could not shout down the hype coming from the bankers and public relations machines. (And when the banking and advertising money stopped flowing, journalism was not enough to keep us alive.) I'd like to believe that those of us who witnessed the tech bubble will be smart enough to prick the next bubble that comes along before too many investors get duped. Encouragingly, some improvements have been made; CNBC now usually identifies whether a banker it is interviewing owns stock in or does business with the companies being discussed on the air. 
But in more skeptical moments, I fear that the rise of any boom sector in the American markets will bring with it an attending press that is at least compliant, if not out-and-out boosterish. Editors and reporters need to be able to resist the notion that any single development in technology or business creates a new economy that defies traditional laws of business. That's not a problem that the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress can solve.

 BODY:
ROY COOPER pawed through hundreds of tapestries, searching for a fetching combination of colors and print. Nothing caught his eye until a tiny, toothless woman wearing a felt fedora and dozens of gold necklaces presented a black and tan rug with geometric patterns. 
 "Runners in dark shades and earth tones, that's all anyone wants," Mr. Cooper, a 52-year-old Kentucky native, said in Spanish with a thick Southern drawl. "The gringos won't pay a dime these days for the brightly colored rugs, so forget the reds and pinks." 
Mr. Cooper, who has lived in Quito with his Ecuadorean wife, Eulalia, for 23 years, bargained the price from $12 to $10, purchased the Navajo-style floor runner and lit a cigarette to celebrate: The rug will likely fetch $30 or more at auction on eBay, where he sells tapestries, baskets and religious relics at substantial markups. Mr. Cooper, who devotes 15 hours a week to buying, listing and shipping eBay items, clears roughly $1,300 a month from his online business, and up to $2,500 each November and December.
 By contrast, the World Bank estimates that the average Ecuadorean earns $1,460 a year. 
 Mr. Cooper's business puts him in an elite group in Ecuador, not only by virtue of his income but also because of the tools with which he makes it. Of Ecuador's 13 million people, only 2.7 percent have been online, according to the government-owned communications company, Conatel. 
 Internet entrepreneurs flourish in Ecuador's largest cities, but many are educated businessmen with ties to the United States. Thousands of households in Quito (the capital) and Guayaquil (the largest city) have Internet access, but few rural communities have telephone lines. 
 The discrepancies make experts pessimistic. They worry that the rapid pace of change in the technology industry will cause third-world nations like Ecuador to slip further behind Europe and North America. 
 "In the late 1990's, everyone jumped up in arms over the digital divide, but it has proven almost impossible to bridge," said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy-analysis center, and an expert on Latin America. "It is a region of inequality. Why would access to technology be any different than access to education, health care, employment or financial aid?"
 In 2000, fewer than 1 percent of Ecuadoreans had sent e-mail or surfed the Web at home, school or work or in cybercafes. In August 2001, in an effort to expand access, the government created the National Connectivity Commission. Public "telecentros" have sprung up to provide free Internet access -- under the auspices of nonprofit groups for which the commission helps find donors -- and home connections, previously timed by the minute, are now available for a flat rate of about $25 a month. 
 "I know that in five years, most people in Ecuador still won't be able to buy a computer," said Jose Pileggi, president of Conatel, which oversees the connectivity project. "But my hope is that they will at least know that they have access to computers."
 Help may also come from the United Nations, which on Dec. 9 began an Internet initiative in Esmeraldas, one of Ecuador's most impoverished provinces. The project will be run by workers from the United Nations Volunteers and financed by the Ecuadorean government, the World Bank and Japan's International Cooperation Agency, offering "one-stop offices" where fishermen, artisans and other small-business owners can use the Web to find new markets. 
 Ecuador's government is also trying to create a hospitable environment for online businesses. In April, the legislature approved a bill giving electronic documents the same legal status as paper documents and making digital theft a crime.
 Still, Ecuador's politics, economy and geography have proven formidable barriers to Internet access. The most ominous threats are political instability and corruption.
 The connectivity program was the brainchild of President Gustavo Noboa's administration. But the program's fate belongs to President-elect Lucio Gutierrez, who takes office Jan. 15. Mr. Gutierrez, a military coup leader who will become Ecuador's sixth president in six years, did not mention technology or Internet access in his campaign. 
 Even if the program survives, some dismiss it as a potential hotbed of bribery. 
 Ricardo Garcia Fuentes, owner of Limon y Cafe, a cybercafe in the Galapagos Islands, said he and several partners paid about $50,000 to set up satellite Internet access in Puerto Ayora, 600 miles from the mainland. Mr. Fuentes said government officials, primarily from Conatel, the phone company, demanded an additional $300,000 in "startup fees," which he and his partners painstakingly gathered or borrowed from investors, including some in the United States.
 He said it did not matter whether the fees were required tariffs or flagrant bribes; he had to pay them to open his business.
 "We are out here on the vanguard of technology," Mr. Fuentes said in his bar, a tourist haunt with tiki lights and salsa tunes. "But the government makes it too costly. They try to give us a solution but it creates an even bigger headache. There is already too much bureaucracy in this country." 
 What fees the $300,000 represented and where the money wound up is unclear. Several Internet service providers here reported having paid officials similar fees. But the connectivity commission says it neither receives nor solicits payments from prospective Internet service providers, and Mr. Pileggi, the president of Conatel, insisted that no one had to bribe a government official to become a provider.
 In any case, some say corruption may be eroding the commission's fundamental source of revenue -- a tax on phone companies' revenues -- because many officials believe executives understate revenue to minimize corporate taxes. 
 Whatever the integrity of the system, the cost of access is daunting. Mario Ortiz, a Conatel executive in charge of infrastructure, estimated that providing universal Internet access -- including lines to vast tracts of the Amazon jungle -- would be at least $1.9 billion. That is more than one-third of Ecuador's $5.1 billion annual budget. 
 Mr. Ortiz is considering the costs and benefits of connections other than land lines, including spread spectrum, a method developed by the United States military that spreads a narrow-band signal over a broader portion of the radio frequency band. But because of security concerns, he does not want spread spectrum in urban areas.
 In the meantime, Mr. Cooper, in his way, bridges the divide. In addition to selling items on eBay, he takes custom orders when clients want a statue of a specific saint or a rug of particular dimensions. He sees himself as a New Economy intermediary, a man who connects the haves and have-nots of cyberspace.
 "The Indians are very happy to sell me tapestries for $10, even when they know I will turn around and sell them for three times as much," Mr. Cooper said as he packed alpaca rugs, wooden statues and glass-framed Amazon insect collections into his sport-utility vehicle. "These people don't have computers and have never heard of e-commerce." So they are glad to have the $10, he said. For now, at least.

A Piano That Runs Hot and Cold to Keep Itself in Tune

BYLINE:  By IAN AUSTEN 

 BODY:
AS the author of a book about piano technology and the co-curator of an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution celebrating the 300th anniversary of the instrument's invention, Edwin M. Good has examined and played just about every kind of piano there is. They all share at least one trait, he said.
 "All pianos are always out of tune," said Dr. Good, a professor emeritus of religious studies at Stanford University. "A piano is by definition not in tune." 
 That sweeping statement is true: the most common piano tuning, based on what is known as the equal-tempered scale, deliberately alters the pitch of some notes to improve the instrument's overall harmonics. 
 But if all pianos are indeed out of tune, some are more out of tune than others. With temperature and humidity changes, it does not take long for the 88 tones of an acoustic piano to get out of whack. "A very large part of the piano is wood, and wood expands and contracts with changes in humidity," Dr. Good said. 
 While concert pianists can have their instruments tuned shortly before a performance, most pianists just put up with the problem. At best, they might have their pianos tuned once or twice a year.
 Don A. Gilmore, an amateur piano player and professional engineer from Kansas City, Mo., however, has developed an electronic system that he says could allow pianists to tune their own instruments at the touch of a button.
 Most other instruments can be tuned as needed by the person playing them. A violinist, for example, tunes the violin before playing and can even compensate for tuning problems while playing by slightly repositioning the fingers on the strings. With a piano, however, Mr. Gilmore said, "you're at the mercy of the instrument when you play it." 
 When he is not playing Chopin, Mr. Gilmore, 38, spends his time designing customized industrial equipment and factory systems. Early in his career, while developing a machine that used servomotors, which can be commanded to start and stop very precisely, Mr. Gilmore began considering ways that they might be used in a self-tuning piano. 
 The 88 tones of a piano are created by about 250 strings. The lower notes use single strings, while the middle and higher notes use two or three strings each, which helps increase their volume. But multiple strings make tuning more difficult. With a high note, for example, "if any one of the three strings in a note is off a slight amount, it's obvious," Mr. Gilmore said. 
 While briefly unemployed about a decade ago, he developed and later patented his first tuning device. It could mechanically tune three strings simultaneously based on electronic analysis of their sound. 
 That system had some major problems, he said. For one thing, because it used microphones to pick up the tones from the strings, the device could not distinguish very well between individual strings. It was certainly a long way from a self-tuning piano. 
 Yet Mr. Gilmore resumed his efforts after he was informally contacted by QRS Music Technologies, a company that makes paper rolls for old-fashioned player pianos and systems that convert conventional pianos into electronic self-playing instruments. QRS also owns the piano maker Story & Clark. 
 Mr. Gilmore's said his "epiphany" came when he tried using separate magnetic pickups, like those found on electric guitars, for each of the strings. Unlike microphones, the pickups are not affected by adjacent strings or extraneous noise. 
 The pickups, combined with a microprocessor, took care of figuring out how much tuning the piano required. But he still needed to devise some way to do the tuning. "I knew anything mechanical was not going to be reliable," he said. 
 Initially he considered making piano strings from Flexinol, a nickel-titanium shape memory wire, which flexes in specific ways in response to temperature changes. 
 But the final solution was simpler: Mr. Gilmore decided to use heat provided by electricity to expand or contract conventional piano strings and alter their tuning. 
Piano strings are relatively poor conductors of electricity, and their resistance will quickly generate heat when a current is passed through them. Increasing the current will raise a string's temperature and cause it to expand. The expansion decreases the tension of the string, lowering the pitch. Reducing the current makes the string cooler and causes it to contract, increasing tension and raising pitch.
 Working with technicians at QRS, which has licensed the technology, Mr. Gilmore is developing a prototype of the self-tuning piano. He anticipates that once the pianos are in production, their strings will be heated to 95 degrees before being tuned at the factory. That reference tuning would then be stored in the piano's electronic memory. 
 Once at its final destination, the piano will always have to warm up before play. To retune the piano, users will press a button and all of its notes will sound. The computer will compare the results to the reference tuning and raise or lower individual string temperatures as needed. Mr. Gilmore expects the process to take about 20 seconds. 
 The self-tuning piano may still need manual retuning if it goes badly out of tune because of, say, a move from an extremely humid to an extremely dry place. Users would also be able to store the work of their own tuners as the reference if they prefer. 
 Thomas A. Dolan, the president and chief executive of QRS, declined to predict when the first self-tuning piano would come to market or to estimate its price. He said the first product based on some of Mr. Gilmore's technology would probably be a portable tuning aid that will still require manual adjustments of the strings. 
 Mr. Dolan said that when Story & Clark makes its first self-tuning pianos, they will be grand pianos rather than uprights. "You don't want the tuning system to cost twice the value of the piano," he said. 
 Because the pianos are likely to be expensive, he said, he believes that at first they will be purchased mainly by schools and professional musicians. 
 Dr. Good, for one, is unlikely to be interested. "Maybe it works," he said. "But if it works, I'm not sure I want it. Why bother with all this expense when you can just get the piano tuned every three months?"

Dollar's Year-End Plunge Increases Prospects for a Decline

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE dollar ended last year in a precipitous plunge, falling 5 percent against the euro and 3 percent against the yen in December, and it looks to be headed lower in 2003. The question is how much.
 The dollar had been slipping against the euro and the yen since early last year, weakened by sluggish economic growth at home, a falling stock market and wary foreign investors. Lately, the threat of war with Iraq, rising oil prices and other geopolitical uncertainties have been dragging it lower. Still, the off-the-cliff acceleration in December caught many currency analysts by surprise and upset forecasts for 2003. 
 The dollar's fall was so swift that it is already lower now against the euro and the yen than some forecasters had predicted for the end of this year. 
Before last month's drop, forecasters predicting a 15 percent decline in the dollar this year might have seemed on the lunatic fringe, said Lara Rhame, senior foreign exchange economist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "All of a sudden, that doesn't look out of the range of possibilities," she said.
Ms. Rhame is expecting a dollar decline, but maybe not as steep as that. Nor is she saying that the dollar is weak. It will just not be as strong as it has been. On a broad, trade-weighted basis, the average dollar value last year is still the third strongest it has been since the currency began to be freely traded in the early 1970's.
"Until you get another major industrial economy on track with strong productivity growth and high expectations of investment returns, there is not going to be a big flow of foreign money out of the United States," Ms. Rhame said. So, she said, "the dollar can skate through at a relatively strong value."
No matter how far the dollar falls, if that happens, that would be the dollar's first back-to-back annual declines since 1994-95. But a weaker dollar is not necessarily bad. It could help a broader economic recovery by making American exports cheaper and more competitive abroad. American manufacturers that compete against foreign companies -- notably automakers -- would also benefit because the dollar price of imports would rise.
A weaker dollar would also help Americans investing overseas by reducing losses or increasing gains when foreign holdings are translated back into dollars.
Big stock markets abroad were in the red last year, but the weaker dollar trimmed a 43.9 percent decline in Germany's DAX index to 33.9 percent and an 18.6 percent decline in the Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks to 9.8 percent. Foreign bond returns were also enhanced, with the total return from a portfolio of European bonds rising to 28 percent when translated into dollars as a result of a euro gain of just over 9 percent.
The big unknown for the dollar in 2003 is President Bush's dollar policy. The administration has backed a strong dollar, but the desire to ensure that the economy rebounds nicely ahead of the 2004 presidential election may encourage it to shift course and try to nudge the dollar lower. John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary-designate, is likely to be asked repeatedly about his views on the dollar, and each word will be weighed carefully as currency traders look for any sign of support for a weaker dollar. If they see one, they will pounce.
The risk in trying to talk down the value of the dollar is that it could fall much further and faster than Bush policy makers would like. An orderly dollar decline, like the one that occurred last year, is easy for the economy and the financial markets to handle. But a rapid fall could further disrupt the economy.
The dollar fell 15.2 percent last year against the euro, a 12-nation currency, ending 2002 at 1.0492 and giving that currency its first positive year since it was introduced into limited use in January 1999. The dollar also dropped against the currencies of two other big trading partners, falling 9.8 percent against the Japanese yen, to 118.79, and 1.3 percent against the Canadian dollar, to 1.5718 (the Canadian dollar settled at 63.62 cents). Its biggest declines came against the South African rand, off 28.4 percent, and the Norwegian krone, down 22.6 percent.
But the dollar also had some gains, including a rise of 13.2 percent against the Mexican peso, to a rate of 10.37; it surged against the currencies of three economically troubled Latin American nations: Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. This mixed performance means that the broadest measure of the dollar's overall value, a trade-weighted dollar adjusted for inflation, slipped just 1.5 percent in 2002, based on preliminary Federal Reserve data.
While recent forecasts of the dollar's value at year-end may have been overtaken by the December decline, the predictions for the dollar-euro rate included in the December reading by Consensus Economics of London show that there is no unanimity on the dollar's direction. As of Dec. 9, the forecasts ranged from a dollar decline of 12.1 percent to a rise of 9.9 percent against the euro.
Against the yen, the forecasts ranged from a dollar fall of 12.4 percent to a rally of 13.5 percent. The yen forecast is much more difficult because the economic fundamentals militate for a weaker yen and stronger dollar. But Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa of Japan and other government leaders made clear in December that they wanted a weak yen to help exporters and the ailing economy.
The Brazilian real could benefit from the dollar's weakness and rally this year if Brazil's new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, appears to be dealing successfully with the country's economic and debt problems. Mexico's peso is likely to slip a bit further, based on the consensus forecast.
The most interesting offbeat dollar play last year was the Norwegian krone, said Laurie A. Cameron, global currency strategist at the J. P. Morgan Private Bank. With the forecast of a 4 percent rise in the value of the krone against the dollar and 6.5 percent from investing in short-term government securities, this year could bring a return of more than 10 percent.
In addition to being affected by sluggish growth here and a lackluster stock market, the dollar could also be dragged lower by concerns about the size of the United States' current-account deficit, which rose to $127 billion in November, nearly a record. It takes an enormous flow of capital from abroad to cover the deficit, which includes red ink in trade, and that inflow may be slowing, which could weaken the dollar.
Yet the dollar could stage a surprise rally. The geopolitical drag on its value could be lessened if a war with Iraq was averted or if it was successful and over quickly.
While the forecasts of economic growth for the United States are not robust, those for Europe and Japan are still weaker. If the American economy and stock markets move ahead faster than expected, many investors could be drawn back to the United States, pushing up the dollar's value.
A narrowing of the gap in interest rates between Europe and the United States would also make the dollar more attractive. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to 2.75 percent, in December. That is more than double the 1.25 percent benchmark rate set by the Federal Reserve. But that gap could narrow substantially if the European bank cuts rates again and if the Fed begins to raise its benchmark interest rate as the economy finally picks up steam in the second half of 2003.

GRAPHIC: Drawing (Robert Neubecker) Chart: "The Pendulum Swings"In 2002, the dollar fell against the currencies of many American trading partners -- including the European Union, Canada and Japan -- and the lackluster United States economy could cause it to fall further. But even with a modest decline this year, the dollar would still be relatively strong compared with its recent history.

Investors, Bruised, Hope It's Over

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE dominant image of the stock market tumble that began nearly three years ago has been a bursting bubble. And while it was true that the worth of many companies was inflated beyond all reason, it turns out that deflating those valuations did not immediately reveal all the damage.
 Instead, the decline in stocks took its time in damaging the economy, much as a domino near the end of a line can topple long after the first ones fall. 
 The first pain was felt by millions of investors, who lost billions but proved surprisingly resilient. The fact that consumers kept spending helped keep the 2001 recession mild. 
But it soon became clear that sales at companies that had prospered most during the boom, notably telecommunications concerns, were going to remain depressed. Forecasts of an early revival were consistently wrong, and now some companies have put off their hopes for growth until 2004.
Only in 2002 did it become clear just how far this string went -- from the federal government to city halls. Governments had been dependent on the revenue-producing effects of the bubble -- particularly income taxes on profits from cashed-in stock options. Now state and local governments are being forced to reduce spending sharply and raise taxes, moves that will slow the economy.
What's left to tumble? Consumer behavior is the area that many economists are watching. Reports of disappointing Christmas spending could be an indication that high debt levels are finally slowing purchases. But housing remains strong, and thanks to low interest rates, most consumers have ample income to pay interest charges on the money they owe.
Productivity numbers have remained strong, providing a source of reassurance that the economy remains healthy. But it is possible that the good news could end in 2003.
"If the productivity numbers reflected the wild and excessive investments," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, a Wall Street firm, "productivity might begin to fade" since bubble-related capital spending has collapsed. He said some research showed a two-year delay in the impact of investments on productivity numbers.
And then, of course, there are signs of a weakening dollar, high oil prices and the prospect of war with Iraq, with a possibly messy aftermath, to give investors pause.
But to some bulls, the real issue is not so much whether the economic outlook is bright, but whether share prices fell far enough to more than compensate for the remaining risks. There were signs within the market, including widespread bearishness and a big increase in volatility, that a turning point was reached when stocks bottomed on Oct. 9.
There are also historical precedents. It's been seven decades since the last time the market went down in four consecutive years -- as would happen if 2003 turned out to be a bad year. And it has been more than six decades since the third year of a presidential election cycle brought lower share prices.
On the other hand, big bear markets are usually followed by bull markets with leadership that is different from the previous bull market. But the rebound since Oct. 9 has been led by technology and telecommunications stocks -- which also led previous rallies in the bear market that began in the spring of 2000. Those earlier rallies all ended with declines that took the market to new lows.
It is hard to remember a time when valuation levels were harder to determine, simply because earnings numbers are now in doubt. Part of that relates to scandals that have led to restatements, and part to a growing sense that the willingness to use numbers that leave out bad news -- so-called pro forma earnings -- created too optimistic a picture.
But some analysts, notably Steve Leuthold of the Leuthold Group, a research firm based in Minneapolis, calculate that valuations had fallen to reasonable levels at the October lows.
Others point out that many companies whose share prices plunged have reported lower profits, and that their stocks still trade at higher multiples of earnings than in pre-bubble years. That is particularly true of large technology stocks. 
For bulls, a tempting comparison is to the mid-1970's, when the stock market fell roughly as far as it did during the bear market that ended -- knock on wood -- in October. From top to bottom in 1973-74, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 48 percent. This time, the decline was 49 percent.
The economic problems of that era were different from today -- rising inflation and economic stagnation were the principal fears -- but the pessimism as the market hit bottom was similar. The pessimists then were right to forecast that the economy would do worse than it had in previous decades. But the stock market still took off in 1975, with the S.& P. 500 gaining 32 percent, although prices did not climb to record levels for several years.
The market in 2002 ended with declines in all the principal gauges for a third consecutive year, something that had not happened since 1939-41. Wall Street forecasters are virtually united in saying the string will stop there, although a year ago they were forecasting that the year just ended would have increases. But on a historical basis, at any rate, they have more going for them now than they had a year ago.
First, the last time that the big indexes had four consecutive declines was in 1929-32. And while this economy has not been especially vibrant, no one is talking about a depression either.
Second, there is the presidential election cycle. For whatever reason -- and cynics have asserted that presidents planning to seek re-election are eager to make things look good in the year when potential rivals are deciding whether to run -- the third year of the election cycle is often the best one.
The last time either the Dow Jones industrial average or the S.& P. 500 fell in the third year of a presidential cycle was in 1939, when World War II began in Europe. (In 1987, there was a crash, but both indexes ended the year with small gains.)
To some extent at least, 2002 was the year that Americans' faith in the stock market was finally shaken. It was the first year since 1988 that Americans took more money out of stock mutual funds than they put in, a fact that is all the more impressive given the automatic investments that come from 401(k) plans and that are counted in the numbers. But the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reports that net withdrawals through November amounted to just 0.7 percent of assets, an indication that investors did not come close to panicking.
To many, investors' continuing faith in stocks makes perfect sense. With interest rates low, savings accounts and even bonds look less attractive than they did during previous market swoons. And even after the recent fall, the Dow has risen at a compound annual rate of 10.9 percent over the last 20 years, excluding dividends. That is better than any 20-year period in the Dow's history before the late 1990's. (In 1929, the peak came with the Dow's having risen at less than a 9 percent annual rate over the previous two decades.)
It may not make investors who entered the market near its peak feel any better, but the recent falls have wiped out only a small part of the gains of the great bull market that began in 1982. (Numerologists take note: In 1982, the Dow bottomed at 776.92; last year, on Oct. 9, the S.& P. hit its year's low at 776.76.)
The declines were widespread in 2002 -- more so than during the previous years of the bear market. Both the Dow and the S.& P. had worse years in 2002 than they experienced in either 2000 or 2001. The S.& P. 500's decline of 23.4 percent was the steepest for any full year since the fall of 29.7 percent in 1974, and every sector in the index posted declines. Just 131 of the 500 stocks rose -- the lowest number for any year since the S.& P. began tracking that statistic in 1980.
The Dow, which was blessed by its relatively low level of technology stocks, fell just 16.8 percent, but that was still the worst since 1977. And of the 30 Dow stocks, only 3 -- Eastman Kodak, Procter & Gamble and 3M -- showed gains for the year. 
Volatility also rose to levels rarely seen before. About one trading day in two had the S.& P. 500 and the Dow rise or fall more than 1 percent, and on average they had moves of at least 2 percent once a week. For the S.& P., volatility was the highest since 1938. For the Dow, it was greater than in any year since 1933.
Volatility in the Nasdaq composite was even greater, with 67 percent of sessions showing moves of at least 1 percent. But that was down from a peak of 75 percent set in 2000.
Volatility often peaks around the time markets change directions, and that may have been true in 2002. The S.& P. 500 showed moves of at least one percentage point in 15 consecutive sessions ended Oct. 11, a period that included the market's bottom on Oct. 9. Since World War II, the longest such string had been nine days, ended Oct. 21, 1974. That volatility came just after the end of the 1973-74 bear market.
The recovery since Oct. 9 indicates that the market is forecasting no new recession, even if the economy is not expected to return to the days of heady growth that investors once took for granted.
"I am increasingly impressed at the remarkable resilience of this economy," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told the Economic Club of New York last month. Investors hope that he will continue to feel that way.

Mild Rebound Is Seen in Initial Stock Offerings Worldwide

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
COMPANIES like Verizon Wireless and the Guangdong Grid Company of China may help initial public offerings rise worldwide this year as faster economic growth in the United States and Asia increases demand for equity, investors and bankers say.
 "People are more optimistic about economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere" this year, "which makes them more comfortable about buying equity," said David Chapman, who helps manage $650 million in global shares at Towry Law Asia in Hong Kong. "I'm getting ready for increased new issuance over the next 12 months." 
 Also, rising stock prices worldwide may encourage more companies to sell shares to the public. 
Even so, global stock markets and economies are not expected to rebound fast enough to lift initial share sales to the levels seen in 2000. In Europe, initial offerings are unlikely to top the $12.8 billion raised in 2002. The region's biggest initial offering of 2003, the French government's sale of shares in the gas utility Gaz de France, is expected to raise 6 billion euros ($6.26 billion).
First-time stock sales worldwide slid 30 percent, to $66 billion, in 2002, the lowest in at least four years, Bloomberg data shows. Consequently, underwriting fees for the Goldman Sachs Group, Merrill Lynch and other securities firms fell an estimated $900 million.
A rebound in initial offerings would not only enable companies to raise money and help revive stalled economies, but would also bring relief to underwriters. Wall Street firms have cut more than 54,000 jobs since March 2001 as a slump in global stock sales and corporate mergers has eroded investment-banking fees.
Initial offerings generate higher underwriting fees than secondary share sales or corporate bond offerings. Underwriting fees for first-time share sales average about 3 percent of the money raised and can go as high as 7 percent, investment bankers said.
"Business will pick up once C.E.O.'s and boardrooms gain confidence in the economic outlook," said Jim Birle, who helps lead global equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch.
The United States economy will probably expand 2.8 percent this year after growing 2.3 percent in 2002, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey for November. The economy grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter of last year, and consumer confidence rose in December to a four-month high.
Europe and Japan are not sharing in that growth. Germany's economy, the biggest in Europe, may contract in the first quarter as production falls and unemployment rises. Japan's government expects its economy, the world's second-largest, to expand 0.6 percent in the year starting April 1, slowing from a 0.9 percent pace this fiscal year.
Initial public offering volume in the United States will probably pick up along with economic growth by the second quarter and may rise about 15 to 20 percent for the year, underwriters and investors predict. That increase would put offerings as high as $34 billion for the year, well below the levels of 1999 and 2000.
In 2002, offerings in the United States slumped 38 percent from 2001, to $28 billion, making last year's total the smallest raised since the $16.8 billion raised in 1991, according to Dealogic.
The biggest initial offering of 2002 was the sale of the CIT Group by Tyco International in July. It raised $4.87 billion. Travelers Property Casualty, a Citigroup unit, completed a $4.27 billion offer in March.
The Travelers sale helped vault the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup into the top spot among global initial public offering underwriters with $10.1 billion of sales, Bloomberg data shows, up from fourth place in 2001. Goldman, the leader in 2001, fell to second. It kept its place as the biggest underwriter of overall share sales.
This year could see some bigger offerings. The Bloomberg IPO Index, which tracks the performance of American stocks in their first year of trading, has risen 17 percent since Oct. 9.
"That suggests to us a nice 2003" for offerings, said Kathleen Shelton Smith, one of the managers of Renaissance Capital's $15 million IPO Plus Fund.
Ms. Smith said she expected Verizon Wireless, the cellphone unit of Verizon Communications, with $16 billion in annual sales, to complete a planned offering in 2003.
Offerings are also expected from Meridian Automotive Systems, Noveon and Loews Cineplex Entertainment, each with $1 billion in annual sales; Converse, the sneakers maker; and Orbitz, the online travel company.
China may generate some of the year's biggest global offerings as its government accelerates sales of state companies. Guangdong Grid, southern China's biggest utility, and the China Netcom Group, the nation's No. 2 fixed-line phone company, each plan initial share sales of more than $1 billion.
Chinese companies sold $4.9 billion of shares in first-time sales in 2002 and may double that figure this year, bankers said. The biggest sales in 2002 were by the Bank of China's Hong Kong unit and the China Telecom Corporation, a unit of the country's leading fixed-line phone company.
"Global markets have suffered, but for Asia, particularly North Asia, it's been business as usual," said Stephen Metcalfe, head of Asian equity syndication for Credit Suisse First Boston, who helped sell $286 million of shares for China Oilfield Services in November. This year in Asia, he said, "is going to be all about China, China, China."
Asian companies outside Japan raised $19 billion from first-time domestic and overseas share sales last year, with $15 billion coming from China. Including Japan, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 39 percent of initial offerings globally, Bloomberg data shows.
In Europe, companies are postponing planned offerings as the continent's biggest economies lag behind American growth.
Europe's biggest share sale this year may be by a company that is already publicly traded. France Telecom, Europe's most indebted phone company, plans to sell additional stock worth as much as 15 billion euros ($15.65 billion) in the first quarter. France's government also plans to sell remaining stakes in companies including Renault, the auto maker.
In Japan, where the stock market lost value for a fifth year in six, the largest share sales planned are secondary sales by the government.
The biggest due this year is the sale of a government stake worth about $2 billion in Japan Tobacco, the nation's cigarette-manufacturing monopoly. The sale was scrapped in July because of stock market declines.

Pressure Points for Oil Market: Venezuela, Iraq, Nigeria . . .

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
PREDICTING that oil prices may be volatile in any given year is to state the obvious. But so many political and economic trends are at play now, oil analysts say, that 2003 might turn out to be the rockiest year in a decade.
 "Every factor that could affect the oil market is with us this year," said Amy Myers Jaffe, senior energy adviser at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. 
 "There could be war in the Middle East," Ms. Jaffe said. "There is Venezuela. There is the possibility of a price war between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. How about labor unrest in Nigeria? It could happen. This year could be the roller coaster ride of roller coaster rides." 
Light sweet crude ended 2002 at $31.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price of oil averaged about $26 a barrel in 2002, a result in large part of a series of production cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The full impact of those cuts came to bear on global markets near the end of summer, just as the Bush administration began to threaten Iraq with war. 
The war premium ebbed once United Nations weapons inspectors arrived in Baghdad. But prices surged again in December -- reaching a two-year high -- when widespread protest in Venezuela against President Hugo Chavez brought oil production there to a standstill. Venezuela is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States, accounting for 9 percent of the nation's daily supply of crude oil. 
Then, by the end of the year, the possibility of war loomed once again, after the Bush administration declared that Iraq was in material breach of resolutions from the United Nations.
The confluence of turmoil in Venezuela and Iraq poses a grave threat to the oil markets, analysts said, because OPEC has the spare capacity to make up for supply disruptions from one place, but not both. "They cannot handle a combination of the Venezuelans and an Iraqi disruption," said Edward L. Morse, executive adviser at the Hess Energy Trading Company.
"All the OPEC countries are producing all out," he added.
By the end of the year, American consumers were already getting a bitter taste of rising prices. Oil prices increased 16 percent in December alone, because of the strife in Venezuela.
There is always a lag of a few weeks between a rise in crude oil prices and a corresponding climb in retail prices. But when it came, it was significant: in one week in late December, gasoline and heating oil prices increased 4 percent.
As both sides in Venezuela retrenched at the end of 2002, it appeared that more retail price increases were likely. And the longer prices remain above $30 a barrel, the more they threaten to weaken the already anemic economic recovery. Even if the Venezuelan conflict is resolved soon, industry analysts say, it will take weeks for Venezuelan oil exports to reach normal levels. 
Increasingly, industry analysts and oil traders have called on the Bush administration to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to ease the supply shortage. But they also concede that the administration may be waiting to gauge what the full impact of a war in Iraq could be on the oil market, and to release crude oil from the reserve only then.
A war in Iraq raises concerns not just about Iraqi supplies, which were intermittent through much of 2002 anyway, but also about other supplies. Oil traders worry that a war could disrupt oil supplies from Iraq's Persian Gulf neighbors. Would the Iraqis bomb Saudi oil fields and sites? Or would Saudi extremists themselves try to sabotage them? 
But most analysts agree that whatever disruptions might occur, they will probably not come in the form of oil embargoes like those of the early 1970's, which still haunt many people in the West.
"People have to stop thinking that oil markets will be affected by embargoes, because embargoes are a thing of the past," said Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan minister of trade and industry and now editor of the journal Foreign Policy.
"The problem is failed states," Mr. Naim said. "It's a harbinger of things to come: when internal political turmoil limits oil to world markets."

From Steel to Copper and Zinc, Commodity Prices Surge

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE traditional interpretation for a sharp rise in commodity prices -- and one occurred last year -- is that the global economy is picking up speed and a rise in inflation lies ahead.
 But it is not clear at all that either outcome is in store this year, despite a 15.9 percent climb in 2002 in industrial commodity prices from copper and zinc to oil and steel. 
 Overall commodity prices, including agricultural products and precious metals, were up 23 percent, led by a 57.3 percent surge in crude oil to $31.20 a barrel and a 24.8 percent jump in gold to $348.20 an ounce. Cotton prices, lifted by the damage to the fields in the South from a hurricane and a tropical storm in the fall and rain since, jumped 43.7 percent to 51.16 cents a pound last year. 
Several economists said that prices of some industrial commodities were higher for reasons other than a rise in the producer demand that would normally be a precursor to an economic rebound, which could then be followed by a rise in inflation. This means people buying gold as a hedge against inflation may be disappointed.
James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said that oil and steel prices, both of which had a big role in the jump in commodity prices, were pushed up more by changes in supply than demand. Cotton was also powered by damage to production, not demand.
Oil prices rose last year, following a sharp decline at the end of 2001, after members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced their production to stabilize the price. Since then, the threat of a war with Iraq has raised the possibility of Middle East supply disruptions. In addition, the strike that began in Venezuela late last year interrupted production there, pushing crude oil prices even higher.
A resolution of the strike in Venezuela and a quick and successful victory in a war with Iraq could end fears of oil production disruptions, pushing oil prices lower again.
Steel prices surged, in some cases as much as 60 percent, after the Bush administration imposed what it called safeguard tariffs of up to 30 percent in March on a wide range of steel products from Europe, Asia and Latin America. The intention was to protect against a flood of imports that could cripple American steel manufacturers.
The increase in the price of commodities "is not what we hoped it would be -- a sign of the revival of the industrial economy," Mr. Glassman said. "This can't be an economic recovery story because the global economy is so weak, and central banks are still cutting interest rates."
Anirvan Banerji, research director for the Economic Cycle Research Institute, said that another factor that might be skewing the rise in commodity prices was the accelerating growth of China's manufacturing sector. "China, we know, is buying like crazy," he said, and is a significant cause of the surge in commodity prices. "It is a bit of a paradox," he added, "because at this point you have a global slowdown."
In fact, Mr. Banerji said that the Journal of Commerce-Economic Cycle Research Institute index of 18 industrial commodities had slowed its pace of increase significantly since the end of June, indicating that the pace of the global industrial economy had also slowed.
As for worries about inflation, Mr. Banerji said: "The deflation from lower labor costs is swamping the pressure from higher commodity prices."
Inflation is not a significant problem at present. The consumer price index is up 2.2 percent over the last 12 months through November. But some of the gold buying appears to reflect fears that inflation lies ahead, analysts said. Some investors seem to think that Federal Reserve policy makers are so determined to avoid deflation that they will probably err toward inflation.
Other factors that contributed to gold's rise, the best annual percentage gain since 1979, were a weakening dollar and the threat of a war in Iraq, although some longtime supporters of gold try to play down the war threat. "I can't say it's not a marginal factor, but it's overrated as a factor," said John Hathaway, a gold fund portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management. "The principle reason is that alternative areas of investment are terrible and people are losing confidence."
A change of heart by speculators, who are now willing to bet on a rise in the price of gold rather than a decline, also helped. One reason for this attitude adjustment is a big change in the approach to hedging by gold producers.
In the last decade, many gold producers hedged and thus put downward pressure on the price of gold. To hedge, producers borrow gold and sell it, locking in the current price plus a premium by investing the proceeds in government securities. In the last two years, hard-line gold producers, who oppose hedging because of its impact on the gold price, have convinced the hedgers to stop or cut back. As a result, gold has had a floor around $300 an ounce, and the odds of rallies lasting are better than they were.

HEADLINE: INAUGURAL IN ALBANY: THE COMPTROLLER; 
After Bruising Defeat in Mayoral Primary, a Safe Landing in Albany

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 1 

 BODY:
Shortly after he finished fourth in the 2001 New York City Democratic mayoral primary, with 30 years in public life at a bitter end, Alan G. Hevesi decided he could not stay out of what he calls "the business."
 He geared up for one more race, the open state comptroller seat, and worked up the nerve to break the news to his wife, Carol. He did it on a long-promised Caribbean cruise, on the third night, after she had won $30 in Caribbean poker. 
 "We went on a cruise," Mr. Hevesi, 62, said, "and I came back a candidate." 
Today, after a narrow victory on Nov. 5 over the Republican candidate, John J. Faso, Mr. Hevesi completed a remarkable political resurrection as he took the oath of office as state comptroller. Mr. Hevesi succeeds H. Carl McCall, a fellow Democrat, who was defeated in his run for governor against Mr. Pataki. 
Mr. Hevesi will oversee the health of the $102 billion state pension fund, the second largest in the nation and one that serves 307,000 retirees, and keep watch over the fiscal practices of state and local governments. It is a job with numbers and the technical detail that Mr. Hevesi, a former New York City comptroller, said he relishes and no doubt will feed his reputation as a wonk.
To become the new face in Albany (though he did serve 22 years in the Assembly a decade ago), Mr. Hevesi turned aside lucrative offers in private business and academia, he said. He was a professor of public affairs and government and taught part-time while serving as city comptroller from 1994 to 2001.
But such offers did not soothe the itch for politics and public service, he said. "It's nice to be back in the business," Mr. Hevesi said in an interview this week. And at a reception today for him and the only other statewide elected Democrat, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, Mr. Hevesi soaked up his newfound glory, dispensing kisses and back-slaps and even signing a few autographs.
Mr. Hevesi returns to Albany at a sober time, with the economy sagging and a likely battle between the governor and the Legislature over how to close a coming state budget deficit that is estimated to be as high as $10 billion. Mr. Hevesi, in the spirit of Mr. Pataki's call for a 5 percent reduction in state spending, has ordered a 5 percent cut from his own budget over the next 15 months. That comes to $6.7 million out of the $128 million that is state-financed in his $204 million budget. The savings, he said, will be achieved in part by a reduction in the 2,400-person staff, mainly through attrition but, if need be, layoffs.
His staff is also conducting a review of the pension fund investments. The fund, like almost all others, has shrunk from a high of about $127 billion in 2000 to about $102 billion now because of the moribund stock market. He said he soon would make proposals to spur private investment in the state.
But at a time when the state's fiscal crisis is paramount, Mr. Hevesi promised to use his office's bully pulpit to the fullest with close scrutiny of the budget, even though he considers Mr. Pataki a "good friend." He has already gone on record with misgivings over Mr. Pataki's plan to help close the deficit by selling bonds backed by money from the tobacco-suit settlement. Mr. Hevesi called such a move, which needs the endorsement of the Legislature, hasty.
Yet Mr. Hevesi is not known to be particularly adversarial. While he was city comptroller, his confrontations with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani were few; most notable was his 1995 lawsuit to block Mr. Giuliani from selling the city water system. Nonetheless, they had a tremendous impact on his political career: Mr. Giuliani became a bitter foe, targeting Mr. Hevesi for defeat in the mayoral primary and re-emerging as the campaign manager for Mr. Faso, his competitor in the state comptroller's race. 
Mr. Hevesi said he preferred to work with his adversaries rather than confront them.
"We're an independent agency," Mr. Hevesi said, "and my job is not to fight. But if we disagree, we'll disagree."
Budget monitors said they had confidence that he would pick the right battles.
"I think people have pretty high expectations of Alan," said Charles Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, which monitors the city and state. "I don't think he went out of his way to pick fights with Rudy Giuliani, but he certainly stood up to him in important moments."
Mr. Hevesi said he did not plan to move to Albany but would continue to live in New York City and spend three or four days a week in the capital, as Mr. McCall did.
He said he looked forward to returning to Albany, where as a statewide elected official his name will inevitably arise in discussions about candidates for offices like governor or United States senator.
"I don't close the door on anything," Mr. Hevesi said with a smile. "I would be content if I served as comptroller for the next 20 years."

HEADLINE: U.S. TV Shows Losing Potency Around World 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Want to catch the latest episode of the CBS hit "C.S.I." in France? Tune in Saturdays at 11 p.m. How about the CBS show "Judging Amy" in Singapore? Try weekdays at midnight. 
 Those programs would have been candidates for prime time several years ago. But today American dramas and sitcoms -- though some remain popular -- increasingly occupy fringe time slots on foreign networks, industry executives say. Instead, a growing number of shows produced by local broadcasters are on the air at the best times. 
 "Whereas American TV shows used to occupy prime-time slots, they are now more typically on cable, or airing in late-night or weekend slots," said Michael Grindon, president of Sony Pictures Television International. 
The shift counters a longstanding assumption that TV shows produced in the United States would continue to overshadow locally produced shows from Singapore to Sicily. The changes are coming at a time when the influence of the United States on international affairs has chafed friends and foes alike, and some people are expressing relief that at least on television American culture is no longer quite the force it once was.
"There has always been a concern that the image of the world would be shaped too much by American culture," said Dr. Jo Groebel, director general of the European Institute for the Media, a nonprofit group.
The American studios priced themselves out of the market just as competition began to heat up abroad from newly privatized commercial broadcasters and upstart cable and satellite networks, industry executives say. Given the choice, they add, foreign viewers often prefer homegrown shows that better reflect local tastes, cultures and historical events. A recent example is "The Tunnel," a miniseries about escapees from East to West Germany, which was the eighth most popular show in Germany last year.
Unlike in the United States, commercial broadcasting in most regions of the world -- including Asia, Europe and to a lesser extent Latin America, which has a long history of commercial TV -- is a relatively recent development.
A majority of broadcasters in many countries were either state-owned or state-subsidized for much of the last century. Governments began to relax their control in the 1980's by privatizing national broadcasters and granting licenses to dozens of new commercial networks. The rise of cable and satellite pay television increased the spectrum of channels.
Relatively inexperienced and often financed on a shoestring, these new commercial stations needed hours of programming -- fast. The cheapest and easiest way to fill air time was to buy shows from American studios, and the bidding wars for popular shows like "Dallas" or "Twin Peaks" were fierce.
The big American studios took advantage of that demand by raising prices and forcing foreign broadcasters to buy less-popular programs if they wanted access to the best-selling shows and movies.
"The studios priced themselves out of prime time," said Harry Evans Sloan, chairman of SBS Broadcasting, a Pan-European broadcaster. Mr. Sloan estimates that over the last decade, the price of American programs has increased fivefold even as the international ratings for these shows have declined. "You cannot win a prime-time slot with an American show anymore," he said.
In general, shows are priced by ratings. A foreign station would pay less for an American show that was shown at an off-peak time.
At the same time, politicians, concerned about the cultural influence of the United States, set quotas on American content. In one example, Dr. Groebel of the media institute said, French officials became alarmed when an increasing number of adolescents appearing in court addressed the judge as "your honor," a term gleaned from American detective shows.
But television executives point out that some American shows, like "The Shield" and "Sex and the City," still attract a large number of foreign viewers. And some still generate huge bidding wars. Channel 4 in England was recently reported to have agreed to pay $1.5 million an episode for "The Simpsons." Over all, they said, foreign demand for American shows has actually increased as the number of channels, including cable and satellite, has grown.
A worldwide economic boom has brought foreign broadcasters more advertising revenue, which they have invested in local programming. Initially, many shows emulated successful American formats. In Germany, for instance, a long-running hit called "Das Traumschiff," or the "Dream Ship," is a remake of the American hit "Love Boat." But increasingly, homegrown programs mined historical events that resonated with their audience or added local twists to popular myths.
According to a survey by the European Audiovisual Observatory, the highest ranking show in Italy last year was "Uno Bianca," a dramatization based on a crime gang. No. 1 in France was "Julie Lescaut," a long-running detective series.
First-run domestic fiction programs in the five largest European Union countries -- Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain and France -- increased 5.7 percent in 2001 and have grown 43 percent since 1996, the European Audiovisual Observatory recently reported.
That pattern has played out in many countries around the world. A 2001 survey by Nielsen Media Research found that 71 percent of the top 10 programs in 60 countries were locally produced in 2001, representing a steady increase over previous years. American movies on television still drew big ratings, grabbing 9 percent of the top 10 slots, but American dramatic or comedic series typically rated much lower than local shows.
In South Korea, for instance, the top-rated show in the third week of last September was "The Era of the Abandoned Hero," a locally produced soap opera that attracted 22.7 percent of the population. By contrast, the highest-rated nonlocal show, "C.S.I.," drew just 2.7 percent of all Koreans tuning in that week.
American shows, which are usually dubbed, fared even worse elsewhere in Asia, where they took a back seat to programming from Britain and China. In Malaysia, the highest-rated nonlocal show for the same week in September was "Mr. Bean," a British comedic series, and in Indonesia there was the Chinese movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
One exception is Japan, which has historically shown little American programming but is now giving prime-time slots to some shows. TV Asahi, for instance, is running the former Fox Network show "Dark Angel" on Mondays at 8 p.m. And in Latin America, where there has always been a more vibrant commercial broadcasting industry, networks have tended to devote more time to local programming, mainly to soap operas called telenovelas.
Some foreign producers have even turned the tables on American studios by pioneering new formats, like reality television, that they exported to the United States. John de Mol, chief executive of Endemol, a Dutch company that produced the original "Big Brother" and now licenses the show to broadcasters around the world, including CBS, said that American studios had initially overlooked the reality format. "They were playing it safe," he said.
The change has important implications for the future of television financing, analysts who follow the industry said.
American broadcasters are still the biggest buyers of American-made television shows, accounting for 90 percent of the $25 billion in 2001 sales, according to Wilkofsky Gruen Associates, a consulting firm. But international sales, which totaled $2.5 billion last year, often make the difference between a profit and a loss on a show, executives said.
As the pace of foreign sales slows -- the market is now growing at 5 percent a year, down from the double-digit growth of the 1990's -- studio executives are rethinking production costs. Sony, for instance, has cut its production schedule by two-thirds, Mr. Grindon said.
Some studios, like Sony, are countering the trend by opening production centers abroad to better create shows tailored to local tastes.
"Mein Leben und Ich," a German show produced by Sony that translates as "Me and My Life," about the angst of a teenage girl, is shown on Friday evenings at 9:15 and is first in its time slot. "A Rich and Famous Governor," a Sony production about a kindhearted but bumbling government official, has just been approved for broadcast in Hong Kong and China.
And at least in Britain, American media companies may soon play a larger role. Legislation that is expected to become law later this year would relax restrictions on foreign ownership and pave the way for American takeovers of British broadcasters.
Still, the changes are humbling for American studios used to calling the shots abroad. "The worldwide television market is growing," said David Hulbert, president of Walt Disney Television International, "but America's place in it is declining."

HEADLINE: WARMING IS FOUND TO DISRUPT SPECIES 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Global warming is forcing species around the world, from California starfish to Alpine herbs, to move into new ranges or alter habits in ways that could disrupt ecosystems, two groups of researchers say. 
 The two new studies, by teams at the University of Texas, Wesleyan, Stanford and elsewhere, are reported in today's issue of the journal Nature. Experts not associated with the studies say they provide the clearest portrait yet of a biological world driven into accelerating flux by warming caused at least in part by human activity. 
 Plants and animals have always had to adjust to shifting climates. But climate is changing faster now than in recent millenniums, and many scientists attribute the pace to rising concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. 
In some cases, species' ranges have shifted 60 miles or more in recent decades, mainly toward the poles, according to the new analyses. In others, the timing of egg laying, migrations and the like has shifted weeks earlier in the year, creating the potential to separate species, in both time and place, from their needed sources of food.
One academic not associated with the studies, Dr. Richard P. Alley, an expert on past climate shifts who teaches at Pennsylvania State University, said that climate had changed more abruptly a few times since the last ice age and that nature had shifted in response. But, he noted, "the preindustrial migrations were made without having to worry about cornfields, parking lots and Interstates." 
Citing the new work and studies of past climate shifts, Dr. Alley saw particular significance in the expectation that animals and plants that rely on one another were likely to migrate at different rates. Referring to affected species, he said, "You'll have to change what you eat, or rely on fewer things to eat, or travel farther to eat, all of which have costs." 
The result in coming decades could be substantial ecological disruption, local losses of wildlife and extinction of some species, the two studies said.
The authors express their findings with a certainty far greater than in the last decade, when many of the same researchers contributed to reports on biological effects of warming that were published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the top international research group on the issue.
The authors of one of the new Nature papers, Dr. Camille Parmesan, a biologist at the University of Texas, and Dr. Gary Yohe, an economist at Wesleyan University, calculated that many ecological changes measured in recent decades had a 95 percent chance of being a result of climate warming and not some other factor.
"You're seeing the impact of climate on natural systems now," Dr. Yohe said. "It's really important to take that seriously."
Some butterflies have shifted northward in Europe by 30 to 60 miles or more, with the changes closely matching those in average warm-season temperatures, Dr. Parmesan said. The researchers were able to rule out other factors -- habitat destruction, for example -- as causes of the changes. 
Some of these changes meshed tightly with variations in temperature over time. Dr. Parmesan cited bird studies in Britain. There, populations of the great tit adjusted their egg laying earlier or later as climate warmed early in the 20th century, then cooled in midcentury and warmed even more sharply after the 1970's.
Over all, Dr. Parmesan's study found that species' ranges were tending to shift toward the poles at some four miles a decade and that spring events, like egg laying or trees' flowering, were shifting 2.3 days earlier a decade.
Around Monterey Bay in California, warmer waters have caused many invertebrates to shift northward, driving some species out of the bay and allowing others to move in from the south.
Authors of both new papers said they were concerned that such significant ecological changes had already been detected even though global temperatures had risen only about one degree in the last century. 
They noted that projections of global warming by 2100 ranged from 2.5 to 10 degrees above current levels, should concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, which flow mainly from smokestacks and tailpipes, continue to rise. 
By comparison, the world took some 18,000 years to climb out of the depths of the last ice age and warm some five to nine degrees to current conditions.
"If we're already seeing such dramatic changes" among species, "it's really pretty frightening to think what we might see in the next 100 years," said Dr. Terry L. Root, an ecologist at Stanford University who was the lead author of one of the new studies. 
The two teams of researchers used different statistical methods to analyze data on hundreds of species, focusing mainly on plants and animals that have been carefully studied for many decades, like trees, butterflies and birds. Both teams found, with very high certainty, a clear ecological effect of rising temperatures.
Several of the researchers said the effects of other, simultaneous human actions, like urban expansion and the introduction of invasive species, could greatly amplify the effects of climate change.
For example, the quino checkerspot butterfly, an endangered species with a small range in northern Mexico and Southern California, is being pushed out of Mexico by higher temperatures while also being pushed south by growing suburban sprawl around Los Angeles and San Diego, Dr. Parmesan said.
"The butterfly is caught between these two major human factors -- urbanization in the north and warming in the south," said Dr. Parmesan, who has spent years studying shifting ranges of various checkerspot species.
Dr. Alley said the studies illustrated the importance of conducting much more research to anticipate impending harms and devise ways to maintain biological diversity, for instance with green "wildlife corridors" linking adjacent pockets of habitat.

Sobering Up After a Year Of Denial

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE governor used the word "crisis" yesterday. He didn't say he contributed to the crisis. He didn't give its dimensions or say what he was going to do about it other than call for the kind of nonpartisan "unity" that is as alien to Albany as a snowless winter.
 But when Gov. George E. Pataki used that word, "crisis," yesterday, about halfway through his third-term inaugural speech, it was as though he'd shouted it from the roof of the Capitol. 
 "The challenge isn't over," he said in his insistently plaintive voice. "We still face a crisis" (italics added).
Better late? The only practical answer to that question, other elected officials were saying yesterday, is yes, because the governor gave New York no other choice. In his re-election year (a few months ago), he was having none of what he termed "the gloom-and-doom talk."
Other states are in deep fiscal trouble, too, but while several governors got down to the business of a budget rescue weeks and even months ago -- limiting the damage -- Mr. Pataki has made only modest moves.
He imposed a state hiring freeze, cut agency spending and proposed a new bond sale using the tobacco settlement -- a risky proposition. That money is already earmarked for, among other things, the raises he gave to the largely Hispanic hospital workers' union on the eve of his campaign, and health programs that he promoted heavily during it.
To predictions months ago that the budget gap could be as high as $10 billion, Mr. Pataki said no way, rejecting the notion of a serious budget problem.
"All the gloom-and-doom talk is not the case," he said in mid-October. Transit fare increases? They could be avoided by finding new riders, he insisted. The fares are about to go up. Tax increases? "I can tell you right now, we're not going to raise taxes next year." Taxes have already gone up in New York City and in other localities, and there's talk of statewide increases.
Candidate Pataki said that a budget gap, whatever its size, would be closed as it always was: "We are going to look, as we did in 1995, to continue to make the government operate in a more efficient and more effective way as we go forward. My goal has always been that you balance budgets by increasing revenues." 
He did not say that increasing revenue is a lot easier when the national economy is on the verge of a spectacular boom, as it was in 1995, rather than mired in recession, as it is today.
But safely re-elected, Mr. Pataki was talking yesterday of "historic, grave and daunting" problems. "Make no mistake, the challenges before us are the most difficult our generation has ever faced," he said. The state's finances "remain critical," he declared at one point. At another, "We've done it before; we will do it again." 
AS for what accounted for his seeming postelection conversion, the governor never said directly. Instead, he implied that the state had failed to rebound from the serious blow of Sept. 11, 2001. Most economists see it differently. The attack hurt, but they mostly blamed the recession, which predated Sept. 11, and on Mr. Pataki's policies (sanctioned by the Legislature) of cutting taxes, spending and using the state's reserve funds last year to help plug the budget gap instead of making inevitably unpopular decisions.
The governor even went around the state during the campaign, doling out grants and other financial gifts to towns, cities and counties. The campaign gifts didn't amount to a fortune, given the scope of the state budget, but the tactic sent a message of fiscal largess.
And now, a few months later, a crisis -- one without a solution. In fact, the governor did not put his imprimatur on any initiatives at all yesterday. If those who know him well did not say that he is always underestimated, it would be tempting to say that he was so busy running for office that he did not take the time to think about what he wanted to do in his third term.
He'll have to figure it out. He delivers his budget message in a few weeks, his State of the State speech next Wednesday. The crisis, said the new state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, "is very, very bad, and the public has to be prepared for the fact that we will have very difficult fiscal times."
In another such year, 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey accurately warned in his State of the State message, "The days of wine and roses are over." Governor Pataki might take the opportunity to suggest that his dance of denial is as well.

South Korea, Once a Solid Ally, Now Poses Problems for the U.S.

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1 

 BODY:
For half a century the United States has had no more stalwart ally in Asia than South Korea, where 37,000 American troops are stationed to protect against an invasion from the North, representing the unity of purpose between the two countries.
 But now South Korea has become one of the Bush administration's biggest foreign policy problems. Years of resentments over a variety of issues are boiling over in Seoul in the form of demonstrations against the United States and pronouncements by the departing and arriving presidents challenging American policies on dealing with North Korea's nuclear ambitions. 
 For the fifth time in four months, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is dispatching his top Korea specialist to Seoul for urgent consultations on forging a unified policy to handle North Korea's moves to restart its nuclear weapons program. 
The envoy, James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, is expected to pave the way for a visit to Washington later this year by the newly elected president of South Korea, Roh Moo Hyun, who says he intends to follow the policy of President Kim Dae Jung of diplomatic and economic engagement with North Korea.
Mr. Kelly said recently that Mr. Roh's past statements did not portend a rupture with the United States. The United States would wait until after he and his team take office and then "look at them face to face and find out what it is that we agree on and what it is that we disagree with."
Many experts on Korea expect the differences to be significant. Unlike South Korea, the United States favors a policy of no bargaining and no new economic incentives until the North abandons its nuclear program.
At the same time, and at the behest of its anxious friends in the region, the United States has repeatedly pledged to seek a diplomatic solution to the problem.
"In some ways, the problem in South Korea has become harder to handle than that of North Korea," said a Korea specialist with ties to many members of President Bush's foreign policy team. "Our first priority is to get Roh and Kim to stop saying that the United States approach will not work. If we don't do that, the divide will get worse."
North Korea is clearly determined to do what it can to sharpen the divide between the South and the United States by suggesting that Koreans from both states have a common cause against Washington. In its New Year message, the North Korean government said, "It can be said that there exists on the Korean peninsula only confrontation between the Koreans in the North and the South and the United States."
Some Bush administration officials insist that talk of divisions between South Korea and the United States is "way off base," as one official said this week.
This official added that the administration's policy is one of increasing diplomatic pressure but not squeezing the North further economically or militarily, and that this was also in keeping with the views of Japan, China and Russia.
The administration's internal strains over Korean policy, apparent since the first months of Mr. Bush's term of office, have subsided over the current situation, officials say, in part because there is a unanimity of views that the United States cannot give in to what officials say is "blackmail" by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il.
But the strains have taken a toll on the relationship between Washington and Seoul, diplomats and administration officials say. Early in 2001, for example, Mr. Powell announced that the United States would continue the Clinton administration policy of building on a 1994 "framework agreement" with North Korea.
Under that arrangement, the North froze work at its plutonium-producing nuclear plant at Yongbyon in return for certain economic benefits, including fuel oil shipments. But as they came into office, many members of the new administration were privately disdainful of the 1994 accord. The White House and Mr. Powell then announced that instead of continuing the policy, the administration would review it. The shift was interpreted in Seoul as a rebuff to Kim Dae Jung and to Mr. Powell.
Later in 2001, the administration shifted again, this time saying that it would continue the policy of engagement. Mr. Kim was cheered, but the wounds were not all healed.
Last year, American intelligence revealed that although North Korea had kept its Yongbyon plant frozen, it was undertaking a separate clandestine nuclear program using highly enriched uranium. A new difference of emphasis emerged with the discovery.
Although South Korea labeled North Korea's plans unacceptable, President Kim opposed cutting off all economic contacts. The United States nonetheless persuaded Mr. Kim, and also the Japanese, to immediately halt the oil shipments to North Korea that had been agreed upon under the 1994 framework.
South Korea went along, but privately South Korean officials warned that such an act might provoke North Korea into restarting its Yongbyon plant. Their warnings proved accurate.
What seems clear is that the administration's frequent changes of policy have aggravated other factors in producing divisions between the United States and its Asian ally.
In recent weeks, South Koreans' attentions have focused on the presence of 37,000 American troops on their soil as a major irritant. South Korean anger was further fueled by an incident last June, when two 14-year-old girls were run over and killed by an American armored vehicle north of Seoul.
The episode unleashed an outpouring of resentment that some experts say dates from the years when a series of military dictators in South Korea, acting with what was perceived as support from Washington, thwarted all efforts at democratization. South Korea did not emerge as a democracy until the late 1980's.
Administration officials say they are handicapped by their lack of knowledge of Mr. Roh, Korea's new leader. He is a lawyer and human rights activist whose victory was boosted when a third candidate, Chung Mong Joon, an heir to the Hyundai business fortune, withdrew with a promise to "do my best to make him win." Hyundai favors investment in the North.
Administration officials acknowledge that two overriding factors are pressing the United States to listen to South Korea's pleas for a conciliatory approach to the North. The first, some say, is that the administration's hard-liners are preoccupied by planning a possible war against Iraq and don't want to be distracted.
Second, officials say North Korea, with its immense armed forces, numbering one million troops, plus a formidable rocket and artillery arsenal, could destroy Seoul and its environs in retaliation against any military pressure by the United States and its allies.
Some in the Bush administration say they favor imposing economic sanctions in the future if North Korea does not reverse course. But Mr. Powell said last weekend that such a course of action is not being contemplated by anyone.
"We'll talk to the North Koreans eventually," said one official. "But they have to do something first. The ball really is in their court."

HEADLINE: McGreevey, Focusing on Environment, Enlists in 'War on Sprawl' 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
It was a raid made for prime time. 
 Last October, a strike force of 70 environmental inspectors descended on Camden in search of leaky underground oil tanks, open barrels of toxic goo and renegade smokestacks suspected of fouling one of the state's poorest and most polluted cities. 
 The State Department of Environmental Protection's weeklong blitzkrieg hit more than 700 sites, yielding 100 violations, a burst of favorable news coverage and the fury of business leaders, who gave the agency the nickname of the Green Gestapo.
Gov. James E. McGreevey took the appellation as a compliment and soldiered on. In his first year in office, he temporarily halted new home construction in three fast-growing water-starved counties; scrapped an emissions credit trading program beloved by industry; and granted special protection to 15 streams and reservoirs, making new development along their banks all but impossible. 
But beyond the assault on environmental scofflaws, Mr. McGreevey, a Democrat, has pledged to reshape the conventional image of New Jersey as an overpopulated bastion of metastasizing subdivisions, clogged highways and oozing Superfund sites. Soon after his inauguration last January, the governor formed a Smart Growth Policy Council, which seeks to enlist nearly every state agency in what he calls "the war on sprawl." In his state of the state speech this month, he is expected to make overdevelopment a central theme of his administration. 
To be sure, with "smart growth" the current slogan, most Northeastern governors have at least paid lip service to environmental causes, and Mr. McGreevey, so far, has delivered more promises than policy. But in contrast to the more laissez-faire environmental stance of his Republican predecessor, Christie Whitman, and a Bush administration that has eased federal environmental rules nationwide, New Jersey's governor is emerging as something of a green guerrilla, at least in the eyes of Trenton's building and business lobbies, who say he is favoring environmental protection over economic development. 
"Right now there's a lot of bad feeling and apprehension out there," said Richard Goldberg, president of the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey, which represents 800 companies. "Considering that he just hit businesses with a $1.8 billion tax hike and tens of millions in increased fees, some of these new rules are like rubbing salt in an open wound."
Mr. McGreevey, who spoke repeatedly about sprawl during his campaign, says he is not antidevelopment. He just views unregulated growth as a root of New Jersey's woes, leading to incorrigible traffic jams, spiraling property taxes and some of the worst air quality in the nation.
"The reason many families live in New Jersey is because we have a relatively high quality of life," he said in an interview. "What we're witnessing right now is the decimation of that quality of life. The status quo is simply not working."
Although they are awaiting measurable change in the status quo, environmental advocates, who regularly clashed with Mrs. Whitman (author of the slogan "New Jersey is open for business"), have already embraced the governor as a savior. "It's like Bizarro World from the Superman comics," said Jeff Tittel, president of the Sierra Club in New Jersey. "It's the mirror image of the Whitman days, when we spent all our time fighting the loosening of regulations."
During her two terms in office, Mrs. Whitman, now administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, made open space preservation and coastline protection the hallmarks of her administration. But even members of her own party criticized the cuts she made in environmental programs, including the elimination of the offices of environmental prosecutor and public advocate.
When it came to air and water pollution, Mrs. Whitman favored a more cooperative approach with industry, eliminating rules that she said were hurting businesses. Critics often cite the 80 percent drop in environmental fines levied during her tenure, but supporters say that such figures obscure that compliance actually increased. 
Mr. McGreevey's environmental commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, a Washington lawyer who served in the Clinton White House, has already made it clear that self-policing is out. Besides the sweep in Camden, his agency fined Ramapo College for building a dormitory on wetlands, and reversed a Whitman administration decision that allowed a prominent cranberry grower to expand his operations in the fragile Pine Barrens. 
As the mayor of suburban Woodbridge and a former pharmaceutical industry lobbyist, Mr. McGreevey had a limited environmental record before his inauguration last January. But even if his environmental credentials are thin, he long ago realized that green is a winning color in New Jersey politics. One telling sign is that despite the state's grievous budget woes and the anger over soaring taxes, New Jersey voters continue to support open space referendums that bill the public for land acquisition. Last June, the McGreevey administration agreed to pay $7.1 million to preserve the top of Hamburg Mountain, the site of the Mountain Creek ski area in Vernon.
James E. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said that New Jersey residents, among the most affluent and educated in the country, have come to appreciate the downsides of freewheeling growth, among them worsening traffic congestion, the loss of bucolic landscapes and the higher municipal taxes that follow a surge in school-age children.
"It's like in New York City, where you have a predominance of renters, supporting rent control is a very positive political virtue," Mr. Hughes said. "The same goes in New Jersey, where most people own their own homes. There are a lot of votes in limiting sprawl."
In a state with 2.5 million homeowners and an average of 25,000 new homes built each year, the cards would seem to be stacked against the building industry. With the help of several proposed new rules and state agencies that spend millions of dollars on infrastructure, Mr. McGreevey says he wants to coax new construction away from rural areas and into the state's neglected cities and older suburbs.
Following in the footsteps of Parris Glendening, the Maryland governor nationally known as a smart-growth pioneer, Mr. McGreevey says he would withhold water permits for environmentally fragile areas, limit the construction of new highway access ramps and develop "super incentives" to lure developers to depopulated cities like Camden, Newark and Paterson. He has already directed his Department of Transportation, which once spent 20 percent of its budget on new roads, to stop new construction altogether. "We have to get out of the business of subsidizing sprawl," he said.
To ease the potential burden on developers, the state would create a "big map," with red, yellow and green shading to show builders where new rules and incentives encourage construction, or make it nearly impossible. But such a map -- and the power behind it -- would require the cooperation of more than 500 municipalities, a tall order in a state that jealously guards the perks of home rule.
"The biggest challenge for McGreevey will be living up to his promises," said David Pringle, executive director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation. "It can be done, it's just a matter of exercising the political will and political skill to make it a reality."
The home construction industry, already unnerved by the proliferation of antigrowth zoning ordinances across the state, is not embracing Mr. McGreevey's vision, which it says is unworkable in a state without any mechanisms for regional planning. Nancy Wittenberg, environmental affairs director for the New Jersey Builders Association, said that she and others were suspicious that the new rules would simply choke off development.
"If smart growth would accommodate growth in places where people want to live, that would be smart," she said. "You can put it all in Newark, but frankly not a lot of people are going to move there unless something is done about other problems, like the schools."
Business groups have so far been wary of the new leadership in Trenton. Although they praised Mr. Campbell, the environmental commissioner, for encouraging debate on matters of enforcement, they are unhappy with some of his agency's more aggressive tactics, including the sweep in Camden and another incident, in which the drug company Pfizer was fined $538,000 after officials voluntarily reported an improper discharge of wastewater into a municipal sewer system.
"There is a lot of apprehension out there," said Edward Hogan, an environmental lawyer who leads a business round-table group. "Early on, there was a feeling that Campbell had allied himself very closely with radical environmental groups, but at least he's listening."
Mr. Campbell and his boss stand by their record so far, saying that the administration will work hard to streamline the state's environmental bureaucracy, but maintain an iron fist when it comes to rule-breakers.
"Governor McGreevey has become the national leader in terms of aggressive environmental protection," he said. "After eight dismal years, I think we've restored the public's faith. They know that the environmental cop is back on the beat."

HEADLINE: A Leftist Takes Over in Brazil and Pledges a 'New Path' 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Jan. 1 

 BODY:
Latin America's largest nation embarked on an ambitious political and social experiment today, as Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of the left-wing Workers Party and a former lathe operator and labor union leader, was inaugurated here as president of Brazil, promising "a new style of government" and a crusade against hunger, injustice and corruption.
 "The time has come to tread a new path," Mr. da Silva declared in his inaugural address, arguing that Brazil's progress had been stalled by what he called the "economic, social and moral impasse" of a system based on self-interest. 
 "Yes, we are going to change things, with courage and care, humility and daring," he added.
On at least two counts, Brazilian history offers no precedent for the rise to power of Mr. da Silva, who has only a grade school education, lost part of a finger in a factory accident and, as he recalled in his address, sold peanuts on the streets as a child to help his divorced mother make ends meet. He is the first member of the working class to become president here and the first candidate of a left-wing party to win a presidential vote. 
Mr. da Silva gained a landslide victory in October, receiving more than 52 million votes in his fourth attempt at the presidency, by running on a platform that promised Brazil's 175 million people better times after nearly a decade of austerity. He sounded that theme again today, saying that "creating jobs is going to be my obsession" and that "it is absolutely necessary that this country return to growth."
The new president has credited his resounding triumph to rejection of the free market policies of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
The change of guard has delighted and reinvigorated the Latin American left, as was evident from the foreign labor and political delegations that were waving Argentine, Uruguayan, Ecuadorean and Peruvian flags as they mixed with ordinary Brazilians along the parade route.
World leaders attending ranged from President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to the Prince of Asturias, heir to the Spanish throne. But the two heads of state who drew the most attention and applause were Fidel Castro of Cuba and the embattled president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who recently invited Mr. da Silva to join him and Mr. Castro in what he called a Latin American "axis of good."
In what was regarded here as a calculated snub, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, led the American delegation. During the recent campaign, Mr. da Silva sarcastically dismissed Mr. Zoellick as "the subsecretary of a subsecretary of a subsecretary" after the American official suggested that Brazil would be reduced to exporting to Antarctica if it shunned the Bush administration's plan for a Free Trade Area of the Americas.
"It's natural that the American president wouldn't come to Brazil on this date," Jose Genoino, president of the Workers Party, complained in a newspaper interview Monday. "But he could have sent a representative with more weight. But never mind. That's how the Americans are."
Mr. da Silva's only direct reference today to relations with the United States was to call for "a mature partnership" between the hemisphere's two most populous nations. But he indirectly criticized the Bush administration twice, arguing that "crises like those in the Middle East should be resolved peacefully and through negotiations," and complaining of subsidies and tariffs that undercut Brazil's ability to export agricultural products.
One of Mr. da Silva's campaign slogans was that "hope vanquishes fear," and the optimism and enthusiasm that his victory engendered was amply on display. As Mr. da Silva, 57, rode to his inauguration in a Rolls-Royce, onlookers climbed trees to cheer him and broke through an official honor guard on horseback, with one person even jumping into the car to embrace and kiss Mr. da Silva.
The vast esplanade in front of the congress building where Mr. da Silva took his oath looked like a giant tail-gate party, with tens of thousands of the new president's supporters gathering to sing, dance, eat and drink. Some were camped out in tents after traveling for days to take part in the celebration, while others have been living out of cars, trucks or buses.
Many followers, often dressed in red T-shirts or berets, carried the Workers Party's red flag with white star or banners recalling Mr. da Silva's humble origins. One cartoon placard showed three contrasting images of him: the first with a cheap suitcase recalling his peasant family's migration from the poor northeast, the second with him holding a wrench to symbolize his years as a factory worker, and the third with him wearing Brazil's presidential sash.
Kleber Gonzaga, 24, was part of a group of 14 college students from Mr. da Silva's home state of Pernambuco that rented a van and drove exactly 1,321 miles to see him sworn in. They missed a New Year's Eve party back home by leaving on Sunday, and the trip will cost each of them the equivalent of a month's salary, but they said that did not matter.
"It's not just that Lula is from the interior, like us, or that he, as a man of the people, has experienced in his own skin the same kind of problems and difficulties that we have," Mr. Gonzaga explained. "Most of us are social science majors, and we wanted to witness this historical moment so as to be able to tell our future students that we were there."

HEADLINE: Assessing Mayor Bloomberg 

 BODY:
He's not a natural politician, but Michael Bloomberg moved with sure feet in his first year as mayor of New York. Unencumbered by a devotion to polling data, unswayed by sentiment, ungifted in drama and unmarried to tradition, he is remaking City Hall to suit his style, which is no nonsense, all business and big ideas -- lots of big ideas.
 Mayor Bloomberg set out an ambitious agenda from the start, promising to continue Rudolph Giuliani's fight to lower crime, but also to begin rebuilding the city, to take control of the schools and to invest in new housing. He has done all that, often with uncommonly bold strokes. In the face of a budget shortfall that analysts estimate at more than $3 billion, he found an innovative way to create a $3 billion program to build 65,000 new housing units. He followed his schools takeover with what seems now to be an inspired appointment of Joel Klein as chancellor. He has offered smart and mostly compelling visions of a revitalized Lower Manhattan and of a newly developed far west side of Midtown. For a city that has failed to do any serious building projects for so long, either one would be a historic achievement. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's guide has been determining what is good for the city and the bottom line, and then doing it, sometimes unblinkingly taking on powerful interests. Calling the recycling of glass and plastic too costly, he suspended both programs, to the dismay of environmentalists, who still worry about the long-term impact of his policy. His answer to gridlock was to restrict turns on Midtown streets, to the continuing distress of hotel and other business owners and drivers. With the numbers of fires down in the city, Mr. Bloomberg demanded a different kind of heroism from firefighters, who he said must share the pain of the budget ax. Unapologetically reneging on one of the few politically advised promises he made early on, the mayor raised taxes. The hefty property tax hike helped the budget if not his popularity. 
The mayor can seem aloof, but he nonetheless pays careful attention to how people live and, especially, what they can live without. So he sent his police to stamp out excessive noise in targeted neighborhoods, and in the name of workers' health, he battled for and won legislation to ban smoking in virtually all bars and restaurants. Quality of life in New York, a continuing theme, is being protected and improved for many in the city.
With hard times refusing to go away, the challenges of helping those in need, including the homeless and hungry, remain to be effectively addressed. Mr. Bloomberg, in signing a living wage law and in promoting the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, has recognized that more must be done to help the city's least fortunate.
The success of his first year behind him, Mr. Bloomberg has made clear he wants a second term, which could be his undoing as an unpolitician. But that is still three years and many ideas away.

HEADLINE: The View From Wall Street; 
For Chastened Analysts, More Skepticism About Investing

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS JR. 

 BODY:
IT would be hard to conjure up a worse year for Wall Street and its analysts than 2002. Stock analysts and strategists were pilloried for their gauzy optimism and accused by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, of being beholden to the investment banking side of their firms. At the same time, the collapsing equity markets made it especially hard to sort out the winners from the losers.
 Consequently, those who survived 2002 look at this year with a cool, skeptical, as well as careful eye. The role of analysts has changed. As a result of the settlement in principle between brokerage firms and federal and state legislators, analysts cannot earn their keep by doing investment banking work. Now it is all about stock picking, through rigorous company-specific analysis, which in theory should be good for investors. 
 Two years into his easing cycle, the magic man of years past, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has lost his power to move markets with a well-timed interest rate cut. 
On the contrary, many experts now say, the market's next bull run will be presaged by evidence that the Fed is moving toward a rate-tightening bias. Put simply: higher rates signal an economy on the mend, which means better earnings for companies across the board.
Despite the market's glum mood, investment opportunities still exist, a group of analysts say. Many companies in crucial sectors like retail, cable, brokerages and technology have been revamping for more than a year. Layoffs, store closings and other measures of cost-cutting have given a number of large companies spruced-up balance sheets. They will be well placed to take advantage of sector recoveries when they come along.
From I.B.M. to Comcast, to Merrill Lynch to Gap, the names are familiar, and in all cases, they are trading well below their highs. These analysts, Dana Telsey of Bear, Stearns, Guy Moszkowski of Salomon Smith Barney, Laura C. Conigliaro of Goldman, Sachs, Richard Bilotti of Morgan Stanley and Richard Bernstein of Merrill Lynch, do not expect the companies to approach their past highs -- by most accounts, 2003 will be a difficult year for the markets as a whole. Most agree, however, that these companies will outperform the broader market.

DANA TELSEY is the senior retail analyst at Bear, Stearns.
Most retailers are "overstored." A lot of companies have reached a stage of maturation where it is not possible to achieve the same level of top-line sales growth they had in the past. Many retailers are working to make efficiencies on expenses, distribution costs and systems to enhance returns. 
We think 2003 will show a continuation of this sort of refinement. Over all, retailers are faced with an environment where pricing flexibility is limited and where the consumer knows that the longer he waits, the cheaper the merchandise will be.
To be successful, retailers must maintain positive gross margins through consistent markups and lower sourcing costs.
The consumer is holding up pretty well. Keep in mind, we have tax cuts, low interest rates and low inflation. All of which bodes well for consumer spending.
One company that will continue to do well is Coach. They do something that is special. By testing their products at least six months ahead of time, they are able to offer the consumer just what they like. Their balance sheet is also very clean, and their store base is not saturated.
Gap is a different story -- if not a speculative one. There is momentum building, because their top-line growth is beginning to improve, albeit off a very depressed base. In addition, they have a new chief executive -- Paul Pressler, formerly of Walt Disney -- and an appealing new marketing campaign. The company is attracting new customers into all divisions -- Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy. All of this is breathing new life into the company.
Plus, in retailing there are not a lot of companies with market capitalizations larger than $10 billion. So Gap stands out at $13 billion.
 Ms. Telsey does not own stock in Coach or Gap, nor does Bear, Stearns do investment banking business with them. 

GUY MOSZKOWSKI is a brokerage analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
Business conditions remain difficult for brokerage stocks. Don't forget -- the operating environment is the stock market. 
A better equity market translates into more trading volume on the retail investor side, better underwriting volume and a better mergers-and-acquisitions environment. Weakness in such areas has driven a decline in return on equity for the big firms to 10 percent or so from historic highs of 30 percent or better. When the market moves up and sustains itself, it will give investors confidence in the sector. But we have not seen that yet.
Of the big firms, Merrill Lynch had the most fat to cut. Give them credit -- they realized in early 2000 when things were still good that they had become bloated and have laid off close to 20,000 employees in the past two years. Unlike other firms, they realized that we were not going to return to the late 90's business levels for a long time. They have managed their costs so well that people will be surprised by the extent of their earnings power once the markets recover.
Goldman Sachs has maintained market share in some key banking activities -- like equity underwriting and mergers and acquisitions -- during this difficult period. It does a few things extremely well, while others are spread more thinly. If there is any improvement in these areas, the stock has a lot of upside.
With regard to the settlement in principle between brokerage firms and federal and state regulators, it clearly gets the regulatory issues behind the firms. Of course, the potential for civil litigation still exists, in terms of arbitration of retail client issues, if not class action.
Given the relative size of fines levied $1.4 billion , along with e-mail evidence already released by regulators, it would appear that Merrill Lynch has the most exposure here, with Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs considerably less so.
 Mr. Moszkowski owns no shares in the firms he cites. Salomon has banking relationships with all of them. 

LAURA C. CONIGLIARO is a technology analyst and strategist at Goldman, Sachs.
For the technology sector, spending on information technology has been most affected by macroeconomic variables.
As we have been seeing for two years now, the I.T. spending environment is weak. That is the feedback we get from end users in sectors like manufacturing, financial services and telecommunications.
We are hearing that their spending patterns will be similar to the end of 2002. Unfortunately, technology spending for 2002 was down, as chief investment officers cut back on their budgets.
Typically, if profitability is improving, so will capital and I.T. spending. But many chief investment officers we speak to are saying it's not just profitability. Cost cutting will not be enough -- they need to see a sustained pickup in revenue, and they have yet to see that.
When we look at stocks, I.B.M. differentiates itself in a number of ways. First, the company never participated in the bubble. So its numbers never got out of whack. Unlike others, it was never overwhelmingly focused on the two big end markets that drove the bubble -- communications and financial services.
In a normal spending environment, financial services and communications might represent 20 percent apiece of overall tech spending. During the bubble, those two sectors combined for 60 percent of end-market spending. That points to another key point about I.B.M.: it is very broad-based when it comes to its end market. The company is gaining market share. It is improving its product line and its execution. We have it rated a sector outperform, which is our highest rating.
I.B.M. is a core holding, indeed it is both a defensive and an offensive stock. It is trading now at roughly 19 times earnings for 2003 -- in line with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Hewlett-Packard is another stock we have a sector outperform rating on. It is a different story: it's a bit of a contrarian pick with an attractive risk-and-reward ratio. Hewlett-Packard has a lot of ground to gain on the cost-cutting front. They have a clear strength in printers, and are improving in PC's and enterprise systems.
Relative to other tech stocks, it is not one of the more expensive -- trading at 14 times 2003 earnings. You would expect a discount to I.B.M., but this one is a little steep.
 Ms. Conigliaro owns no stock in the companies mentioned. Goldman, Sachs has banking ties with Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. 

RICHARD BILOTTI is a cable and entertainment analyst at Morgan Stanley.
What we expect to see in 2003 are cable companies that will have a higher strategic value than content companies like Viacom and Walt Disney. This has not been true since the late 70's during the heyday of the build-out of cable in the United States. There are three main themes behind this evolution.
First, after years of competition with satellite broadcasters, we are entering a period of pricing stability for cable companies. They are also selling value-added services to their customers and finding that it makes more sense to mine existing customer bases than to chase after new ones. All the major distribution companies -- Comcast, Cox Communications and EchoStar Communications -- are undervalued by 40 percent.
Secondly, we have never seen a cable company the size of Comcast, with 22 million subscribers, provide size and scale without precedent. If it feels that its supplier of content is too expensive, it could conceivably launch its own replacement channel. 
Say, for example, the company does not want to carry a sports package because one of the channels is too expensive. They can go to the supplier of content -- the N.F.L., for example -- and say, "You know what, I'll buy that football package directly from you." The cost of buying the programming rights could be less expensive when spread over the Comcast base of subscribers than the wholesale fees charged by the exisiting networks. What do the content companies do? Well, they will have to go out and buy their own distribution channels. 
And finally, for the first time since I've been an analyst, the rate of return on reinvested capital for cable companies is higher than that of content companies: 20 percent for distribution companies, after taxes, compared with 3 to 6 percent for content companies. Unlike the content companies, cable and satellite companies are investing all their discretionary cash flow back into their core businesses.
For the content companies, it is a different story. Because of the fragmentation of the television audience and the sheer number of channels, content companies are finding it hard to capture advertising. So instead of investing in their core business, they are looking to make acquisitions of television stations and cable channels. But that gives you a return of just 6 or 7 percent.
Historically, robust advertising growth has camouflaged these weak returns. Look at Comcast, which completed its merger with AT&T Broadband in November. It will have discretionary cash flow -- cash flow after interest expenses, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures -- of $1.50 to $1.75 a share. They will choose to put that money back into their business and earn 15 to 20 percent returns. Comcast trades at 15 times discretionary cash flow, well below the 25 to 30 times that is common for content companies.
 Mr. Bilotti does not own stock in the companies he cites, but Morgan Stanley does have banking relationships with them. 

RICHARD BERNSTEIN is chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch.
We recently lowered our equity allocation. Previously, we were recommending 50 percent stock, 30 percent bonds and 20 cash. Now we are at 45 percent, 35 and 20. We think the equity market is very speculative. 
Equities remain the asset class of choice, and that does not bode well for their future performance. You hear people all the time say, "Where can you get higher returns than in equities?" That was the correct thing to say in 1982 when everyone wanted to look at money market funds. Or 1994, when everyone was in bonds. Call it the paradox of investing. If everyone thinks equities are the asset class of choice, the odds are they are not.
We have the S.& P. at 29 times trailing earnings. My point is that the only sure thing we have these days are announced earnings. According to our research, forecasting earnings growth is the least predictable and most volatile it has been in 60 years. So why would we value the market on somebody's forecast if this is true? People are assuming that earnings growth is a given. My argument is this: Wait a minute, future earnings are the least predictable in our lifetimes.
With regard to the Fed, its repeated easing shows that the economy is not making the transition from the early phase to the middle phase of the economic cycle. Continued easing is keeping the economy on life support. The Fed is basically admitting that things are not working. 
Our belief is that the next bull market begins only when the Fed starts to tighten. That will tell you that we have moved beyond this deflationary environment.

HEADLINE: Modest Hopes for 2003 

 BODY:
We have several wishes for the new year. Nothing wildly ambitious, just a short list of familiar public policy ideas that have been waiting for the right person to make them real. They are not risk free, politically. If they were, they would not need leadership to move them along. But all are doable, and all would yield enormous, multiple benefits. In terms of payback-to-effort, they're our top priorities. 
 Take the question of American dependence on foreign oil. There are plenty of big, futuristic ideas around -- developing a hydrogen-based economy, for instance -- and plenty of bad ideas, like the notion that we can drill our way to energy independence. But one obvious response is to improve fuel economy standards, which have not been tightened since the Reagan years. At the very least, policy makers should require S.U.V.'s to meet the same standards as passenger cars. 
 President Bush recently promised to increase fuel economy in S.U.V.'s by 1.5 miles a gallon by 2007. But that's less than what the automakers say they can do on their own, and far less than what the National Academy of Sciences says is possible for all cars with existing off-the-shelf technology. And the rewards for a big increase in efficiency would be huge: cleaner air, fewer global warming gases, reduced dependence on Persian Gulf oil.
Given a magic lamp, we might wish for stable, responsible democratic regimes in Iraq and North Korea for the new year. But for an idea that's doable, our foreign policy choice is dismantling Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Just as terrorism is the greatest Palestinian obstacle to Middle East peace, so the settlements established in territories captured in the 1967 war are the greatest Israeli obstacle. They deprive the Palestinians of valuable land and water and deny them geographical continuity. They are hard for Israel to defend against Palestinian attack, and they make it impossible to establish a clear, secure Israeli border.
For all these reasons, the United States -- which has lately ignored the issue -- should press Israel to start reducing a settler population that's doubled in the last decade to 200,000 (without counting 200,000 in East Jerusalem). Israel's cooperation would show that it is serious about a two-state solution and, if matched by reciprocal concessions on the Palestinian side, would strengthen the prospects for a durable agreement.
Here's a third wish: Kill the global system of agricultural subsidies. The obvious way for poor farmers in developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty is to sell their products abroad. But they can't, mainly because rich countries have rigged the markets, subsidizing their farmers so heavily that nobody can compete. That's not only unfair but perverse: reducing farm subsidies would do far more to help poor countries than large increases in direct foreign aid.
Several proposals for reform are floating about, including a Bush administration idea for balanced and mutual reductions of subsidies in both Europe and America, so that neither gets an advantage. This deserves serious consideration. Another trifecta of payoffs awaits: more money in the pockets of the poor, greater social and political stability across the third world, and a fairer distribution of the fruits of globalization.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ARABS; 
U.S. Welcomes Thaw in Relations With 'Pragmatic' Syria

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Jan. 1 

 BODY:
Listening to Syrian and American officials these days, it is easy to forget that Syria is one of seven nations still listed by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism.
 "We have a good dialogue with the United States on all levels characterized by respect," Minister of Information Adnan Omran said in an interview on Monday. "We can reach understandings and ease difficulties." 
 A Bush administration official involved in Middle East policy essentially agreed, saying, "The Syrians are highly opportunistic and pragmatic, which is why we can work with them." 
Such harmonious comments hardly represent a robust alliance, but they represent a striking departure from the normally uneasy relations between the two countries over the last five decades.
The United States official, who spoke this week on condition of anonymity, complimented Syria's "extremely productive cooperation" against Al Qaeda, "the result of which has been that American lives have been saved."
He said the administration was surprised and gratified by Syria's recent vote in the United Nations Security Council in favor of the resolution demanding Iraq allow weapons inspectors to return or face possible military action.
The two countries are still in dispute over Syria's prolonged intervention in Lebanon, stubborn hostility toward Israel and the wide-ranging support for Hamas and Hezbollah militants that keeps Damascus on the State Department terrorist black list. Mob attacks against the American Embassy here in 1998 and 2000 opened new wounds, which have been salted by Syria's opening of its borders to Iraqi oil exports in violation of the United Nations-sanctioned embargo.
But Syria's recent help against terrorists has created the most important thaw since a brief warming of relations in 1990 when Damascus offered a largely symbolic force to the United States-led coalition against Saddam Hussein, a traditional rival of the regime here.
American and Syrian officials are willing to say little about their coordinated efforts against Al Qaeda, except to confirm that Syrian intelligence and security officials have arrested and interrogated more than 20 suspected terrorists and shared information with the C.I.A. They also say that Syrian leads have led to the capture of many terrorists around the world.
Syria assisted in the arrest of Muhammed Haydar Zammar, a German citizen who was born in Syria and is accused of helping to recruit several of the Sept. 11 hijackers in Hamburg. Now in Syrian custody, he is believed to have told the Syrians much about how the Hamburg cell functioned, information that was passed on to Washington.
Damascus has also been helpful of late, Western diplomats note, in restraining Hezbollah from attacking Israel from bases in Lebanon since April in an effort to control rising tensions.
Since taking over from his late father, Hafez al-Assad, just over two years ago, President Bashar al-Assad, a 37-year-old British-trained ophthalmologist, has engaged in an unlikely balancing act, trying to improve relations with both Washington and Baghdad. The loveless triangle made for a strange scene in November, when Iraqi Kurdish opposition leaders visited the American Embassy with great fanfare while Iraqi government officials looked on from across the street from a recently opened Iraqi mission bedecked with a large public poster of Saddam Hussein.
Both Washington and Damascus refashioned their relationship after the Qaeda terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
As a secular regime that has been in conflict with Islamic fundamentalist terrorists since it brutally repressed an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1980's, the Syrian government was quick to offer Washington intelligence help. The Bush administration was quick to accept.
With respect to Iraq, Syria has sought to bolster economic ties with the Saddam Hussein regime while deepening political relations with the Iraqi opposition, which has diplomatic offices here.
"The political relationship is with us and the economic relationship is with the regime," said Bayan Jaber, the representative here of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a Shiite opposition group. "That is Syria's pragmatic dance and we have to live with that."
Syria denies breaking the United Nations embargo on Iraq, but Western diplomats and independent oil experts say the country imports about 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day for its domestic use, freeing its own oil production for export. Western diplomats estimate that total trade with Iraq earns the Syrian government $500 million a year, or 10 percent of its annual revenues.
American diplomats have warned President Assad that he is becoming economically dependent on Iraq and that relations with Washington would reach another breaking point if American intelligence discovered that weapons or anything else that could be harmful to American troops were passing from Syria to Iraq.
As a member of the United Nations Security Council, Syria voted two months ago in favor of a resolution calling for Iraq to account for all weapons of mass destruction, a vote viewed positively in Washington as a tacit nod in favor of tightening the screws on Baghdad. But since that vote, Syria has tilted its diplomacy back in favor of Saddam Hussein to avert war.
During a state visit to Algeria last weekend, President Assad declared that Iraq had complied with the United Nations resolution and had proved it did not have weapons of mass destruction. "We see the United States administration's insistence on fabricating an excuse to launch a war against the brotherly people of Iraq," he said.
Syrian political analysts and government officials say they fear that an American invasion of Iraq would unleash a prolonged civil war there that would damage the Syrian economy, strengthen Israel's strategic position and create regional instability by inciting Kurds in Turkey and possibly even Syria to rebel to form a new nation with Iraqi Kurds.
Western diplomats say Syria's balancing act is intended to avert any change in the region since Damascus can easily coexist with a weakened Saddam Hussein who needs Syria economically.
"The status quo is not unreasonable for them at all," noted a European diplomat here, "and they have worked hard to achieve that." Still, he added, "they are hedging their bets."

HEADLINE: The Exercise of American Power 

 BODY:
Even before the Champagne bottles started to run dry yesterday morning, the reality of an ominous new year was dawning across the globe. With the threat of terrorism undiminished, the world faces two other immediate, multi-alarm crises abroad, one in Iraq, the other in North Korea. With many nations eager to assert their independence from Washington, President Bush and America's European and Asian allies will have to perform some intricate diplomatic choreography in the coming weeks if they are to avoid the unhealthy prospect of the United States acting on its own to enforce its will on other countries.
 As much as Washington might like to keep North Korea's nuclear ambitions at bay until the confrontation with Iraq runs its course, there is no way to suspend the Korean crisis until a more convenient moment. Both situations demand a carefully calibrated international response that depends heavily on the United Nations Security Council and close cooperation with America's allies and friends. The new world order that has often been proclaimed since the end of the cold war but has yet to materialize can begin to take shape if President Bush musters the statesmanship to work in harness with leaders in Moscow, Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, Riyadh, Paris, London and other capitals. 
 The signs suggest that Washington is moving toward war with Iraq. Mr. Bush's decision to call up military reserves, the cancellation of his January trip to Africa, the dispatch of a large Navy hospital ship to the Indian Ocean to stand by near the Persian Gulf, not to mention the continuing buildup of American combat forces in the region, all indicate that Mr. Bush believes diplomatic options are rapidly dwindling. While Iraq is ostensibly cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors, Baghdad's overall accounting of its unconventional arms programs has been circumscribed at best and deceptive at worst. The failure to provide a full description of its nuclear weapons projects is especially troubling.
Mr. Bush must still exhaust the diplomatic options before ordering American forces into combat. That means carefully assessing the next report due from Hans Blix, the chief inspector, at the end of the month and making public any American intelligence information that refutes Iraq's claim that it has no menacing weapons. It also means that Mr. Bush should return to the Security Council to seek explicit authorization to use force, a step that requires the assent of Russia, China, France and Britain. That would help ensure international support for rebuilding Iraq if Saddam Hussein is ousted.
The equation in North Korea is no less difficult. Unless North Korea actually attacks one of its neighbors, Washington must rely exclusively on nonmilitary options. We were encouraged by Mr. Bush's statement Tuesday that the crisis could be handled "peacefully, through diplomacy." The Bush administration should not merely try to squeeze North Korea by isolating it economically. The better course would be to enlist the help of China, Russia, Japan and South Korea in a united diplomatic offensive that makes clear to North Korea that its powerful neighbors are willing to help if it will give up its nuclear ambitions. This time, unlike in 1994, North Korea will have to accept intrusive, nationwide inspections to reassure the world that it has really closed down its nuclear reactors, plutonium reprocessing plants and other bomb-making facilities.
The world will be watching America closely as the new year unfolds. If Mr. Bush can't find a way to work with leaders like Roh Moo Hyun, South Korea's president-elect, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, any American diplomatic or military success may prove short-lived. The United States has overwhelming power, but over the long run it will be of use only if it is exercised with self-control.

HEADLINE: FOES OF ABORTION READY MAJOR BILLS FOR NEW CONGRESS 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1 

 BODY:
Galvanized by the Republican takeover of the Senate, opponents of abortion are preparing a major push for new abortion restrictions in the next Congress, beginning with a ban on the type of medical procedure they call partial birth abortion.
 They say they will also push for some other measures already passed by the Republican-controlled House, including a bill making it a crime to evade parental notification laws by taking a minor across state lines for an abortion and legislation making it a separate crime to harm a fetus during an attack on a pregnant woman. They also want to allow hospitals and other health care providers to refuse to perform abortions without fear of penalty, like the loss of federal money. 
 Supporters of abortion rights acknowledge that they face a much tougher fight without sympathetic Democrats in control of the White House, the Senate or the House.
Still, several Republican strategists on Capitol Hill have said their party needs to focus first and foremost on the economic agenda and not appear to be overinterpreting its Election Day mandate by pushing social issues right out of the gate. 
At the center of the legislative maneuvering will be Senator Bill Frist, who replaced Senator Trent Lott as incoming majority leader last month. While a few social conservatives have voiced concern about his record, Dr. Frist is considered a strong ally by the National Right to Life Committee, which has given him a 100 percent rating on major votes for the last six years.
Ken Connor, president of the conservative Family Research Council, argued that Dr. Frist might be particularly effective for the anti-abortion cause because of his background as a surgeon. 
"When he speaks on these issues," Mr. Connor said, "he does so with great authority, great expertise, and now with great clout."
Abortion rights advocates say that while Dr. Frist may have a different persona, "his views and his record are indistinguishable from Trent Lott's" on abortion, as Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, put it.
A spokesman for Dr. Frist said the senator was still working on the year's legislative agenda, but he noted that Dr. Frist had a long history of supporting a ban on the so-called "partial birth" procedure.
Many strategists on both sides say they expect that proposal, which passed the House last July, to be the first major abortion-related legislation to move through Congress. Douglas Johnson, the legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee, said that there were more than 60 votes for the measure in the Senate -- enough to overcome a filibuster -- and that President Bush had repeatedly promised to sign it.
Such a law would be a milestone for the anti-abortion movement, and abortion rights groups said they would quickly challenge it in the courts. The Supreme Court has already ruled that several state laws outlawing the practice are unconstitutional, in part because they did not include an exemption allowing the procedure for the sake of a woman's health and because the procedure itself was too vaguely defined.
Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the No. 3 Republican in the new Senate leadership and an abortion opponent, said in a recent interview, "We've come back with a rewrite that I think will pass constitutional muster. And I think it's an important line in the sand, although far from the line I would draw."
The latest stage of the abortion struggle begins at an emotional time for both sides: Jan. 22 is the 30th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that recognized a constitutional right to abortion. Organizing is well under way for the anti-abortion marches and demonstrations that traditionally mark the day and that are expected to have special significance this year.
Speculation abounds on what kind of signal President Bush, an ally of the anti-abortion movement, will send to the marchers and the nation at large on that anniversary -- how he will juggle the interests of an important conservative constituency with the swing voters who support abortion rights.
Despite the gains of the anti-abortion movement in the November elections, Mr. Santorum said recently that "we still don't have anything I would consider a pro-life majority in the Senate." But he argued that there was a majority for certain restrictions, like the "partial birth" ban, which he said had broad support among the public.
Critics assert that the abortion method at issue is a grisly practice that amounts to partially delivering a fetus before aborting it. A ban on the practice passed Congress twice in the Clinton administration, only to be vetoed at the urging of abortion rights supporters who asserted that the procedure was sometimes necessary to protect a woman's health.
Other legislative priorities for the anti-abortion movement include a broad ban on human cloning, including cloning to create tissue for medical research. Many argue that the issue has added urgency after a religious sect claimed last week to have created the first human clone.
Abortion opponents say they are uncertain how many votes the new abortion restrictions -- many of which have passed the House -- would get in the Senate.
Mr. Santorum said Republican control meant that such bills would, at the least, be brought to the floor and debated. Mr. Connor of the Family Research council agreed, saying that under the leadership of Senator Tom Daschle, a Democrat, the Senate was "a veritable graveyard of pro-life legislation."
"Hopefully," Mr. Connor said, "that logjam will now be overcome." 
Supporters of abortion rights assert that the restrictions being sought, while seemingly incremental, are an effort to chip away at the basic right to abortion. Ms. Michelman, of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, said, "We're going to see, legislatively, some difficult months ahead."
Both sides also expect to be fully engaged in the struggle over judicial nominations in the new Senate, given the crucial role that federal judges can play in interpreting abortion law.
The Senate, for many years, has been a tougher arena for the anti-abortion movement than the House. But the National Right to Life Committee estimates the November elections produced a net gain of two anti-abortion seats, with abortion rights opponents replacing supporters in Georgia, Minnesota and Missouri. In December, however, Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, an abortion opponent, appointed his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, to fill the remaining two years of his term, and she is considered a supporter of abortion rights.
The actual number of anti-abortion or abortion rights senators depends on the specific issue; for example, many politicians who support legalized abortion nevertheless vote for a ban on the so-called partial birth procedure. 
In addition, there are limits to the new political clout of the anti-abortion movement. Mr. Bush has shown little inclination to put the issue front and center, speaking more generally of creating "a culture of life" and advancing more incremental measures to restrict abortions.
Democrats are openly hoping that the newly empowered social conservatives end up provoking a backlash by 2004, especially among the suburban women who tend to be economic conservatives but more socially liberal.
"A lot of pro-life Republicans, including the president in 2000, were able to win the votes of pro-choice independents and Republicans by convincing them that they did not really represent a threat to a woman's right to choose," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The closer the pro-lifers get to attacking the core of Roe v. Wade, the bigger the political fallout will be."
Abortion opponents counter that they are proposing a set of restrictions that are very much in the mainstream of public opinion, the ambivalent middle that tends to support the legality of abortion but is open to more restrictions and regulations.
This agenda reflects a strategic shift among many anti-abortion advocates in recent years: While still committed to ending legalized abortion someday, many have adopted a more gradual, step-by-step approach intended to change attitudes and laws over the long haul.

HEADLINE: INAUGURAL IN ALBANY: OVERVIEW; 
Pataki Stresses Need for Unity In Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 1 

 BODY:
George Elmer Pataki, sworn in for his third term as New York's governor, challenged New Yorkers today to confront the state's dire fiscal problems with the same courage and unity they displayed during the terrorist attack 15 months ago.
 The Republican governor, who for months has deflected questions about the sorry state of New York's budget with vague, optimistic statements, said the state faced a crisis and called for bipartisan cooperation from Albany's often-divided lawmakers to close a shortfall of $2 billion this fiscal year and $10 billion next. 
 "Make no mistake, the challenges before us are the most difficult our generation has ever faced," Mr. Pataki said during the inauguration. "These challenges will yield only to unified action, only with all of us working together, and each of us putting aside partisan and parochial concerns." 
The inauguration was in some ways the last celebration before the serious business of the government gets under way next week with Mr. Pataki's annual address to the Legislature.
Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of the State Court of Appeals administered the oath of office as a 19-gun salute echoed in the background and more than 2,000 guests looked on, among them Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue, who won re-election on Mr. Pataki's ticket, was also sworn in.
Moments earlier, two Democrats took oaths on the same stage. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who won a second term in November and is a likely Democratic candidate for governor in 2006, was sworn in by his old mentor, federal Judge Robert W. Sweet. Alan G. Hevesi, the former New York City comptroller who won a close race for state comptroller, took the oath of office from Judge Kaye. 
The governor, facing a budget gap that will force him to make difficult decisions about raising taxes or cutting back many programs he has promoted, tried to wrap himself in the mantle of patriotism and the heroic spirit of ordinary New Yorkers who responded to the devastation of the attack on the World Trade Center.
Mr. Pataki, 57, urged legislators to take a cue from those heroic acts and rise above the partisan discord that has marred budget negotiations in recent years. At the same time, he seemed to be preparing the public for bad news when he unveils his spending plan late this month. "There can be no doubt that the challenges before us are historic, grave and daunting," Mr. Pataki said.
The hourlong ceremony was an eclectic mix of cultural influences, orchestrated to reinforce the theme of the celebration, titled "Forward Together." It seemed a hybrid of a veterans' parade, a high school graduation and a jazz club in Washington Heights. 
The guests in the Convention Center at the Empire State Plaza were treated to a bagpipe player squeezing out the strains of "The Marines' Hymn," a Latin jazz trio doing a syncopated number called "Look to the Sky," an Irish tenor belting out the national anthem, a gospel choir singing "When the Saints Go Marching In" and a troupe of Hispanic girls singing a salsa version of Billy Joel's "New York State of Mind." The event ended with the girls' troupe singing "America the Beautiful," while Mr. Pataki, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Spitzer threaded through the crowd with their families.
Despite Mr. Pataki's call for unity, no sooner had the inauguration ended than the partisan divide became evident. The Democrats and Republicans retreated to separate receptions. Mr. Spitzer tried to rally the spirits of Democrats at his reception, proclaiming that the party was far from dead. The Republicans, meanwhile, reveled in Mr. Pataki's victory at a modest reception in the Crowne Plaza Hotel, with some predicting they would hold the governor's seat for not just the new term, but for at least four years after that. 
The leader of the Republican majority in the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, lauded the governor for starting the year off with a call for bipartisan cooperation. "I thought it was the right tone, the right message," he said.
Democratic leaders of the Assembly were less effusive in their praise but did not rule out the possibility of greater cooperation. After years of legislative gridlock, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said Mr. Pataki's chances of success were better in a year like this one, when no one in Albany stands for re-election. "It's not unrealistic, and if he's sincere about it, I said I would be delighted to meet him more than halfway," he said.
Other Democrats said that while the governor's speech was uplifting, his budget would show his true priorities. "The inauguration is always a good positive, philosophical speech," said Assemblyman John J. McEneny, an Albany Democrat. "The moment of truth will come with the budget. That's where the difficult choices and priorities have to be established."
Mr. Pataki offered almost no clue about how he would deal with the fiscal crisis. He did suggest that one priority would be security. "There are still terrorists, both at home and abroad, who want to harm us and who plot against us," he said. "We will be strong, we will be vigilant and we will protect ourselves."
The governor also took pains to lay much of the blame for the economic problems of the state on the terrorist attack, even though the recession began long before it. "Since the attacks, far too many New Yorkers have lost jobs, and we know a good job is the foundation of a strong family," he said. "Further, the condition of our state's finances remains critical. Tax revenues continue to run far below the pre-Sept. 11th levels. This is the reality we now face."
The day's events were deliberately low-key, in stark contrast to the extravagant festivities where the governor was host with corporate support when he was first elected in 1995. Still, the inauguration was a crowning triumph for Mr. Pataki, who was raised on a farm in Peekskill, won an upset victory over a liberal icon, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994, and in November defeated H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, in a landslide. 
Mr. Pataki approached his first term as a pragmatic conservative, cutting taxes, reducing spending and reinstating the death penalty. In his second term, he moved to the left, backing gun control, gay rights and social programs often characterized as liberal. Spending rose at three times the rate of inflation during his last six years in office.
Some in the audience today, including supporters of the governor, said he had missed a chance to touch on the issues that will probably define his third term. He did not, for instance, say anything about changing the state's stiff sentences for drug crimes or offer details about how the state intends to prevent terrorism.
"I had wished he could have just given us a little more substance, rather than painting the picture of what we're to do, the vision," said the Rev. Simon Bouie, a Republican from Harlem who backed the governor. "But I think he just didn't dab into it enough, I think, for me."

HEADLINE: Talk of a Rescue Bid Buoys Fiat's Shares 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
Shares of Fiat surged today as investors anticipated that Roberto Colaninno, the Italian entrepreneur, would make a bid to rescue the company with an injection of fresh money.
 Mr. Colaninno is considering a plan to inject as much as $8 billion into Fiat, which is crippled by heavy debt and losses at its auto division. 
 Shares of Fiat rose nearly 10 percent in trading in Milan, to 8.503 euros. In New York, its American depository receipts, each worth one ordinary share of the Italian company, rose more than 10 percent, to $8.76.
The increase came despite efforts by the Agnelli family, Fiat's largest shareholder, to throw cold water on Mr. Colaninno's idea. On Wednesday, Umberto Agnelli, the president of the holding companies through which the family controls Fiat, said with a touch of sarcasm that while he appreciated the interest in Fiat, he "would like once again to recall that there exists only one plan approved by the board of directors of Fiat in agreement with the creditor banks and the government."
Fiat presented broad plans to turn around its unprofitable auto division in May, when it gained approval for a $3 billion refinancing package from several leading Italian banks. In recent discussions with the Italian government and labor unions, Fiat won approval for a round of layoffs that could result in the elimination of as many as 8,000 jobs at its factories in Italy.
Without mentioning Mr. Colaninno by name, Mr. Agnelli emphasized the Agnellis' support for Fiat's current management, and he said the "absolute priority for Fiat Auto today is to work serenely to advance the ambitious industrial projects under way."
Mr. Colaninno is perhaps best remembered for transforming the Olivetti typewriter company into a successful computer maker and for his daring hostile takeover of Telecom Italia in 1999. He has been hunting for a big investment opportunity after making a large capital gain when he was forced out of Telecom Italia in 2001.
Even though the Agnellis have reacted coolly, a bid by Mr. Colaninno would be attractive for the banks because it would raise the prospect of lifting $3 billion worth of exposure to Fiat from their balance sheets. As the European economy continues to deteriorate, Italian banks are feeling the pinch. At Capitalia, formerly known as Banca di Roma, which together with UniCredito Italiano has the second-largest exposure to Fiat -- about 1.2 billion euros -- nonperforming loans already account for more than 11 percent of its 7 billion euros of equity.
Mr. Colaninno's idea is essentially to pump fresh money into Fiat Auto and shed assets other than the automobile, truck and farm machinery businesses.
Fiat's chairman, Paolo Fresco, has been seeking to sell assets to ease Fiat's troubled finances, and some industry experts are skeptical that Mr. Colaninno would have better luck than Mr. Fresco.
"It's not a matter of Colaninno," said one auto industry executive who knows Fiat well. "It's a matter of businesses that are not sexy to sell."
He noted that Fiat had sought, so far unsuccessfully, to shed all or part of units like Comau and Magneti Marelli, which make equipment and components for the auto industry and have been hurt by the industry's severe downturn. "When does the industry sign contracts?" the executive said. "The day before the recession's over. Now no one's betting a single cent on a turnaround."

HEADLINE: Falling Dollar Cushions Americans Investing Abroad 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Americans investing in overseas stock markets last year did better than those who stayed home.
 But that is little comfort for those who ventured beyond their backyards. It was still a decidedly down year internationally. Over the last three years, stocks have plunged abroad as well as on Wall Street, but foreign equities are down slightly more, 45 percent compared with 43 percent, in dollar terms. 
 The big surprise of the year was the relatively good performance of emerging markets, which often fare badly when major markets are soft. Twelve emerging markets were in the black for the year in dollar terms, while all but 2 of the 22 developed markets abroad were in the red, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International's stock indexes.
Unfortunately, many of the emerging-market bright spots were in less well-known, less popular places, and most American investors and fund managers probably overlooked them or had very small positions in them. Among the top performers were the Czech Republic, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Hungary and Pakistan.
Another surprise was the inability of Germany -- and, therefore, pretty much all of Europe -- to get its economy back on track. The German stock market, as measured by the Morgan Stanley index, was the worst performer among developed markets, falling 34.1 percent in dollar terms and 44.1 percent in the local currency, the euro. As a whole, the 12 euro-nation markets fell 24.6 percent, the sharpest decline in dollar terms of any region except Scandinavia.
In the end, the American investor's best friend last year was the dollar, which dropped in value. The shift reduced stock losses from many countries and actually turned local-currency declines into nice dollar gains in South Africa, New Zealand, South Korea and Austria. 
Over all, the dollar's weakness reduced losses abroad from a decline of 25.4 percent in local currencies to just 16.5 percent in dollars. The United States market fell 24 percent.
That help from the dollar seems only fair, because in 2000 and 2001, its relative strength worsened the losses for Americans who had invested abroad, turning a two-year decline of 23.9 percent in local currencies into a 33.9 percent plunge in dollars.
But the dollar did not help everywhere. Political and economic turmoil in Latin America pushed most major currencies there sharply lower and turned positive local stock performances into big dollar losses: a 51 percent plunge in Argentina, a 33.8 percent fall in Brazil and an 18.6 percent decline in Venezuela.
In general, though, if the dollar continues to decline this year, as many forecasters predict, that will be one reason for discouraged Americans to look abroad. Another positive factor is what appears to be a new determination by political and monetary leaders, especially in Europe, to stimulate economic growth.
"They are no longer worrying about the inflationary impacts," said Katherine Schapiro, portfolio manager for international equities at Strong Capital Management in San Francisco. Many analysts said the European Central Bank had kept on worrying about inflation much too long, putting off cuts in its benchmark short-term interest rate until December despite economic weakness in Europe.
The threat of a war with Iraq and a possible confrontation with North Korea over nuclear weapons curbed investors' interest at the end of 2002 and could offset any benefits from steps to stimulate the economy until both situations are resolved. Resolving them might actually give a lift to the dollar, which would then reduce foreign returns.
"It is going to more of a trading market," Ms. Schapiro said. "I don't know if we will end the year up or down, but there will be positive and negative swings, and you can make money on those."
In 2002, emerging markets were down only 8 percent in dollar terms despite big declines in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela and a 36.5 percent plunge in Turkey. But emerging markets in Eastern Europe were higher, rising 14.6 percent, led by the Czech Republic (up 40.9 percent) and Hungary (up 28.9 percent). In Asia, emerging markets fell 6.3 percent in dollar terms; the loss was limited by a 24.3 percent jump in Thailand and a 7.4 percent rise in South Korea.
India's market, in dollar terms, was up 5.93 percent, while Indonesia rose 38.1 percent, despite the terrorist attack, and Pakistan soared 122 percent.
Many of these markets had fallen sharply in recent years, so they were rising from a point where some of their stocks were attractively cheap. Some of the rallies, like that in Pakistan, were driven by local, not foreign, investors. Others, like that in South Korea, benefited from much faster rates of economic growth than in the developed countries. South Korea posted big gains earlier in the year, but they were partly undercut by renewed tensions between the United States and North Korea. 
Falling interest rates worldwide were also a plus. So were exchange-rate shifts and swings in commodity prices that made some emerging-market countries more competitive abroad.
In a few cases, the performance of one or two stocks led whole markets higher. In Colombia, where the Morgan Stanley index rose 18.3 percent in dollar terms, one dominant stock -- Bancolombia S.A. -- accounts for almost one-quarter of the index. It rose 52.5 percent last year.
Germany was unable to get its economy back on its feet, in part because of the close election for chancellor and the European Central Bank's delay in cutting its interest-rate benchmark. It has been hard to stimulate the economy in Germany and other euro-bloc countries, either through tax cuts or increased spending, because the treaty that created the new currency limits budget deficits and public debt.
Germany and its European neighbors have also proved unable to adapt to changing economic circumstances as quickly as companies and consumers in the United States. 
The most prominent European nation outside the euro bloc, Britain, also had a bad year, with its market down 17.8 percent in dollar terms.
The only good news in Europe was an 18 percent rise in the value of the euro against the dollar, trimming bottom-line losses for Americans. In the case of Austria, a 3 percent decline in euros became a 14.4 percent gain in dollars.
The same effect was seen in New Zealand, where a 4.5 percent loss in New Zealand dollars became a 20 percent gain in the American currency. The same thing was seen in South Africa (down 11.8 percent in rands, up 23.3 percent in dollars) and South Korea (off 3 percent in won, up 7.4 percent in dollars).
Japan was a surprise of sorts as its market also got a lot of help from the dollar. Stocks in Japan fell 19.4 percent in yen last year, and 11 percent in dollar terms -- but looked at either way, the decline was the smallest in the last three years.

HEADLINE: The Forgotten Forest Product: Water 

BYLINE:  By Mike Dombeck; Mike Dombeck, a professor of environmental management at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, was chief of the United States Forest Service from 1997 to 2001.

DATELINE: STEVENS POINT, Wis. 

 BODY:
My daughter, Mary, is a Peace Corps volunteer in a village in Mali. Each day she gets a small amount of drinking water, which she must purify, plus two buckets of water for bathing. We are far more fortunate here in the United States, a relatively water-rich nation. Yet even here, water restrictions have become the norm in some parts of the country -- in the East, where supplies once seemed inexhaustible, and in the arid West, where a number of states, along with Mexico, routinely fight over the trickle from what is now the parched Colorado River.
 Given such realities, I am puzzled that water rarely enters the debate as the Bush administration and interest groups argue about roadless areas, logging and forest fire management. For water is perhaps the most important forest product. 
 Forests generate most of the water in the country, providing two-thirds of all the precipitation runoff -- the water that comes from the sky -- in the 48 contiguous states. Some 14 percent of all runoff comes from the roughly 190 million acres of our national forests, which take up only 8 percent of the land. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 60 million people in 3,400 communities in 33 states rely on national forests for their drinking water. Millions more depend on state and private forests to facilitate the refilling of aquifers from which they draw their water.
A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt recognized the vital connection between forests and water. When Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot, the first United States Forest Service chief, set up the national forest system, they talked about managing for the greatest good for the greatest number -- for the long run. This was in response to the cut-and-run era of timber harvests that left the United States with 80 million acres of denuded forests known as clear-cuts, mostly in the East and upper Midwest. Roosevelt, Pinchot and other federal policymakers were most concerned about preserving the long-term timber supply and the watershed function of the forests.
Yet in modern times, this connection has been lost. When I was in the Clinton administration, I participated in more than 100 Congressional and public hearings and fielded thousands of questions about forest policy. Then, as now, water rarely surfaced as a forest management issue. Yet water from our national forests has an economic value of more than $3.7 billion a year, according to a Forest Service report issued in 2000.
How do forests produce and preserve water? The complex array of trees, shrubs, ground covers and roots slows runoff from rain and snow, and water is purified as it percolates through the soil and into aquifers. By slowing runoff, forests also reduce floods and erosion, minimizing the sediment entering streams and rivers.
Mature forests do this work best. They have the best soil, and their mixed canopy -- a mosaic of open and closed spots among the treetops -- allows for snowfall accumulation and eventual runoff. Old trees also use less water for growth than young trees do. And as intact forests better regulate water chemistry and temperatures, they enhance habitats for aquatic species. (In many streams this means better recreational opportunities, such as trout fishing.)
New York City has some of the best water in the world because it maintains healthy forests in its Catskill, Delaware and Croton watershed system. The E.P.A. recently warned that New York would have to spend more than $6 billion on a purification plant if it failed to protect those watersheds.
It comes as no surprise that the Bush administration is proposing new forest-management policies. New administrations always bring new policies. What's unfortunate, however, is that some of these policies effectively abandon Theodore Roosevelt's long-term goals. Roosevelt valued open-space preservation and resource conservation. That's why I support the recent ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld the ban on building roads in roughly 60 million acres of national forest. Maintaining these areas is both prudent and conservative, especially given the explosive rate of urban expansion and the rapid decline of open space.
New national-forest planning regulations should now specify that the remaining old-growth public forests should not be harvested, since these wild lands provide the cleanest water in the country. Rather than wasting energy on the rancorous, tired debates about road building in the wilderness and old-growth forest management, the focus should be on how to let our forests do their job of producing high-quality water. Given our water supply problems, this should be the highest priority of forest management.

HEADLINE: Report on Manufacturing Shows Sharp Improvement 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity expanded strongly in December, the first growth in four months, but it is unclear if that strength can be sustained, a private industry group said yesterday. 
 The group, the Institute for Supply Management of Tempe, Ariz., said its index of business activity registered 54.7 in December, a sharp increase from a reading of 49.2 in November. A figure above 50 signals that manufacturing is growing; a reading below 50 suggests contraction. 
 Analysts had forecast a reading of 50.1 for December. The last time the index was above 50 was in August. 
"The manufacturing sector rebounded in December," said Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the group's monthly survey. "The question at this point is whether the manufacturing sector can continue to gather momentum during the first quarter of 2003." 
Mr. Ore said that the index offered some positive signs for manufacturers as the industry entered 2003, but that the jump in activity remained difficult to explain. 
Some of the purchasing and supply executives surveyed by the institute reported an increase in new orders for their products in December. But a number still see little if any rebound, and the uncertainties involved in a prospective war with Iraq appear to be holding back business, the group said. 
The index was pushed higher in large part by a surge in new orders, and a somewhat less robust increase in production. 
Of the 20 industries surveyed, 11 reported growth including printing and publishing, food, leather, and instruments and photographic equipment. 
The report is followed by economists because it offers an early reading on the health of manufacturing industries. It is based on a survey of executives who buy the raw materials for manufacturing at more than 350 companies. 
In other economic data released yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the number of newly laid-off Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits rose 13,000 last week, to 403,000 after declining for two consecutive weeks. The number was in line with expectations. 
The four-week moving average, which tends to even out weekly volatility, rose to 418,750, from 407,500. This was the third consecutive week above 400,000, a level considered a sign of a weak labor market.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Still more brand names to get star roles in a Fox sports show.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
"THE BEST DAMN SPORTS SHOW PERIOD" is reasserting its leading role in blurring the boundaries between advertising and programming, striking two new deals, one that includes giving prominent placement to a beermaker's mascot.
 Starting Tuesday, Labatt USA will be the beer sponsor for the show, which appears on Fox Sports Net, taking over the bar set that belonged last year to Mike's Hard Lemonade. The deal, which makes up most of a $2 million advertising package that Labatt bought on Fox Sports Net for 2003, also calls for cameos by the bear mascot featured in recent Labatt Blue commercials. 
 Home Depot will follow next month via a new set simulating a backyard deck, where hosts, including Tom Arnold and Chris Rose, will regularly kick back to talk about sports. That deal, part of a package valued at $1 million to $2 million, could allow for even more product placement. "They can barbecue," said Guy Sousa, executive vice president for advertising sales at Fox Cable Sports, "and do something with sponsors' products on the grill." 
The new deals advance a merger of programming and advertising that aims to counter viewers' ability to mute or zap commercials. And the deals have plenty of recent company. In September, Fox Sports inserted computer-generated Ford F-250 Super Duty trucks onto the field at a National Football League game. On New Year's Day, as part of the halftime entertainment at the Sugar Bowl on ABC, the comedian Jimmy Kimmel was the host of a quiz incorporating a 15-foot Nokia digital-camera phone. And DaimlerChrysler, which sponsored a contest last year seeking short films that featured Chryslers, is talking to networks about turning the contest into a "reality" series, Advertising Age reported.
The Fox deal is Labatt's biggest single media buy ever, said Bryan Semkuley, vice president for marketing at Labatt, a joint venture of the Labatt Brewing Company, part of Interbrew, and FEMSA Cerveza. The show will feature three Labatt brands, Rolling Rock, Labatt Blue and Dos Equis, with signs and simulated taps on the bar. Although some details are still being negotiated, the deal could mean shooting remote segments at the Rolling Rock Town Fair; using the Labatt Blue Bear in "On the Road to the Super Bowl" programming; and generating content for the show in Mexico to promote Dos Equis, he said.
Critics who worry about the commercialization of popular culture are seeing their concern grow.
"Get used to it," said James Twitchell, professor of English and advertising at the University of Florida in Gainesville. "Media, advertising and delivery historically were merged," he said, citing examples like the corporate branding of radio orchestras, and later, the placement of products like flour on soap operas.
Only a brief bout of sensitivity to commercialism fed the idea that sponsors should not influence the content of shows, Professor Twitchell said. Now, the ease of changing channels with a remote control and the rise of digital recorders like TiVo, which helps viewers skip commercials, have led advertisers to insinuate themselves into shows again.
Not that there is anything wrong with that, Fox executives said.
"We can do it because our shows are not as much sports news," said Mr. Sousa at Fox, part of the News Corporation. "The Best Damn Sports Show Period," styled as a bunch of guys sitting around talking about sports, is entertainment, he said. Moreover, using brands like Labatt and Home Depot can lend personality and believability to the show by making the set look a lot like viewers' homes and social lives.
(Some television programmers are pushing verisimilitude even when sponsors are not paying the bill; "Lost at Home," a new ABC comedy about an advertising executive, will use real brands throughout the show without consulting marketers or receiving compensation.)
"The Best Damn Sports Show Period," which is on the air from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. each weeknight and repeats at 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., has been a leader in erasing the distinction between television programming and advertising. Last June, Levi Strauss & Company paid for an actor who was featured in a commercial for its Dockers pants to appear on the show in a skit with the hosts. The show features food prepared by the Outback Steakhouse, which regularly brought meals onto the show last year for the cast. In 2001, the show recreated sports highlights to look like Microsoft's Xbox video games.
"Certain advertisers' brands marry and fit within the Fox brands," Mr. Sousa said. "It has to be something that feels right." Of the deals with Mike's Hard Lemonade and now Labatt, he said, "It felt right to have a bar on the show."

HEADLINE: Partners in Flight 

 BODY:
America's beleaguered airlines continue to hemorrhage money at an alarming rate. After losing $7 billion in 2001, carriers are expected to report close to $9 billion in losses for 2002, the year in which both United Airlines and US Airways filed for bankruptcy. With the possibility of war on the horizon, and the economy recovering at a languid pace, no relief is in sight. 
 Congress rushed to the airlines' aid in response to the terrorist attacks in 2001, but rightly declined to approve a broader bailout. In a deregulated industry, companies should be allowed to suffer the consequences of their mistakes in an economic slowdown. However, deregulation works both ways. Congress could do a great deal to help the airlines if it lifted protectionist limits on foreign investment in U.S.-based airlines. That would stimulate competition and provide troubled carriers with fresh sources of capital. The likes of Richard Branson, the British founder of Virgin Atlantic, should be encouraged to start a new airline in the United States, not dissuaded. And if a big global player like Lufthansa wants to bail out United, so much the better. 
 The Department of Transportation, for its part, must act as if it understands that airlines are entitled to compete in a deregulated industry. Although the government does have a duty to keep airlines from engaging in unfair practices such as below-cost predatory pricing to undermine competitors, it is not supposed to stop them from trying to improve their ability to sell tickets. For example, it is not clear why Transportation has delayed approval of a proposed marketing alliance linking Delta, Continental and Northwest, even after the Justice Department indicated that the deal posed no antitrust concerns. 
Troubled carriers everywhere are wooing partners to build alliances. United and Lufthansa are leaders of the global Star Alliance, and American and British Airways head Oneworld. These partnerships allow carriers to expand their networks (because they can book connecting flights on partner airlines), while providing passengers more convenience. The government recently approved such an alliance between United and US Airways, after blocking their merger. 
Regulators should hasten to allow Delta to join Continental and Northwest in their existing alliance, which has benefited consumers without suppressing competition. Any further delay would signal an inappropriate regulatory impulse to shield bankrupt carriers from efficient competition. The fact that the government has the right to acquire a stake in some airlines as part of its loan guarantee program makes it even more inappropriate for it to block other carriers' attempts to help themselves.
The country needs healthier "network" airlines that fly coast to coast and an environment that encourages the expansion of nimbler low-cost carriers like AirTran and JetBlue. The proposed alliance serves the former need without imperiling the latter.

HEADLINE: Rate on 30-Year Mortgage Drops to 5.85% 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell this week to the lowest level in almost four decades, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. 
 The 30-year rate declined to 5.85 percent this week, the lowest since the early 1960's, from 5.93 percent, the agency said. 
The average rate on one-year adjustable mortgages rose to 4.06 percent, from 4.01 percent. 
 Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said its mortgage applications index increased 4.7 percent, to 950.9, the second increase in the last three weeks, from 908.3 in the previous week. That compares with last year's average of 796.7. 
The refinancing applications index increased 10.9 percent, to 4,548.8, the highest in five weeks, from 4,101. It also remains above the average of 3,365 for last year.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NORTHEAST ASIA; 
China 'Looming Large' in South Korea As Biggest Player, Replacing the U.S.

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
Faced with a looming crisis over North Korea's nuclear bomb program, South Korea sent an envoy today to its most important economic partner: China.
 The bland result was a one-line statement that the two sides had discussed "common concerns on North Korea nuclear issues." 
 But South Korea's choice was telling. Until a decade ago, South Korea had no diplomatic relations with China, the godfather of North Korea. For all security matters, Seoul turned first to its own godfather, the United States. 
But just as billboards with South Korean corporate names now line the highway from Beijing's international airport, a fundamental economic and power shift is taking place in Northeast Asia, and not just the one surrounding North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons.
In 2001, for the first time, more Chinese -- 444,113 -- visited South Korea than Americans. That year, also for the first time, South Koreans invested more money, $830 million, in China than in the United States. In 2002, for the first time in a century, China reasserted its historic role as the largest trading partner for the Korean peninsula.
Displacing the United States as South Korea's largest trading partner, China saw its two-way trade with South Korea jump by about 20 percent last year, heading over the $100 billion mark.
"China is looming large as an alternative to the United States," said Lee Jung Hoon, a professor of International Relations at Yonsei University. Referring to a recent wave of protests, he added, "This is particularly being played out with this anti-American sentiment in South Korea."
Although political and security relations have been slow to catch up with the new economic realities, China increasingly sees North Korea as an economic liability and South Korea as an economic asset. At the same time, China retains a special relationship with North Korea that gives it exceptional political and diplomatic leverage.
China, which is North Korea's largest trading partner and historic guarantor, has taken the rare step of publicly rebuking North Korea for its nuclear weapons program. Last fall, China aggressively defended its interests against North Korea by arresting a Chinese man who had been named days earlier by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, to run a new free trade zone on China's border.
In today's nuclear issue, China has clear security fears. If North Korea builds up a nuclear arsenal, the thinking goes, South Korea and Japan will match it. North Korea's admission of a secret bomb program last October pushed Japan to commit last month to a higher stage of a missile defense research program with the United States.
The question hanging over Northeast Asia today is: will China use its leverage to persuade North Korea to abandon its bomb program? Many South Koreans and Japanese fear that China will decide that the path of least resistance will be to persuade South Korea and Japan to accept a nuclear North Korea.
Northeast Asia's biggest poverty pocket, North Korea is kept going partly as a result of Chinese aid, donations of food and oil. China sees this aid as an insurance payment against the collapse of the North's police state. If North Korea's dikes were to lower, millions of impoverished people would flood into northeastern China, a migration that would tip ethnic balances in a border area where ethnic Koreans already account for 40 percent of the people.
By contrast, capitalist South Korea is of major economic interest to China, funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into the same Chinese areas threatened by a North Korean exodus. Home to China's largest concentration of ethnic Koreans, the area directly north of North Korea has an annual per capita income of $1,154, about one-half that of the greater Beijing area and one-third that of Shanghai.
Over all, South Korea is expected to invest $1 billion in China this year, about half of its total overseas investment. With about 8,000 companies employing hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers, South Korea now is the fifth largest foreign investor in China, after the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore. South Korea, with a population of only 43 million, is now China's third largest trading partner.
"Compare these numbers with less than $500 million in trade and negligible investments between China and North Korea as of the end of 2002, and you will see where Chinese capital sees its future," Alexandre Mansourov, a North Korea specialist at the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, wrote recently.
Following the money, with a lag, relations are tightening between China and Korea, which from 1400 to 1800 was a vassal state of China.
Over the last year, China and South Korea exchanged their first port calls by ships of their navies. To avoid offending China, South Korea in recent years has discouraged visa applications by the Dalai Lama and by former leaders of Taiwan.
In a rare dissenting voice, the Journalists Association of Korea protested assaults by Chinese police officers on North Korean defectors and journalists last spring, saying the police action "branded China as an inhumane country, and confirmed that China is an undemocratic country which allows beating of journalists."
Still, "China fever" persists. Chinese language schools are jammed here, with more South Koreans now studying Chinese than Japanese. Seoul subways recently added Chinese announcements to Korean and English. Following shifting tastes, Yonhap, South Korea's news agency, last summer shelved plans for opening a bureau in Osaka, Japan, choosing to open instead in Shanghai.
The number of South Koreans studying at Chinese universities jumps yearly. Chinese youth have also been hit by "the Korean wave," a vogue for Korean pop movies, music and television drama.
Ever stronger bonds with China were predicted by 51 future leaders of South Korea, aged 30 to 49, who were interviewed a year ago by Gallup Korea for a project commissioned by the National Defense University of the United States.
Looking at China, 90 percent saw their huge neighbor "primarily as a market and economic opportunity," compared with 10 percent who saw it as "a potential military threat."

Student Arrested in DirecTV Piracy Case

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
A 19-year-old University of Chicago student was arrested in Los Angeles today and charged with stealing trade secrets from DirecTV, the nation's leading satellite television provider. 
 Federal prosecutors said that Igor Serebryany of Los Angeles would be charged under the rarely used 1996 Economic Espionage Act with stealing the documents -- which described the latest technology to control access to DirecTV -- and releasing them on the Internet. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
 Prosecutors said Mr. Serebryany, a sophomore at the University of Chicago, stole confidential papers about DirecTV's latest generation of satellite television smart cards from the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. Mr. Serebryany, who worked for an outside document preparation company, was imaging papers for a civil lawsuit over DirecTV's card technology.
Jones Day represents DirecTV in a lawsuit against NDS, the company that designs encrypted satellite cards for DirecTV. According to prosecutors, Mr. Serebryany sent hundreds of digital documents to three satellite pirate Web sites in September and October. 
The confidential documents contained technical specifications for DirecTV's Period 4 generation of satellite smart cards, as well as correspondence between NDS and DirecTV discussing the card's architecture and design, according to DirectTV. The technical details about the card are valuable because the three previous generations of DirecTV access cards have already been hacked by pirates. 
Satellite television smart cards, which slide into set-top boxes, contain computer chips that decrypt signals from DirecTV's satellites. Hacked satellite television cards override the encryption technology, allowing a viewer to receive the satellite signals free.
While prosecutors say Mr. Serebryany did not profit personally by releasing the documents, the Economic Espionage Act prohibits the release of information to benefit others. "This is a very serious crime which we will prosecute aggressively," said James W. Spertus, an assistant United States attorney. 
Satellite piracy is a huge underground industry estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. Many of the pirate vendors are based in Canada where, until this year, the legal status of pirating American satellite television was ambiguous. Dozens of Web sites are devoted to satellite piracy. Many of them serve as public forums for discussions on how to reverse-engineer the Period 4 technology.
DirecTV said that the documents, though confidential, did not provide a roadmap for reverse-engineering the new chip. "The card is designed so that even if you know everything about it, you still can't hack it," said Marc Zwillinger, the lead lawyer for DirecTV's anti-piracy efforts.
DirecTV has been plagued by piracy. The company has 11 million paying subscribers, but industry analysts estimate that an additional million or more households illicitly receive DirecTV signals. To combat the piracy, DirecTV spent $25 million on research and development of Period 4, which it introduced last year. The company is also spending tens of millions of dollars to mail the cards to subscribers.

HEADLINE: Companies in U.S. Sing Blues As Europe Reprises 50's Hits 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
European copyright protection is expiring on a collector's trove of 1950's jazz, opera and early rock 'n' roll albums, forcing major American record companies to consider deals with bootleg labels and demand new customs barriers.
 Already reeling from a stagnant economy and the illegal but widespread downloading of copyrighted music from the Internet, the recording companies will now face a perfectly legal influx of European recordings of popular works. 
 Copyright protection lasts only 50 years in European Union countries, compared with 95 years in the United States, even if the recordings were originally made and released in America. So recordings made in the early- to mid-1950's -- by figures like Maria Callas, Elvis Presley and Ella Fitzgerald -- are entering the public domain in Europe, opening the way for any European recording company to release albums that had been owned exclusively by particular labels.
Although the distribution of such albums would be limited to Europe in theory, record-store chains and specialty outlets in the United States routinely stock foreign imports. 
Expiring copyrights could mean much cheaper recordings for music lovers, but they do not bode well for major record companies. (These copyrights apply to only the recordings, not the music recorded.) The expected crush of material entering the public domain has already sent one giant company, EMI Classics, into a shotgun marriage with a renegade label that it had long tried to shut down to protect its lucrative Callas discography. The influx also has the American record industry talking about erecting a customs barrier.
"The import of those products would be an act of piracy," said Neil Turkewitz, the executive vice president international of the Recording Industry Association of America, which has strongly advocated for copyright protections. "The industry is regretful that these absolutely piratical products are being released." 
The industry association is trying to persuade European Union countries to extend copyright terms. Meanwhile, Mr. Turkewitz said, "we will try to get these products blocked," arguing that customs agents "have the authority to seize these European recordings even in the absence of an injunction brought by the copyright owners."
Expiring copyrights have already led to voluminous European reissues of such historically important artists as the violinist Jascha Heifetz and the jazz cornetist Bix Beiderbecke. But the recordings of the 50's are viewed as being of another order. 
That was the era when recording techniques took a quantum leap and when the long-playing record came into its own and was embraced by the public. Even monaural records from the period, before stereophonic sound, are prized today by classical and jazz audiophiles. Artistically, the decade coincided with the golden years of opera legends like Renata Tebaldi; the birth of rock heralded by recordings of Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Presley; and enormous outbursts of creativity from seminal jazz figures like Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. "That decade of recording transformed music and how the public consumes music," Mr. Turkewitz said.
That was also the great decade of Callas, who was under exclusive contract to EMI. The looming expiration of copyright on EMI's extensive Callas selections compelled that London-based company to form an alliance with a former enemy. 
EMI Classics (formerly Angel Records) has been the official keeper of the Callas discography since 1953, when Callas, the Greek soprano, was 29 and made her first recordings for the company. Over the years, EMI has contended with independent labels that released unauthorized Callas recordings, mostly taken from pirated live performances. In the late 1990's, the bane of EMI's existence was a Milan-based independent called Diva, the largest producer of the unofficial recordings. (A lawyer for Diva, Kriton Metaxopoulos, said that Diva never released Callas recordings without the approval of her heirs.)
But last year, with the support of the Callas estate in Athens, EMI made a deal with Diva, which two years ago reconstituted itself as Marcal Records (for Maria Callas) and moved its offices to the Virgin Islands for tax purposes. In November EMI released a new batch of Callas recordings, including four complete live operas and five CD's of live concerts and rehearsals. The source for these was Marcal. 
The strategy would seem to be, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Richard Lyttelton, president of classics and jazz for EMI Recorded Music, concedes as much.
"For many years EMI was in opposition to Diva," Mr. Lyttelton said in a recent interview from London. "But there has been an irresistible pull for us to work together." With this deal, as Mr. Lyttelton explained, EMI "wanted to try to legitimize the market" for these live Callas recordings "rather than try to suppress it."
The company hopes that its unconventional deal with Diva may prove to be an indirect way to maintain dominance in the Callas market, which has been crucial to EMI's artistic legacy and its bottom line. Callas recordings, most of them made between 1953 and 1960, account for about 5 percent of sales for EMI's classical division in a typical year, more than for any artist on that division's current roster, said Mark Forlow, vice president of EMI Classics. "It's amazing," Mr. Forlow said. "Those records just keep selling."
In 1997, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Callas's death at 53, EMI issued the first of three installments of its complete Callas Collection, which included 59 releases, including 31 complete operas, all impressively remastered, intelligently packaged and rich with program notes.
With its new releases, EMI has issued live Callas performances that it was trying to suppress not so long ago, banking that its quality presentation will draw Callas fans and keep them away from cheaper choices. As a further inducement, the new EMI releases are being sold at mid-price. 
This strategy has been tried for years by specialty labels like Mosaic Records, a reissue company that releases critically praised boxed sets of classic jazz recordings. Mosaic recently released a seven-CD set of recordings by Beiderbecke, who died in 1931. But cheap competition from European labels has hurt the profitability of such projects, said Michael Cuscuna, Mosaic's president.
"With the Beiderbecke set, we went to the original metal discs and did the best possible sound transfers," he said. "But a handful of European companies have put out this stuff just dumped off the original 78's. That the recording exists in such an inferior state hurts the music." Mr. Cuscuna said that some European labels simply wait for a reissue to come out in the United States, then copy it and appropriate the photographs. "Yet, consumers still go for the cheaper product," he said. "It's discouraging. We've got to get the major labels to take a stand."
Consumer advocates and champions of access to creative products see many copyright protections as too lengthy, unfair to the public and ultimately stifling to creativity. "When works enter the public domain, the consequence is extraordinary variety and lower costs," said Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law School. Professor Lessig appeared before the United States Supreme Court to challenge a 1998 law that extended copyright protection by 20 years, and a decision could come from the court as early as this month. 
The Callas recordings, for example, "will be taken and put into a million different content spheres," he said. "They will be encouraged and sold in ways not done now."
This is all the more true because of the Internet, Professor Lessig added. Once copyrighted works enter the public domain, he said, "a wide range of copies -- high quality and low -- will quickly be available, always and for free." Unlike many record companies, he considers this beneficial. "People ask, 'How could you ever compete with free?' " he said. "Think Perrier or Poland Spring." 
According to Mr. Turkewitz, it is illegal under American copyright law to download material protected in the United States regardless of the legal status of that material in another country. Still, the computer file-sharing programs that are cropping up everywhere make this law difficult to enforce.
Defenders of extended copyright terms, like Mr. Turkewitz, argue that, if anything, American laws are still too lax and that the European laws are woefully inadequate. 
"The public sees icons like Mickey Mouse and thinks that the companies must by now have made their money," he said. But, he added, 9 out of 10 sound recordings lose money. "Very few materials wind up generating the revenues that sustain an entire system," he said. "The amount of money put back into production by the record companies is enormous. It's extremely risk-intensive." 
One example of what EMI faces by the end of this year is that any European label will be able to release a staple of the company's catalog: the incomparable 1953 Callas recording of Puccini's "Tosca" with Giuseppe di Stefano as Cavaradossi and Tito Gobbi as Scarpia, both at their peaks, with the Italian maestro Victor de Sabata conducting.
Callas fans, no doubt, will heatedly debate the artistic merits and the sound restoration on the four new releases of live performances from La Scala on EMI, the most familiar being a 1955 performance of Bellini's "Sonnambula," with Callas in top form and Leonard Bernstein, then 36, conducting. This recording, available over the years on various independent labels, has long been an underground hit.
The stakes for EMI are considerable. 
"Some in the company say we should be throwing roses on the Aegean Sea every year," Mr. Forlow said. "Callas keeps the lights on here."

HEADLINE: A Bad Bet 

 BODY:
Pro-gambling lobbyists across the country cannot believe their good fortune. The worst budgetary outlook in decades has left plenty of desperate state governments once again vulnerable to being snookered by the gambling lobby's alluring "something-for-nothing" sales pitch, the fiscal equivalent of a comped buffet. States should know better by now. Opposing an ill-advised expansion of legalized gambling will be a true test of leadership for governors and state legislators nationwide. 
 States embraced gambling as a fiscal panacea during the last economic slowdown, in the early 1990's. Video poker machines (the industry's crack cocaine) and riverboat casinos spread into such improbable venues as Iowa and South Carolina. 
 It is painfully clear that not every state, and indeed not every county, can sustain its own Las Vegas. People do not fly across the country to gamble in South Dakota saloons, and there is no long-term economic payoff in enticing locals to ante up. The all-too-distressing reality created by gambling's spread is more crime, more addiction and more local businesses being cannibalized. 
In recent years, the drive to expand legalized gambling has lost its momentum. Flusher economic times helped state governments acknowledge that gambling's social costs outweighed whatever windfall could be had in tax revenue. In 1999 the Congressionally appointed National Gambling Impact Study Commission called for a moratorium on the spread of gambling. 
Now budget deficits are back, and so are the pro-gambling lobbyists. From California to Florida and Massachusetts, states are eyeing an expansion of legalized gambling. The gleeful lobbyists portray the issue as a choice between voluntary and involuntary taxes. What they don't add is that this so-called voluntary tax is regressive and saddles communities with unacceptably high social costs. 
The case made for expanding gambling is usually a disingenuous one. It's all about saving venerable horse tracks (by bringing in slot machines), enhancing an existing lottery or helping Indian nations. An army of Washington lobbyists and outside casino operators eager to join with real and imagined tribes has worked hard to transform laws allowing gambling on reservations into a regulatory Trojan horse stuffed with slot machines. 
Among the ensuing absurdities: Indian-owned off-reservation casinos, like the glitzy one the Seneca Nation opened on New Year's Eve in Niagara Falls, N.Y. Casinos already operate on the Canadian side of the falls. 
One rationale for allowing casino gambling in New York State, as in most places, is a rather defensive "If we don't take the wagers, other states will." Courageous leaders must resist this destructive race to the bottom.

HEADLINE: MORGAN RESOLVES DISPUTE ON ENRON 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan Chase announced yesterday that it would receive about $580 million from insurance companies as part of a settlement resolving one of the most contentious disputes touched off by Enron's collapse.
 The settlement is a partial victory for J. P. Morgan, which had sought nearly $1 billion from the insurers and will take a charge of about $400 million to cover the difference. 
 Trying to put a year of corporate scandal behind it, J. P. Morgan also announced the creation of a $900 million reserve to cover the anticipated costs of various lawsuits and settlements. Those include its share of the recent accord reached by the securities industry regarding conflicts of interest and possible resolutions of suits brought by Enron shareholders.
The charge and the additional reserves will cause the bank to post a loss for the quarter just ended. 
The insurance dispute centered on allegations that J. P. Morgan had defrauded insurers, disguising loans to Enron as commodities trades. The insurers had issued bonds guaranteeing the trades, and J. P. Morgan sought to collect on them after Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2001. The insurers balked at paying, saying that they had been misled about the nature of the transactions. J. P. Morgan contended that the insurance companies were aware of the details of the complex deals -- which later drew the scrutiny of Congressional investigators, regulators and shareholders' lawyers -- and sued the insurers early last year. The case had gone to trial and was set to go to the jury yesterday.
Investors had feared that J. P. Morgan would recover none of the $1 billion it sought from the insurers and they greeted the bank's announcements with enthusiasm yesterday, sending the stock up $1.78, or 7.5 percent, to $25.44.
As both sides faced the uncertainty of the outcome of the case, the insurance companies viewed the settlement as a prudent way to avoid larger lawsuits.
"We are very satisfied with the results of this settlement," said Alan Levine, a lawyer at Kronish Lieb Weiner & Hellman in New York who represented the insurance companies. "The economics of the settlement speak for itself."
But for J. P. Morgan, the settlement resolves only one problem for an institution that has been battered by bad loans and a tough business environment. Some critics have said that J. P. Morgan has not taken adequate steps to prepare for more litigation related to Enron and other companies tainted by scandal, and noted that Citigroup announced last week that it would set up a $1.5 billion reserve to cope with litigation and settlements.
J. P. Morgan's revenues have been disappointing for two years, since the merger of J. P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan, and its stock declined almost 40 percent in 2002. Even without the fallout from Enron, J. P. Morgan's chief executive, William B. Harrison Jr., who helped engineer the giant merger, faces significant challenges because of the plunge in the stock market and in investment banking.
"What you still have is a case of very depressed earnings; I can't imagine a near- or intermediate-term improvement in that," said Stephen Biggar, a bank equity analyst at Standard & Poor's. The company must deal with both risky loans and slow investment banking business, he said. "Unless or until those things improve, I don't see any fundamental improvement."
Nonetheless, the settlement of the dispute with the insurance companies is good news, analysts said, because it eliminates uncertainty about the outcome of a trial that was under way in federal court in Manhattan. 
The insurance companies, including Travelers and Liberty Mutual, said J. P. Morgan participated in fraudulent transactions involving contracts to buy gas by a Jersey Islands entity, Mahonia Ltd. 
The insurance companies, which issued surety bonds to guarantee the delivery of the gas, argued that Mahonia was never intended to receive any gas. Instead, they contended that the gas purchases and subsequent trades really provided a way for J. P. Morgan to lend money to Enron without loans appearing on Enron's balance sheet. 
When Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2001, it ceased to comply with the gas sales contracts. J. P. Morgan sought to compel the insurers to pay on the surety bonds, the insurance companies refused, and the bank sued.
In court last month, the insurance companies introduced an e-mail message by a J. P. Morgan vice chairman, Donald H. Layton, referring to transactions involving Enron as "disguised loans." It was not clear, though, that Mr. Layton was referring specifically to transactions involving Mahonia. J. P. Morgan insisted in court that the insurance companies knew the nature of the transactions involving Enron.
In an e-mail message sent to J. P. Morgan employees on the eve of trial in early December, the bank's general counsel wrote that J. P. Morgan "made no representations to the insurance companies," and that "when they issued the bonds, the insurance companies made little or no inquiry about the facts about which they now say they were misled."
Yesterday, J. P. Morgan executives said the settlement vindicated their argument that the insurers' payment obligations were valid.
"The settlement at the level at which we settled represents, at least from our perspective, recognition of our position that we were in the right," Dina Dublon, J. P. Morgan's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts.
Another financial institution, FleetBoston Financial, also participated in one of the Mahonia transactions and will be covered by the settlement, though its exposure was a fraction of J. P. Morgan's. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
J. P. Morgan valued the settlement at $579 million, or 60 percent of the $965 million that it sought. The insurance companies said that the settlement would cost them about $503 million because the amount they will pay will be reduced by the value of their claims against Enron. The settlement values those claims at 13 cents on the dollar. J. P. Morgan executives said they could sell those claims for that amount, and would still receive about $580 million.
The 11 insurers involved in the settlement are the Travelers Casualty and Surety Company and the Travelers Indemnity Company; the St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company; the Continental Casualty Company and the National Fire Insurance Company, both part of the CNA Financial Corporation; the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, part of Allianz; the Safeco Insurance Company; the Federal Insurance Company, part of Chubb; the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, part of Hartford Financial Services; the Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company, part of Kemper; and the Liberty Mutual Group.
As a result of the settlement and the creation of the reserve, executives at J. P. Morgan said the bank would take a charge of 43 cents a share for the last three months of 2002 and would report a loss in the quarter. Analysts had predicted that J. P. Morgan would report a profit of about 36 cents a share. In the final quarter of 2001, the bank posted a loss of 18 cents a share, citing losses on loans to Argentina and to Enron, among other items.
Bank executives said yesterday that they did not expect the settlement or reserve to have any impact on its future dividend payments, something that investors have been watching closely.
J. P. Morgan had been treating the full $965 million in the Mahonia surety case essentially as a bad loan and will now take a charge against earnings for the $400 million ($260 million after taxes, according to the bank) that it will not receive, as well as a charge for the $900 million reserve ($600 million after taxes). The charges will be applied to the bank's results for the final quarter of 2002.
That is still relatively good news, said David Stumpf, a banking analyst at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "The market was bracing itself for potential total loss on these surety bonds," so the fact that J. P. Morgan is getting nearly $600 million has cheered investors, he said.
The size of the charges that J. P. Morgan was taking for other litigation also reassured markets, even if it was smaller than Citibank's reserve, Mr. Stumpf said. J. P. Morgan executives said the bank's reserve was smaller in part because it must pay a smaller share of a settlement reached by the securities industry in recent weeks regarding conflicts of interest related to research analysts.
By settling the Mahonia dispute, J. P. Morgan avoids the risk of an adverse jury verdict that could be used against it in other shareholder lawsuits. However, evidence on the nature of the Mahonia transactions -- like the internal bank e-mail messages -- will almost certainly be used against it, said William S. Lerach, who represents the lead plaintiff in an Enron shareholder class-action suit that names J. P. Morgan as a defendant.
"The evidence that came out is very favorable to our case," Mr. Lerach said. "It shows clearly that they were disguised loans and it shows clearly that J. P. Morgan characterized them as disguised loans at the top levels of the company. Of course we will use that evidence."

HEADLINE: RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Commercial Developer Jumps Into Home Rental

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
Forest City Ratner Companies, known for developing large commercial and hotel projects including the $1 billion MetroTech Center in Brooklyn and the Harlem Center, an $80 million mixed-use project on West 125th Street, is dipping into the Manhattan residential market.
 Construction is expected to be complete in March on a 20-story, 330-unit rental apartment building at 111 Worth Street that extends from Lafayette Street almost to Broadway in the Civic Center neighborhood. It sits on property that had several low-rise structures that were vacant when they were demolished. Rental of studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments is to begin on Jan. 15. Pinnacle Realty, a partner in the venture, will manage the building. 
 Forest City Ratner's only other residential property in the city is Queenswood, two eight-story buildings for low- and moderate-income tenants built in 1980 in Corona, Queens.
"We haven't done anything in Manhattan before because it is very competitive and because of the difficulty finding locations," said Bruce C. Ratner, the firm's president and chief executive. "We built this ourselves and think it was an opportunity that makes economic sense. 
"We are not new to housing," he continued, pointing out that the firm's parent company, Forest City Enterprises, based in Cleveland, has a background in residential development. "The national company owns well over 25,000 housing units."
The Worth Street project, which cost about $120 million, is being financed through state-issued bonds backed by HVB Real Estate, a division of the HVB Group, a bank based in Munich.
Building a condo or cooperative, rather than a rental, was never considered, Mr. Ratner said. "Although we develop land for multi- and single-family homes around the country, we don't actually build for-sale housing to any extent," he said. "It is more volatile." 
Asked about the timing of opening his first Manhattan residential building in a softening rental market, Mr. Ratner said: "It takes many years to develop a project, and this was probably conceived three years ago. We also feel that the Civic Center area has been underbuilt until now, so the long-term outlook is strong." The company has no current plans to develop other residential buildings here, he said.
Many of the 111 Worth Street apartments, even those on lower floors, will have sweeping views of the East and Hudson Rivers, the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, Foley Square and City Hall through their floor-to-ceiling windows.
The building, designed by Costas Kondylis, is clad in beige brick panels. The configuration of the apartments is straightforward, with kitchens opening loft-style onto living rooms. Kitchens will have granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances and white laminate cabinets. Floors will be oak parquet, and bathrooms will have standard-size tubs and pedestal sinks.
The building will have some unusual amenities. There will be three outdoor spaces, a sky deck on the roof -- where there will be an outdoor shower for sunbathers -- another deck on the 14th-floor setback and a landscaped garden on the second floor, where a four-hole putting green will be installed. Two netted golf driving cages occupying about 300 square feet will sit at right angles to the garden. There will also be fitness and business centers, and a coffee bar. Retail shops, including a Starbucks, will occupy the double-height ground floor.
Rents for studios will start at $1,815, one bedrooms at $2,350 and two bedrooms at $3,995. The most expensive unit, a large two-bedroom with individual terrace, will be $6,750 a month. Tenants will be eligible for $6,000 grants awarded by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to people living in the downtown area for at least two years. 
In exchange for $114 million worth of tax-exempt bonds issued by the New York State Housing Finance Agency, the company is reserving 56 of the 330 units for residents earning incomes no more than 50 percent of the median income for the area, or about $31,400 for a family of four. Another 10 units are set aside for people with incomes no more than 40 percent of area median income, or $25,120 for a family of four.
More than 16,000 people contacted the Settlement Housing Fund, which is administering the selection process, which begins with a lottery to be conducted on Tuesday and the investigation into the qualification of the candidates. "We closed off the applications at 12,000," said Susan Cole, associate director of the fund.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Anxious And Obsessed With Image

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Of all the notes sounded in the collective dream life of movies lately, the most insistent may be a faraway but steady thrum of fear. As we confront the threat of terrorism and the possibility of war at a time of economic uncertainty, which is the wiser course: to grit our teeth and imagine worst-possible scenarios, or to put on a happy face and reaffirm our faith in the future?
 In "Catch Me if You Can," Steven Spielberg, demonstrating his usual intuition into the mood of mass culture, may have distilled those conflicting impulses more deftly than any other filmmaker. Based on a true story, it celebrates a prodigious teenage master of disguise and fraud embodied by none other than that chameleonic man-child, Leonardo DiCaprio. 
 Although the movie is set in the 1960's, its portrait of a brilliant dissembler speaks directly to an obsession with appearances and surfaces that has grown steadily more intense since the decade the movie both enshrines and gently satirizes. Back then, today's endless vocabulary of image manipulation, from Botox to spin doctor, was still in an early stage of codification. 
Variations on the slippery notion of image can be detected in several other of the more acclaimed films released at the end of 2002. "Far From Heaven" is a stylized homage to the 1950's melodramas of Douglas Sirk, with their glamorous surfaces and churning psychological undercurrents. At the same time, it is a reflection on the gap between the stylized artificiality of films from that era and real life as it was led then. Going further, it comments on the gap between hard-line conservative values and public political correctness in which a slip of the tongue can spell political suicide.
"Adaptation" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" -- both of which have scripts by 2002's hottest young screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman -- inflect reality with fantasy, leaving it up to the viewer to choose between alternate interpretations of events. Both movies evoke the world as a tricky through-the-looking-glass hall of mirrors. On a soberer level, "The Hours" and "About Schmidt" revolve around angst-ridden middle-class characters (one a retired Middle American insurance executive) searching for meaning and value in their lives.
Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" (in which Mr. DiCaprio appears as a street fighter bent on avenging his father's murder) and Spike Lee's "25th Hour" are steeped in post-9/11 paranoia. Both refer solemnly to the destruction of the World Trade Center, and their hyper-macho stance presumes an environment so consumed by tribal belligerence that there's no room left for gentleness. A variation of that cynicism even runs to the core of the movie musical "Chicago," the prison fantasies of a murderess whose trial becomes a national sensation that makes her a star.
Those are some of the ideas floating around the worthy end-of-the-year movies, 15 of which are listed in order of personal preference. Omitted are the franchise movies like "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and the latest Harry Potter, James Bond and "Star Trek" episodes, and the season's romantic comedies. The selection makes it a point to mention outstanding supporting performances.

'Talk to Her'
No other filmmaker has a more compassionate appreciation of the human comedy than the Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, whose newest film is a wildly inventive celebration of sensitive men and the comatose women they love. The indelible characters include a virginal mama's boy (Javier Camara) who worships an unconscious ballerina (Leonor Watling) and a weepy Argentine journalist (Dario Grandinetti) in love with a female bullfighter (Rosario Flores). As the story twists and turns, the film becomes a transcendently tender soap opera fraught with tragedy and miracles.
PLUSES: In the year's most ravishing film score (by Alberto Iglesias) swatches of symphonic flamenco pivot around a transfixing performance by the Brazilian singer and songwriter Caetano Veloso. A silent, black-and-white movie-within-the-movie cracks a Freudian joke that sends tragicomic shivers through the rest of the film.
MINUSES: Because Mr. Almodovar's sexually ambiguous universe is a world unto itself, those who demand rigid psychological realism might be confounded.

'The Hours'
Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning meditation on Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" skips around in time while reflecting on the lasting power of literature, the possibility of suicide and the essential aloneness of the human condition. Nicole Kidman, giving the performance of her career, offers one of the most truthful and unsettling portrayals of mental illness ever filmed. Julianne Moore, as a morose Los Angeles housewife in 1951, and Meryl Streep, as a book editor living in contemporary Greenwich Village, are Woolf's spiritual heirs nagged by profound life-and-death questions.
PLUSES: A furious, thrashing performance by Ed Harris as a poet dying of AIDS and a smaller, scintillating one by Toni Collette as a troubled California housewife lead the list of brilliant supporting performances.
MINUSES: "The Hours" is the furthest thing from a mall movie. Although it avoids morbidity, it is a somber, literary film that might mystify those unfamiliar with Woolf.

'About Schmidt'
Jack Nicholson is Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance executive from Omaha who hits the road in a Winnebago after the sudden death of his wife. A trip to Denver to attend the wedding of his daughter (Hope Davis) becomes a quest for meaning in a life he sees as pointless. Created by the same directing and screenwriting team (Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor) who gave us "Citizen Ruth" and "Election," the movie balances astute satire of Middle American mores with a deep respect for that culture's solidity.
PLUSES: Mr. Nicholson's portrayal of Schmidt, a sad, stooped-over retiree on the verge of old age, is the furthest thing from the flaming, Mephistophelean rebels that have been his specialty, and it stands as one of his two or three greatest screen performances. Kathy Bates has a flashy cameo as the bridegroom's garrulous, randy mother.
MINUSES: Underneath its humor, "About Schmidt" (like "The Hours") conveys a deep current of angst that some may find forbidding.

'Adaptation'
In a fiercely witty comedy that crashes headlong through the looking glass, Nicolas Cage plays identical twins, both screenwriters, of opposite sensibility. One of them is the movie's real-life screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, frustrated in his attempt to adapt Susan Orlean's book "The Orchid Thief" into a serious film. The other is his phantom twin, Donald, who writes trashy screenplays that sell and scores with women. The movie's crowning joke is to have its last third hijacked by Donald and turned into a ludicrous but oddly touching action-adventure fantasy that culminates in a Florida swamp. Spike Jonze directed "Adaptation" with the same fearlessly zany elan he brought to "Being John Malkovich." Who knew that a movie about writer's block could be so funny?
PLUSES: Mr. Cage, who appears to have put on at least 20 pounds for his dual role, is equally convincing as a shy, self-loathing schlub and his carefree doppelganger. As Ms. Orlean, Meryl Streep gives a refined comic performance that gives the film a perfect twist of lemon. Most impressive is Chris Cooper's portrayal of John Laroche, the eccentric gap-toothed orchid thief whose story Charlie is struggling to tell.
MINUSES: Those who dislike witty intellectual games will find the movie's smart-aleck concepts and twisty plot irritating.

'Far From Heaven'
Todd Haynes's homage to the sudsy melodramas of Douglas Sirk, set in Hartford in 1957, is a politically savvy variation on the vintage Rock Hudson-Jane Wyman weepie "All That Heaven Allows." Julianne Moore is Cathy Whitaker, a magazine-perfect 50's housewife whose world shatters when her husband (Dennis Quaid) begins exploring his homosexuality, and her chaste friendship with an African-American gardener (Dennis Haysbert) makes her a social pariah. If the film's portrait of a repressed, rigidly conformist society has elements of a horror film, it also resonates uncomfortably with today's conservative, image-obsessed cultural climate.
PLUSES: Ms. Moore's Cathy is a luminous period butterfly whose wings are about to be singed, and Mr. Quaid's Frank is a painfully acute study of sexual repression and self-loathing. The movie is almost stolen by Patricia Clarkson's fussy, chatty portrayal of Cathy's solicitous but ultimately poisonous best friend, whose tolerance is stretched beyond its limit.
MINUSES: Those unwilling to make the imaginative connections the film encourages may find it cold, artificial and overly schematic.

'Chicago'
Although it opened on Broadway in 1975, this cynical vaudeville musical set in Prohibition-era Chicago is right in sync with the age of O. J. Simpson and the Menendez Brothers and the MTV diva wars. Renee Zellweger, who recalls the young Shirley MacLaine, and Catherine Zeta-Jones are Roxie Hart and Velma Kelley, homicidal vaudevillians who, promoted by a lawyer (Richard Gere) with the instincts of P. T. Barnum, become tabloid sensations.
PLUSES: Rob Marshall has turned the movie into a sustained rush of energy that lifts off from his Bob Fosse-style choreography and jump-cut editing. The result is the most exciting movie musical since "Cabaret."
MINUSES: Musical-theater purists have a lot to grumble about. The show's hard-edged characters, especially the sinister prison matron (Queen Latifah), have been greatly softened, and one of the finest songs from the hard-edged Kander and Ebb score, "Class," has been eliminated.

'Gangs of New York'
Martin Scorsese's huge, lumbering epic of ethnic warfare on the mean streets of 1860's New York (culminating in the 1863 Civil War Draft Riots, in which much of the city was consumed by fire) is a towering feat of cinematic imagination. The gory, rough-hewn film is carried on the shoulders of its central character, William Cutting, a k a Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), the brutal one-eyed leader of the so-called Nativists battling the Irish immigrants in huge, splashy set pieces in the Five Points neighborhood. The spine of the story follows the rise of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), the son of a slain Irish-American kingpin, who is determined to avenge his father's death at the butcher's hands.
PLUSES: The breadth of its vision makes "Gangs of New York" Mr. Scorsese's "Apocalypse Now" and "Birth of a Nation." The movie forcefully conveys his brutal vision of a nation forged in bloodshed and tribal warfare. Mr. Day-Lewis's Cutting is a Paul Bunyan-size villain.
MINUSES: Subsidiary characters remain out of focus, and subplots are left frustratingly undeveloped. Mr. DiCaprio's dull, blocky Vallon is no match for Mr. Day-Lewis's swashbuckling butcher.

'The Pianist'
Roman Polanski's film about Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish concert pianist and composer who against all odds survived in the devastated Warsaw ghetto, is a forceful act of remembrance (and perhaps of contrition) from the exiled bad-boy director. The film documents the rapidly tightening grip of the Nazis on the Jews of Warsaw. By sheer luck, Szpilman, played by Adrien Brody, escapes deportation to a death camp. The heart of the film details his desperate, lonely struggle for food, water and shelter in the closing months of World War II.
PLUSES: Mr. Brody's restrained, largely silent performance conveys a mute suffering and fear that are finally beyond words.
MINUSES: The early scenes have a clunky expository feel. As eloquent as Szpilman's silence may be, it also prevents us from getting to know him.

'Catch Me if You Can'
Frank Abagnale Jr., the teenage con man and chameleon who slithers through Steven Spielberg's sophisticated comedy, is the latest and one of the most memorable in the filmmaker's catalog of lost boys. The movie tells the mostly true story of Frank's ascent from teenage runaway to international notoriety as a check forger who successfully impersonates an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer before being apprehended by his Javert-like pursuer, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). The movie pokes delicious fun at the swinging 60's, when air travel was sold as sex in the sky.
PLUSES: Leonardo DiCaprio dazzles as the charming criminal prodigy and chip off the slippery block of his father, Frank Sr., a tax-evading Rotarian played to reptilian perfection by Christopher Walken. Martin Sheen and the newcomer Amy Adams have amusing roles as the unctuously pompous father of Frank's fiancee and the perky daughter who is first seen as a nurse with a mouthful of braces.
MINUSES: After zipping brightly along, the movie eventually loses momentum. Twenty minutes of cutting would have helped.

'Antwone Fisher'
The most potent male weepie to come along in years, "Antwone Fisher" is the somewhat fictionalized biography of its screenwriter (played by Derek Luke), who was born in a Cleveland prison and ended up in an orphanage and then in a foster home. As a hotheaded young sailor, he risks being bounced out of the Navy and is sent to a psychiatrist, who unlocks his pain and directs him to search for his family. The directorial debut of Denzel Washington, who also plays the psychiatrist, "Antwone Fisher" is acted with such refinement that you can almost forgive its sentimental excesses.
PLUSES: As a first-time director, Mr. Washington elicits exquisitely reactive performances that match his own screen acting in care and balance, and Mr. Luke's wonderfully natural, understated Antwone stands as the year's most auspicious screen acting debut. The movie includes the most convincing psychotherapy sessions this side of "The Sopranos." Novella Nelson deserves special mention for her ferocious portrayal of Antwone's brutally abusive foster mother, who drills her racial self-hatred into him.
MINUSES: In giving Antwone the perfect, understanding girlfriend and a therapist who becomes a surrogate father, the movie pours on too much syrup.

'Max'
Menno Meyjes's audacious historical fantasy imagines the young Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor) as an ambitious young painter struggling for recognition amid the desolation of post-World War I Munich. His part-time mentor, the fictional Max Rothman (John Cusack), is an art dealer and avowed modernist who lost an arm in the war but not his spirit. The film, which has an exotic, expressionist visual palette, proposes that Nazism (with the swastika, the uniforms and all the other regalia) originated as the art project of a failed painter.
PLUSES: In portraying a European bon vivant and intellectual, Mr. Cusack makes a big dramatic leap forward. Avoiding turning into a cartoon, Mr. Taylor's Hitler is a thoroughly disagreeable, socially inept creep whose bottled rage and bogus theories of racial purity are coalescing into a monstrous entity.
MINUSES: The movie is largely fantasy and a platform for contemplating the relationship between art and history. The scenes of Max's turbulent personal life (he has a wife, two children and a lover) are so confusingly sketchy they seem almost extraneous.

'Rabbit-Proof Fence'
The movie tells the true story of three Aboriginal girls of mixed blood who escape after being forcibly taken from their community in the Australian outback to a settlement as part of a government campaign to breed out the Aboriginal race. The heart of the movie follows their 1,500-mile journey home on foot, in which they successfully elude their would-be captors. The director Phillip Noyce treats a story that could have been a gruesome manhunt as an inspirational folk tale.
PLUSES: Everlyn Sampi is quietly mesmerizing as the oldest of the three girls and their intrepidly determined and canny leader. The camera drinks in the beauty and the variety of the Australian landscape.
MINUSES: The movie's decision to tell the story as cinematic folk ballad robs it of credibility. Instead of a grueling odyssey, the journey unfolds as a kind of dream.

'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind'
George Clooney's flashy directorial debut (with a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman) relates the autobiography of Chuck Barris, the creepy, leering television impresario who dumped "The Dating Game," "The Newlywed Game" and "The Gong Show" onto television. The movie treats Mr. Barris's claims that he was a C.I.A. agent on assassination duty so skeptically that his contacts (played by Mr. Clooney and Julia Roberts) appear as delusional as the paranoid-schizophrenic phantoms in "A Beautiful Mind."
PLUSES: Sam Rockwell's star-making portrayal of Barris captures his body language and smirking cynicism without pushing too hard.
MINUSES: As a screen character, Mr. Barris has the same freaky sideshow quality as Bob Crane, the "Hogan's Heroes" star and sex fiend portrayed by Greg Kinnear in Paul Schrader's "Auto Focus," which opened earlier in 2002.

'25th Hour'
Like many of Spike Lee's other movies, this harsh portrait of post-9/11 New York City as a paranoid, hypersexual jungle of feuding tribes gives you the feeling of being shouted at by someone reading tabloid headlines an inch away from your face. The first screenplay by David Benioff, who adapted the story from his novel, "25th Hour" follows the last day of freedom for Monty Brogan (Edward Norton), a youngish drug dealer about to serve a seven-year prison sentence. We meet his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), who may have ratted on him to the feds, and his two oldest friends, Slaughtery (Barry Pepper), a piggy, womanizing bond trader, and Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a sniveling teacher besotted with an underage student (Anna Paquin).
PLUSES: Mr. Pepper's Wall Street hotshot is the creepiest screen portrait of a wheeler-dealer since "The Boiler Room." The movie's blunt, hard-boiled dialogue sticks like dirt under your fingernails.
MINUSES: Mr. Norton is slightly miscast as a supposed pretty boy terrified of being gang-raped on his first night in prison. The movie wallows in paranoid urban vibes.

'Nicholas Nickleby'
Douglas McGrath's screen adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel plays like a cheery, cartoonish greatest hits, with the mostly British cast giving the characters the robust "Masterpiece Theater" treatment. But the novel is too large to be contained in a movie, even one that runs two hours and 12 minutes. We've barely settled into one set of characters when we're whisked off to meet the group.
PLUSES: Christopher Plummer's evil, slit-eyed Ralph Nickleby, the hero's heartless uncle, is a cunning, hateful villain for all seasons. Jamie Bell's Smike could wring tears from certain stones.
MINUSES: The movie's thinness of texture is matched by Charlie Hunnam's simpering, platinum-haired Nicholas, an anemic male ingenue so smug in his virtue that you almost root for the scheming Uncle Ralph to destroy him.

HEADLINE: Games Nations Play 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
What game does the Bush administration think it's playing in Korea?
That's not a rhetorical question. During the cold war, the U.S. government employed experts in game theory to analyze strategies of nuclear deterrence. Men with Ph.D.'s in economics, like Daniel Ellsberg, wrote background papers with titles like "The Theory and Practice of Blackmail." The intellectual quality of these analyses was impressive, but their main conclusion was simple: Deterrence requires a credible commitment to punish bad behavior and reward good behavior. 
 I know, it sounds obvious. Yet the Bush administration's Korea policy has systematically violated that simple principle. 
 Let's be clear: North Korea's rulers are as nasty as they come. But unless we have a plan to overthrow those rulers, we should ask ourselves what incentives we're giving them.
So put yourself in Kim Jong Il's shoes. The Bush administration has denounced you. It broke off negotiations as soon as it came into office. Last year, though you were no nastier than you had been the year before, George W. Bush declared you part of the "axis of evil." A few months later Mr. Bush called you a "pygmy," saying: "I loathe Kim Jong Il -- I've got a visceral reaction to this guy. . . . They tell me, well we may not need to move too fast, because the financial burdens on people will be so immense if this guy were to topple -- I just don't buy that." 
Moreover, there's every reason to take Mr. Bush's viscera seriously. Under his doctrine of pre-emption, the U.S. can attack countries it thinks might support terrorism, whether or not they have actually done so. And who decides whether we attack? Here's what Mr. Bush says: "You said we're headed to war in Iraq. I don't know why you say that. I'm the person who gets to decide, not you." L'etat, c'est moi. 
So Mr. Bush thinks you're a bad guy -- and that makes you a potential target, no matter what you do.
On the other hand, Mr. Bush hasn't gone after you yet, though you are much closer to developing weapons of mass destruction than Iraq. (You probably already have a couple.) And you ask yourself, why is Saddam Hussein first in line? He's no more a supporter of terrorism than you are: the Bush administration hasn't produced any evidence of a Saddam-Al Qaeda connection. Maybe the administration covets Iraq's oil reserves; but it's also notable that of the three members of the axis of evil, Iraq has by far the weakest military.
So you might be tempted to conclude that the Bush administration is big on denouncing evildoers, but that it can be deterred from actually attacking countries it denounces if it expects them to put up a serious fight. What was it Teddy Roosevelt said? Talk trash but carry a small stick? 
Your own experience seems to confirm that conclusion. Last summer you were caught enriching uranium, which violates the spirit of your 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration. But the Bush administration, though ready to invade Iraq at the slightest hint of a nuclear weapons program, tried to play down the story, and its response -- cutting off shipments of fuel oil -- was no more than a rap on the knuckles. In fact, even now the Bush administration hasn't done what its predecessor did in 1994: send troops to the region and prepare for a military confrontation.
So here's how it probably looks from Pyongyang: 
The Bush administration says you're evil. It won't offer you aid, even if you cancel your nuclear program, because that would be rewarding evil. It won't even promise not to attack you, because it believes it has a mission to destroy evil regimes, whether or not they actually pose any threat to the U.S. But for all its belligerence, the Bush administration seems willing to confront only regimes that are militarily weak.
The incentives for North Korea are clear. There's no point in playing nice -- it will bring neither aid nor security. It needn't worry about American efforts to isolate it economically -- North Korea hardly has any trade except with China, and China isn't cooperating. The best self-preservation strategy for Mr. Kim is to be dangerous. So while America is busy with Iraq, the North Koreans should cook up some plutonium and build themselves some bombs. 
Again: What game does the Bush administration think it's playing?

HEADLINE: Germany Takes Center Stage 

 BODY:
History could hardly have scripted a more highly charged moment for Germany to commence a two-year term on the United Nations Security Council. As Berlin takes its seat this week, the council is moving toward momentous decisions about Iraq. Only a few months ago, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder ran for re-election declaring his firm opposition to war with Iraq. Now, for the good of Germany and the United Nations, he must set aside campaign politics and cast Germany's votes on this critical issue on the merits. 
 Fortuitously, Germany will preside over the council in February, just when the Iraqi issue is likely to reach a decision point, and has been chosen to lead the council's subcommittee monitoring the enforcement of economic sanctions against Baghdad. During the German election campaign Mr. Schroder pledged that German troops would not fight in Iraq, no matter how blatantly Baghdad defied U.N. disarmament requirements, even if the Security Council authorized force. That stance, largely driven by domestic politics, damaged Germany's international standing, especially in Washington. To earn the international respect it seeks, Berlin must adjust its position to unfolding facts, especially to the report that U.N. weapons inspectors will submit to council members late this month. 
 Germany is under no obligation to support an American-led war against Iraq simply because Washington demands German assent, but Berlin should devise a policy flexible enough to back a confrontation with Baghdad if Iraqi defiance leaves the world no choice but to disarm Iraq by force. In recent days there have been encouraging signs that Berlin is trying to adopt a more nimble approach. This week Mr. Schroder declared that Germans "know from experience that sometimes only violence can stop dictators." Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer indicated that depending on the circumstances prevailing at the time of a Security Council vote, Germany might be willing to authorize using force even though it would not contribute its own troops. In case of war, Berlin has also offered to make its airspace and bases available to the United States and other NATO members.
Emphasizing diplomacy over force is reasonable, but must be accompanied by a recognition that diplomacy alone doesn't always work. As the facts come in on Iraq, Germany should base its decisions on the record of Iraqi conduct.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Democrats Use Job Chart To Try to Skewer Bush

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
Call it incomplete, unfair, misleading or even, as White House officials attest, utterly meaningless.
 But as President Bush prepares to announce a proposal next week for deep new tax cuts, House Democrats plan to circulate a mischievous little chart aimed at skewering him on what they say is one of his biggest vulnerabilities, unemployment. 
 The chart, based on standard government statistics, measures the number of jobs created under every president since Harry S. Truman and ranks President Bush as dead last by a wide margin.
Indeed, Mr. Bush seemed to acknowledge implicitly today that he was exposed on the issue when he told reporters at his ranch in Texas about his planned announcement of a tax-cut package to jump-start the economy and couched the cuts as an effort to create employment. "What I'm worried about," he said, "is job creation." 
Politics, like baseball, is often a game of statistics. And statistics are almost certain to be a crucial weapon in the tax-cut battle and Mr. Bush's broader economic policy. But in much the way a cartoonist can stretch a president's nose to make him look shifty, political pugilists can stretch and shape a telling statistic to skewer a victim or airbrush a glossy portrait.
Democrats cite one batch of statistics to show that Mr. Bush's tax cuts help just the rich. Republicans cite other statistics, equally true, to show that the rich pay the biggest share, by far, of income taxes. 
Although President Bill Clinton averaged more than 230,000 new jobs a month in his eight-year tenure, the chart shows, Mr. Bush has averaged a loss of 69,000 jobs a month since he took office. Although every other president is at least slightly above the zero line, Mr. Bush is conspicuously below it.
Government statistics do indeed show that the economy lost 1.5 million jobs in Mr. Bush's years in office. Those same measures would also rank Jimmy Carter as one of the most successful presidents. Yet Mr. Carter presided over calamitous double-digit inflation, a big reason for his landslide defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1980.
"As a measure of economic growth, job creation is as reasonable as anything else," said Joel E. Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan. "The real question, of course, is to what extent it had anything to do with the policies of the administration." 
Neither Democrats nor Republicans worry much about such distinctions, except when it helps their cause. 
"The administration is going around as if they have already won the Super Bowl," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, whose staff came up with the figures. "Their score for away games may be 6 and 2, but their record on home games is 1 and 7."
White House officials quickly dismissed the chart and cited their figures to argue that the economic problems originated under Mr. Clinton.
"It's misleading to the point of being meaningless," the president's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said. "It ignores the fact that the recession was really begun as a result of events that took place in 2000."
Mr. Fleischer reached for his batch of statistics. The stock market began plunging in March 2000, manufacturing employment started to decline in July 2000, and industrial production began to decline in September 2000.
By Democratic calculations, the economy will have to add 86,000 jobs a month through the end of Mr. Bush's first term in January 2005 before he would even tie President Dwight D. Eisenhower for last place in job creation.
Mr. Bush was the sole president charted on the basis of two years' experience. Every other president was charted for four-year terms.
Mr. Reagan, who also had a slowdown as he took office, had even worse numbers than Mr. Bush in his first two years but then enjoyed six strong years. Mr. Reagan ended his first term with an average monthly job gain of 109,000 and his second term with an average gain of 224,000.
Nor do employment statistics tell the whole story. Mr. Carter's term coincided with an average increase of 218,000 a month. But inflation soared to more than 15 percent and interest rates skyrocketed to nearly 20 percent before the epidemic was controlled.
Democrats also plan to argue that Mr. Bush's proposal for a tax cut is unlikely to be a panacea. They say the employment decline began in April 2001, just as the House was approving his $1.35 trillion tax cut. The Democrats also note that the economy began shedding enormous numbers of jobs soon after Congress approved Mr. Reagan's huge tax reductions in 1981.
"You can manipulate statistics almost anyway you want, but fact is that behind those statistics you have a human problem," Mr. Obey said.
Democrats also plan to go after Mr. Bush for failing to prevent the expiration of federal unemployment benefits for the 750,000 long-term unemployed workers. The benefits expired on Dec. 28. Last month in a radio address, Mr. Bush favored a modest extension of the benefits that would be retroactive, acting only after Congress had left for the year. And House Republican leaders favor a much smaller extension than the Democrats.
White House officials, still energized from Republican Congressional victories in November, brush off the criticism.
"Often, politicians see economic data as being potent while the voters reject it," Mr. Fleischer said. "If it were true, and if voters perceived it as being true, then why didn't they vote against Republicans in November?"

HEADLINE: We Don't Invade Iraq. Then What? 

BYLINE:  By Robert Malley; Robert Malley, Middle East program director at the International Crisis Group, was special assistant to President Bill Clinton for Arab-Israeli affairs from 1998 to 2001.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For some time now, the debate over Iraq has focused on a potential war and what should follow it. What is striking is how little thought appears to have been given to the other possible outcome, the one the rest of the world continues to push and the Bush administration itself professes to favor: a nonmilitary settlement. In short, all the talk has been about the day after a war. But what about the day after a non-war?
 An invasion still seems likely. But we may witness an Iraqi turnabout -- last-minute compliance with the United Nations Security Council terms in hope of salvaging Saddam Hussein's regime. There may be a pre-emptive coup by Iraqi security officials determined to get rid of Saddam Hussein before the United States gets rid of them. Or we may have to live with an ambiguous situation that drags on for a long time, with neither a smoking gun nor a clean bill of health, because inspections are inconclusive, American allies deem Iraq's threat insufficient to justify a war and Washington concludes that it would be wiser not to go at all than to go it alone. 
 In any case, avoiding war with Iraq does not mean resolving the problem of Iraq. For the past decade, Iraq policy has been caught between those who believed that sanctions and covert action would make the regime go away, and those who believed that time would make the whole issue go away. Thus Iraq today suffers under harsh international sanctions and harsher domestic repression, with intrusive inspections and disturbing uncertainty about its weapons capability. Sanctions leak, to the benefit of their intended target, the Iraqi regime, and they hurt their unintended victims, the Iraqi people. 
The regime's totalitarian power is intact, but the nation's sovereignty is in shambles, with no-flight zones north and south, a quasi-independent Kurdish area and meddling by its neighbors. Indeed, the message conveyed by the Iraqi citizens interviewed in recent weeks by the International Crisis Group is that the situation is so desperate that many now appear ready to accept a war whose destructive impact they risk being the first to suffer. 
Even if Saddam Hussein were ousted, the Iraq problem is unlikely to disappear. Iraq would still have a volatile domestic situation, long-standing border disputes with neighbors, a rivalry with Iran and a drive to acquire nonconventional weapons. 
The responsibility today, especially for those who wish to oppose a conflict, is to think about what will happen if war is avoided. The central pillar of any plan needs to be deterrence, with commitments from American allies -- possibly backed by a Security Council resolution -- for a crushing military response so credible that the regime will understand that any use of weapons of mass destruction, or indeed any threat to its neighbors, would bring its immediate demise. 
A second pillar would be to induce political change in Iraq. The United Nations resolutions adopted after the gulf war demanded that it cease its repression of its citizens. Needless to say, this call has not been heeded. But Iraq is in dire straits. The oil industry operates at nowhere near capacity, roads and water facilities are a shambles, and Iraq's isolation from most of the industrialized world makes paying for improvements impossible. 
The quid pro quo for Iraq's economic reintegration, including international aid, loans for reconstruction projects and the lifting of sanctions, ought to be key domestic reforms: real elections, political pluralism, ethnic rights. 
Ultimately, so long as any concerns remain about the country's intentions regarding weapons of mass destruction, the ban on military goods and the oil-for-food program should be maintained. Other sanctions -- like the one banning technology that has both civilian and military uses -- could gradually be lifted to encourage domestic reform.
In the longer term, a third pillar would be a Persian Gulf regional security system. Elements of this would include commitments from all gulf states (including Iran) to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of their neighbors and to give up programs in weapons of mass destruction. These commitments could be monitored by an international presence on the ground. 
The truth is, while Iraq and Iran may have some very bad reasons to want to develop their nonconventional arsenals, they feel they have some pretty good reasons as well -- not least of all, their fear of each other Unless these fears are addressed, any solution is liable to be short lived. 
Failure to offer practical ideas for what should happen if war does not occur will only make war more likely -- either now or when the next crisis is upon us.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Set to Unveil New Economic Policy 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would detail his proposal to cut taxes and stimulate the economy on Tuesday, and he brushed aside critics who predicted that his plans would primarily benefit the rich.
 "I am worried about those who are unemployed," he told reporters at his ranch near Crawford, Tex. "I think about the overall economy and how best to help those folks who are looking for work." 
 Mr. Bush is expected to propose a package of tax cuts worth as much as $300 billion over 10 years. The package is expected to include a reduction in taxes on corporate dividends, new tax breaks for business and an acceleration of rate reductions that were supposed to phase in over the next several years. 
To deflect criticism that the plan does little to help the poor and the middle class, Mr. Bush is also likely to propose an immediate increase in the child-care tax credit and a more rapid phase-out of the so-called "marriage penalty" for two-income couples.
But Republican lawmakers in Congress are already worried about keeping the estimated cost of all those measures below $300 billion.
A 50 percent reduction in taxes on corporate dividends would alone cost about $150 billion over 10 years, according to estimates by Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research organization run by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
An immediate increase in the child-care tax credit, to $1,000 from $600, would cost $99 billion over 10 years. And accelerating all the rate reductions scheduled for 2004 and 2006 would cost an additional $114 billion.
White House officials have let it be known for months that they favor a new round of tax cuts to jolt the economy out of its doldrums, and they had said Mr. Bush would announce a plan sometime in January.
In deciding to go ahead next week, Mr. Bush seemed intent on imprinting his priorities on the new Congress as soon as it convened. But he will be doing so before his new economic team is fully in place to help sell the plan. Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman at Goldman Sachs, is starting work this week as head of the White House National Economic Council. John W. Snow, the railroad executive Mr. Bush selected to succeed Paul H. O'Neill as Treasury secretary, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate.
But Mr. Bush badly wants to be perceived as doing something about the economy, and administration officials have long been eager to reduce or eliminate dividend taxes altogether.
Unemployment climbed to 6 percent last month, manufacturing has been stagnant and business investment remains weak. There are signs of improvement: the stock market has climbed shakily from what appears to have been a low point in October, and the latest survey of manufacturers, released today, showed an unexpectedly big increase in orders and expectations.
Economists are at best divided about whether a new round of tax cuts will have much impact on the immediate problems. Many of the tax cuts would not reach taxpayers until later in the year or next year. Lowering dividend taxes could push up stock prices, but many economists say it would have little short-term impact on either consumer spending or business investment.
In pressing for his program, Mr. Bush will be treading a fine line between highlighting the urgent need for quick action and providing reassurance that the economy is improving.
"I recognize that there, you know, there are some uncertainties," Mr. Bush said today. "But one thing is certain: that the economy of the United States is strong and resilient. And we must put policies in place to enhance that resiliency and enhance that strength."

Price Soars as Oil Inventories Reflect Strike in Venezuela

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices opened the year yesterday with an increase of more than 2 percent, as a month-old Venezuelan strike cut further into American imports and pushed inventories toward a 26-year low.
 The inventory data showed crude oil in storage dropping 3 percent last week, as shipments from Venezuela all but dried up. Analysts had expected a 1 percent dip. 
 In New York, crude oil for February delivery gained 65 cents yesterday, or 2.1 percent, to $31.85.
Michael Rothman, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said American inventory levels were 50 million barrels below normal. "In fact," Mr. Rothman said, "inventories ended 2002 at their lowest level since we began tracking the data in 1984."
Venezuela accounts for about 14 percent of America's imports, but exports have ground to a virtual halt since early December because of a strike aimed at ousting President Hugo Chavez.
The Energy Department said yesterday that its weekly report on crude oil inventories, showed imports slumping by 1.5 million barrels a day. The United States uses 20 million barrels of oil a day, equivalent to one-quarter of world supply.
"It does appear that crude oil imports from Venezuela last week were almost nonexistent," the agency said.
The long disruption to supplies from Venezuela -- at a time when looming conflict with Iraq threatens to upset flows from the Middle East -- has deepened concerns that higher energy costs could derail a tentative recovery. The decline in inventories brought crude oil storage levels close to a 26-year low reached in October, when storms disrupted operations on the Gulf Coast.
Inventories are approaching 270 million barrels, which the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee to the secretary of energy, says could result in supply problems during a period of strong demand, like a cold winter.
The data showed American demand for oil growing 5 percent in the last four weeks from the period a year ago, despite sluggish economic growth.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, dominated by Middle Eastern states, has offered to make up any supply shortfall caused by the Venezuelan strike.
But supplies from the Mideast take six weeks to reach the United States compared with about five days for oil from Venezuela.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Outlook: Up and Down 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
With his visit to Brazil, a radiant President Hugo Chavez assured the world today that he would survive a month-old strike aimed at forcing him from power. But back home, Venezuelans were left to wonder if their country, as they know it, might not. 
 The president's talk may be bravado, but political analysts here and abroad agree that he appears once again to have beaten his way out of a political corner and taken the upper hand against his opposition, whose strike has all but stopped the heartbeat of the Venezuelan economy: the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. 
 Mr. Chavez may not only survive this latest challenge to his presidency, analysts and some of his opponents are beginning to concede, but he may also emerge with new strength, even if his country emerges more polarized and economically hobbled than before. 
"The opposition underestimated President Chavez's determination to stay in power at all costs," said Luis Pacheco, a striking oil executive. "Any other Western leader would have looked at this situation, at the economic and social distress, and would have left office. But Chavez is willing to govern over ruins."
In April, after a brief coup against him, Mr. Chavez said that as a gesture of reconciliation, he would not dismiss oil company executives accused of taking part. He has vowed not to be so forgiving this time. 
Two weeks ago, the president, who has long wanted to tighten his control over the state-owned oil company, announced the suspension of nearly 100 executives and managers whom he charged with supporting or taking part in the strike. 
The move effectively executed his goal, and each day that he is able to keep the oil company -- and this country -- limping along is another day that he confounds and weakens the strategy of his opponents. 
Similarly, in April, the president purged senior officers from the ranks of the military. Today, that institution is more firmly in his command, and the armed forces have remained loyal to him throughout the current crisis. 
Time, analysts said, has shifted in the president's favor. The opposition, which once called for new elections, has turned its energy toward organizing a nonbinding referendum on Mr. Chavez's presidency for Feb. 2. The Supreme Court has yet even to rule on the legality of such a vote. In any case, no matter the outcome, the president says he intends to stay in power. 
But the price to Venezuela's economy, analysts agree, is hardly sustainable.
Mr. Chavez may succeed in securing his hold on the oil company, but for now, it is not one producing much oil. Last month, exports from the company, the world's fifth largest and a chief supplier to the United States, plummeted from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to less than 2 million barrels -- all month.
Ramon Espinasa, a former executive of the state-owned oil company and a consultant at the Inter-American Development Bank, said that without fully restoring oil production, Venezuela's gross domestic product would probably decline as much as 10 percent in the coming year. 
The government has already begun to dip into reserves, and will probably be forced to print more money next year, a move that could send inflation soaring past its already dizzying rate of 30 percent. Other analysts predicted a rash of bankruptcies, unemployment and migration that could shake the economy for months ahead. 
In addition to the economic turmoil, weeks of high-charged rhetoric between Mr. Chavez and his opponents have left the nation's nerves raw. The social divisions that have long marked life in this country have become as treacherous as minefields. 
On one side, Mr. Chavez, a former paratrooper who considers himself a champion of the poor, has refused to make concessions in negotiations with his opponents, calling their leaders "terrorists" and "coup plotters." Meanwhile, calls for violence, once an undercurrent of the crisis, now come openly in the opposition-controlled media and opposition rallies.
"Wasting our energy with marches no longer leads anywhere," wrote Armando Duran, a columnist for El Nacional, referring to almost daily protests by government opponents that draw hundreds of thousands of people. 
Mr. Duran added that the only way for the opposition not to be squashed by the government was for it to take its protests to the presidential compound at Miraflores, the site of violent clashes in April.
"We must confront him once and for all," Mr. Duran wrote, "and at whatever price." 
The top leader of Venezuela's strike on Thursday urged members of the armed forces to join the opposition against Mr. Chavez.
"What are you waiting for to accompany us?" asked one unionist, Carlos Ortega. "We understand the obedience you owe to the president of the republic, but obedience is one thing, being submissive is another."
Still, even as Venezuela faces a grim prospects for 2003, Mr. Chavez beams with strength. He boasts that neighboring countries have rallied to his aid, sending shipments of food and gasoline that have helped the government meet nation's most pressing needs. He said he would seek foreign oil experts to restart wells and refineries. He has pledged to normalize the oil industry within the month.
Most people believe that Mr. Chavez's optimism is overstated. Petroleos de Venezuela has some of the most sophisticated refining installations in the world, striking executives said. They need to run in order to keep functioning properly; the longer they are down, they longer it will take to get them up again.
Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, said the opposition's strategy might backfire. 
"The opposition was counting on people getting tired of President Chavez," he said. "But the opposition caused this crisis, and Chavez has every right to try to go out and fix it."

HEADLINE: Government Openness at Issue As Bush Holds On to Records 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has put a much tighter lid than recent presidents on government proceedings and the public release of information, exhibiting a penchant for secrecy that has been striking to historians, legal experts and lawmakers of both parties.
 Some of the Bush policies, like closing previously public court proceedings, were prompted by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and are part of the administration's drive for greater domestic security. Others, like Vice President Dick Cheney's battle to keep records of his energy task force secret, reflect an administration that arrived in Washington determined to strengthen the authority of the executive branch, senior administration officials say. 
 Some of the changes have sparked a passionate public debate and excited political controversy. But other measures taken by the Bush administration to enforce greater government secrecy have received relatively little attention, masking the proportions of what dozens of experts described in recent interviews as a sea change in government openness. 
A telling example came in late 2001 when Attorney General John Ashcroft announced the new policy on the Freedom of Information Act, a move that attracted relatively little public attention.
Although the new policy for dealing with the 1966 statute that has opened millions of pages of government records to scholars, reporters and the public was announced after Sept. 11, it had been planned well before the attacks.
The Ashcroft directive encouraged federal agencies to reject requests for documents if there was any legal basis to do so, promising that the Justice Department would defend them in court. It was a stark reversal of the policy set eight years earlier, when the Clinton administration told agencies to make records available whenever they could, even if the law provided a reason not to, so long as there was no "foreseeable harm" from the release.
Generally speaking, said Alan Brinkley, a Columbia University historian, while secrecy has been increasingly attractive to recent administrations, "this administration has taken it to a new level."
Its "instinct is to release nothing," Professor Brinkley said, adding that this was not necessarily because there were particular embarrassing secrets to hide, but "they are just worried about what's in there that they don't know about."
The Bush administration contends that it is not trying to make government less open. Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, said, "The bottom line remains the president is dedicated to an open government, a responsive government, while he fully exercises the authority of the executive branch."
Secrecy is almost impossible to quantify, but there are some revealing measures. In the year that ended on Sept. 30, 2001, most of which came during the Bush presidency, 260,978 documents were classified, up 18 percent from the previous year. And since Sept. 11, three new agencies were given the power to stamp documents as "Secret" -- the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services.
In Congress, where objections to secrecy usually come from the party opposed to the president, the complaints are bipartisan. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat first elected in 1974, said, "Since I've been here, I have never known an administration that is more difficult to get information from." Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said things were getting worse, and "it seems like in the last month or two I've been running into more and more stonewalls." 
Mr. Cheney says the Bush policies have sought to restore the proper powers of the executive branch. Explaining the fight to control the task force records to ABC News last January, he said that over more than three decades: "I have repeatedly seen an erosion of the powers and the ability of the president of the United States to do his job. We saw it in the War Powers Act, we saw it in the Anti-Impoundment Act. We've seen it in cases like this before, where it's demanded that the presidents cough up and compromise on important principles. One of the things that I feel an obligation on, and I know the president does, too, because we talked about it, is to pass on our offices in better shape than we found them to our successors."
Mr. Bush has made similar comments. But the more relevant history may have been in Texas, where Mr. Bush, as governor, was also reluctant to make government records public. Confronted with a deadline to curb air pollution, he convened a private task force to propose solutions and resisted efforts to make its deliberations public. When he left office, he sent his papers not to the Texas State Library in Austin, but to his father's presidential library at College Station. That library was unable to cope with demands for access, and the papers have since been sent to the state library.

Framing an Argument
One argument underlies many of the administration's steps: that presidents need confidential and frank advice and that they cannot get it if the advice becomes public, cited by Mr. Cheney in reference to the task force and by Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, in explaining the administration's decision to delay the release of President Ronald Reagan's papers.
Mr. Gonzales said "the pursuit of history" should not "deprive a president of candid advice while making crucial decisions."
Some administration arguments are more closely focused on security. Mr. Ashcroft has said that releasing the names of people held for immigration offenses could give Al Qaeda "a road map" showing which agents had been arrested. 
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has threatened action against Pentagon officials who discuss military operations with reporters, said before troops at the Army's Special Operation Command on Nov. 21, 2001, "I don't think the American people do want to know anything that's going to cause the death of any one of these enormously talented and dedicated and courageous people that are here today."
The critics argue more generally. Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, argues that secrecy does more harm than good. The Central Intelligence Agency's exaggerated estimates of Soviet economic strength, for example, would have stopped influencing United States policy, Mr. Moynihan said, if they had been published and any correspondent in Moscow could have laughed at them. 
"Secrecy is a formula for inefficient decision-making," Mr. Moynihan said, and plays to the instincts of self-importance of the bureaucracy.
Mary Graham, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, saw two major risks in this administration's level of secrecy.
"What are often being couched as temporary emergency orders are in fact what we are going to live with for 20 years, just as we lived with the cold war restrictions for years after it was over," Ms. Graham said. "We make policy by crisis, and we particularly make secrecy policy by crisis."
Moreover, she said, it ignores the value of openness, which "creates public pressure for improvement." When risk analyses of chemical plants were available on the Internet, she said, people could pressure companies to do better, or move away. 
Mr. Fleischer contends that there is no secrecy problem. "I make the case that we are more accessible and open than many previous administrations -- given how many times Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Rumsfeld and Ashcroft have briefed," he said.
Asked if there was anyone in the administration who was a consistent advocate of openness, who argued that secrecy hurt as well as helped, Mr. Fleischer said President Bush was that person. He said that was exemplified by the fact that while "the president reserved the authority to try people under military tribunals, nobody has been tried under military tribunals."
In the cases of Zacarias Moussaoui and John Walker Lindh, he said, Mr. Bush has opted for the more open and traditional route of the criminal justice system.

Shielding Presidents
The Bush administration's first major policy move to enforce greater secrecy could affect how its own history is written.
On March 23, 2001, Mr. Gonzales, the White House counsel, ordered the National Archives not to release to the public 68,000 pages of records from Ronald Reagan's presidency that scholars had requested and archivists had determined posed no threat to national security or personal privacy. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the documents were to become available after Jan. 20, 2001, twelve years after Mr. Reagan left office. Mr. Reagan's administration was the first covered by the 1978 law.
The directive, which also covered the papers of Mr. Reagan's vice president and the president's father, George Bush, was to last 90 days. When Mr. Gonzales extended the sealing period for an additional 90 days, historians like Hugh Davis Graham of Vanderbilt University attacked the delays, saying they were designed to prevent embarrassment and would nullify the records law's presumption of public access to those documents. 
On Nov. 1, 2001, President Bush issued an even more sweeping order under which former presidents and vice presidents like his father, or representatives designated by them or by their surviving families, could bar release of documents by claiming one of a variety of privileges: "military, diplomatic, or national security secrets, presidential communications, legal advice, legal work or the deliberative processes of the president and the president's advisers," according to the order. 
Before the order, the Archivist of the United States could reject a former president's claim of privilege. Now he cannot.
The order was promptly attacked in court and on Capitol Hill. Scott L. Nelson of the Public Interest Litigation Group sued on behalf of historians and reporters, maintaining that the new order allowed unlimited delays in releasing documents and created new privileges to bar release.
House Republicans were among the order's sharpest critics. Representative Steve Horn of California called a hearing within a few days, and Representative Doug Ose, another Californian, said the order "undercuts the public's right to be fully informed about how its government operated in the past." The order, Mr. Horn said, improperly "gives the former and incumbent presidents veto power over the release of the records."
On Dec. 20, the White House sought to silence the complaints by announcing that nearly all the 68,000 pages of the Reagan records were being released. Legislation introduced to undo the order never made it to the House floor, where leaders had no interest in embarrassing the president. And a lawsuit challenging the order languishes in Federal District Court before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.
Historians remain angry. Robert Dallek, a biographer of Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, said, "This order of Bush, we feel it's a disgrace -- what it means is if this policy applies, they can hold presidential documents close to the vest in perpetuity, the way Lincoln's papers were held by the family until 1947."

Battling the Congress
The administration's most publicized fight over secrecy, and its biggest victory to date, has come over its efforts to keep the investigative arm of Congress from gaining access to records of the energy task force led by Vice President Cheney.
This fight is only the showiest of many battles between the Bush administration and members of Congress over information. Such skirmishes happen in every administration. But not only are they especially frequent now, but also many of the loudest Congressional complaints come from the president's own party, from Republicans like Senator Grassley and Representative Dan Burton of Indiana. 
The vice president framed the fight as being less about what the papers sought by the General Accounting Office might show than over power -- what Congress could demand and how it could get it or what essential prerogatives the executive branch could maintain, especially its ability to get confidential advice. And he welcomed the battle. In an interview the day before the suit was filed, he said. "It ought to be resolved in a court, unless you're willing to compromise on a basic fundamental principle, which we're not." And on Dec. 9, Judge John D. Bates of Federal District Court ruled for the vice president.
Judge Bates ruled that David M. Walker, who as comptroller general heads the General Accounting Office, had not suffered any personal injury, nor had he been injured as an agent of Congress, and therefore the suit could not be considered. An appeal is all but certain to be filed, but for the time being, the administration clearly has a victory.
"Vice President Cheney's cover-up will apparently continue for the foreseeable future," said Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who pressed Mr. Walker to act, hoping to find evidence of special interest favoritism for Republican donors in the Cheney documents.
There have been other bitter fights over disclosure between the White House and the Congress. While the Democrats controlled the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the chairman, James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont, repeatedly threatened last year to subpoena the Environmental Protection Agency for documents explaining the scientific basis and potential impact of its proposed air pollution rule changes requiring aging power plants to install new pollution controls when their facilities are modernized. Mr. Jeffords, who never got around to issuing the subpoena, argued that the administration had broken its promises of cooperation.
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was infuriated last August when the Justice Department said it would send answers to some of his questions about how it was using the USA Patriot Act to the more pliant Intelligence Committee, which was not interested. Mr. Sensenbrenner threatened to issue a subpoena or "blow a fuse."
Mr. Grassley, the incoming chairman of the Finance Committee, said administration obstruction required him to go and personally question government officials working on Medicare fraud cases, instead of sending his staff. But his new chairmanship and the Treasury confirmations before it may give him a lever. He said he told a White House aide of his problems and asked, "How can I get a presidential nominee through if I have to be spending my time doing things my investigators could be doing?"

Closing the Courtroom
Legal policy is where the administration's desire to maintain secrecy has excited the most controversy. Since the first few days after the Sept. 11 attacks, the federal government has insisted on a rare degree of secrecy about the individuals it has arrested and detained. 
The immigration hearings held for hundreds of people caught in sweeps after the bombings have been closed to relatives, the news media and the public.
The names of those detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service have been kept secret, along with details of their arrests, although on Dec. 12 the Justice Department told The Associated Press there had been 765 of them, of whom only 6 were still in custody.
A few dozen individuals have been held as material witnesses, after the Justice Department persuaded federal judges that they had information about terrorism and might flee if released. Neither their names nor the total number of them have been made public.
The administration has also kept a tight lid on the identities of the military detainees being held at Guantanamo, Cuba. But in considering how to deal with them, in military tribunals, the government has moved away from secrecy. When Mr. Bush directed the Defense Department in November 2001 to set up military tribunals to try noncitizens suspected of terrorism, one reason cited was the ability to hold those proceedings in secret, to protect intelligence and to reduce risks to judges and jurors. But when the rules were announced in March, they said "the accused shall be afforded a trial open to the public (except proceedings closed by the presiding officer)." 
While the government's policy in the immigration cases has suffered some judicial setbacks, appeals and stays have allowed it to remain in effect. 
Fundamentally, the government has argued against opening hearings by contending that they would make available to terrorists a mosaic of facts that a sophisticated enemy could use to build a road map of the investigation, to know what the government knew or did not know, and thus to escape or execute new attacks.
That argument was also made in the main case involving releasing the names of those detained, where the government also maintains that the Freedom of Information Act's right to privacy would be violated by a release of the names.
Legal scholars have objected particularly to the decision to close all the immigration hearings, rather than parts of them. Stephen A. Schulhofer, a professor at New York University Law School, said there was already a legal provision for closing a hearing when a judge was shown the necessity.
The "road map" explanation seemed implausible, Mr. Schulhofer said, because the detainees had a right to make phone calls, in which "a real terrorist could alert cohorts who would not have known he was detained."
At a recent seminar at Georgetown University Law School, Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff said protecting privacy was the main reason for suppressing the names. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, dismissed that rationale, asking Mr. Chertoff, "How can you even say that with a straight face?" 
So far, the government has won challenges to the detention of material witnesses. 
On releasing the names, it lost in a Federal District Court here, but appeared to have impressed two of the three appeals court judges who heard the case in November.
On the question of a blanket closing of "special interest" immigration hearings, an appeals court in Cincinnati ruled against the government in August and one in Philadelphia ruled in its favor in October. The Supreme Court is likely to be faced with choosing between them.

Putting Sand in the Gears
Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, governments at all levels feared that information they made publicly available could be useful to terrorists, and began moves to curtail access, a trend the Bush administration encouraged. 
The first of the strictures on information resulting from Sept. 11 were described by Ms. Graham, the Brookings and Kennedy School scholar, in her book, "Democracy by Disclosure" (Brookings Institution Press, 2002). 
"Officials quickly dismantled user-friendly disclosure systems on government Web sites," she wrote. "They censored information designed to tell community residents about risks from nearby chemical factories; maps that identified the location of pipelines carrying oil, gas and hazardous substances; and reports about risks associated with nuclear power plants."
Many of those withdrawals mirrored efforts industry had been making for quite a few years, arguing that the public did not really need the information. Some information has been removed from public gaze entirely. James Neal, the Columbia University librarian, said that officials of libraries like his around the country that serve as depositories for federal information "have some concern about the requests to withdraw materials from those collections." Perhaps even more important, Mr. Neal said, was that "we also do not know what materials are not getting distributed." 
Some material that has been removed from Web sites is still available, though obviously to fewer people, in government reading rooms. The chemical factory risk management plans cited by Ms. Graham are no longer available through the Internet, said Stephanie Bell, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency. But individuals can look at up to 10 of them and take notes (but not photocopies) in 55 government reading rooms around the country, Ms. Bell said. There is at least one reading room in every state except Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.
Last March the Defense Department issued a draft regulation concerning possible limits on publication of unclassified research it finances and sharp restrictions on access by foreign citizens to such data and research facilities.
This prompted some concerted resistance from scientists. Bruce Alberts, a biochemist who heads the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences, told the academy's annual meeting on April 29: 
"I am worried about a movement to restrict publication that has been proceeding quietly but quickly in Washington. Some of the plans being proposed could severely hamper the U.S. research enterprise and decrease national security. It is being suggested that every manuscript resulting from work supported by federal funds be cleared by a federal project officer before being published, with serious penalties for violations. Another rule could prevent any foreign national from working on a broad range of projects."
Even though the department withdrew its proposal and officials say there has been no decision on whether to try again, the scientists say they are still worried. 
The new Ashcroft directive on Freedom of Information requests has also begun to be felt. A veteran Justice Department official said he believed that fewer discretionary disclosures were being made throughout the government because "as a matter of policy, we are not advocating the making of discretionary disclosures."
Delays are one clear reality. The General Accounting Office reported last fall that "while the number of requests received appears to be leveling off, backlogs of pending requests governmentwide are growing, indicating that agencies are falling behind in processing requests." 
To Thomas Blanton, who helps run the National Security Archive, which collects and posts documents gained through Freedom of Information Act, that is a clear effect of the Ashcroft order.
"What these signals from on high do in a bureaucracy, they don't really change the standards," Mr. Blanton said, "but they put molasses or sand in the gears."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the Bush administration's increased use of secrecy misstated the name of an organization that sued over the policy on sealing presidential records. It is the Public Citizen Litigation Group, not the Public Interest Litigation Group.
Because of an editing error, the article also referred incorrectly to Tom Blanton's role at the National Security Archive, which collects and posts documents gained through the Freedom of Information Act. He is executive director, not just a staff member.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ASIAN ARENA; 
Bush Plays Down Rift With Allies Over U.S. Stance on North Korea

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Jan. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush discounted American differences with Asian nations today on how to handle the nuclear standoff with North Korea.
 Mr. Bush argued that Japan, South Korea and the European Union joined him in curtailing oil shipments to North Korea late last year, and that the world would work in concert to ensure "the Korean Peninsula to be nuclear weapons-free." 
 The president insisted that despite widespread evidence of American disputes with South Korea and China about whether to isolate North Korea, Washington's efforts to rally reluctant Asian nations against Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, might be succeeding. 
"They may be putting pressure on and you just don't know about it," Mr. Bush said, referring to China and South Korea. "I know that they're not reluctant when it comes to the idea of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. And we are in constant contact with the Japanese and the South Koreans and the Chinese and the Russians."
Behind the scenes, however, the American effort to force a common position among the Asian allies is heating up. Senior Japanese and South Korean diplomats are coming to Washington this weekend; they are expected to issue a statement on Monday. After that James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, will travel to the region.
Mr. Bush's comments came as his advisers drafted plans to argue in the United Nations Security Council that although Iraq should face military consequences for failing to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction, there was still time for diplomacy and economic pressure to contain North Korea's arms.
Representatives of several countries on the Security Council are beginning to make the case that the inspection process in Iraq should be allowed to run its course, and that Washington should be pressed to take the same kind of step-by-step approach with Saddam Hussein that it is taking with Mr. Kim.
Mr. Bush's aides say they disagree; they plan to assert that Iraq is a special case, impervious to the kinds of economic pressure that Mr. Bush is trying with North Korea. "We have basically exhausted diplomacy and containment in Iraq," one senior administration official said today. "We haven't in Korea." 
But in private, several of Mr. Bush's advisers say the North Korean crisis has complicated their diplomatic task at the United Nations. So has Mr. Bush's determination that a pre-emptive strike on North Korea is not viable even if Mr. Kim is only months away from adding to his nuclear arsenal, the advisers say.
"We will be facing considerable skepticism on the question of how we can justify confrontation with Saddam when he is letting inspectors into the country, and a diplomatic solution with Kim when he's just thrown them out," one senior diplomat acknowledged today. "And we're working on the answer."
After a hike around his ranch today, Mr. Bush made his most direct public criticism of Mr. Kim since the crisis began.
Mr. Bush described Mr. Kim as "somebody who starves his people" and who violated the 1994 accord with the United States to forgo nuclear arms in return for energy aid.
"We've got a great heart," Mr. Bush said of the United States, noting the nation's food donations to North Korea, "but I have no heart for somebody who starves his folks."
Mr. Bush's comments today were noticeably different in tone from those he made on New Year's Eve. At that time he was harshly critical of Mr. Hussein but he made no mention of North Korea's weapons projects, its ejection of inspectors or any consequences it might face. The lopsided nature of his comparison worried some of Mr. Bush's advisers, who feared that he was not sending a strong enough message to Mr. Kim.
So today when asked about North Korea, Mr. Bush accused Mr. Kim of economic mismanagement, at a time when, the Central Intelligence Agency estimates, 30 percent of North Korea's gross domestic product goes to the military.
"The United States of America is the largest -- one of the largest, if not the largest donor of food to the North Korean people," Mr. Bush said.
"And one of the reasons why the people are starving is because the leader of North Korea hasn't seen to it that their economy is strong or that they be fed."
North Korean officials have said that because of the oil cutoff, they had no choice but to start up the Yongbyon nuclear facility, which has been shut down since 1994.
But Mr. Bush was unapologetic about that American-led move today, pointing out that the decision was made by several nations, and portraying the standoff as pitting North Korea against its neighbors rather than just the United States.
The oil shipments are controlled by the Korean Energy Development Organization, a group set up to meet the West's obligations under the 1994 accord. The organization includes Japan, South Korea and the European Union, and while the vote to cut off oil was unanimous, it was not made without acrimony. South Korea was the most hesitant, warning the United States that cutting off the oil could lead to a rekindling of the country's plutonium production.
Mr. Bush said today that "the decision to cut off fuel oil was a joint decision, it was not a U.S. decision."
He also put the blame for the crisis on Mr. Kim. "It's important for the American people to remember the history of Kim Jong Il," Mr. Bush said today.
Mr. Bush recalled the 1994 accord and said that under it, the United States and others would "provide fuel oil and help and in return, he would not enrich uranium."
"But it turns out he was enriching uranium," he said, referring to a second North Korean nuclear project, aided by Pakistan and discovered by South Korean and American intelligence agencies.
"We blew the whistle on the fact that he was in violation of the '94 agreement," Mr. Bush said. "And the parties to that agreement came together and said, well, in return for him making that decision, in terms of him abrogating the agreement there will be a consequence."
Mr. Bush referred today to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and North Korea's nuclear arms are apparently the only ones remaining. North Korea is believed to have made two weapons before 1994. South Korea was stopped by Washington from developing nuclear arms several decades ago. The United States said in the early 1990's that it was removing its tactical nuclear arms from the peninsula, in part so North Korea would not have a pretext for developing its own, and in part out of concern that the weapons would incite South Korean protests.

HEADLINE: BUSH TO PROPOSE SWEEPING CHANGES IN MEDICARE PLAN 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 

 BODY:
With the new Senate majority leader as a powerful ally, President Bush will propose sweeping, long-term changes in Medicare later this month when he urges Congress to provide prescription drug benefits for the elderly, administration officials say.
 In the last three weeks, the president has told his advisers and Congressional leaders that he wants to promote competition in Medicare to shore up the program for 76 million baby boomers and to establish his credentials on an issue likely to figure prominently in the 2004 election. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Bush's vision for Medicare closely resembled proposals advanced in the last three years by Senator Bill Frist, the Tennessee Republican who is to become majority leader when Congress convenes on Tuesday. While Mr. Bush had been drafting his own proposals, administration officials and Congressional aides said Dr. Frist's elevation enhanced the prospect that they would be taken seriously on Capitol Hill. 
Though White House officials are still working out details, Mr. Bush, like Dr. Frist, has said he wants to foster competition between the original fee-for-service Medicare program and private health plans. Such changes could eventually make Medicare look more like private insurance. Because of his long interest in the issue, Dr. Frist can explain and defend the Medicare proposals in a way that the previous Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, never could.
Still, persuading Congress to enact major changes in the structure of Medicare, beyond the addition of drug benefits, will be an uphill struggle for Mr. Bush, even with help from Dr. Frist, because the program is immensely popular with older voters.
Administration officials hope that the changes would, over the long term, produce savings by keeping costs down. But they had no firm estimates for now.
Under one idea favored by many of the president's advisers, the government would give Medicare beneficiaries a powerful incentive to enroll in more efficient, less costly health plans. If private health plans did a better job of holding down costs, their members would reap the benefits, getting cash rebates or lower premiums. Conversely, if the traditional program cost less, the government would pass on most of the savings to people who are in it.
Under another proposal, Medicare would offer enhanced benefits, including a cap on out-of-pocket costs, perhaps in return for higher premiums.
"The president has encouraged his advisers to think long term," a White House official said today. "He insists that any proposal for prescription drug benefits must have major Medicare reforms in it. We shouldn't just add liabilities onto a program that's antiquated and likely to go bankrupt."
An administration official said Mr. Bush agreed with Dr. Frist's view that "drug coverage must be part of comprehensive Medicare reform."
That view complicates the task facing Congress and virtually ensures a huge political battle. Almost every member of Congress has promised drug benefits to the elderly, and the two parties could conceivably strike a compromise on that issue, but they are nowhere near agreement on long-term changes in the structure of Medicare.
"If the price of a prescription drug benefit is the end of Medicare as we know it, that's not a price worth paying," said Debbie Curtis, chief of staff to Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California.
The White House is working with an influential Democratic senator, John B. Breaux of Louisiana.
"Just adding prescription drugs to an outdated Medicare program is like throwing lead weights onto a sinking ship," said Mr. Breaux, who has drafted legislation with Dr. Frist to inject market forces into Medicare.
In June, the House passed a Republican bill to offer drug benefits to all 40 million elderly and disabled people on Medicare. It included a little-noticed provision for an experiment under which the fee-for-service Medicare program would compete with private insurance plans, including health maintenance organizations, in four metropolitan areas.
Administration officials said this was just the type of competition they wanted to encourage, because it would make Medicare beneficiaries more conscious of costs. But, the officials said, House Republicans were too timid in limiting their experiment to four areas and should have tried it on a larger scale.
Congressional Republicans welcomed the prospect that Mr. Bush would lead a high-profile campaign for prescription drug benefits, but they said they were apprehensive about White House ideas for fundamental changes in the Medicare structure. Elderly voters want drug benefits as soon as possible, but are not clamoring for "Medicare reform," said several Republicans who personally favor such changes.
Mr. Bush and Dr. Frist often cite the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program as a model for the competition they want to see in Medicare. Under that program, the government contributes a fixed amount of money for each employee, and workers who choose more expensive plans have to pay more.
Bobby Jindal, an assistant secretary of health and human services, endorsed that approach. "Plans should be allowed to bid to provide Medicare's required benefits at a competitive price," Mr. Jindal said, "and beneficiaries who elect a less costly option should be able to keep most of the savings."
But Vicki Gottlich, who counsels elderly patients as a lawyer at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, said that approach would not work as well for Medicare beneficiaries as for federal employees. "It could shift costs to individual beneficiaries so that people with the greatest medical needs pay the most for their health care," Ms. Gottlich said.
About 85 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are in the fee-for-service program. Many private health plans have dropped out, saying Medicare pays too little to cover their costs. Administration officials said Mr. Bush would propose an increase in Medicare payments to private plans, as an incentive for them to stay in the program.
The comptroller general of the United States, David M. Walker, has said that Medicare is "unsustainable in its present form," because the costs are growing much faster than either the economy or the revenues available to pay for the program. The Congressional Budget Office says that the annual cost, $256 billion last year, will top $470 billion in a decade, without any new benefits.
In outlining his health-care agenda, President Bush said last year that "seniors who are happy with the current system should be able to keep the coverage that they have now, with no changes, if they prefer."
Administration officials said this commitment applied to people already in Medicare, and perhaps to those who become eligible in the next 5 to 10 years. Whether it applies to people who enter Medicare after that is "open to discussion," an administration official said.
Under several proposals being considered by the administration, Medicare beneficiaries would be encouraged to enroll in an H.M.O. or in a new version of the fee-for-service program to obtain prescription drug benefits.
The new option would offer more extensive coverage of preventive services, like mammograms and colon cancer tests, and would provide greater protection against the high costs of serious illnesses. But for such protection, officials said, Medicare beneficiaries might be required to pay higher premiums and co-payments, in addition to any new charge for drug coverage.
Under the existing program, Dr. Frist has noted, Medicare covers only half of the health costs for an average beneficiary, leaving the elderly exposed to "large and unlimited out-of-pocket liabilities."
The Medicare premium, now $58.70 a month, rises with Medicare spending for doctors' services and outpatient hospital care. Even without new drug benefits, the premium will reach $105 in 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Under the bills most seriously considered by Congress last year, Medicare would charge an additional premium for drug coverage, starting at $25 to $33 a month.
As members of a federal advisory commission in 1998 and 1999, Senators Frist and Breaux devised an elaborate proposal to promote competition in the Medicare market. 
Within hours after Congress convenes next week, health care providers will converge on the Capitol to lobby for higher Medicare payments. 
Administration officials said Mr. Bush would support a small increase in Medicare payments to doctors, whose Medicare fees were cut 5.4 percent last year and 4.4 percent this year.

HEADLINE: A Rare Chance to Take Back a Market; 
Johnson & Johnson's New Stent May Dominate Angioplasties

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Few companies ever get a second chance once they fall behind the competition on a pivotal product. Johnson & Johnson is about to become an exception to that rule.
 Early this year, Johnson & Johnson, the giant health care conglomerate that sells everything from Band-Aids to birth control pills, is expected to receive regulatory approval in the United States for a new medical device -- a drug-coated stent that promises drastic changes in the way that hundreds of thousands of patients with heart disease are treated. 
 The stent, called the Cypher, keeps coronary arteries open more successfully and much longer than the plain metal devices now used, sharply reducing the need for repeated angioplasties and for heart bypass surgery. Even at a price likely to be around $3,000 each -- more than double the cost of current devices -- the stents are expected to take over much of the market for angioplasties. 
"It has the potential to change the landscape, not only for patients but also the economics," said Michael Dake, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. "It's a really big business."
Johnson & Johnson, in 1994, pioneered the stent, a meshlike device inserted in coronary arteries that serves as scaffolding to help overcome the constrictions that cause heart attacks. But the company squandered its lead. Failing to recognize just how important the device was, the company did not invest enough in developing better designs. It also alienated doctors and hospitals by charging $1,600 for each stent without making sure insurers would reimburse the cost. By the late 1990's, Johnson & Johnson's share of the market had fallen sharply.
Robert W. Croce, the chairman of Cordis, the unit at Johnson & Johnson responsible for making stents, vows not to make the same mistakes again. Even before the Food and Drug Administration approves the new stent, the company has been lining up insurance coverage and meeting with hospitals about the device's potential impact on their finances. Cordis is also already at work on new versions of the stent.
"We feel like we're staying ahead of our competitors and will be a moving target," Mr. Croce said. Guidant and Boston Scientific are already readying their own devices.
The market for the drug-coated stents is worth fighting for. Kurt Kruger, an analyst with Banc of America Securities, says the new stents could lead to a doubling of the existing American market, to $3.2 billion, in 2003. The overwhelming majority of those sales are expected to be of the drug-coated stent, with Johnson & Johnson capturing $2.8 billion of the total, compared with an estimated $415 million in stent sales in 2002.
"It's going to be an absolute gold mine for Johnson & Johnson," said Mr. Kruger, who estimates the market could reach nearly $4 billion by 2004.
While Johnson & Johnson is a huge company, expected to have $36 billion in sales this year, drug-coated stents are by far its most promising product. Recapturing the stent business will give the company a highly profitable franchise in cardiology devices, a rapidly growing market. Sales of the stents could approach those of Johnson & Johnson's most popular product, the Procrit/Eprex anemia drug.
If all goes as expected, Mr. Kruger said, the company's earnings growth in 2003 should reach the high double digits, largely because of the stents.
Because expectations are so high, however, if anything goes wrong Johnson & Johnson risks disappointing doctors and patients, not to mention the investors who have bid up its stock this year.
"Whenever there is a lot of hype surrounding a product launch, sometimes it's setting up for possible problems," said Michael Krensavage, an analyst for Raymond James.
Johnson & Johnson's original stent revolutionized angioplasty, a procedure that involves threading a catheter through a clogged artery and then inflating a balloon to unblock the vessel. The stents made angioplasty more effective, and Johnson & Johnson had the market to itself for about three years. But the company failed to anticipate how quickly the device would catch on, Mr. Croce said, and stumbled. Hospitals shouldered the extra cost of the new devices because Medicare was slow to reimburse them.
By the time competitors like Guidant entered the market in 1997, Johnson & Johnson was vulnerable. The company refused to drop the price of its stents, and the competing devices proved much more flexible and easier for doctors to use.
"If you get a little complacent in the market, you're going to get hammered," said Mr. Croce, who took over Cordis just as the company was losing its grip on the stent market. 
Now, Johnson & Johnson is doing what it can to make sure the new device is paid for. Last year, Medicare took the highly unusual step of agreeing to pay for the drug-coated stent even before it received F.D.A. approval.
"I believe, and my staff believes, this is really a revolutionary new technology," said Thomas A. Scully, the head of Medicare, who said he had responded to concern from hospitals that they would lose significant sums if the new devices were not paid for.
While Johnson & Johnson has not yet said what it plans to charge for the new stent, analysts and others expect the price to be about $3,000. Company officials argue that the savings from fewer angioplasties and bypass surgeries easily outweighs the device's costs. While the costs of these procedures vary widely, an average angioplasty with a stent costs some $8,000 and a bypass around $17,500 at the Health Alliance network of hospitals in Cincinnati, for example. 
At Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest not-for-profit health maintenance organization, the committee studying new procedures has recommended that its doctors consider using drug-coated stents, although it does not analyze the cost of new technologies.
Many private insurers are also deciding their reimbursement policies. Aetna, for example, is conducting an expedited review and should decide its reimbursement policy soon after the stent receives approval.
The new stent addresses a fundamental problem: 20 to 40 percent of patients who get the traditional stents experience reblockage of their arteries because of scar tissue. Johnson & Johnson scientists discovered that the scarring could be prevented if stents were coated with a drug licensed from Wyeth called Sirolimus, now used in patients getting kidney transplants. The stent releases minute amounts of the drug for the first month or so, when the scarring tends to occur.
In the most recent clinical study, the drug-coated stent sharply reduced the need for a second procedure, and an F.D.A. advisory panel voted unanimously in late October to recommend its approval. The company is expected to get final clearance early this year, although regulators have expressed some concerns about the device.
Johnson & Johnson appears to have the market to itself for at least the first year, although any delay in regulatory approval will shorten that lead. Its competitors, Guidant and Boston Scientific, are scrambling to come up with their own versions of drug-coated stents, and the two have been wrangling over the rights to the drug they want to use, paclitaxel, licensed from Angiotech Pharmaceuticals.
Boston Scientific is expected to come to the market at the end of this year. But Guidant, which reported disappointing preliminary results from a study yesterday, is now expected to enter the market sometime in 2005. The company is expected to cancel its plans to merge with the Cook Group and instead develop another kind of drug-coated stent.
But Johnson & Johnson may not be able to make too much of being first with the new devices. "It will be the best stent that captures the market, not the first," said Dr. William L. Hunter, Angiotech's chief executive.
And many of the factors that gave Johnson & Johnson a second chance also make its lead tenuous, said Gary P. Pisano, a Harvard University business professor who has studied the medical device market.
"The product cycles are very short," he said. "This is a very competitive market," and cardiologists, who tend to be quick to adopt a technology, are also likely to switch to a better device if it becomes available.
"They don't tend to be very brand- loyal," Mr. Pisano said.
While Mr. Croce says he is confident that Sirolimus is the best drug in keeping arteries open, paclitaxel also appears effective. "Neither Johnson & Johnson nor Boston Scientific has been able to deliver a knock-out blow" by producing studies that demonstrate significant superiority, Mr. Kruger of Banc of America said. In 2004, he estimates that Boston Scientific will sell about $1 billion of its drug-coated stents, compared with nearly $3 billion in sales for Johnson & Johnson. 
Johnson & Johnson is also working to introduce other versions of its stent in the next few years. The last time around, "we didn't apply enough resources to develop the next generation," Mr. Croce said. Now, the company is planning to introduce an improved stent coated with the same drug in 2004 and another stent that is also coated with heparin, which reduces the chance of blood clots, in 2005.
But the hefty price tag of the Cypher may still prove a stumbling block. The device has already been approved in Europe, but doctors there have been slower than expected to embrace the new stent, and the device has so far captured only 10 percent of the market.
"It's all about reimbursement," said Mr. Croce, who predicted that as next year's budgets take into account more use of the drug-coated stent, more doctors will use it.
But some doctors also say they do not believe that every patient should get the new stent, even though they expect their colleagues to rush to use it. "There's a zeal for popping those things in," said Dean J. Kereiakes, a cardiologist who heads the Ohio Heart Health Center. But the stent may not prove as effective as hoped for in some patients, he said, including patients undergoing a heart attack or diabetics who take insulin. 
"I'm an advocate," Dr. Kereiakes said of the new stents, "but I'm also cautious about extrapolating from limited data."
There are also concerns about the impact of the devices on hospitals, many of whom say they will still lose money because the reimbursement for the new stents is not likely to cover all their costs.
It will be years before anyone knows for sure just how lasting a breakthrough Johnson & Johnson's new stent turns out to be.
There will be "a ramp-up of clinical activity over the next few years," said Patrick O'Gara, the medical director of the cardiac service line for Partners HealthCare, which includes Brigham & Women's and Massachusetts General Hospitals in Boston, "to see what the limits of the new technology will be and what patients will most benefit."

HEADLINE: Displaying An Empire For Posterity 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BRISTOL, England 

 BODY:
As Britain's baby boomers came of age in the mid-1960's, the sun was setting on the British Empire. Instead of young Britons heading off to run the colonies as soldiers and administrators, Jamaicans, Indians, Pakistanis and other former colonial subjects began migrating in droves to Britain. It was now the turn of the ex-colonies to change the mother country. In a sense, the British Empire had come home to roost.
 In the decades that followed, however, public awareness of Britain's past glory quickly faded. The country accepted that it was a former great power and carved itself a new role as a bridge between Europe and the United States. Nostalgia for the greatness of yore became the stuff of satire. Pride in imperial feats was offset by reminders of the abuses that also accompanied 350 years of conquest and rule. The very words "British Empire" caused discomfort. 
 Little wonder that when John Letts, a British publisher, lamented the absence of a British Empire museum in the mid-1970's, there was little echo. After all, treasures of the ex-colonies were already on show in the British Museum, while the Commonwealth Institute offered a reassuring multicultural image of what had become of the empire. The British government, for its part, had no interest in creating a museum simply to celebrate the largest empire the world has ever known. 
Yet almost 30 years later, thanks to Mr. Letts's persistence in winning allies and raising money, a privately run British Empire and Commonwealth Museum has opened in the western city of Bristol. No less surprising, its display has been well received as a balanced interpretation of the good and the bad of the empire as well as of the mixed welcome given to immigrants from the former colonies when they arrived in Britain.
"It has been a very fine line we have had to tread," Mr. Letts, 73, said of the $15 million museum, which was inaugurated in November by Princess Anne, Queen Elizabeth II's daughter. "Everywhere we have tried to tell both sides of the stories. You could say we're trying to be all things to all peoples, but we have been very careful about what goes in."
One result has been a flurry of newspaper articles here about both the museum and about Britain's uneasy relationship with its colonial past. There has been fresh debate about the imperial roots of contemporary problems like Kashmir, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and even Iraq, which Britain carved out of the remnants of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920's. Comparisons have been drawn between the British Empire and the United States' global domination today.
In general, though, the response to the museum has been tempered -- neither jingoistic nor remorseful. For instance, while last February Belgium expressed regret for its role in the 1961 murder of Patrice Lumumba, the former Belgian Congo's first prime minister after independence, there has been no talk here of a British apology for imperial wrongs.
"As far as this institution is concerned, it is enough that we don't step back from the most uncomfortable periods of our national history and don't hide and duck the realities of history," Gareth Griffiths, the museum's director, said. "We're here as an institution that is collecting a history that was forgotten and was disappearing and, in the future, as a forum for presenting this history and encouraging debate."
With little of this history being taught in British schools today, the museum's first task may well be educational. Writing in The Times of London, Michael Binyon recalled that when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned, in 1953, Britain still ruled a quarter of the globe. "Not only has this imperial order vanished almost overnight, but it has disappeared entirely from public memory," he noted. "The British Empire is now a black hole in history, and few dare look into its depths."
Bristol itself, though, offers an apposite door to this past. It was from here that John Cabot left to discover Newfoundland in 1497. Barely a century later, as Bristol became the principal gateway to the colonies of the New World, its wealth grew thanks to tobacco imports and the slave trade. 
What Bristol perhaps best represents, however, is the economic impulse behind the early empire, as illustrated by the museum's emphasis on the role played by the great trading companies, starting with the East India Company and the Hudson's Bay Company of Canada. Most British slave traders also operated under the aegis of the Royal African Company, selling four million Africans to the New World between 1640 and 1807.
The museum's collection is presented chronologically, albeit as a journey through space as well as time. Britain's navy, first merchant vessels and much later the Royal Navy, was central to the expansion of British interests, which for a long time remained principally commercial. 
The museum pays scant attention to the "loss" of the United States after 1776, but by the late 18th century Britain's focus had clearly switched from simple trading to colonization. This became the formula for the greatest expansion of the empire during the 19th century, when Canada, India, Australia, New Zealand and a good part of Africa were under imperial rule. 
Along with the maps, documents, photographs and objects, the museum also displays text panels where today's perspective is often added. For instance, one panel recalls that, ignoring the Aboriginal population, Capt. James Cook described Australia as "terra nullis" -- empty land -- when he landed there in 1770. Noting that Britain founded its first penal colony there in 1788, the text observes: "No Man's Land? Britons ignore the rights of the First Australians."
Another panel refers to the opium wars provoked by British sales of Indian-produced opium to China: "British guns back private drug trade in China. British merchants smuggled huge amounts of opium into China in the 19th century. When the Chinese government protested, Britain went to war." The 1857 Indian Mutiny is in turn renamed "the great rebellion."
But not everything is negative. Some historians believe that Britain's rule of India prevented the subcontinent's fragmentation into scores of small states. Similarly, while Britons were major slave traders, the movement to ban slavery also began in Britain: it prohibited the slave trade in 1807, after which the Royal Navy intercepted foreign slave ships.
"But altruism was perhaps more in the minds of the British than in the perceptions of those ruled," Mr. Letts conceded.
A crucial factor in holding together the empire was communication. In the 19th century, Britain built railways in most of its colonies (as well as in much of Latin America). It also exploited the invention of the telegraph and marine cable systems to ensure that information reached London quickly from the colonies. And of course the Royal Navy ruled the waves. At the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, the world was invited to admire -- or fear -- British power.
World War I marked the beginning of the end of the empire, although in both this conflict and World War II, Britain was helped immeasurably by food and raw materials from the colonies, as well as by no fewer than two million soldiers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India in World War II alone. But once India's pent-up demand for independence was granted in 1947, the rest of the empire soon followed, with the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 almost an afterthought.
One of the museum's most interesting initiatives has been to "catch the dying," as Mr. Griffiths put it, by recording the recollections of more than 1,000 people who worked in the former colonies. At the same time, a large screen in the museum carries brief testimonies from a dozen people from Africa, India, the Caribbean and Hong Kong who recall their experiences of moving to Britain.
"There are tales of economic migration, joy, discrimination, disappointment and integration," Gary Younge wrote in The Guardian, a left-of-center British newspaper. "The result is a lasting imprint of the economic motor that drove Empire and colonization and the human impact such a mammoth journey has had on all of us."
It is also an impact that continues to be felt in a Britain where ethnic minorities represent almost 6 percent of the population. One key to understanding contemporary Britain lies in the history of its empire.
"When I decided something must be done, I picked up a line from Cicero," Mr. Letts recalled. "It says, 'Not to have knowledge of what happened before you were born is to be condemned to live forever as a child.' I like to think of this as the idea that guides the museum."

Warning From Home Depot Halts the New Year's Rally

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A profit warning from Home Depot halted the New Year's rally on Wall Street yesterday, leaving stocks narrowly mixed amid concerns about consumer spending. But the market's leading gauges ended the week with healthy gains.
 Trading was tentative and lackluster, a sharp contrast to the session on Thursday when the market had its best day in more than two months after the report of an unexpected jump in manufacturing activity. 
 Analysts were heartened that despite Home Depot's warning, the market declines yesterday were modest.
"The market has held up rather nicely," said Brian Bush, director of equity research at Stephens. "We have entered the year with people optimistic that we are not going to have a fourth negative year for the overall market."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 5.83 points, or 0.1 percent, at 8,601.69. On Thursday, the Dow surged 265.89 points, its best one-day gain since Oct. 15.
The market's broader gauges were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index was up 2.23 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,387.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 0.44 point, or 0.1 percent, to 908.59.
The indexes posted gains for the week because of advances in the three previous sessions, including Thursday's big rally. For the holiday-shortened week, the Dow rose 3.6 percent, the Nasdaq climbed 2.9 percent and the S.& P. advanced 3.8 percent. All three indexes were down the previous week.
The Dow is 18 percent above the five-year low of 7,286.27 it hit on Oct. 9. The Nasdaq is 24 percent above and the S.& P. is 17 percent above six-year lows also made on Oct. 9.
But analysts also said the market needed more upbeat news about earnings and the economy before embarking on another upward trend or breaking its three-year losing stretch.
"You wouldn't expect to have multiple days up, especially with Home Depot's earnings warning and slack December retail sales," said Brian Bruce, director of global investments at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston.
A day like Thursday, he said, "is almost an anomaly until sentiment changes and people become more positive."
Investors are particularly sensitive to disappointing news involving consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy.
Home Depot, which late Thursday cited slow holiday sales as it cut its earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending in February, dropped $3.50, to $21.38, yesterday.
Additionally, Bear, Stearns and Deutsche Securities each downgraded Home Depot, while Banc of America Securities downgraded a rival, Lowe's, which then fell $2.43, to $36.92.
After three years of dismal declines, investors are wary about 2003 and are postponing committing to the market ahead of first-quarter earnings results, which companies will begin releasing in earnest in two weeks.
Bond prices rose yesterday. The 10-year note gained 2/32 , to a price of 99 26/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.02 percent from 4.03 percent on Thursday. The 30-year bond increased 5/32 , to 106 15/32 . Its yield dropped to 4.95 percent from 4.96 percent.
Among stocks, Walgreen was up $2.06 at $32.16, on quarterly earnings that were a penny a share higher than analysts had expected.
Kenneth Cole advanced $1.57, to $23.57, after raising its fourth-quarter estimates of profit and revenue.
Advancing issues had a narrow lead over decliners on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was light.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Energy-Rich Kazakhstan Is Suffering Growing Pains

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE with CHRISTOPHER PALA

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan 

 BODY:
At the presidential palace here, a confident President Nursultan Nazarbayev strode out in December to greet foreign investors. It was all smiles for the cameras as Mr. Nazarbayev sat down with the investors, most of them oil executives, to talk about recent business developments in this vast country, rich in energy resources.
 But behind the facade of friendliness, tensions could not be hidden. A consortium had recently halted a long-planned $3.5 billion expansion at the largest oil development project in Kazakhstan, in a standoff with the government over the terms of the contract. 
 A criminal inquiry in Washington into Mr. Nazarbayev's relations with some American oil companies was, meanwhile, moving forward despite efforts by Mr. Nazarbayev's aides to stop it. 
Kazakh officials said the dispute with the consortium had already been resolved. The oil industry group, however, denies that. Whatever the outcome, that disagreement, the separate criminal investigation and a new toughness toward foreign investors have shown that Kazakhstan is not as risk-free for investors as it likes to present itself. The difficulties come in a region that the United States has long said is central to its efforts to find alternatives to the Middle East as a source of oil. 
Some say the country is just experiencing growing pains. Leaders in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic five times the size of France, "did not know where Paris was eight years ago," one American executive said. Now it has a high credit rating, rapid economic growth, and global oil companies still clamoring for entry to its oil industry. 
Economic achievements were followed by new oil discoveries. The oil find at Kashagan, a field in the northern Caspian Sea with seven billion to nine billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves, is the largest discovery in the world since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska over 30 years ago.
The years of successes have given Kazakhstan and its government a new confidence. Officials are younger and more worldly. The economic free-for-all of the early 1990's, during which foreign companies were given advantageous deals, are over, the officials say. The time has come for foreign companies to pay more.
According to the American executive, a senior Kazakh official recently described the early deals with foreign oil companies as "giving them everything they wanted in exchange for beads."
The Kazakhs "are sophisticated and have money," added the executive, who works closely with the government and is one of the few foreigners here willing to talk about the situation in Kazakhstan but only on condition he not be identified.
"It's not the poor country it was even five years ago," he added. "They think they can call the shots, whether it's with ChevronTexaco or TotalFinaElf."
That approach, however, has caused big problems with foreign investors.
Consider the ChevronTexaco oil consortium and its very public falling-out with the government in November over investments in a large field in western Kazakhstan called Tengiz.
The consortium -- known as TengizChevroil and including Exxon Mobil; LukArco of Russia; and a Kazakh company, KazMunaiGaz -- suspended a long-planned expansion of the project when the government insisted on an accounting method that would have brought in more for the state but was not, the consortium contended, part of the 1993 contract.
Kazakhstan's finance minister, Zeinulla Kakimzhanov, railed at the suspension and said the accounting method of the consortium would deprive the budget of $1 billion in revenue. "For Kazakhstan, this is a significant sum of money," he said at the time. "The Kazakh side supports production expansion, but not at the cost of lower tax payments."
The foreign companies say the contract should be respected. They say that without favorable and predictable tax regimes, no international company will invest the billions of dollars needed to develop a large oil field. Besides, they say, they are contributing their fair share in taxes.
The tax payments from TengizChevroil alone account for 15 percent of the Kazakhstan budget.
Executives for ChevronTexaco and TengizChevroil in Almaty declined to be interviewed.
A senior United States Department of Energy official said in an interview in December: "You cannot change the rules of the game after people have invested. People are making decisions and there are implications all down the line. If the rules were being changed, that's a problem."
Signs of tougher conditions began to appear even before 2002, with the government's drafting of a law to level the playing field between foreign and local investors. That measure, critics say, has worsened conditions for foreigners.
The government has become "more assertive in terms of regulation," said Menno Grouvel, director in Europe and Central Asia for TotalFinaElf. "They tend to apply constraints that are more difficult to implement."
Tax and ecological fines are more frequently imposed, executives said. The ChevronTexaco project has been fighting a $71 million environmental fine it contends was wrongly imposed. Another oil investor said that he was fighting for the repeal of a tax fine that was equal to the entire amount of its 2001 net profit for its Kazakhstan project.
"The energy minister says the contracts are sacrosanct," said a lawyer at an international law firm with an office here in Almaty that represents foreign oil companies. "But on a practical level, state tax auditors are often using new laws that make the contracts worse."
The local business and political elite support the government's stance. Bulat Abilov, a businessman and former opposition member of Parliament, said higher taxes for foreign companies should be a prerequisite for support for the war on terrorism by the United States. Kazakhstan gave the United States military landing rights here after Sept. 11, 2001.
Foreign oil concerns "hold a few baseball tournaments and everyone thanks them," Mr. Abilov said. "You want help with the fight against terrorism? Have the big oil companies pay more taxes here."
"It's been 10 years" since the TengizChevroil deal was signed, he said, and "people in the provinces are still thinking, 'What do we get from this oil?' "
Mr. Abilov and other critics say the oil companies carved out good deals for themselves in the early 1990's, when Kazakhstan's legal system was just being formed and profitable contracts could be won through bribes and close ties with state officials.
Some of the contracts have been the subject of criminal inquiries in the United States, where the authorities are investigating claims that Mr. Nazarbayev took bribes from American companies to award desired oil fields and later tried to obstruct an inquiry into the payments.
Mr. Nazarbayev and the companies, which include Mobil, now part of Exxon Mobil; Amoco, now part of BP; and Phillips Petroleum, now part of ConocoPhillips, deny any wrongdoing.
Despite all the difficulties, foreign companies are showing no signs of abandoning the rich reserves here. Competition for the investment dollars could intensify if Iraq's oil fields open for development after a possible American-led war against that country, analysts said. Even so, they said, Kazakhstan would remain the leading energy power in the Caspian region. And that means the investors would have to figure out a way to work with the more demanding Kazakh government.
And vice versa. The Kazakhs "are playing hide-and-seek with foreign companies," said Sergei Lukyanov, Caspian expert in Moscow for Petroleum Argus, an oil industry publication. "But Kazakhstan has very ambitious oil export plans. If they aren't backed by real export growth, it will have to forget them. Kazakhstan cannot wait. It is the emerging market, not ChevronTexaco."

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Up In November 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 

 BODY:
Construction spending rose for a third consecutive month in November as the lowest mortgage rates in three decades spurred record home sales.
 The amount spent on homes, hotels and highways increased 0.3 percent from the previous month after the October gain was revised up to 1 percent, the Commerce Department said. The $843.2 billion spent in November was the most since May. 
 The increase adds to evidence that a sluggish economic recovery is gathering momentum. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its manufacturing index rose the most in 11 years in December, and home sales probably reached a record in 2002. 
"The recovery is well positioned to continue, moderately but steadily," Cathy Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a speech in Hartford. "We just need to have some patience."
The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to 5.85 percent this week, the lowest since 1965. Cheaper financing has allowed more Americans to become first-time homeowners. Construction accounts for almost 5 percent of the United States economy, and residential building makes up half of construction spending.
"Affordability continues to be strong because interest rates are very low," said Gary Reece, chief financial officer of M.D.C. Holdings Inc., the ninth-biggest home builder in the nation.
The National Association of Realtors' home-buyer affordability index was 141.2 in November, up from 137.2 in January. A value of 100 means that a family with the national median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home.
The value of new housing construction jumped 1.6 percent in November, to a record $271.3 billion. 
The value of public construction rose 1.5 percent, to $207.9 billion at an annual rate. Government spending increased for schools, hospitals and highways.
Nonresidential construction declined 0.1 percent in November, to $158.7 billion, after rising 1.5 percent a month earlier, today's report said. The drop was led by less spending on office buildings, schools and hospitals. Commercial construction declined for the sixth time in seven months.

HEADLINE: Fiat's Woes, Europe's Disunion 

 BODY:
They must be breathing a sigh of relief in Detroit. Roberto Colaninno, the entrepreneurial turnaround artist, now seems set to play the role of white knight in Fiat's tale of woe. He may buy a controlling interest and relieve General Motors of its potential obligation to acquire the 80 percent stake in the iconic but troubled Italian automaker that it doesn't already own. 
 The fact that G.M. now has little interest in owning Fiat is what makes this deal -- if it goes through -- good news. But it will be a happy ending to a bad scenario. This was a plan orchestrated in part by the Italian government, which encouraged Mr. Colaninno to get involved because Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was driven by a misplaced sense of economic nationalism to make sure Fiat remained in Italian hands. 
 His protectionist impulse is part of a disquieting trend undermining the European Union's goal of supplementing its common currency with a single financial market, governed by one set of rules, by 2005. Most egregiously, the French government announced a $9 billion bailout to heavily indebted France Telecom last month.
Such interventionism distorts competition, protects inefficiency and mocks the very idea of a single European economy by discouraging cross-border investment. It is no surprise that in this environment, Brussels' ambitious drive to create a common financial market has stalled. The inability of E.U. member nations to agree on rules governing corporate takeovers is particularly telling.
The European Union cannot fulfill its economic potential, nor achieve its avowed goal of surpassing American competition, unless it succeeds in creating a single financial market. And Americans should be hopeful that Brussels will ultimately prevail in its uphill march toward making the European Union a more formidable competitor. Growth is not a zero-sum game, and the United States needs as much help as it can get in trying to reignite the world economy.

At the end of every year, John Brockman, a literary agent and the publisher of Edge.org, a Web site devoted to science, poses a question to leading scientists, writers and futurists. In 2002, he asked respondents to imagine that they had been nominated as White House science adviser and that President Bush had sought their answer to "What are the pressing scientific issues for the nation and the world, and what is your advice on how I can begin to deal with them?" Here are excerpts of some of the responses. 

Mapping the Planet
 Over the last decade, the human genome project has laid the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of human biology. The translation of the new understanding into cures for human diseases will be a slow and difficult process. 
 Meanwhile, a new century has begun. It is time to begin a bold new initiative in biology: a planetary genome sequencing project to identify all the segments of the genomes of all the millions of species that live together on the planet.
This would require, first, the aggressive development of new technology for deciphering genes, comparable to the development of computer technology during the last half century, so that the cost of sequencing genes can continue to fall as rapidly as the cost of computing. 
The goal would be to complete the sequencing of the biosphere within less than half a century, at a cost comparable with the cost of the human genome. This project would bring an enormous increase in understanding of the ecology of the planet, which could then be translated into practical measures to sustain and improve the environment while allowing continued rapid economic development. It could also lead to the stabilization of the atmosphere and the climate. Let this century be the century of cures for planetary as well as human diseases.
-- Freeman Dyson, retired professor of physics, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J.

Professor PlayStation
While American schools are notoriously underserving their students, American children are rushing home from class to learn how to succeed in the alternative universes of video games. They spend dozens of hours every week exploring virtual worlds, each with its own set of rules. Barring a complete overhaul of our schools, makers of game systems like Nintendo and PlayStation will continue to be the most successful institutions when it comes to captivating young minds.
South Korea has already figured this out. More than 60 percent of Korean homes have broadband Internet access -- and online, multiplayer role-playing games are immensely popular. Recently, the largest Korean textbook distributor and an independent software designer joined forces to make such a game in which children study math, science and history.
Here in the United States, the Army is using video games to reach teenagers. With a $7 million budget, it is building a series of games to be made available as a free download over the Web. The first title, "America's Army," helps players learn about war tactics by requiring them to rush through shooter missions armed with guns and grenades.
But where are the games created to teach young Americans civilian skills? While televisions and slide shows play a large role in classrooms, video games are still appallingly underused. Let's match the money and effort spent on "America's Army" to develop freely available games that teach about math and science, history and citizenship.
--Justin Hall, electronic entertainment journalist and creator of the Web site Justin's Links. 

Little Geniuses
We need more support for the most productive, and most underfinanced, scientific community in the country. These scientists and educators do more to provide the basic intellectual infrastructure of the nation than any other group. Every year they make fundamental discoveries in physics, biology, mathematics and psychology, as well as ensure that the discoveries of previous generations of scientists are passed on to future generations. Yet they typically receive salaries of zero to $15,000 a year, and 16 percent are below the poverty line. Most of the science educators in this group actually make major financial sacrifices to do their work. They receive less federal and state support than any other part of the scientific community -- no grants, no scholarships, no research and development write-offs. 
These unsung geniuses, are, of course, children under five and the many women (and a few men) who take care of them. This may seem like a motherhood issue; well, actually, it is a motherhood issue. But it's sound science policy too. Give our children what all scientists need --lunch, the right toys, a safe place to play, interesting problems to solve and someone to talk to, and watch them invent a new world.
-- Alison Gopnik, author of "The Scientist in the Crib: What Early Learning Tells Us About the Mind."

Think Small
The United States has been increasing its research efforts in a broad field called nanotechnology. Nanotechnology -- its name comes from the Greek work for dwarf -- refers to mechanical engineering on a molecular scale. Technology based on molecular manufacturing will lead to computer systems a billion times more powerful than what we have today, aerospace vehicles with 98 percent less structural mass, and medical tools that can repair tissues, organs and cells at a microscopic level. 
Molecular manufacturing will be based on molecular machine systems able to manipulate and assemble molecular components to make larger products. If you look in a conventional factory today, you will see electronic devices sensing and controlling processes, but the actual work shaping, moving and assembling parts is done by machines that, quite naturally, use moving parts to move parts.
Yet today's research programs are not focused on developing the molecular machine technologies essential to molecular manufacturing. Researchers often see any machinery as somehow archaic, left over from the 19th century. Thus interest in topics like biotechnology and microelectronics has diverted resources into short-term efforts that are worth doing, but not at the expense of neglecting the long-term promise of nanotechnology. 
--K. Eric Drexler, founder of the Foresight Institute and author of "Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation; Unbounding the Future."

Science Without Secrets
My advice is to keep science public. Secret knowledge, no matter how laboriously acquired, is less than science.
Some knowledge, of course, must remain secret for the security of the nation. But unless there is a clear security risk, publish all else. Why? Science belongs to the people: they pay for it; they benefit from it. The benefits of scientific knowledge accrue far more rapidly when that knowledge lies open for all to see, to test and to try.
In my field, quantum computation, openness is beneficial. Quantum mechanics is famously weird, and one of the consequences of quantum weirdness is that even a small quantum computer, consisting of a few thousand atoms, has the potential to break all existing public-key cryptosystems.
As a result, quantum computers pose a significant threat to the security not only of classified encoded material, but also of most commercial transactions. Yet our national security agencies have elected to award grant money for quantum computing research with the stipulation that the results be published.
This is a wise policy. There is no doubt large-scale quantum computers will pose a risk to security. But they don't how exist, and constructing them will require the scientific and engineering community to solve wide-ranging problems of nanofabrication and control. The potential benefits of such research are a thousand times greater than any drawback from potential disruption to security.
-- Seth Lloyd, a professor of quantum-mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Fending Off the Big One
As an astrophysicist, I admit that few issues in my trade could be considered pressing. However, there is one aspect of my work that could have deadly consequences -- or, more precisely, will have deadly consequences if it is ignored. Here is where heaven and Earth meet: in the long-run certainty that people will die from the effects of an asteroid, large or small, hitting the planet.
NASA has been discovering and tracking asteroids, but the financing had not been sufficient to catalog most of them, and no money had gone to study how an asteroid might be deflected, even though the technology has, in principle, been available.
Fortunately, it is rather straightforward to develop a spacecraft that could reach a 100-meter diameter asteroid and give it a nudge so that it would miss the earth. For example, scientists have made great strides with plasma engines -- which are much more effective than traditional chemical engines and use radio waves to heat their fuel and magnetic fields to direct a stream of ultrahot ionized gases -- which could be used as space "tug boats."
All we have to do is carry out a test mission in which we demonstrate the ability to significantly alter an asteroid's orbit. Then when we discover an asteroid with our name on it, we will be prepared. Plasma engine advances would also speed up human expansion into space. This initiative could open the door to populating other worlds while at the same time making our own world a safer place.
-- Piet Hut, astrophysicist, Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J.

Intellectual Globalization
Both art and science address the most profound issues of the day yet often face each other across a great divide. A new National Institute for Humanism would encourage collaborations across the arts, humanities and sciences in tackling important questions about who and what we are. Call it the intellectual equivalent of globalization. 
Milan Kundera once wrote that every novel offers some answer to the question. "What is human existence and wherein does its poetry lie?" I submit that so does every work of important science.
-- Nancy Etcoff, author and instructor in the department of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School.

Cassandras of the Labs
Scientists are as much victims of fashion as ordinary mortals are -- a fact illustrated by the rich history of junk science and false alarms of the last 30 years. Recall a few instances:
In the mid-1970's, many climatologists warned of an ice age that would severely diminish agricultural productivity by the year 2000.
In 1972, the United States banned DDT, only to find out, years later, that the evidence of the pesticide's harmful effects on human beings is inconclusive. In the meantime, millions of people -- 1 in 20 African children, for example -- have died of malaria, as Europe and the United States remain reluctant to support controlling mosquitoes with DDT.
And let's not forget the dire warnings about natural resources. In the 1970's, we were told that there would be essentially no oil left by the 1990's.
Science retains its alarmist streak today. The scuttlebutt among the scientists I know is that they have a better chance of getting a government or private grant if they indicate that their research might uncover a serious threat or problem. Media fascination with bad news is partly to blame, along with the principled gloominess and nagging of nongovernmental pressure groups. But government itself has played its natural part.
The point is not to be cynical about science fads but to know enough to choose wisely when it comes to supporting pure science, along with research that can give us beneficial technologies.
-- Denis Dutton, Department of Philosophy, University of Canterbury, New Zealand.

Really Popular Science
I believe that if 1 percent of the money now being distributed for science went to research that was of real interest to taxpayers, science would become more popular. 
At present, money generally goes to research sought by the scientific establishment, corporations and government bureaucracies. The administration of science is neither democratically accountable, nor carried out in a democratic spirit. 
My proposal is that 99 percent of the research funds continue to be allocated in the usual way. But I suggest that 1 percent be spent in a way that reflects the curiosity of lay people, who pay for all publicly financed research through taxes. It would be necessary to create a separate body. One possible name would be the National Discovery Center. 
The center would be governed by a board representing a wide range of interests, including nongovernmental organizations, schools and voluntary associations. Individuals could send suggestions in over the Internet. Local and national organizations could lobby for projects. Potential subjects for research could be discussed in the news media. 
This new venture would make science more attractive to young people, stimulate interest in scientific thinking and hypothesis-testing, and help break down the depressing alienation many people feel from science.

HEADLINE: The Ultimate Backup In the Backwoods; 
Using Remote Sites for Emergencies

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: STERLING FOREST, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Angelo Kosmidis isn't sure what a big-name computer company like I.B.M. does in the two nondescript office buildings at the entrance to this state park in Orange County, but he knows what the people working there like for breakfast: pancakes.
 What Mr. Kosmidis probably does not know is that each time he delivers the pancakes, he is walking into a building with "people traps." Any intruder who made it to the second-floor reception area, with or without pancakes, would be caught in a high-tech snare. The two shatterproof glass doors would close, and the elevator would drop to the first floor, stranding the intruder. The receptionist would run behind a steel door and into the back room where top-secret security codes are kept. 
 It may sound like an Austin Powers movie, and yet people in this business like it that way. Disaster recovery sites like this one operate as high-tech lifeboats for other companies that need a safe haven for their employees, or for electronic records in fires, floods or terrorist attacks. 
Tucked away among miles of tree-covered slopes and pristine lakes 45 miles from Manhattan, the I.B.M. Business Continuity and Recovery Center is symbolic of the disaster recovery industry. Open since 1993, the Sterling Forest center was an afterthought for many people. It was referred to as "the bunker" by those quasi-paramilitary emergency planning teams that were once the object of ridicule in some offices.
On Sept. 11, 2001, all of that changed. The unthinkable became real, and the bunker was a joke no more.
Among the assumptions that were challenged was the location of companies' existing recovery sites. Ken Brady, senior director at Krolls Crisis Management Group, a consulting firm, said one company had its offices in 1 World Trade Center and its backup site in 2 World Trade Center. "Everyone had thought if there's a fire in 1, we'd walk over to 2.' 
Another change: disaster recovery planners are no longer way down the food chain in corporate America, said Joseph Flach, vice president of Eagle Rock Alliance, a business continuity consulting firm. "Now we're selling to C.E.O.'s," he said.
Until Sept. 11, most companies focused almost exclusively on what they would do if they lost electronic files. They did not think the building itself would be gone, according to Jim Simmons, chief executive at Sungard Availability Services. Sungard, in Wayne, Pa., runs six large recovery centers, and along with I.B.M. dominates the field of disaster recovery services.
Information without people is useless, Mr. Simmons said, and companies now understand that. They have set up toll-free numbers so employees can call for directions on where to go, and are thinking about relocating the work itself. 
All of this comes in handy when planning for transit strikes as well as terrorist attacks. During the New York City transit union negotiations recently, several companies called I.B.M.'s Sterling Forest center to make sure they could put their emergency plans into action if employees could not get around the city.
Industry experts say it is hard to estimate how many recovery sites exist. Most are in "major N.F.L. cities," Mr. Simmons said. That is where large businesses are. The trick is being close enough to the original office but far enough away to escape the same threat, be it a hurricane or a terrorist. Thus Sterling Forest's 45 miles from Manhattan.
Here, companies can pay anywhere from a few hundred dollars a month for a computer and desks so employees can continue working in a disaster to hundreds of thousands of dollars to have entire computer systems replicated in buildings adjacent to the 17,863-acre state park. 
The I.B.M. center, whose lounge offers a striking view, might appear to be a resort if it were not for the security cameras at almost every door and the heavy, dark suitcases filled with tapes of data that arrive under top security.
And I.B.M., with its need for privacy, actually fits in alongside the few homes here, whose driveways bear signs warning hikers, "Private. Please Do Not Enter."
Those who enter find themselves in a brave new world. "We can run a report at every door your employee was at," said Christine Piazza, an executive administrator at the site.
No one, it turns out, can just walk through a door here. Doors require codes on security keypads. Each time a new code is about to be entered, the keypad first scrambles the numbers so that the top line rarely reads 1-2-3; instead it might read 4-8-2. A bystander cannot simply memorize by position the numbers someone else entered on the pad.
For those who make it past the door, there is not much to see. On one recent visit, the scene featured just desk after desk with computers and keyboards and phones, and a few middle-aged men moving cassettes of data from one rack to another. Other middle-aged men sit at computers with green blinking text, beneath a strip of clocks telling the hour in four time zones, from New York to Seattle.
But the needs of the people from the 40-some companies who came here after Sept. 11 were not so high-tech, according to an I.B.M. marketing executive, Pat Corcoran.
"The No. 1 request of people when they came here was, 'I need to get on Internet and e-mail,' " he said. In some cases they also needed chiropractors. Stress levels were high, Ms. Piazza said, and some employees had their backs worked on in the lounge overlooking Blue Lake.
When people are not recovering from a disaster, they are here testing.
Either way, there is no telling who might show up. Ms. Piazza has seen people arrive with pets (she found a kennel nearby). There are also sofas for sleeping overnight (pillows and blankets included) and showers in the bathrooms.
Yet despite the new interest brought on by Sept. 11, the future might not be too bright for recovery sites like the one in Sterling Forest. More companies are building their own backup sites, Mr. Brady said. They may work in New York City, for instance, but have office space and data backup on Long Island. Others disperse workers, leaving 300 workers in Manhattan and taking the other 300 to Westchester or New Jersey.
The slumping economy has also hurt the market, Mr. Brady said. Some travel companies have said they want to set up recovery plans, he said, but instead they are using their scarce money hoping just to keep hotels open.
In that sense, a disaster recovery plan is still not viewed as a must-have by some companies, according to Andy Hagg, executive editor of Contingency, Planning and Management magazine.
And even though Sept. 11 brought new focus to disaster recovery, terrorist attacks have not been and are unlikely to become the leading reason for disaster recovery. Every year, Mr. Hagg said, his magazine surveys companies for the causes of their disasters. It used to be that companies would cite natural disasters like hurricanes, he said. But in the last five years, companies have begun referring more and more frequently to "human error" and to computer problems like viruses.
But Mr. Simmons said sometimes computers do not have anything to do with the red alerts that disaster recovery sites get.
"You'd be surprised how many of those are water sprinklers going off," Mr. Simmons said.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
Where The Tundra Is Always Frozen

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: GREEN BAY, Wis., Jan. 3 

 BODY:
It will not take the Atlanta Falcons long to realize the urgency of playoff football here on the frozen tundra. "Titletown" is painted on a hangar at the airport, Packers flags hang in the lobby and the gift shop offers all things cheese: cheese heads, cheese helmets, even cheese bras, all of which may appear as accessories at Saturday's first-round playoff game at Lambeau Field.
 "Ever see that guy at the games, St. Vincent?" asked Gary Stevens, a security official for the company that is remodeling Lambeau. "He wears a pope's hat with Vince Lombardi's picture on it. He's got a staff and the long robe in green and gold." 
 Janice Hylok has attended nearly every Packers home game since 1957, and will be at Saturday night's game, even if she has to miss a friend's anniversary party. During training camp each August, she puts up a holiday tree at home adorned with more than 100 green and gold ornaments. The tree stays up until after the Super Bowl. In the past, Hylok used a real tree, but it shed needles the way Paul Hornung once shed tacklers.
"Janice counts down the days to the Packers' preseason the way a lot of people count down the days to Christmas," a friend named Mark Hollister told The Green Bay Press-Gazette.
Even as the new sky-box reality is evident at renovated Lambeau Field, a small-town quaintness persists here alongside the wackiness, evoking a time when the economy of Ray Scott's voice -- "Starr . . . Dowler . . . touchdown" -- suggested that professional football was still more a game than a business. The Packers have won 12 National Football League titles, maintaining an intimacy and viability within a community of 102,000 whose fans serve as the team's stockholders.
The faithful are still stunned after the Packers lost, 42-17, last weekend to the Jets. "A high school team could have beaten them," Stacey Mosher said as he awaited lunch today at a sub shop. Home-field advantage throughout the National Football Conference playoffs has been lost to Philadelphia. Still, fans will pack Lambeau on Saturday night, assured in the knowledge that the Packers have never lost here in the postseason, and that the weather can be more blustery and chilling than a Lombardi tirade.
Winning isn't the only thing in January, snowing is. Saturday night's forecast calls for temperatures in the mid-20's with possible snow accumulation of one to three inches and a wind chill in the teens.
"Brett Favre weather," Stevens said in this morning's chill outside the stadium, his breath emerging white like steam from a smokestack. "It'll slow Vick down a little."
Packers fans know that Michael Vick, the Falcons' migratory quarterback, can run, but they wonder if he can skate. In the season opener here, Vick passed for 203 yards and a touchdown, and ran for 72 additional yards and another touchdown, as the Falcons extended the Packers into overtime before losing, 37-34.
That was September; this is January.
The Falcons are accustomed to playing in a dome, where the offense is as climate-controlled as orchids. This time of year, Green Bay more closely resembles "Holiday on Ice" in shoulder pads. The turf is more conducive to double axels than double reverses. If there is one visiting athlete who might be comfortable in these conditions, it is Brian Boitano.
"We're not playing in a dome down there or on a summer day up here," Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman said of Vick. "You'd think that maybe the turf wouldn't help him."
Vick said he played at Virginia Tech, where it snowed frequently. Dan Reeves, the Atlanta coach and aspiring meteorologist, said, "He's still going to be faster than most people, whatever track it is." 
Speaking of turf, it made front-page news today in the local paper. Lake Superior State University of Michigan has included "frozen tundra" on its 2003 List of Words Banished From the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness. On the 35th anniversary of the famed Ice Bowl, when Bart Starr sneaked into the end zone and Dallas defenders skidded along the goal line as if wearing blades instead of cleats, the term frozen tundra has been declared hopelessly redundant.
So what, the locals say. Jumbo shrimp is an awkward term and people still use it. The usage of frozen tundra is not likely to thaw any time soon, unlike the actual turf at Lambeau Field, which is kept from freezing by an underground heating system. 
According to the Packers, "frozen tundra" originated with N.F.L. Films and the voice-of-God portentousness of the announcer John Facenda. Chris Berman has imitated the phrase to great effect on ESPN in a tone that is both reverent and satirical. If the arbiters at Lake Superior State have declared that frozen tundra has jumped the shark, locals suggest, perhaps they have played in too many GE College Bowls without their helmets, or thinking caps.
Redundancy is not all bad, said Harvey Kaye, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. "I always figure people learn better when they hear it twice," he said.
Brian Sutton, an English professor at the university, recalled a student at Vince Lombardi Middle School saying before a Monday night game against Miami last November, "Dolphins usually eat fish; tonight, they're eating frozen tundra."
"It's a redundancy worth keeping," Sutton said. "When I moved here from Chattanooga, my friends said, 'You're going to the frozen tundra.' It gives us an identity. Without the Packers, we're Skokie, Illinois."

HEADLINE: Crisis in Korea Stirs Debate In a Borough In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: PALISADES PARK, N.J., Jan. 3 

 BODY:
They tape American flags to their front doors, sprinkle English words into their banter and turn emotional when speaking of their adopted homeland. But for many of the 36,000 Korean-Americans who have settled in and around this tidy, blue-collar borough, the growing crisis on the Korean peninsula is provoking anxiety, stirring passionate debate and straining allegiances as never before.
 Like their relatives and friends in South Korea, they worry about North Korea's nuclear aspirations, the prospect of war and the possibility that the current standoff, even if it remains a diplomatic one, will defer their dreams for a unified Korea. 
 "Every day there is no peace is another day that I will not get to see my mother," said Myung Sun Park, 68, a retired tailor who was separated from his family during the Korean War more than 50 years ago. "Seeing the news brings me so much heartache." 
But as they watch South Korea and the United States drift farther apart over policy toward the north, the accountants, greengrocers and beauticians who have prospered here are increasingly troubled by the anti-American tempest brewing in the streets of Seoul and by the words of the newly elected president, Roh Moo Hyun, who has questioned the White House's hard-nosed stance toward North Korea's authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Il.
Like many South Koreans who came of age during the cold war, Tim Lee, 45, thinks the demonstrations in Seoul, which have drawn thousands of youthful protesters, are misguided, even reckless. After all, he said, more than 54,000 Americans lost their lives defending the south, and since the war ended, 37,000 soldiers have been stationed there to discourage an invasion from the Communist north.
"I feel sad and ashamed," Mr. Lee said, sitting in the computer shop he owns on Broad Avenue, the bustling commercial spine of Palisades Park, where more than a third of the residents are Korean. "You sacrificed so much for us, and now you probably feel let down when they say, 'Yankee, go home.' "
Jee Jung, 30, a reporter at The Korean Times, a newspaper published in Queens, said many Korean-Americans were hypersensitive about the fraying relationship between Seoul and Washington, once among the world's most reliable alliances. With the news from Korea featuring daily protests and shop signs that say, "Americans Not Welcome Here," their fear, he said, is that they will be stigmatized here.
"The situation after Sept. 11, and the sentiment toward Muslims -- they don't want that to happen to them," said Mr. Jung, who does freelance reporting for The New York Times.
Jay Lee, 61, a real estate broker and American citizen who arrived here 30 years ago, said he feared the opposite: that he would no longer be welcome in the country of his birth, where much of his family still lives. "I hear it's dangerous now to carry an American passport over there or speak openly your pro-American opinions," he said, his voice hushed and his face etched with worry. "It can bring you personal danger, and that makes me sad."
Still, many of the two dozen people interviewed here acknowledged a measure of sympathy for the protesters, saying that their unhappiness over America's prolonged military presence and its tough words for North Korea could not be easily dismissed. They said that an armed conflict between the north and south would primarily affect Korean civilians.
"President Bush seems to think violence can solve any problem," said Helen Lee, 35, a pharmacist and a mother of two. "But if there is war, we will pay the price."
Such sentiments -- that the United States does not have Korea's best interests in mind -- are fueling much of the anger in South Korea. After decades of treating North Korea like a peril and a pariah, and using economic sanctions as a cudgel, South Korea now views dialogue and economic engagement as the best paths toward peace. South Koreans, not Americans, they say, should solve the problems in their own backyard. 
Long-simmering resentments boiled over last June after an American armored vehicle accidentally killed two Korean schoolgirls north of the capital. A United States military court later acquitted those involved in the incident, and a White House apology, read by the American ambassador, was widely viewed as insincere.
"America is very strong, so we wonder why President Bush would not himself apologize for what happened," said Yong Ja Lee, who was celebrating her 35th birthday with friends at the New Shin La Bakery. "That only makes America seem more arrogant and makes people angry."
The rift between the United States and South Korea widened further after President Bush made a speech last year grouping North Korea with Iraq and Iran in an "axis of evil." Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld heightened tensions by warning the north that the United States could wage two wars at once. His statement was in response to North Korea's announcement that it would restart a nuclear reactor that had been closed under an agreement with the Clinton administration.
But like many others here, Jae Ko, 32, a jeweler, said the current face-off was not as dangerous as the news media had made it out to be. After all, he added, the two nations have been officially at war since the 1950's. 
"At this point, I don't think North Korea is that stupid to start up a war," he said. "But if there is one, it will be because of the U.S."

HEADLINE: G.M. Lifts Market Share On Sales Burst In December 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 3 

 BODY:
General Motors, intent on increasing its market share for the second consecutive year, turned to a fire sale last month that lifted sales 36 percent and helped it accomplish its goal, according to figures released today.
 The back-to-back annual gain in market share was the first since 1976, but it was made possible by zero percent financing deals and reliance on less profitable sales to corporate and rental fleets. Now Wall Street and Detroit are wondering whether several years of outsize vehicle sales, propped up by increasingly large incentives from the Big Three, will make a feast or famine of 2003. Added to that is the uncertain economy and the potential for war in Iraq. 
 "I think the industry is on a terrible treadmill," said John Casesa, an analyst for Merrill Lynch, who expects industry sales to fall to 16.2 million cars and trucks this year from 16.8 million in 2002, which was the fourth-best year on record for United States sales. 
"They used big discounts in December, and now they have to deal with the aftermath in January," Mr. Casesa added.
G.M.'s share of the United States market, as high as 60 percent in the early 1960's, stands at 28.7 percent. For the industry, G.M.'s big month led to the best December on record and a 14.4 percent increase compared with the month a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a company in Southfield, Mich., that tracks auto sales. 
For December, Ford posted a gain of 8.2 percent and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler reported a 1 percent increase, but it was G.M. that had the blowout month.
"G.M. had an excellent year in 2002 on all fronts," John Smith, group vice president for North American vehicle sales, said in a statement.
Mack McPherson, sales manager at Burt Chevrolet in Englewood, Colo., a suburb of Denver, said his dealership sold 246 new Chevy cars and trucks last month, compared with fewer than 200 in October and November. It was propelled by huge sales for the Suburban and Tahoe sport utility vehicles.
"They put zero percent on those two vehicles around the 18th or 20th, and they took off," he said. "People just went crazy."
"Getting all those commercials, and zero percent, and the cash back, that drives the market," he said. "As soon as people hear that, they say, 'Honey, it's time to go buy a car.' "
Suburbans, Tahoes and other light trucks -- a government classification that includes sport utility vehicles, trucks and minivans -- outsold passenger cars for the second consecutive year. 
In 1980, only about a fifth of sales came from light trucks. The growth of light trucks, particularly S.U.V.'s, has increased the gas consumption of the average automobile despite advances in technology and has led environmentalists into an increasingly adversarial relationship with Detroit over issues like emissions of greenhouse gases and smog-forming pollutants. 
It has also had considerable safety implications; light trucks have a higher death rate for their own occupants because of their tendency to roll over, and they pose increased dangers when they collide with passenger cars. 
But light trucks are Detroit's chief profit center at a time of only modest profitability and fierce competition from abroad. 
Of particular concern for analysts is the disparity in what the Big Three and foreign automakers spend on incentives. G.M. spent $2,431 a vehicle for the year through November, and that almost certainly rose in December. By comparison, Toyota spends $526 a vehicle on incentives, according to the Autodata Corporation. G.M. announced an extensive new round of incentive offers today, including many five-year, zero percent offers and financing as low as 1.9 percent on six-year deals. 
"Ultimately, this is just kind of more of the same," said Rod Lache, an analyst for Deutsche Bank. "The auto industry lowers prices and the market responds, but I don't think this is a good thing for automakers. These guys are going for volume instead of profitability, and that's not constructive for the industry."
Jim O'Connor, the head of the Ford division of Ford Motor, said: "Affordability has been very favorable for consumers, and I think it will continue to drive retail sales. Some people might be skittish about some uncertainties, perhaps in the Mideast, but you certainly can't prove it when you look at vehicle sales."
Ford also spent heavily on incentives last month, though Mr. O'Connor said the company spent about 25 percent less than G.M. Officials at Chrysler said they also decided not to match G.M.'s incentives.
"The industry went in to kind of an incentive spending spree during the month of December," said Gary E. Dilts, Chrysler's senior vice president for sales. "We elected not to participate at the highest level of that spending spree. That's bad news if you're counting the sales tickets in the month of December, it's good news if you're managing the profitability of the Chrysler Group."
Diane Swonk, an economist at Bank One, said the big month "shows what we knew all along, that the consumer that everyone thought couldn't hold it up was an Atlas and shouldered the burden of the economy." Ms. Swonk took advantage of the deals and traded in her Saturn for a CTS, the flashy, sharp-edged new sedan from Cadillac. She says she thinks sales will fall to about 15.8 million cars and trucks this year.
"There's got to be some givebacks, but that's what we all said last year," she added.
She says she does believe, though, that earnings can hold up because of productivity gains.
Mr. Casesa is less optimistic. He predicts G.M.'s earnings will fall to $3 a share this year from a projected $6.67 a share last year and that Ford's earnings will decline to 30 cents a share this year from an estimated 45 cents last year.
David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, said G.M. "did achieve their goal of two years in a row of higher market share; on the other hand I think they pulled in some of their January volume into December and as a result January sales could be kind of sick."
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief industry sales analyst, said, "We do believe there is a bit of payback as we've stressed previously though we don't want to overstate that."
Over all, sales in 2002 fell 2 percent from 2001, which was the second-best year, with 17.2 million vehicles sold. Several foreign automakers had their best years ever, including BMW, with sales up 20 percent; Honda, which posted a 3.3 percent rise; and Toyota, whose sales were up 1 percent. By comparison, G.M.'s sales fell about 1 percent, while Ford's dropped 8.8 percent and Chrysler's declined 3 percent.

HEADLINE: A Bored Shopper's Lament: Seen a Store,Seen Them All 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
America's stores are caught in an identity crisis. 
 Shoppers are bored, complaining that they cannot tell one pair of khakis or ribbed turtleneck or Fair Isle sweater from another. And even worse, they cannot tell one store from another. 
 Many pollsters and analysts blame the recent holiday retailing debacle -- one of the most disappointing seasons in at least 10 years -- on the inability of merchants to set themselves apart from their competition and generate enough excitement to make customers leave their houses and spend. 
"More than ever before, a store must attract a group of core customers," said Robert F. Buchanan, the chief retail analyst for A. G. Edwards. "They need loyal shoppers who will return, again and again, through higher prices and low, to keep the registers ringing." 
Once, shoppers say, stores had distinct personalities. Lord & Taylor's catered to Greenwich, Conn., matrons; Bloomingdale's to jet-setters; Eddie Bauer was big with the wood-smoke-and-golden-retrievers crowd; and the Gap specialized in putting baby boomers in khakis and T-shirts. 
"Now they say they don't know what they're going to find where," said Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, which tracks consumer preferences. "Seventy-four percent of consumers interviewed over the past two years -- more than a half-million of them -- say all stores look alike within their category." 
Marvin Traub, the former chairman of Bloomingdale's, blames the sameness at stores, particularly department stores, on "pressure on the bottom line." The desperation to show profits "pushed the stores into a less innovative dependence on the same suppliers," Mr. Traub said. "This took the edge off the creativity and excitement of fashion." 
A look at efforts by five big chains -- Lord & Taylor, the Limited, Kohl's, Target and Neiman Marcus -- to hang onto core customers in a weak shopping environment underscores how crucial a clear identify is turning out to be.

Lord & Taylor
Lord & Taylor was once the symbol of what analysts call "the carriage trade" -- middle-aged and older matrons, wearing fitted tweed suits with patent leather pumps. But the store lost its way more than a decade ago by trying to captivate the teenage crowd with noisy displays. 
Now, under Jane Elfers, a relatively new, down-to-earth chief executive, Lord & Taylor is trying to recapture old customers while pulling in some new shoppers aged 30 to 44.
"When I arrived in June 2000, I determined to bring back Lord & Taylor's specialty store roots," Ms. Elfers said this week. "During the 1990's, it had become a department store; it had lost its cachet and was selling a lot of the same brands as at the malls. We were trying to compete on price, and it wasn't a winning strategy for us."
The new team waded in, refining the merchandise and cleaning up the clutter in all 86 stores. Analysts say the team has moved accessories to the front doors, to broaden the merchandise, "to show they're not just about frumpy dresses and Grandma's clothes," said Marshal Cohen, research director of NPD Fashionworld, a market survey company.
Ms. Elfers set up the first internal design team, and directed the manufacture of a handful of private label styles, with younger-sounding names: Kate Hill, Metropolitan and -- guess what -- Identity. 
The store has also stopped trying to capture teenagers: "That's really not our DNA," she said. The core customer, Ms. Elfers says, "is jealously guarded," with more traditional skirts and dresses. She said she was looking forward to 2003, which has already been christened "the year of the dress." 
Analysts are less sanguine about Lord & Taylor's prospects. Although the stores look elegant with their pink marble floors and crystal table lamps on the counters, Lord & Taylor is still perceived as a troubled moderate-price department store. 
"They're still alienating their core customers," Mr. Buchanan of A. G. Edwards said. "When I walk into one of their stores, I still don't see the jacket women want to wear to work. Where are the clothes for the woman who is 5 foot 4 and 140 pounds?" While he said the store's sales figures were improving, Lord & Taylor is "still significantly negative," the analyst said.
At May Department Stores, which owns Lord & Taylor, same-store sales declined 5.8 percent in November (the company does not break out separate figures for its 11 store chains). Elaine Francolino, a vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors' Service, said Moody's credit rating for May was high, but the outlook was negative. "We believe their margin and operating may not return to levels of the past because of increased competition," she said, citing Kohl's and other moderate-price stores.

The Limited
Things have been rocky at the Limited, and its sister, the Express chain, for some time, largely because of the classic identity problem: the store lost its fashion sense by worrying about the bottom line -- and going to a more generic look.
"Their iconic items like the Firenze sweaters have disappeared from their assortments -- they don't have a single key item," said Richard Jaffe, a retail analyst with UBS Warburg. "They were known for a single look for each season." 
On the day before New Year's, customers standing in line at a Limited store in the King of Prussia, Pa., mall agreed that something had gone wrong a couple of years ago -- but they said that the store was finding itself again.
"They went down because they became too businesslike," said Rini Sen, 22, a student at the University of Maryland. Now, Ms. Sen says, the Limited is coming back to recognizing what its core shoppers want: lighthearted, dressy separates. 
"See this top?" she said, holding up a black stretch one-shoulder top with a ruffle. "This is what I'm buying." 
The analysts agree that the Limited may be discovering its fashion recipe. "They are succeeding in defining a target customer and appealing to her," Mr. Buchanan said.
Mr. Jaffee said the Limited has "improved its offerings significantly in the last year, to include more unique fashions." 
Nevertheless, on Friday, Lazard lowered its December same-store estimate from plus 2 to negative one-half for Limited Brands, which owns the Limited and Express. In offering this assessment, Todd Slater, an analyst, wrote that gift card sales -- which register when the cards are cashed in, not when they are purchased -- may lift sales in January and February. Mr. Buchanan of A. G. Edwards predicted that Limited's earnings would rise in the spring, because of its more pulled-together fashions.

Kohl's
Since Kohl's went public a decade ago, expanding from 76 stores to 457, shoppers have warmed to its seemingly ideal formula, which combined a specialty store environment -- wooden shelves and attractive wall dividers -- with a down-and-direct price-cutting strategy. Customers say they love the $30 Nikes, and the two-for-$9 (on sale) cotton towels. By having lots of stock on a few models in each brand, the store satisfied picky bargain-hunting customers used to stores like T.J. Maxx, which have good brands and great prices but maybe only one pair of Levi's -- in size 3.
But to a few analysts, Kohl's strategy now may not be quite so perfect. Several wonder if it will lose its niche as it is squeezed above and below. The rapidly expanding chain is being nibbled on the bottom by Wal-Mart and Target, chains featuring much better apparel than discount stores ever had before -- and down from the top by traditional department stores like Lord & Taylor and Nordstrom, which are marking goods down even below Kohl's prices. In November, Kohl's same-store sales were down 3.4 percent from the year earlier. 
A spokeswoman said that Kohl's had carefully defined its core customer, and was sticking to its goal of high quality at moderate prices.
Larry Montgomery, the chain's chief executive, has announced that the company will continue to expand: in the coming year, it plans to open 80 stores, including 40 in the Southwest; its first store in Southern California is to open in the spring and be followed by an entry into Las Vegas in the fall. 
Ms. Francolino of Moody's remains optimistic. "Based on what customers want, Kohl's has been very successful," she said. "Maybe they had one or two months where same-store sales declined, but Kohl's has a business model that we believe will continue to be successful."

Target
For several years, Target had the hippest advertising campaign in the industry, which, month after month, drove customers into its stores. But now, while the company has kept the campaign, some analysts say that the stores do not really look all that different from Kmarts. 
A recent visit to the Target in Queens confirmed what analysts have been saying for the last few months: both the store layout and its employees seemed confused. It was impossible to find the Michael Graves whistling tea kettles that Target made famous, although there was a display of other, cheaper models.
Disgruntled shoppers say they have not been able to find a lot of the more chic advertised offerings -- including the new Philippe Starck take on Tupperware.
Target did not comment on its recent performance. But the chain, analysts say, risks alienating some of its core customers -- the would-be fashionistas who want to grab a stylish look for a cheap price -- unless it makes the company look as chic as the ads.
While they praise Target's increasingly fashionable clothes by Mossimo and Merona, some analysts worry about Target's recent entry into the food business. "Their strategy is questionable," Mr. Buchanan said. 
Mr. Slater still champions Target for its upscale merchandise assortment, including a separate Sony line of consumer electronics -- CD players and DVD machines -- made just for Target. The children's furniture competes with Pottery Barn, he said, for a lot less money. 
"Naturally, the apparel doesn't compete with Bergdorf Goodman," he said. "After all, it's a discounter."

Neiman Marcus
Many analysts say that these stores have done the best job of keeping core customers. Unlike many other stores, which fell over backward trying to be hip or cheap, or both, Neiman kept its luxury shopper. Even so, the economy is bound to affect the stores. After all, with stockbroker bonuses down and the bankers running for cover, won't the number of women who can afford a $595 pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes be cut down?
Perhaps not. Neiman Marcus's same-store sales for November were up 5.8 percent -- a rarity in an ocean of negative numbers -- and executives boasted that their stores had fewer marked-down goods than other stores. According to Ms. Francolino of Moody's, Neiman has "targeted the right customer niche." Yet Neiman's credit rating is lower than both Target and Kohl's -- largely because its success is limited to 32 stores. 
"Neiman's is not a large operation," Ms. Francolinosaid. "They can't roll out 100 stores, because the store must keep its cachet. Its potential for growth is a lot more limited than some, because of those upscale shoppers." She paused. "They've got a terrific customer base."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
New Seoul Leader to Press U.S. and North to Yield a Bit

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE with ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: SEOUL, Jan. 3 

 BODY:
South Korea's president-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, a former labor negotiator, is preparing a compromise proposal that would require both North Korea and the United States to accept concessions to resolve the standoff over the Communist state's nuclear program, an aide said today.
 Mr. Roh hopes to resolve the dispute before he takes office Feb. 25, Lim Chae Jung, head of the presidential transition team, said on SBS-TV, one of the main television channels. The Yonhap news agency reported that one proposal under study would require North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a written guarantee of security from the United States. 
 In Beijing today, North Korea's Ambassador to China, Choe Jin Su, called on Washington to reopen talks. "The U.S. should respect the international community and respond to dialogue without any preconditions," Mr. Choe told reporters today, adding that his country was "compelled" to restart its nuclear program and to expel inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. He said Pyongyang would resume negotiations on the nuclear issue if Washington would guarantee North Korea's security. 
In response to the ambassador's remarks, the Bush administration repeated today its precondition for talks: that North Korea stop its two programs to build nuclear bombs.
"The issue is not nonaggression," the State Department's spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said in Washington today. "The issue is whether North Korea will verifiably dismantle this nuclear enrichment program."
"We have no intention to sit down and bargain again, to pay for this horse again," Mr. Boucher said, referring to North Korea's decision last month to walk away from a 1994 agreement that provided North Korea with two light-water reactors and a supply of free fuel oil in exchange for closing a reactor that could produce weapons-grade plutonium. "We are not entering into a negotiation," he said, "in order to get them to commit to something that they've already committed to." 
In a similar news conference in Moscow this week, North Korea's ambassador to Russia suggested that North Korea would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
"The North Koreans have used their ambassadors to float trial balloons in the past," said Scott Snyder, Korea representative of The Asia Foundation, a research group partly financed by the United States government. He cited a similar pattern of news conferences held to stage-manage the crisis over North Korea's nuclear program in 1993-94. 
Referring to the North's latest offer, he added: "It's a non-starter. Now that there is a clear condition for dialogue, it is easy to call for unconditional dialogue."
But offering clues to the new policy of South Korea's future president, a top aide to Mr. Roh said tonight that dialogue was the only way out of Korea's nuclear standoff. 
"The new government calls for dialogue, and President Bush just mentioned two days ago that North Korea's program could be resolved through diplomacy," Ben Q. Limb, press adviser to the president- elect, said in respnse to the news that the North Korean ambassador had called for dialogue. "Now, can there be diplomacy without dialogue?" 
In fact, North Korea's nuclear brinkmanship is provoking intense rounds of discussion, but not of the kind that it is expected to like.
Today, John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control and international security, left on a weeklong trip to Asia. On Monday and Tuesday, the United States, South Korea and Japan will coordinate strategy in Washington. With a common policy in hand, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, James A. Kelly, then plans to tour capitals in the region.
Separately, a South Korean envoy, the vice foreign minister, Kim Han Kyung, met with Chinese officials on Thursday, and flew from Beijing to Moscow today.
With an eye to this intense diplomatic activity, North Korea's ambassador to Beijing said other countries should urge Washington to talk with North Korea to conclude a nonaggression treaty.
"If other countries are concerned about nuclear security on the Korean Peninsula, they should urge the United States to assure us of security, and if they can't do that, they should be quiet," he said. "The Bush administration has been saying the whole time it has no intention of invading our country. We can't believe that. Who can believe these words?"
For his part, President Bush had some strong words this week for Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader. Mr. Bush said he had "no heart for somebody who starves his folks." 
North Korea, long isolated internationally, is now more isolated than ever. Russia and China, its historic allies, now have thriving and profitable ties with the booming economy of the South.
Eyeing the possibility that huge amounts of South Korean freight traffic could travel along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, Russia has devoted much diplomatic energy to encouraging North Korea to allow trains to cross the Demilitarized Zone separating the North from the South. After months of land-mine removal and construction work, test trains are expected to cross the heavily fortified border this month.
China, which keeps friendly relations with both Seoul and Pyongyang, sends aid to the North while strengthening trade and investment ties with South Korea. 
Meanwhile, North Korea's brief fall honeymoon with Japan now seems long over. Today, Pyongyang concentrated its fire on Japan, the nation in the region that has proved to be most sympathetic to Washington's hard line on the nuclear program. Calling Japan's stance a "suicidal act," said the official daily, Rodong Sinmum. "It is like poking one's eyes with one's own hands."

HEADLINE: Surgeons Explain Reasons for Their Walkout 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WEIRTON, W. Va., Jan. 3 

 BODY:
An ambulance with lights flashing and siren screaming wheeled into the Weirton Medical Center here on Thursday afternoon, carrying a 30-year-old steelworker writhing in pain.
 Dr. Mitch Fuscardo, director of the emergency room, quickly determined that the man had a kidney stone blockage and that a surgeon was needed to remove the stone. 
 But there was no one to do the work. Half the hospital's 20 full-time surgeons had taken themselves off the duty roster at midnight on New Year's Eve to protest the high cost of medical malpractice insurance in West Virginia. Technically, they have taken leaves of absence. 
Surgeons at three hospitals in Wheeling, about 25 miles to the south, also stopped routine work. Today, doctors here said that colleagues in two or three other towns might soon join in.
So far only surgeons are involved. Their work is regarded as among the riskiest in medicine, and they pay the highest insurance premiums, as much as $150,000 a year. 
"I'm doing this because I want to stay in West Virginia," Dr. Charles P. Capito said. "It's gotten to the point where you can't afford malpractice insurance in this state. We've been begging the Legislature to do something for years."
Dr. Capito said his insurance bill this year was $54,000, up from $42,000 last year and $30,000 the year before.
"I feel tremendous support for the physicians who have walked out," said Dr. Joe Endrich, an internist and the chairman of the board of the Weirton Medical Center. "But I can't call my practice elective. I'd consider myself abandoning my patients if I was not available to them."
The protest, which the surgeons are unwilling to call a strike, is only the latest sign of a backlash around the country against the rising cost of malpractice insurance. 
The problem has been building for several years and has been most severe in West Virginia, Florida, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Both as a result of increasingly large jury awards and settlements and because of bad business decisions and the slump in the stock markets, medical malpractice insurers have been unable to turn a profit. 
Several companies have collapsed and several have stopped selling this type of insurance. Companies still in the business have been sharply raising prices and offering coverage only to the doctors they think are least likely to be sued. As a result, some doctors have seen their premiums double or triple; some have been able to buy coverage only through special state programs.
In some states doctors are retiring early or avoiding risky procedures to lower their premiums. In the last year, more than 100 West Virginia doctors have moved to other states where insurance rates are considered more tolerable.
Doctors in this old steel town in the hilly sliver of West Virginia that is wedged between Pennsylvania and Ohio said they would jump in were they needed to save a life. But for other situations that may be merely painful, like the steelworker's kidney stones, or inconvenient, like a delay of a hernia operation, they are keeping hands off.
People in this hardscrabble region can sympathize. But even strong union members like Robert Eltringham, a retired sheet metal worker, have been taken aback that such a drastic step was taken.
"It's a little disheartening that they would walk out like this," Mr. Eltringham said. "People depend on the doctors."
Yet Erma Rangos, who owns a women's clothing store, said, "They need to do something," adding, "Maybe it will benefit us all."
When Dr. Fuscardo tried to help the steelworker in the emergency room, all he could do was order some tests, administer pain medicine and try to find a surgeon in Pennsylvania or Ohio who would take the case. He ended up sending the patient to the Trinity Medical Center West in Steubenville, Ohio, a 15-minute ambulance trip across the Ohio River.
Other doctors transferred another man with a kidney stone blockage to Trinity West on New Year's Day. The same day, a 91-year-old woman who broke an arm in a fall was also sent there.
There have been no life-threatening situations yet, but Dr. Endrich said that in just three days there had been "tremendous disruption" for patients. He said that the dozen or so family doctors and internists in Weirton, a blue-collar town of about 25,000 people, regularly send patients for surgical evaluations to the medical center. But now, he said, patients were being sent to hospitals in Pittsburgh, about 40 miles to the east. "I've sent at least 20 patients to Pittsburgh myself in these last few days," he said.
As the number of medical malpractice lawsuits has risen in the state, several insurers have left West Virginia, saying they cannot make a profit even with increased premiums. In 2001, Gov. Bob Wise pushed through a program in which the state provides coverage to many doctors. But premiums remain high.
The doctors want a reduction in their overall insurance costs; a ceiling of $250,000 imposed on claims of pain and suffering; and help in getting higher payments for their work from health insurers. 
The doctors here said they watched colleagues in Nevada and Mississippi get the attention of state officials by staging protests. They said that after talking with aides to Governor Wise for weeks, they decided they should take a stand, too. 
"The physicians have been screaming for years about the malpractice problem and they feel it has been falling on deaf ears," said Don Muhlenthaler, the chief executive of the medical center. 
The doctors here were encouraged by the success of colleagues in Pennsylvania who threatened to stop working on New Year's Day. In Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell, the incoming governor, got the doctors to stay on the job by vowing to urge the legislature to cut insurance costs for surgeons in the riskiest fields significantly and to push for new procedures to reduce frivolous lawsuits against doctors and hospitals.
So far in West Virginia, Governor Wise has been unable to mollify the doctors. At a meeting with three surgeons from Wheeling Thursday evening at the State House in Charleston, Governor Wise spoke of "sweeping plans" for limitations on lawsuits and "also promised to address our economic problems," said one of the surgeons, Dr. Gregory Saracco.
But Dr. Saracco, a general surgeon, said that the governor refused to provide any details, saying he would do so in his annual address to the state legislature on Wednesday.
Dr. Saracco said Mr. Wise urged him and his colleagues to abandon their protest. "I tend to feel I should be able to trust the governor," Dr. Saracco said. But he said he had not decided whether to resume work. 
Here in Weirton, Dr. Capito, an orthopedic surgeon, said he would continue protesting at least until the governor's address. "We'll see what he says then," Dr. Capito said.

BYLINE:  By Wayne Arnold (NYT)

 BODY:
 Demand for electronics from within Asia appears to be keeping the region's export engines turning even as the crucial United States market slows. 
Malaysia and the Philippines both reported strong export growth for November, thanks largely to higher electronics shipments to Japan, China and elsewhere in Asia. Compared with the month before, Malaysian exports in November slowed, but they were still up about 10 percent, but in the Philippines, export growth accelerated to 18 percent. Exports to the United States , however, showed a decline in both countries. Wayne Arnold (NYT)

HEADLINE: United to Lay Off 1,500 More Employees 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
United Airlines said yesterday that it would lay off nearly 1,500 management and salaried employees by Jan. 19.
 That is a 14 percent reduction in its management and salaried work force, and a 1.9 percent decline from its total work force of 80,000. 
 United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, has been struggling to restructure its business since filing for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 9. It has to meet certain monthly cash flow expectations set forth by its four lenders so that it can obtain access to $700 million of loans. United said yesterday that the layoffs would help it achieve the cost cuts needed to reach those cash flow goals. 
The airline also said it would close its remaining 32 city ticket offices by Jan. 28, resulting in the layoffs of 188 more workers.
Dan Walsh, United's vice president for sales, said in a statement that United customers were increasingly buying tickets online or through a reservations hot line. This made the city ticket offices unnecessary, he said.
United has not decided who among its management and salaried employees will be laid off. It said it would send notices to the affected workers as soon as those decisions were made.
"These changes are part of the process of creating a new business that is competitive, customer-focused and sustainable," Sara Fields, United's senior vice president in charge of people, said in a statement.
Last week, United put a message on its employee hot line saying that "significant layoffs are likely in the short run." The company said that it had recorded that message because a federal law required it to give advance warning if there were big layoffs or plant closings in the near future.
Since Sept. 11, 2001, United has laid off more than 20,000 workers, or a fifth of its work force.
Unionized employees have long complained that United has too many managers on its payroll and that the airline could make its operations more efficient by laying off some of those workers. The airline is also in negotiations with its unions for short-term and long-term concessions. It is seeking interim cuts of $70 million a month from its unions and long-term cuts of $2.4 billion a year through 2008.
In a previously announced cutback, United will end service at two airports in South America and one in Germany on Tuesday, resulting in the layoffs of 183 workers. On the same day, United will also switch to regional jets instead of large planes to serve five relatively small cities in the United States, resulting in the layoffs of 150 workers. And today, United will close its reservations offices in San Francisco; Long Beach, Calif., and Indianapolis, resulting in the layoffs of 686 employees.

Ex-Merrill Analyst Notified Of Probable Fraud Lawsuit
Securities regulators have advised Henry Blodget, the former Internet stock analyst at Merrill Lynch, that he will probably be sued for fraud and other securities violations, according to someone involved in the investigation and a lawyer who has been briefed on it.
 The NASD, the largest securities regulator, objects to Mr. Blodget's public support of companies that he was deriding in e-mail messages to Merrill associates, these people say. In addition, it will argue that his research reports were inappropriately influenced by Merrill's investment bankers. Page A1.

HEADLINE: BUSH TO PROPOSE COUPLING TAX CUTS WITH AID TO STATES 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush could propose as much as $600 billion in tax cuts and new spending measures over the next 10 years, an economic stimulus package nearly twice as big as even Republican lawmakers had been expecting, administration officials said today.
 White House officials said the package, which Mr. Bush plans to outline on Tuesday in Chicago, was likely to include billions of dollars for state governments wrestling with huge budget shortfalls. 
 Officials would not provide details of the spending proposals, although they are certain to include extension of unemployment benefits. They could also include assistance for state Medicaid programs and money for improving domestic security. 
Mr. Bush may also propose tax cuts that are deeper than administration officials have been describing. One official said Mr. Bush would call for speeding up rate reductions for taxpayers at all income levels, rebutting speculation that he might slow down on reductions for people in the top tax bracket.
Mr. Bush may also push for an even bigger cut in dividend taxes than the 50 percent reduction administration officials were considering in late December.
The latest plans suggest that Mr. Bush is girding for a partisan battle with Democratic leaders in Congress, who accused him today of pursuing a misguided plan that would favor the rich and do little to help the sluggish economy.
Firing a shot even before Mr. Bush formally outlines his tax package next week, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, said the president's plan would be "the wrong idea at the wrong time to help the wrong people." 
Democratic lawmakers are pushing for tax breaks intended for lower- and middle-income families, with some proposing a temporary "holiday" from payroll taxes for Social Security and others proposing one-time rebates.
White House officials declined to say how big Mr. Bush's final tax proposal would be, but they suggested that the plan was, if anything, more aggressive than previously reported when it came to tax cuts for investors and people in the highest tax brackets.
Even a 50 percent reduction in dividend taxes would total about $150 billion over 10 years and would probably be the centerpiece of his tax plan. Under such a plan, the tax benefits flow almost exclusively to the very wealthiest taxpayers because they are the ones who receive most dividends.
Calculations by the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research group run by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, show that about 64 percent of the benefits will go to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers.
Administration officials acknowledge that wealthy taxpayers will be the primary beneficiaries, but they argue that reducing dividend taxes will reduce distortions in the current tax system and lift the stock market.
White House officials said Mr. Bush was also likely to propose speeding up previously scheduled rate reductions for all classes of taxpayers.
"Congress has already concluded that tax relief is necessary and has enacted it into law," said one official, alluding to income tax reductions scheduled to take effect in 2004 and 2006. "The president doesn't see any need to distinguish between groups."
Today, one day after Mr. Bush announced he would detail his plan next Tuesday, Democrats began pre-emptive attacks that concentrated heavily on what they said was the unfairness of the plan for middle-income and poorer families.
"The president's plan won't help middle-income families, it won't contribute to economic growth, it won't make our homeland more secure," said Mr. Daschle, in the text of a radio address to be delivered on Saturday.
Citing calculations by the Tax Policy Center, Mr. Daschle said that a person making more than $1 million a year would save $24,000 in taxes under Mr. Bush's plan while a person earning from $40,000 to $50,000 a year would save only $76.
Mr. Bush has already denounced such criticisms as "class warfare," though White House officials are sensitive about the issue. 
Democratic lawmakers are not the only critics. Many economists and business analysts, even those who favor the tax cuts in theory, said today that Mr. Bush's core idea of slashing dividend taxes would do little to increase economic growth or job creation.
"If you are looking for short-term stimulative effect, you don't find it there," said Hank Gutman, head of the federal tax policy practice at KMPG, the accounting firm. "All it means is that people are going to be trading their stocks more. They won't necessarily be investing any more, and companies won't have any more money to spend."
William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said many of the tax cuts would not even been felt until 2004, too late to provide a quick boost this year to an economy plagued by uncertainty.
"The total amount of the stimulus isn't going to be very big in 2003," Mr. Dudley said.
He added that he was assuming the tax cuts would be front-loaded to provide as much as $150 billion in relief in the first two years, but he said the actual benefits this year were likely to run from $25 billion to $50 billion, a relatively small sum in a $10 trillion economy.
White House officials insist that their plans can have a big impact and predict that the dividend tax cut will lift stock prices, improve business confidence and reduce corporations' costs of raising money.
But they acknowledge they are not greatly interested in short-term economic stimulus and disparage the idea of trying to fine-tune the economy. The real issue, they say, is improving the basis for long-term growth.
"The concern here is not over the next couple of quarters," one senior White House official said. "The concern is making sure we have the right flexibility in place to ensure the economy can grow at its full potential."
Many analysts, including those who support the Bush administration's ideas, see the tax package primarily as an effort to advance a broader philosophical agenda of overhauling the entire tax system.
Republican analysts have long argued that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation of corporate profits -- once at the corporate level and once as income to shareholders. 
The current system encourages companies to run up big debt, they argue, because interest payments are tax deductible and dividends are not. And it discourages companies from paying out dividends.
"For political reasons, they think calling it stimulus is going to resonate better than fundamental tax reform," said Joel E. Slemrod, a tax economist at the University of Michigan who supports dividend tax cuts.
Mr. Bush has been huddling with economic advisers for days at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. But Republican lawmakers and many business lobbyists say they still have little sense of many important details in the new tax proposal.
Many believe that Mr. Bush will include several measures intended for middle-income families, like a faster increase in the child-care tax credit to $1,000 from $600 and more rapid relief of the so-called marriage penalty that pushes many two-income couples into higher tax brackets.
White House officials are not interested in a reduction in the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Some Democrats have argued that a holiday on payroll taxes would provide the most direct stimulus.
But Mr. Bush does plan to push for a new extension of federal unemployment benefits. The previous law expired on Dec. 28, cutting off benefits for about 750,000 people whose state-financed unemployment benefits had already run out.

HEADLINE: Gunfire Kills 2 in Venezuela as March Turns Into Street Fight 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 3 

 BODY:
At least two people were shot to death today and dozens of others were wounded in clashes between opponents of President Hugo Chavez and pro-government groups, as a peaceful protest involving thousands deteriorated into a huge street fight.
 It is unclear who fired the shots. 
 The Caracas fire chief, Rodolfo Briseno, said on television that two men had died of gunshot wounds. 
Hospital officials reported at least a dozen people wounded by stones and rubber bullets, and soldiers fired dozens of tear gas shells to disperse the crowds. The disturbances lasted until sunset. 
The violence marked an escalation of tensions that have roiled this country since the start 33 days ago of a national strike aimed at forcing Mr. Chavez from power. Many people at the scene expressed concern that with no end in sight to Venezuela's latest political storm, the atmosphere would only get worse.
"This country is like a time bomb," said Antonio Melchor, his clothes drenched in sweat and his eyes bloodshot from the tear gas. "Instead of elections, it seems the president wants civil war."
The strike has shut down most major industry, including crucial oil production, generating serious shortages of gasoline and cooking fuel.
As part of his effort to break the strike, Mr. Chavez has had talks with officials from Algeria about the possibility of importing oil workers, and is reportedly exploring similar options with India and the Philippines.
He said today that he expected a team of Algerians to arrive soon. He described them as "tanker crews, some experts in energy matters, refining, production, and especially systems analysts."
In Washington, the State Department reacted negatively to an effort by Mr. Chavez to form a coalition of heads of state, called "Friends of Venezuela," to help negotiate a settlement to the crisis. He talked about forming such a group during a recent visit to Brazil. 
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, instead expressed American support for talks currently mediated by the Organization of American States.
The violence here today began when tens of thousands of protesters approached a bridge leading to the main military base at Fort Tiuna, witnesses said. Protesters urging the military to join them also sought the release of a dissident general detained last week by the government. 
Chavez supporters, shouting that they had come to defend the army, intercepted the marchers. Beneath the bridge, members of other pro-government groups, their faces covered by masks, began to throw stones and bottles. 
Almost every day since the strike began, opponents of the president have held marches and rallies, at times with as many as half a million people, to press him to resign and hold new elections. The protesters say Mr. Chavez, who proclaims himself a champion of the poor, is seeking to impose a Cuban-style government. Meanwhile, the country is convulsed by its deepest recession in more than a decade.
Labeling protesters terrorists and coup plotters, the president has ignored calls to resign. He has further inflamed opponents by threatening to prosecute their leaders and by playing down the strike's impact. 
But the violent scenes broadcast live on all major Venezuelan networks today only emphasized the depth of the turmoil. 
Pro-government groups stood at one side of the bridge. Some began to set fire to the fields of shrubs beneath the bridge and throw stones.
On the other side, some opposition protesters, who had come armed only with flags and whistles, also began throwing stones.

 CAPTIVES
By Linda Colley.
Illustrated. 438 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $27.50.
 THE most powerful empire ever seen extends its influence throughout the planet. Its navy is the world's largest. A key battleground is Afghanistan. And yet in other far corners of the earth, terrorists, some virtually stateless, attack the citizens of this empire at will, killing them or holding them hostage. Many victims are civilians. Some of the most daring terrorist raids take place on the empire's own home soil. 
The empire Linda Colley describes in her engaging, gracefully written but somewhat unsatisfying new book, "Captives," is not our own. It is Britain's, between 1600 and 1850. During that time British military and sea power gradually spread around the world. But the very size of Britain's merchant fleet made it vulnerable to attacks from privateers. One particularly aggressive group, the Barbary corsairs of the North African coast, repeatedly sailed into British and Irish port towns in the 1630's to seize hostages who could later be ransomed. 
Colley, the Leverhulme research professor at the London School of Economics, is best known for her 1992 study, "Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837," an account of how a powerful modern state emerged from the combustible, fractious mix of English, Scottish and Welsh identities; Jacobite rebellion at home; and revolutionary and Napoleonic threats from abroad. It has quickly and deservedly become the standard history of Britain in that period. Her new book, however, is more like a traditional monograph, for Colley restricts her focus to the intensive study of one small body of literature. Under her microscope are the stories of Britons venturing abroad in three areas -- North Africa, North America and India -- who were taken captive. 
"Captivity narratives" have recently won much attention from historians of American culture, although not so much from their counterparts in Britain. Colley points out how the theme of captivity dominates one national epic, "Gulliver's Travels," and appears continually in British poetry, song, art, fiction and journalism. Conquerors everywhere always prefer to see themselves as victims; the story of Britons held in the Black Hole of Calcutta came to overshadow the stories of the far greater number of Africans and Asians killed or captured by the British. 
Nonetheless, the number of Britons taken prisoner during the empire's expansion is startling. Colley estimates that at least 20,000 British and Irish captives were held in North Africa between 1600 and 1750, and that some 3,000 settlers were captured by American Indians in the 1750's and 60's in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia alone. In fighting that began in 1779 at least one out of five British soldiers in India ended up in enemy custody. One of the most famous North American British captives, John Smith, whose life was supposedly saved by Pocahontas, had previously been seized by the Ottoman Turks and sold as a slave in Constantinople. Fear of humiliating captivity went hand in hand with empire building -- and still does, as Colley gently reminds us, noting the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-81, and the peculiar, obsessional belief that there were still American prisoners hidden in Southeast Asia after the end of the Vietnam War. 
Colley examines the British captives' stories from every angle, and in her hands much is revealed. Anxiety about capture was so acute because Britain's army was spread so thin. Furthermore, the British could not completely demonize the darker peoples who kept capturing them, because the only way this small nation could take over so many larger territories was by enlisting or allying with favored groups of Indians, Africans and Native Americans. Another theme is the way British authorities always feared that people long held captive would "go native": by converting to Islam and getting circumcised, or by marrying Hindu wives or otherwise adopting their captors' customs. Many did: after Peter Williamson survived captivity in North America and finally was buried in his native Scotland, he was in moccasins, fringed leggings and a headdress of feathers.
As a writer, Colley is seldom less than elegant, and her book is enlivened by sharp-eyed descriptions of what some of the various places of captivity look like today, from the Straits of Gibraltar to the ruins of the island fortress of Seringapatam in India. She has an amazing set piece about a 1751 pageant at Covent Garden Theater, featuring emaciated Britons just returned from five years' captivity in Morocco and wearing rags and chains again for this strange appearance on stage. There is marvelous detail on every page, from the ancestry of the Stars and Stripes in the horizontal red and white stripes of the East India Company's flag to how the British obtained Tangier: "Charles II . . . acquired the settlement along with other colonial booty in 1661, as part of the dowry of his sad, barren Portuguese bride, Catherine of Braganza."
But Colley's focus is not quite broad enough to match her skill as a stylist or her knowledge as a historian. Sometimes a close look at a particular literary genre can be a satisfying prism through which to see a cultural moment: One thinks of Paul Fussell's study of British travel writers between the wars, of several of Orwell's essays on popular culture or of Edmund Wilson's book on the literature of the Civil War. But in this case, both the genre and the time and place are too diffuse. British captivity narratives vary wildly in style, tone, length and proportion of truth and falsehood. And the historical moment Colley illuminates through them extends across two and a half centuries. It is too great a stretch. 
Furthermore, to use captivity stories to talk about the makers of the empire seems to be a case of the tail wagging the dog. Most of us prefer to read books whose contours are determined not by a particular body of texts under study but by a big question -- exactly as Colley shaped "Britons." The big question that implicitly lurks in the pages of "Captives" is how, and at what costs to both conquerors and conquered, did this tiny island less than half the size of Madagascar manage to take over so much of the earth? So why not write the history of the British empire, in all its enlightenment and brutality, arrogance and illusions, greed and noblesse oblige, and use the experience of captivity -- in both directions -- as one of many means to tell the story?
Colley seems to sense this dog-tail problem, for, as if reaching for wider scope than that allowed by captivity tales, she broadens her definition of captivity in two odd ways. The first is to veer off briefly to look at Britons who were held as prisoners of war in the American Revolution -- captivity to be sure, but certainly of a far different, more conventional sort than the captures by non-Europeans that she has been talking about. The second is to include a lengthy chapter on "Captives in Uniform" -- the long-suffering British troops who, especially in India, kept the empire going while living in dreadful conditions. The chapter is filled with fascinating information, on deserters, on flogging as the main means of military discipline, on the British-Irish tensions that extended even here and much more. But we've come a long way from captivity: it feels as if the tail had sprouted an extra branch and that this material belonged in a book of broader reach.
It may seem presumptuous to suggest that an author should have written a somewhat different book, but the one I wish Colley had written is the one described on the dust jacket: "The story of Britain's pursuit of empire and how its soldiers and civilians were held captive by the dream of global supremacy, 1600-1850." There are few, if any, living historians who could do a better job.

Another Saga for Stamford's Palace Theater

BYLINE:  By LISA PIERCE 

 BODY:
ON a cold Saturday last month, a bewildered couple wandered around Stamford's Palace Theater, searching for a Christmas concert.
 "We've circled the block twice," the woman moaned when she was at last directed past a 126-foot construction site along Atlantic Street to the theater's temporary entrance. "No wonder we couldn't find it." 
 For the past three performing seasons, audiences have had to make their way down a walled-off walkway and across a wooden ramp to attend events at the theater, a onetime vaudeville and movie palace built in 1927. Audiences can expect to continue making this pilgrimage for awhile. The theater, Stamford's largest, is still in the midst of a facelift, the plans for which were announced 10 years ago. Renovations are scheduled to be completed next summer; a reopening gala is planned for October. 
Why has the work taken so long?
In 1993, officials at Stamford Center for the Arts, which owns the theater, announced a plan to modernize the interior and expand the entrance and stage. In recent years, the Palace was been home to the Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra, and the Stamford Symphony Orchestra, among other local groups, as well as touring acts and Broadway productions on the way to New York City.
Immediately after the renovation plan was announced, debate erupted between the center and local preservationists, led by the Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program and the Stamford Historic Society. The preservationists were intensely concerned about the fate of the theater's terra cotta Beaux Arts facade.
"People were pretty passionate about it," recalled Carmen Domonkos, then president of Stamford's board of representatives. The board, the city's governing body, controlled a $1.5 million grant from the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development for work on the entrance. (Approval for other state financing did not require city approval. Private money was also raised.)
Officials from the center argued that preserving the facade could add over $700,000 to construction costs and cause delays. But public meetings on the project, held throughout the mid-1990's, often drew as many as 100 residents, most of whom took the preservationists' side, Mrs. Domonkos said. In the end, the board voted not to sign off on the grant unless at least some of the original entrance was saved.
Expanding the stage to 3,800 square feet and building modernized dressing rooms began in 1996 and took a year. In 1998, a compromise on the entrance was adopted; the facade would be preserved, while the entrance would be expanded to include space formerly part of the adjacent Il Forno restaurant.
Designed by the Connecticut architects Fletcher-Thompson, the plan blends the facade with modern architectural elements. Construction began in 2000. The outer framework was completed last June.
George Moredock, the center's executive director, and Frank Rich, its chairman and a prominent local developer, said their predictions about the escalated costs and delays have been borne out.
"It cost over $1 million to accommodate and fortify the facade," Mr. Moredock said. "All told, it added at least three years to the project. We could have torn it down and been in that building a long time ago."
Renee Kahn, director of the Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program, disputed this. She blamed the delay and increased costs on a decision to add a 200-seat theater under the Il Forno property.
Ms. Kahn said the theater, with its Renaissance, Gothic and Mediterranean influences, was "an important example of the end of the era of historic revival in theatrical architecture."
The Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra has performed at the Palace throughout construction. But its staff has fielded hundreds of queries about whether a performance was canceled because of the construction, said Laurence Gilgore, the group's general director. The Stamford Symphony Orchestra has performed at the Rich Forum for most of the last two seasons because its elderly patrons had trouble using the ramps, said Barbara Soroca, its executive director.
"The building is going to be magnificent," she said. "The unfortunate part is the amount of time it took to get to this place."

WHEN Pepe Martinez crossed the Mexican border in 1991 as an illegal immigrant, he had few job prospects, but he brought with him big dreams of owning a business. He landed in the Hamptons, where the divide between the haves and have-nots is infamously wide.
 While working as a dishwasher at the Hamptons Coffee Company, a cafe in Water Mill, Mr. Martinez took notes on how other employees roasted coffee beans, served customers, bargained with vendors and spoke English. One day, when the manager quit, he asked for the job. 
 "One of the owners, she said, 'What would people think of a Mexican in front of the counter?' " Mr. Martinez recalled. "I told her people look at me one way when I am cleaning. They will look at me a different way when I am the manager." 
He got the promotion and in 1999, bought out that co-owner to become a partner in the business. Now a legal resident, Mr. Martinez, 38, is an owner of two Hamptons Coffee cafes -- the other is in Westhampton Beach -- and is planning to open a third in Manhattan.
"I had dreams," he said. "I worked very hard." 
Over the last two decades, more and more Hispanic immigrants on the South Fork are, like Mr. Martinez, capturing a piece of the American dream. And, like him, they do it in a place that offers limited institutional or governmental assistance.
Last month, some of them formed an organization that, they hope, will not only show more recent immigrants the path to success but will also create a unified, political presence. It is the first group of its kind in eastern Suffolk County and is viewed with such optimism that the Town of East Hampton has disbanded its own Hispanic Advisory Board. 
The new group, Organizacion Latino Americana, goes by the welcoming acronym OLA. Its president, Isabel Sepulveda de Scanlon, said that inclusiveness is OLA's motto. "Latinos are from so many countries -- Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Peru -- and our cultures are very different," she said. "Anglos always talk about the Latino community, but really we are many communities."
Ms. Sepulveda, who was born in Chile, works part time as a private chef to Leon Uris, the author, and is the host of a Hispanic talk show on public-access television. OLA's executive board includes an artist, a real estate broker, a priest, a construction company owner and a school administrator. Among its most active members and supporters are a restaurateur, a social worker, a gallery owner, a guidance counselor, a beauty salon owner, an elementary school principal and a psychologist.
But for every Latino on the South Fork with a house, a car and a profession, there are hundreds living in poverty with no medical insurance, no education and no regular employment, Ms. Sepulveda said.
In the South Fork's two towns, East Hampton and Southampton, Latinos constitute the fastest-growing ethnic group, with about 12 percent of the population, according to the 2000 census. Since 1990, Southampton's Hispanic population nearly quadrupled, to 8.6 percent. But the census has been widely criticized for undercounting minorities, and Ms. Sepulveda noted that a quarter of East Hampton High School's students are Hispanic.
The dearth of affordable housing forces many Latinos to live in cramped, squalid quarters, Ms. Sepulveda said, and every morning there are crowds of unemployed men outside a store in Southampton and the lumberyard in East Hampton, waiting to be hired as day laborers. 
"There are so many, many problems, and no individual person can fix them," Ms. Sepulveda said. "We have to work together, to speak with one voice. Only then will we have power." 
OLA has set an ambitious agenda, with committees assigned to explore such issues as housing, immigration, health care, transportation, education, recreation and government.
As the South Fork moves to accommodate its Spanish-speaking residents, English-as-a-second-language programs have popped up in schools, libraries and colleges, and many businesses and government offices have Spanish-speaking employees who deal with the public.
Southampton Hospital, the region's only hospital, has been sharply criticized for providing no interpreters, but a few months ago it turned for help to the Rev. Luigi Hargain, an adviser to OLA and a member of the Ecumenical Missionaries, an American Catholic order that works with immigrants, especially Latinos. Now the order's members are either in the hospital or on call around the clock. They also lead a class on ethnic and racial diversity that is mandatory for all hospital employees, and they have volunteered to teach Spanish or English to anyone who wants to learn.
"The hospital is really trying," Father Hargain said. 
In his view OLA should focus first on breaking down the language barrier. "The power of language bestows the power of dignity," he said. Some of his English students were pharmacists and doctors in their native countries, he pointed out, "but in the United States they clean houses, wash dishes." 
Along with increasing the number of Latinos who can speak and read English, Father Hargain said, OLA must become a political force if it is to have lasting impact. Ms. Sepulveda agreed, saying that it would be nonpartisan in its approach.
Father Hargain said: "My prayer is that it doesn't become another organization that just talks about nice things. It is demeaning to be given a Christmas turkey, then ignored the rest of the year. Latinos need political clout for their entire community."
One reason Hispanic residents have not yet achieved the political strength to match their numbers is that many came from countries where outspokenness could be dangerous. "They are too afraid to speak up," Mr. Martinez said. "It is good that an organization will speak for them."
Diana Weir, an East Hampton town councilwoman of Puerto Rican and Colombian descent, was the liaison to the town's Hispanic Advisory Committee. She said the committee wrestled with so many issues outside the town's limited purview that its members all declined to be reappointed, opting instead to help form OLA.
"They were frustrated," she said. "All they could do was advise the town. They couldn't lobby in Washington for changes to immigration law or in Albany for tenants' rights."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the Organizacion Latino Americana, a new Hispanic group on the South Fork, misstated the name of the cafes in Water Mill and Westhampton Beach whose co-owners include Pepe Martinez, an adviser to the group. They are called the Hampton Coffee Company, not Hamptons.

HEADLINE: Fairer Winds, but Watch Offshore Storms 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
BENEFITING from its increasing diversity, the Long Island economy marginally outperformed the sluggish national economy in 2002 and appears poised for modest growth in 2003, with the greatest advances likely in the second half of the new year, leading Long Island economists said.
 The economists, working in government, academia and private industry, said that local unemployment rates that were some 2 percentage points below the national average were likely to carry over from last year. They also agreed that higher prices in a torrid Long Island real estate market would continue as long as interest rates remained low. 
 They warned that, as always, events outside the region and utterly beyond local control could be decisive in the months ahead. 
"A lot depends on what happens on the geopolitical front," said Irwin Kellner, a professor of economics at Hofstra University and chief economist for North Fork Bank. "We are hoping any conflict with Iraq will be resolved fairly quickly one way or another, but clearly we don't know and it's not under our control." 
He and other economists said the possibility of war in Iraq and future terrorist attacks created uncertainty that was itself a drag on the local and national economies. "What we are missing is forward momentum," said Gary E. Huth, a principal economist at the state Department of Labor regional office in Hicksville. "There is that uncertainty out there. And the longer you stay in a lull the more it can become a problem."
But the Island's increased economic diversity, the economists independently agreed, would continue to offer some protection in an uncertain period. As some other regions tied to the fortunes of dominant manufacturers or dot-coms have seen local economies plunge like a stock in a sell-off, the consensus was that Long Island's highly varied, post-military-contractor economy would perform more like a mutual fund leveraged against precipitous decline.
"We did not have the high flyers that were more common in some of those other areas, so we didn't have the crashes," Mr. Huth said. "Because of our diversity we don't have a major exposure."
Thomas Conoscenti, an economist in Nesconset with a consulting business, said Long Island entered 2003 as "a mature, highly developed economy that can compensate for changes a lot more easily than a mono-industry economy." He predicted regional employment growth of 1.2 percent in 2003 coupled with a decline in unemployment from an annual average of 3.2 percent to 3 percent. The monthly unemployment rate in November, the most recent month for which figures are available, was 3.9 percent.
"Our economy seems to march to a different drummer," Dr. Conoscenti said. "It's not responding like the national economy. It's holding itself up."
Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group, said the rise in Long Island home prices exacerbated the problem of inadequate affordable housing but had at least one positive impact. "Consumers feel their houses are worth more so they are more inclined to spend," she said.
But Dr. Kamer said the strong real estate market was not enough to offset the local impact of the sputtering national economy. "The national economy is experiencing difficulty in developing an economic recovery that has some traction," she said. "And until we see a strengthened national economy I think we will see a fairly flat economy on Long Island."
Dr. Kamer also suggested that the residential real estate market on Long Island would level off in the year ahead. "The run-up in housing prices is a bit worrisome, but it may be a bubble," she said. She said that while high housing demand worked against any major decline in value, she expected selling price increases this year of 3 to 6 percent, far below the double-digit pace of 2002.
She said she expected that further declines in interest rates and a federal fiscal stimulus package that included tax cuts would spur the economy in the second half of the year.
Dr. Kellner, who is also the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in Nassau County, said federal tax cuts, extension of unemployment benefits and releasing block grants to states could help regionally. "As many as 47 of 50 states are running deficits, so there's a groundswell for Washington to come to their assistance," he said of the grants.
Federal money to states percolates to localities, easing upward pressure on property taxes and helping meet soaring social service and medical costs, among other impacts.
Dr. Kellner said that an upturn in the stock market was likely during 2003. "The market doesn't have to set a new record for this to be a plus, but it needs to be decisive, say 5 or 10 percent," he said. He noted that the market had gone up in every year before a presidential election year since 1943.
A lack of affordable housing remained a drag on a region where even skilled workers may be priced out of the market, the economists said. "This will be a major impediment to Long Island," Dr. Kamer said. "It's not easy to catch up when you are this far behind in terms of affordable housing."
Dr. Conoscenti said solutions would have to come from local elected officials. "We've been talking about affordable housing for 25 years but it's going to have to be initiated by the towns," he said. "The towns are the ones that restrict the development of a diversified housing market." 
Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association and not an economist, said the results of the affordable housing crunch would become painfully clear when the regional economy reignited. "It is underlying the surface right now because of the flatness of the economy," he said, "but when the economy heats up again we are going to experience labor shortages."
State statistics provided by Mr. Huth showed a net loss of 400 jobs in Nassau and Suffolk in a comparison of November 2001 and last November. But Mr. Huth, a labor market analyst, said he believed the worst of the job losses were over.
"The question is when and how much of a turnaround are you going to begin to see in 2003," said Mr. Huth, who predicted that the number of jobs on the Island, now at 1.2 million, would grow by 10,000 to 12,000 if all went well. He said business services were the probable growth leaders.
Soft retail sales and a weak holiday shopping season, he said, were "reasons you have to be cautious." Still, sales taxes collected by the two Long Island counties increased in 2002, and both counties were projecting increases for this year.
Opinions were divided on the dismal topic of past and future impacts from war and terrorism. Mr. Huth said opportunities existed for local businesses. "We might see some benefit in the continued defense spending, both on the overt military side and in the homeland security area," he said. "There are some positive possibilities out there for Long Island companies."
Dr. Kellner saw negatives. "I don't think you'll find anybody who is rooting for a war for economic reasons," he said. "It's a negative for everybody."
But he also said the 9/11 attacks had a perversely positive economic aftermath on Long Island. "People tended to stay at home and cocoon. They put their money into their houses instead of into vacationing far from the Island. They bought cars and other fancy items, and on balance the Long Island economy benefited."
Dr. Conoscenti said factoring war and possible terrorist attacks into economic forecasts was problematic. "You just kind of leave there," he said. "Should another 9/11 happen, then you have to go back to the drawing board."

Jobless Rate Masks Fundamental Economic Shift

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
LAST month, State Labor Department data showed that Nassau and Suffolk combined had an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent in November. That figure -- and the job picture it represented -- looked pretty sturdy in a skittish economy.
 Some of the neighbors are not doing nearly as well. Unemployment in the New York City region (the five boroughs, Westchester, Putnam and Rockland, along with Nassau and Suffolk) hit 7.3 percent. 
 Taking a "glass is half-full" tack, two prominent regional economists hailed the data as indicative of economic recovery in Nassau and Suffolk.
Irwin L. Kellner, the chief economist for the North Fork Bank and a professor of economics at Hofstra University, said the numbers showed a regional resurgence. "After a shaky start, the Long Island economy has bounced back," Dr. Kellner said.
Gary E. Huth, the economist in the State Labor Department's Hicksville office, said: "Some of the region's worst problems of the past 12 months seem to have bottomed out. I would say the local economy looks pretty healthy."
Upon closer inspection, however, the data show that Nassau and Suffolk are shifting toward a service economy, much like the rest of the country, and with that shift, the two counties are moving toward a job base characterized by lower wages and skimpier employment benefits. The data also suggest that a "glass is half-empty" perspective might not be merely a Cassandra response but a reasonable reaction to an economy looking leaner and meaner by the month.
The economists agreed that the region's low unemployment rate masked unsettling changes in the job market. "If you look at them straight up they are quite healthy numbers, but they are a little misleading actually," Mr. Huth said. "It used to be there were employers just waiting to catch people as they walked out the door. Now there is a lack of hiring, and that's particularly painful for people who had relatively good positions and who are having a hard time finding something comparable."
From November 2001 to November 2002, the number of private-sector jobs in Nassau and Suffolk decreased by 2,600, or 0.3 percent. Many of those lost jobs were relatively high-paying positions in industries like telecommunications, information technology and computerized printing and graphics, all high-tech industries that not so long ago were touted as engines of economic growth.
Over the last year, the region lost some 6,600 of what the Labor Department calls goods-producing jobs: for example, designing and assembling electronic equipment, packing frozen foods or printing and distributing glossy calendars. Hardest hit in the goods-producing category was manufacturing, where 4,900 jobs disappeared.
During the same period, Nassau and Suffolk gained 6,200 jobs in the service sector, a broadly defined category that includes engineers for the Long Island Rail Road, sales representatives at department stores and orderlies in nursing homes. The big job gains were at home refinance companies and a retail category the state calls "building materials/garden supplies," which includes workers at chains like Home Depot and Lowe's. The refinance companies added some 600 jobs and the retail category added about 500 jobs, many in new stores.
"The big losses have been in telecommunications and high technology in general," Mr. Huth said. "Companies in these industries have been very ambitious and had been hiring aggressively to meet their growth projections. Many were severely overextended and have begun pulling back, and that means cutting jobs."
As a result, the unemployment rate is unevenly distributed. Among the hardest hit have been marketing and engineering professionals, technical specialists and information technology workers. For people who are willing to drive trucks, to work weekend shifts at department stores or to change bandages in hospitals, jobs remain plentiful.
Dennis Hahn, the director of career counseling for the Suffolk Labor Department, said: "People have to face reality. If you are an unemployed professional, your next job will probably be at a lower rate of pay."
An analysis of October job relocation data provided by the department's Hauppauge office bears out Mr. Hahn's warning in microeconomic terms. Of 35 workers who found new jobs, 26 took positions that offered the same pay or less. The new jobs paid on average $20.11 an hour, 79 cents less than the worker's last job. In a 40-hour week that difference amounts to $31.60.
The state does not track benefits, but evidence abounds that workers are paying a greater portion of their own health-care and insurance expenses.
Rob Rossiter, a consultant to the Oyster Bay office of Diversified Concepts, which administers employee benefits, said that employers were becoming less generous. "When it's time to renew benefits packages, employers are scaling back," he said. "Benefits are a function of how badly you need to keep your best employees. Today, the employee pool is overflowing, and companies are able to offer less. They're raising the co-payment on medical benefits and dropping life insurance and dental benefits altogether. It's a 180-degree reversal from two or three years ago."
A look at unemployment benefits paid out by the state for the 12-month period ending in October underscores the "downward mobility" trend, especially for white-collar workers. In that period the ranks of unemployed technical workers jumped nearly 25 percent; the next-highest increase was professionals, a category that rose 20 percent.
In comparison, the number of clerical workers receiving unemployment benefits dropped by 8.6 percent, and the number of blue-collar workers dropped by 6.5 percent.
Education was little insurance against layoff. Among those who had some college credits but lacked four-year degrees, unemployment rose nearly 13 percent, and for those who had college degrees, there was a 7.3 percent rise. But workers with only high school diplomas found the welcome mat out; for them, unemployment dropped nearly 12 percent.
Stephen W. Sorahan, the president of Sterling Mortgage Capital in Garden City, said that the boom in refinancing last year prompted him to double his work force from 8 to 17 employees and to pay salaries that were 50 percent higher than he had been paying just a year earlier.
"People looking for jobs walk in the door and name the salaries they want, and if we say no, they walk out and head over to the next company," Mr. Sorahan said. "They know what the market is paying."
Some economic analysts and social critics warn that the transition from a goods-producing to service-sector economy should raise red flags. They warn that a market in which jobs pay less, offer less medical insurance and carry little security undermines growth by shifting economic benefits to employers at the expense of employees.
"We're seeing a continuation of the long-term trend away from manufacturing and toward service and sales," said Michael Zweig, a professor of economics at the State University at Stony Brook and the director of the Center for Study of Working Class Life there. "Often the new jobs coming into existence don't pay enough for the worker to establish a home on Long Island."
"Having a job is better than not having a job," he added. "But still, for the worker this trend represents a deterioration of economic conditions."

UConn Speeds Toward 'a State of the Art Campus'

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AT the University of Connecticut campus in Storrs, construction workers are already as common a sight as students as the the hard hats scramble to finish a modernization program in 2005. Now more projects are on the horizon. A new building program designed to put the finishing touches to what one university official called "a state of the art campus" will keep the payloaders and bulldozers around through at least 2015.
 The present makeover project, called UConn 2000 and started in 1995, has already changed the face of the campus. Two parking garages with a combined 2,500 spaces, a $56 million chemistry building, a $26.6 million business school and a $42.9 million biological sciences building have opened. An information technology center costing $34.1 million is nearly finished and work will start soon on a $40 million pharmacy building. 
 More than 100 classrooms have been renovated and now have voice, video and data service at each seat, and the core campus has been closed to traffic with the construction of a large pedestrian mall. New dormitory complexes have added thousands of beds to the residence halls. 
The overall cost of UConn 2000: $940 million.
The activity will continue now that the Connecticut Legislature has approved and the governor has signed a bill that extends the construction program for another 10 years in a plan called 21st Century UConn.
The new program, costing $1.3 billion, will include a third parking garage, a new $66 million humanities classroom building, a new student health building and a $20 million expansion of the new Fine Arts complex. The life sciences building will be renovated at a cost of $48 million, $20 million will go toward the expansion and renovation of the psychology building, and $7.2 million will be spent to renovate the Jorgensen Theater.
"This will allow us to go right into the design of the next projects as we're finishing up UConn 2000," said Larry G. Schilling, executive director of architectural and engineering services at UConn. "Knowing the funding will be in place allows us to make some decisions that will save money in the long run."
Less disruption can be expected than if work stopped and then restarted, Mr. Schilling said. 
"The problem we had in the beginning was that most of the campus had not seen any significant construction for many years, and all of a sudden pedestrian patterns had to change and vehicle patterns had to change, and it was disruptive," Mr. Schilling said. "Now we've developed methods to inform people what we'll be doing next, so they may not like it but at least they know what's coming."
UCONN 2000 will ultimately involve the construction of about 50 new buildings and the renovation of about 50 more, Mr. Schilling said. An additional 20 new buildings will be financed under 21st Century UConn, but the focus will shift to renovating some existing buildings, many of them dating from the early and mid-20th century.
About $300 million of the new financing will be designated for the UConn Health Center in Farmington, the UConn Law School in West Hartford and regional campuses in Waterbury, Torrington and Groton.
"In UConn 2000 we addressed absolutely critical needs, the issues that needed immediate attention because we had basic decaying infrastructure," said Karla H. Fox, associate vice chancellor for university affairs, who is in charge of the master plan. 
The business and pharmacy schools, in particular, were going to face re-accreditation problems because their facilities were so outdated, she said. A large part of the money went to repair leaky roofs and pipes, to install computer networking cables, and to upgrade heating and cooling systems all over the campus.
"Now, 21st Century UConn will allow us to move forward, to really plan a state of the art campus for the future," Dr. Fox said.
About $215 million of the new money will go toward deferred maintenance and making some of the older buildings accessible to the handicapped.
"When they were built 100 years ago, that wasn't an issue that was even considered by the architects, but our goal is to have 100 percent of our buildings accessible if possible," Dr. Fox said.
Another $90 million will be designated for replacement of the West Campus and Graduate housing complexes, and more than $30 million will go toward an intercollegiate, intramural and recreational sports complex.
Some projects that were only partly financed in UConn 2000 will be finished with the money from 21st Century UConn. The William Benton Museum of Art, for instance, is in the midst of a 7,000-square-foot expansion using $700,000 from the UConn 2000 funds and $800,000 donated by an alumna. It will get $3 million from the next phase of financing.
"It's nice to see the humanities are getting some of the money," said Salvatore Scalora, the museum's director. "In a university setting, it's very easy to direct the money to science and engineering, which bring in the research dollars, but a humanities-centered education is essential, and we're excited to be a part of it."
The final draft of the campus master plan is awaiting the outcome of a study by the school's Academic Plan Task Force, which is spending much of its time discussing the school's classroom needs and trying to make the new buildings as flexible as possible. The expanded Student Union building, for instance, will have a 500-seat theater that can be divided into classrooms on weekdays.
"We're designing these buildings to last at least 100 years," Dr. Fox said. "They're going to be top flight buildings, but if they're going to be around that long, we have to put a lot of thought into them. 
THE new buildings have been winning raves from graduate students and professors. Michelle Rosado, a microbiology graduate student, said the colorful and well-lighted biological sciences building she moved into last month was a wonderful change from the drab, dim building she had occupied. The security, too, is much better, she said, which will help protect not only the people but their experiments.
"We used to have the microbiologists spread out, so if we wanted to talk to someone else in the department you usually had to go to another building," Ms. Rosado said. "This will bring everyone together."
Preston B. Garcia, another doctoral student in microbiology, said the new buildings were also much better equipped for modern science. Some of his work, for instance, is done with a DNA sequence analysis program that requires he connect to a powerful computer server.
"In the old lab we had to string about 100 feet of Ethernet cable to get Internet access," Mr. Garcia said. "Here, there are data jacks about every two feet, so it's a lot more convenient."
The university's president, Philip E. Austin, said that the overwhelming political support for the second phase of the construction program was gratifying and a vote of confidence in how UConn had managed the first phase. 
"The governor and the Legislature understand that the state's economic future is in a significant measure tied to the University of Connecticut," Dr. Austin said. "They understand that this is a way to invest in the state's future."
In addition to the research and consulting expertise at UConn, almost 75 percent of the graduates stay in the state, providing a talented work force for Connecticut companies, he said. Pharmaceutical, defense, insurance and utility companies in the state have donated endowed chairs in some of the technical disciplines, or entire buildings, Dr. Austin said.
"Those guys don't drop money on you unless you give them a reason," he said. "The corporate community recognizes what UConn provides, and has also been supportive."
Nevin E. Kessler, vice president for development at the UConn Foundation, said the overhaul of the campus had bolstered the school's fund-raising as well. Since 1995 the number of donors each year has risen from 25,000 to about 40,000, and the amount they give has risen even faster, from about $7 million a year to $50 million last year.
"Generally, people want to give to organizations that are successful and have a bright future, and a campus that has significant deferred maintenance problems like the University of Connecticut had in the late 1980's and early 1990's was not an organization that people could get excited about," Mr. Kessler said. "But that's all changed with UConn 2000 and now 21st Century UConn."
"One of the things that we try to do, as we reach out to people who have not been donating in the past, is to get them to come back and see the campus now," Mr. Kessler said. "People get excited about what the university is doing and see it as a wise investment in the future."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Downtown Brooklyn Project; 
Reborn Building to Aid the Arts

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
After sitting vacant for the last decade, an eight-story building in downtown Brooklyn, formerly owned by the state, is being reborn as offices for small nonprofit cultural groups.
 By the fall, 80 Hanson Place, once a medical testing lab, is scheduled to be home to up to 30 arts and arts services groups. They will lease the offices, with 400 to 2,500 square feet each, at below-market rents of $16 to $18 a square foot a year. There will be about 2,500 square feet of common areas, like conference rooms and rehearsal space. 
 The BAM Local Development Corporation is using $6 million in city and state grants to develop the project. The building is the first step in realizing the group's plan for a cultural district in the area. 
The corporation received $1 million from the state and $5 million from the city to buy and renovate the red-brick building, which is now boarded up. The renovation will include installing new windows and mechanical systems. The development group will make applications available late this month to potential tenants.
Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the development corporation and longtime head of the Brooklyn Academy of Music from which the group takes its name, said that despite tough economic times, the financing from the city "is secure and we have drawn down on the money." 
The city has also committed $75 million more toward the entire cultural district project. The district plan calls for a mix of uses. Besides the affordable offices, the district is to have housing, stores and space for arts-related educational programs on four sites near the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Lafayette Avenue and Ashland Place.
Other projects advancing are the renovation of the former Strand Theater, now home to arts groups, which includes the recreation of a 300-seat theater, and the planned construction of a visual and performing arts library as a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. Work on the theater is to start in 14 months and on the library branch in 2005.
As for 80 Hanson Place, Jeanne Lutfy, president of the development corporation, said, "There is a tremendous need for affordable offices for small arts groups, many of which work out of their living rooms." The offices will enable the groups "to do business better and foster collaborations," she said.
Ms. Lutfy said her company was inspired to go forward with the project after a building on nearby South Oxford Street was leased in three weeks by the nonprofit ART New York to 19 member theaters. She said 80 Hanson Place, already divided into small spaces, is ideal for the proposed use.
BEC New Communities, a developer based in Fort Greene, will manage the building, and Open Office of Manhattan will design the improvements. Tenants will be selected using criteria that include financial and performance standards. Ms. Lutfy said her group would hold a workshop next month to help potential tenants complete applications, which are due in April. RACHELLE GARBARINE

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption last Sunday with a report in the Postings column about the refurbishing of a Brooklyn building for use by arts groups misstated the street number and misspelled the surname of the president of the BAM Local Development Corporation. As the column noted, the address is 80 Hanson Place, not 8. The developer is Jeanne Lutfy, not Lufty.

HEADLINE: After the Bright Lights, Some Head Back Home 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN 

 BODY:
NOT many New York City professionals think of their business address as a career achievement, but if you grew up on the other side of the Hudson, the folks back home sure do.
 Just ask Jeff Vaughan, executive director of corporate communications at Rodale, a publishing company in Emmaus, Pa. Mr. Vaughan was born and raised in Allentown, Pa., and is a 1989 graduate of Muhlenberg College there. During a campus recruiting session his senior year, an executive sports producer at NBC described a company training program that allowed temporary employees to try different jobs at the television station. Mr. Vaughan applied, was accepted, and moved to New York. For the first few years he gave studio tours and worked in media relations. Seven years and four promotions later, he became the publicist of "Dateline NBC." 
 In 1998, he met Anne Alexander, editor in chief at Rodale, during one of her appearances for a health segment of the NBC "Weekend Today" show. When Ms. Alexander mentioned that she was looking for a public relations executive, Mr. Vaughan casually mentioned that he might be available. That is all the editor needed to know.
"I couldn't believe he was interested," Ms. Alexander, who is now vice president and editorial director for the British unit of AOL, said in a phone interview from England. "New York is the center of nationally ranked companies, and NBC is one of them." Mr. Vaughan's New York experience "really set him apart," she said.
And if people a two-hour drive away from the city can be awed by the connection, just think what potential employers in Indianapolis or Henderson, Nev., might think.
"The cachet of having made it in New York is even more impressive the farther away one gets," said Kenneth Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board, a New York-based business research organization. "It says something that those of us who work here don't fully appreciate. It's like saying you went to Harvard instead of saying you went to college."
Not that non-New Yorkers are necessarily starry-eyed. New York is the corporate, banking, deal-making, advertising, fashion, media, cultural and culinary capital of the United States, if not the world, and carving out a successful career surrounded by all that talent is a marketable achievement.
Recruiters from other parts of the country have long known that. And now, two states, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, are engaged in aggressive efforts to woo their native sons and daughters to return and bolster the economies of those states.
In October, Mark Schweiker, the governor of Pennsylvania, and 50 business leaders and college presidents from the state traveled to New York City looking for people like Mr. Vaughan. They entertained alumni from 10 Pennsylvania colleges with Champagne and hors d'oeuvres at the W Hotel in midtown Manhattan. While they did not actually hand out job applications, they did extol the virtues of living and working in the Lehigh Valley.
Michael J. Gausling, chief executive of OraSure Technologies, a medical diagnostics company in Bethlehem, enthusiastically chatted up several candidates that night. "While there aren't many biotech companies in New York City, our company is at the cutting edge of diagnostic testing that can help save people's lives," said Joseph Zack, OraSure's executive vice president for marketing and sales. The company hopes to attract employees with an entrepreneurial spirit, he said.
The Lehigh Valley is not exactly desperate for talent; the Allentown-Bethlehem region ranks No. 4 in a creativity index concocted by Richard Florida, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and the author of "The Rise of the Creative Class" (Basic Books, 2002). It does want to attract more talent, though, and it did not take much to twist Mr. Vaughan's arm.
"If you are born in Allentown, you grow up knowing about Rodale," he said. He and his wife had just had their first child when Ms. Alexander offered him the job, and they were planning to have more, so they decided to return to Allentown to be near family.
Connecticut is also busy promoting itself as one of the nation's fastest-growing technology hot spots. In November, representatives from the Connecticut Technology Council attended a new-media show held in Manhattan to promote the state and recruit employees and companies.
Kristiana Sullivan, campaign manager for the "You Belong in Connecticut" state marketing effort, took that slogan to heart herself a few years ago. Ms. Sullivan, a 29-year-old native of Windsor Locks, Conn., worked as a summer intern for MTV in New York between her junior and senior years at Boston University, and after graduating, had job interviews with MTV's parent company, Viacom; with Nickelodeon; and with the New Boston Garden Corporation. But then she was offered an entry-level public relations job with AAA in Hartford, in large part because of her stint at MTV, she believes. She grabbed it so she could be closer to family and friends.
"The man who interviewed me told me my internship experience was a very good fit for the position," she said.
Michelle Daon also discovered the power of the New York connection. After graduating from St. Anselm College in New Hampshire in 1994, Ms. Daon worked in the publications department of Baruch College in Manhattan for three years. Then she applied for a fund-raising job at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, a nonprofit in West Hartford, Conn. The woman who hired her told Ms. Daon that her New York experience clinched it, she says.
"My boss knew how fast paced my job at Baruch was," said Ms. Daon, 30, who now lives in Glastonbury, Conn. "I had to meet deadlines for printing brochures and other publications and keep track of other projects at the same time. I really learned multi-tasking."
She has since gone to work at Hooker & Holcombe, an actuarial-consulting and investment advisory firm in Hartford, where she says the salary is higher and the opportunities for advancement greater.
Even the mayor of Stamford, Conn., returned to his roots after getting New York experience. Dannel Malloy, born and raised in Stamford, was an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn from 1980 to 1984, serving as senior trial attorney in the homicide bureau. Mr. Malloy, now 47, was then enticed back to Connecticut by an offer from the Abate & Fox law firm in Stamford, after which he started his own law firm. In 1995, he was elected mayor on a platform that advocated revamping the police department and instituting community policing.
"That New York experience was worth millions for someone wanting to get involved in law or politics," Mr. Malloy said.

HEADLINE: In Commercial Markets, Mixed Signals 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE real estate market in New York as the new year begins is choppy and characterized by crosscurrents. The demand for office space is soft and asking rents are declining but the retail segment in Manhattan remains strong. Investors are spending heavily for trophy buildings, but less attractive office towers draw little interest.
 An influx of capital from investors wary of the stock market and scornful of bond market yields has resulted in rich prices being paid for trophy properties filled with tenants with good credit ratings locked into long leases. But the appeal of buildings with empty space or leases set to expire in a few years has dropped abruptly, and real estate executives say many announced deals have not closed and others have quietly been withdrawn from the market. 
 Some tenants are seeking to lock in the current low rents and get rid of slow-moving sublet space by persuading their landlords to take back the vacant space in return for extensions to their existing leases. Owners, in turn, have to judge whether eliminating sublet space being offered by leaseholders who are, in effect, competing with their landlords to lure new tenants will ease the downward price pressure on rents and whether the lease extensions will allow them to refinance at the current low interest rates. 
The outlook for the coming year is unclear, with some executives saying that an economic upturn could gobble up available space quickly while others are observing that such an upturn is nowhere in sight. "There is," said Robert Billingsley, vice chairman of Colliers ABR, a brokerage specializing in office leasing, "a continuum of optimism about the outlook for the market. Most people say it will get softer. The optimists say it will be for six months. The pessimists say it will be for two years."
Peter Pattison, a real estate industry consultant, would count as a pessimist. "If we are on the bottom -- and I am not sure we are -- we are going to stay there for a while," he said. "Space is going to compete for tenants. Financial pressures will force people to put space out at what the market will pay."
"There is a lot more space coming on the market this year, and we already have a two-year supply in inventory," said John B. Brod, a principal in PBS Realty Advisors, a small brokerage that specializes in representing tenants. "The recovery will await the national economy, which probably means not until 2005."
According to figures compiled by Insignia/ESG, the real estate brokerage and services company, the overall vacancy rate in Manhattan stood at 11.8 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2002, compared with 8.4 percent a year earlier and just 3.8 percent at the height of the market in 2000.
The overall asking rental rate in the same time had fallen to $44.66 a square foot annually, from $50.75 a square foot a year earlier and $52.67 in 2000.
In spite of the declines, many real estate executives said the New York leasing market is strong compared with many other cities across the country. "We are well below the national average for vacancies, which is 16 to 17 percent," said Bruce Mosler, the president for United States operations of Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company with headquarters in New York.

Sublet Space
Tenants Compete With Landlords
One continuing peculiarity of the office market in Manhattan is the large amount of sublet space. This is space being offered by tenants whose needs have shrunk or have not grown as much as expected, often in competition with space in the same building being offered directly by the landlord. "Sublet space is about one-third of the market, about 18 million square feet of the 55 million square feet available," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage that represents tenants.
Since the original tenants of the space being offered for sublet are, in general, still paying rents, they have an incentive to cut the price to gain a subtenant and reduce their total rent bills. This has a downward impact on overall rental rates.
Some real estate executives said the current situation with sublet space is reminiscent of the late 1980's and early 1990's, when a spate of new construction brought millions of square feet of space onto the market as demand was softening.
"Sublets can carry a discount to direct space," said Robert J. Alexander, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG. With financial industry companies laying off thousands of workers, well finished space is now available on good terms. "If you can get a relatively long-term sublet from an institutional financial firm with good credit, that's not such a bad bet."
But Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, a brokerage and management company, said comparisons with the late 80's and early 90's are overblown. "The real estate market today is much better off than it was then because there has been no speculative building," he said.
He noted that a lot of the empty space in places like Midtown south of about 34th Street are in formerly industrial buildings that were not even considered part of the office market two decades ago. Pointing to massive former industrial sites on the West Side, he said, "There is 120 million square feet of space in buildings like 111 Eighth Avenue and the Starrett-Lehigh Building that did not exist 20 years ago."

Buildings for Sale
A 'Bifurcated' Market For Investors
Even as the leasing market continues in the doldrums, investors are paying top dollar for selected buildings. Real estate executives say that this is because alternative investments, like the stock market, provide uncertain prospects for returns and investors have developed a taste for things they can see and touch.
But the market for these properties has grown increasingly divided, with buildings that are fully occupied with tenants on long-term leases who have strong credit ratings drawing top bids, while those with vacancies and a lot of leases likely to expire in a few years are attracting little attention.
"The market is bifurcated in two ways," said Warren M. Heller, an executive managing director for investment sales at Insignia/ESG. "First, there are one and a half markets nationally that investors are interested in: Midtown Manhattan and Washington, D.C."
And in those markets, investors are seeking properties that look like bonds in that they guarantee a steady, predictable return on investment. Such sites are almost fully leased to companies that are highly likely to pay the rent on their long-term leases. "If you have a building that looks like a bond, there is an infinite amount of capital to bid for it," Mr. Heller said.
The deal most often cited as being in this category is the sale of 399 Park Avenue to Boston Properties for $1.06 billion, or $626.85 a square foot. The building is 100 percent leased to two leading financial institutions on long-term leases.
"That building had Citigroup and Lehman Brothers committed to long-term leases, which made it an extremely attractive investment," said Timothy J. Welch, an executive managing director of Cushman & Wakefield. "It was clearly like a bond, with very stable return of 8 to 9 percent a year, compared with 4 or 5 percent" in the conventional bond market, he said.
But investors are no longer willing to buy vacancies -- in hopes of renting spaces at higher rates -- as they were a year or two ago, said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W&M Properties, the operating affiliate of his family's investment syndicates. As a result, he said, "a lot of deals have gone bust" as prospective buyers could not secure financing to close the transactions. 
"The market has hit reality," said Leslie W. Himmel, a partner in Himmel & Merringoff Properties, an investment company. "You can see the correction; the velocity of deals is off and properties are being taken off the market." She said many owners are still trying to get sales prices of $300 a square foot that may have been justifiable when annual rents were in the $40's, but which are not with rents in the $30's.
The 18.5 percent increase in city property taxes is also helping to chill the investment sales market, by threatening to increase owners' costs as leases expire, Ms. Himmel observed. "The increased taxes can generally be passed on to tenants, but when leases expire, a lot of landlords are going to be hit hard," she said.
Record-low interest rates are providing an alternative for landlords who cannot sell for the price they want or do not want to face the tax consequences of a sale. They can pull their own capital out of a property by refinancing the debt and locking in a low rate.
For many hard-pressed property owners, this is a way to hold on to properties they might otherwise lose to lenders. "For some people, refinancing is not an alternative to selling; it is an alternative to getting wiped out," Mr. Heller said. "With vacancies up and rents dropping, refinancing lets an owner cover up and wait for a better day. It extends the life of owners who otherwise would have lost properties."
The desire to make properties suitable for refinancing may help clear the overhang of sublet space by inducing landlords to take back space being offered by tenants in return for the tenants' signing of long-term renewal leases for the space they are occupying, real estate executives said.
"I think we are going to see the recasting of leases this year with a twist," said Robert Freedman, vice chairman of GVA Williams, a brokerage and services company. If a tenant occupies, say, 250,000 square feet with three to five years left on the lease and also has 50,000 square feet vacant and being offered for sublease, conditions are ripe for a deal, he said.
To induce such tenants with strong credit ratings to extend leases on the spaces they are occupying, landlords may be willing to take back the sublet space, which they can market directly, Mr. Freedman said. "With a short-term lease, you have a wasting asset, but with a long-term renewal, an owner can monetize the asset," he said.
The arrangement has benefits for tenants as well, Mr. Freedman said. Not only are they freed of the obligation to pay rent on space they do not need, but they can clean up their balance sheets by eliminating the lease obligation on the space taken back by the landlord. "These are silent workouts that are happening because landlords want to lock in cheap money for the long term," Mr. Freedman said.
Following are developments in other sectors of the commercial property industry:

Suburban Offices
Vacancies Continue To Increase
The office market in northern New Jersey, by some measures the fourth largest in the country, reflects the overall economic slowdown in the region and big cutbacks in the telecommunications industry.
"The vacancy rate increased to 18.9 percent in 2002 from 13.9 percent in 2001," said Christopher Kinum, senior managing director of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey. "And the average asking rent declined to $25.92 a square foot from $26.24." In addition, he said, the pace of leasing dropped sharply to a total of 8.8 million square feet in 2002, from 15 million feet in 2001.
He said that as more telecommunications space comes to the market this year amid job cuts, there will be downward pressure on rental rates. "I have never seen this market go more than 18 to 24 months without an uptick," he said, "but this may be different. I keep reading that the recession is over, but I don't see it."
The industrial sector of the market, which largely means warehouses and distribution centers, has slowed as well, Mr. Kinum said. "There has been a big slowdown in speculative building of big boxes along the Turnpike and in the Meadowlands," he said. "Build-to-suit is the way to get financing today."
Nevertheless, capital continues to pour into the state, seeking investments in commercial and industrial real estate, said Andrew J. Merrin, executive vice president for investment at Cushman & Wakefield. "We actually call it the paradox," he said.
"There are a number of things going on here," he said. "First, there is disenchantment with Wall Street, and pension funds are increasing their allocations for real estate. Second, with the low interest rates, financing is about as good as it gets. And, third, the presence of all this capital is driving product that you would not ordinarily see onto the market."
In the boroughs of New York City, uncertainty about what will be built in downtown Manhattan and the sublet overhang in the rest of Manhattan is likely to limit development, even in areas like Long Island City that have been rezoned for more intensive development, real estate executives say.
"Our affiliate, Octagon Properties, just bought 10 one-story buildings near the base of the 59th Street Bridge," said Frank Zuckerbrot, an executive vice president of Sholom & Zuckerbrot, a brokerage specializing in property outside Manhattan, most of it in Queens. "Some of them are contiguous, so there is potential for development, but it is our intention to operate them as industrial properties for tenants serving customers in Manhattan," he said.
The rezoning aside, he said, most development sites in the area have not been assembled, and he said there will be little incentive to do so until it becomes clear what is going to happen in Manhattan.
Vacancies continued to rise in Westchester and Fairfield Counties although overall asking rents have not declined significantly. However, concessions by landlords, such as periods of free rent, have cut effective rents in some submarkets, according to Jeffrey Dunne, an executive vice president in the Stamford office of CB Richard Ellis.
"Asking rents are just that," he said. "In some places they are being achieved, and in some they are not." Landlords in Greenwich have been among those most reluctant to offer concessions, he said.

Retail Space
Demand Stays Strong In Manhattan
In spite of a soft leasing market for office space, demand for retail space remained strong as consumers continued spending and new stores sought to enter the rich Manhattan market. As a result, rental rates have held their previous levels or even increased in some locations.
"The international and national tourists have returned, and there is retail activity all over town," said Faith H. Consolo, vice chairman of Garrick-Aug Associates, a brokerage specializing in retail space. One new entrant last year, she said, was Best Buy, the big electronics operation that opened a store at 23rd Street and the Avenue of the Americas and is building out another at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue.
"The retail market has been consistent," said David A. Green, executive director of the retail group at Insignia/ESG. "Demand has been sufficient to take up the available supply, so pricing has gone up."
He said demand was coming from sources as diverse as four banks -- Commerce, Fleet, Washington Mutual and North Fork -- that seem determined to have a branch in every neighborhood in the city, to DeBeers, the diamond company, which is opening its first store in this country in the St. Regis Hotel at 55th Street and Fifth Avenue.
He noted that SoHo, which suffered from a lack of tourist traffic after the terrorist attack, seems to be making a comeback, with Bloomingdale's planning to open a 125,000-square-foot store at 504 Broadway, a space formerly occupied by a Canal Jeans store. Other new entrants to SoHo, Ms. Consolo said, were the Puma and Adidas shoe stores and the Crate & Barrel and Sharper Image houseware stores.
Downtown, retailers displaced from the World Trade Center sought new locations to tap what remains the nation's third largest central business district, after Midtown Manhattan and Chicago. Notable was the deal to place a 33,000-square-foot Borders bookstore at 100 Broadway at Pine Street.
Broadway may become the main retail avenue in Lower Manhattan, said Richard Hodos, the president of Madison HGCD, a brokerage specializing in retail properties. "The area will not be successful if people place stores here and there," he said. "You need to have a concentration to provide synergy, and Broadway is a natural corridor for retail."
Borders started looking for a new location soon after its 40,000-square-foot, three-level store in the base of the Trade Center was destroyed in the Sept. 11 attack, said Virginia M. Pittarelli, a senior vice president of Madison. "Borders considered itself part of the community and there was no question about replacing their flagship store," she said. "Within 90 days after 9/11 we were analyzing the market to find a new location."
Suburban malls appear attractive as well. Near the end of last year, the Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., announced that it was purchasing the 885,000-square-foot Galleria at White Plains in Westchester County and the 637,000-square-foot Riverside Square in Hackensack, N.J.
Mills, a real estate investment trust, is also one of three finalists in the competition to redevelop the Meadowlands Sports Complex in northern New Jersey. Mills has joined forces with a New Jersey-based REIT, the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, in advancing its proposal.

Hotels
Lower Rates Mean Higher Occupancy
New York's hotel operators have largely succeeded in filling the rooms that were left vacant after 9/11 by domestic and foreign tourists who were reluctant to visit the city. They did so, largely, by cutting room rates to attract customers. As a result, their revenues fell sharply.
"Hotel operators have been increasingly successful in inducing people to come here by offering great rates," said Sean Hennessey, director of the New York area hospitality consulting practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. "But the business is hobbling along."
He said the outlook for next year is for small gains in occupancy and revenue, although 2003's first quarter will look especially good because the occupancy rate early last year was an unusually low 64 percent.
Over all, the estimated occupancy rate for all of 2002 was 74 percent, compared with 73.3 percent in 2001, but a far cry from the virtually-sold-out rate of 83.9 percent in 2000. The average room rate last year was an estimated $185 a night, a decline from the average of $192 in 2001, which included nine months of normal business before the attack, and well off the record $222 in 2000.
A more telling statistic is revenue per available room, which combines both room rates and vacancies. That was $137 in 2002, down from $141 in 2001 and $186 in 2000.
The outlook for this year, Mr. Hennessey said, is for occupancy to improve to 76 percent, with an average rate of $192 a night and revenue per available room of $142.
He said hotel managers would be seeking to re-establish relations with corporate customers who are less sensitive to price and trying to wean themselves from dependence on tourists scanning the Internet for bargains.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
A Market With Plenty Of Room To Grow

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
AFTER three years of stock market losses, investors are still staring at a mound of problems.
 These include the uncertain outlook for the economy and corporate earnings, unsettled conditions in Iraq and North Korea, and the persistent problem of terrorism. 
 But James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, has been loading up on stocks since July. Last week, he explained why he thinks 2003 is going to be a good year. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. What is your outlook for the market?

A. I am optimistic. Generally, I don't remember another time, or at least not many, when there are as many clear and present risks as there are right now. That is all that is thought or written about. But I think the time of real risk was a couple of years ago, when nobody was talking about risk.
When perceived risk is high, I would argue actual risk is low. It is the high perceived risk right now that has changed the environment in a way that should make things better. It has caused the business sector to contract and investors to get overly bearish. If there is any change toward optimism, there is a lot of room for stocks to move higher.

Q. What is your take on the economy?

A. The thing that is different today than a year ago was that back then all we had was a relaxed monetary policy. We were still running a fiscal surplus, the dollar was rising in value and long-term bond yields were stubbornly high.
Now we have four easing policies, and as a result we will get a more normal recovery. 

Q. Do you expect corporate profits to grow?

A. By spring, we should get a profits season that exceeds lowered expectations. Profits melted so badly in the last couple of years because of very high fixed costs as a percentage of total sales. That has been a huge negative. But it is now a positive, because if we get back to an expansion, any incremental demand will fall right to the bottom line.
The other part of the profit story is that we have had an abnormally irregular pricing world for corporations: it's called deflation. The fact that the dollar has fallen so much is a huge positive for the corporate sector. Without such stiff price competition, profits will do better.

Q. Is the market cheaply priced?

A. Absolutely not. But it shouldn't be at a time when we have short-term and long-term interest rates at 40-year lows, positive economic growth, record-setting productivity and low inflation.
Relative to gross domestic product, the market's capitalization is no longer at a record high. And prices-to-forward-earnings ratios are close to their historic averages. 
But what people are missing here is that there has been an incredibly breathtaking revaluation of stocks relative to bonds. How often do investors get the chance to step in and buy stocks after a record cheapening relative to bonds? 

Q. What advice do you have for investors?

A. I think exposure to international stocks should be lifted, because I think the dollar is in the early stages of a long-term period of weakening. I also still like large-cap stocks over small-cap stocks. They have the most to gain from economies of scale. And if we are going to return to optimism, investors will come back to large, recognizable names. I also think the road back to optimism has to go back through technology stocks, at least for a while. I think they will be the leaders. I also like industrial and basic-materials stocks, because of their cyclical nature and the fact that they have been hurt the most by a rising dollar.
And I like financials, for a variety of different reasons. If the economy returns to health, that should help creditworthiness. A return to a rising stock market should help investment banking and brokerages. And lending companies should benefit, because the yield curve will remain steep. The Fed will be reluctant to raise interest rates this year.

Q. What investments would you avoid?

A. I would underweight some of the more defensive areas, like consumer staples and health care stocks. And I don't like bonds. If you are going to be in bonds, overweight corporates and municipals.

Q. Are you expecting a good year for the markets?

A. It might be a really good year. But this is not the start of a fresh new bull market, but a cyclical rebound.
This is a lot like the 1970's. In December of 1970 you could have argued the market would go up 25 percent in a year but would be flat for 10 years. I would not be at all surprised that by the end of this year or in the middle of 2004, it might be time to go back to bonds. 
We could go up 25 percent from here, and that would still only get us back to where we were nine months ago. But it would feel great.

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
As Job Seekers Multiply, So Can Empty Promises

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
AN LEICHT'S luck seemed to go from bad to worse after he was laid off about two years ago as chief technology officer for a media company in Los Angeles.
 Five months into his job search, he said, he received a promising e-mail message from what appeared to be an executive recruiter. "It said they were in receipt of my credentials and that I should give this person a call because they might have opportunities for me," he said. 
 Mr. Leicht said a representative from the company in Irvine, Calif., told him that it had close ties to many businesses and would have no problem placing him in a job paying as much as $200,000 a year. All he had to do, he said, was pay a $3,600 fee, in advance. He said that he put up half the money, promising the rest later, but that all he received in return were revisions to his resume and lists of jobs he had seen elsewhere, many outside his field. "They were sending me listings for physicians," said Mr. Leicht, 29, adding that he eventually received a refund after filing a lawsuit against the company. (He is now employed as a technology consultant for another Los Angeles media concern.) 
Apparently Mr. Leicht was not the only disgruntled client. The Irvine Police Department and the Better Business Bureau in Southern California say they have received many complaints about the company, called Careers 2000, which is now defunct. The owner, Charles F. Dimon III, who has operated several other employment companies, would not comment when reached on his cellphone recently.
Consumer groups and career experts say they are expecting more job search problems to arise if the economy remains weak and unemployment climbs. The jobless rate now stands at an eight-year high of 6 percent, and economists expect little improvement when the Labor Department releases its next report on Friday.
The Council of Better Business Bureaus, based in Arlington, Va., recorded a 12 percent increase in complaints nationwide about career counseling and other job search companies in 2001 from the previous year, according to Holly Cherico, a council spokeswoman. She said the group expects another increase when final figures come in for 2002.
The Internet has made it easier for disreputable individuals and businesses to find their victims, either by promoting their services through slick sites or by responding to resumes posted online. The Internet, though, has also helped job seekers by publishing the names of suspect companies.
Job seekers should be especially wary of so-called career or employment marketing firms, career experts and consumer groups say. Unlike employment agencies that keep lists of jobs or executive recruiters that act as headhunters on behalf of a hiring company, these firms try to market the job seeker with services like resume critiques, interview coaching and guidance about the marketplace. Some are legitimate companies offering practical services, but others may make promises they cannot deliver, like immediate job placement or access to unlisted and unadvertised positions. They can also charge advance fees of thousands of dollars, depending on a candidate's previous salary level. (Typically, the higher the salary, the higher the fee.)
R. J. Porter, the immediate past president of the International Association of Career Consulting Firms in Pittsburgh, said that there was nothing wrong with firms asking for fees in advance, just as colleges ask for tuition up front. But Mr. Porter, who is president of Fairchild, Barclay & Associates, a human resources consulting firm in Dallas, says job seekers should watch for many red flags: companies that put pressure on people to sign contracts, for example, or promise to arrange interviews with chief executives of big-name companies. In addition, experts warn of dealing with companies that will not provide references or referrals from past clients.
Gary Modrak, 49, of Scottsdale, Ariz., said there were several warning signs that he missed when interviewing with a career marketing firm in Phoenix, which he found through a newspaper advertisement three years ago. Mr. Modrak said the company, which he would not identify, had assured him that with his background as a program manager in the auto industry, he would be working within a month. "They said, 'The company that hires you will pay back our fee, so you've got nothing to worry about,' " he added. He said he handed over $1,450 of the $4,600 fee and agreed to make payments on the balance. The firm did give him names of executives to contact, he said, but when he sent his resume to some of them, "I got several letters returned that said they weren't there anymore, or that the address was wrong." The one company that seemed promising said it would not repay the consulting firm's fee if it hired him. He eventually found a job himself by answering a newspaper advertisement.
Jeffrey Christian, the chief executive of Christian & Timbers in Cleveland, which helps recruit executives for companies, says that job seekers who rely on career marketing firms risk more than just losing money. Paying someone to help, he said, "actually puts you at a disadvantage." 
"That almost tells the hiring manager you are desperate; you can't find a job on your own, so you have to go out and pay someone to do this," Mr. Christian said. 
Rick Cobb, an executive vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm that helps employers provide job leads for workers that have been laid off, agreed. Often, he added, "if you are paying for that help out of your own pocket there is a conscious or subconscious tendency on the part of the provider to tell you what you want to hear."
Scott Flemming, 39, of Chino Hills, Calif., said the salespeople at the career marketing firm he dealt with last year, a company called Careers 20/20, were very slick and promised things that were not in the written contract. He found out otherwise, he said, after plunking down a $3,600 fee. (Because he paid by credit card, he said he was eventually able to get a refund.) 
CAREER-MARKETING firms can also be chameleonlike. Mr. Flemming said he was unaware that the chief executive of Careers 20/20, Mr. Dimon, had previously run Careers 2000. (A company called Geneva Search recently acquired the assets of Careers 20/20 and is now operating in its old offices in Irvine. In a news release, its president, Greg Cynaumon, promises clients access to a "hidden job market." He pledged in an interview that the company would operate ethically.) 
Sayyed A. Bashir, 51, of Roseville, Calif., said he also had dealings with Mr. Dimon, in October 1998, when Mr. Dimon was running a firm called the Icon Management Group. He said that he took Mr. Dimon to small claims court and was awarded his $2,400 fee, but settled for less. 
Despite his bad experience, Mr. Bashir said he does not condemn all career service firms. "If it is a job seeker who doesn't know anything about finding a job himself, he might get some benefit" from career coaching, he said.
"But that doesn't cost $5,000," he added.
Ms. Cherico of the Council of Better Business Bureaus said that while some employment companies are "schlocky," even legitimate companies are bound to disappoint job seekers who have the wrong expectations. "Despite caution, people who are looking for a job are fairly eager to find something," she said. "You can't cast common sense aside out of desperation." 
Just because a company is affiliated with an established firm does not mean you can let down your guard, either. In September, the Reed Freedman Management Group, which owns two Kansas franchises of Bernard Haldane Associates, agreed to pay $300,000 in refunds to former clients, after the state attorney general's office received dozens of complaints. The company settled a complaint in California with a refund agreement in 1992. (There are about 100 offices worldwide.) 
Bernard Haldane says it is correcting past problems. It said it has set up a telephone hot line and provided an e-mail comment form in the "client care" section of its Web site, www.bernardhaldane.com, to contact the corporate headquarters with questions or complaints. It has also hired a director of quality assurance and is drafting a new contract that it says will clarify what Bernard Haldane will and will not do for job seekers. "We've had some trouble in the past, and we take it very seriously," said Elizabeth Vogel, a company spokeswoman. "Our top goal is to ensure customer satisfaction, and we're not hiding from that."
Other attempts have been made to clean up, or at least monitor, the industry. Mr. Leicht set up www.jobscams.com, which aims to help job seekers avoid employment search problems. Another Web site, www.execcareer.com, keeps watch on other career marketing companies.
But Ms. Cherico of the Council of Better Business Bureaus says that as long as there are vulnerable job seekers, corrupt individuals will always be around. "There is always a market for this," she said. "People can be misled; people want to believe offers that are too good to be true."

Before Buying Employment Services, Take a Close Look
IF you are thinking of hiring someone to help with your job search, consider these suggestions from consumer groups and employment experts:
* Pinpoint the help you need. If you are changing careers or are unfamiliar with a job market, a coach or consultant may help create a search strategy. Many charge by the hour, however, so if you just need to brush up on interviewing skills or resume writing, you may turn to the Internet, to books or to a lower-cost service. Tips for selecting employment services are available through the Web site of the Better Business Bureau, www.bbb.org/library/employ.asp.
* Research the job-search company. To screen for complaints as well as for qualifications, search the Internet for the company name along with its top executives. Web sites like Ripoffreport.com, scamwatch .com and execcareer.com have information about various job-search companies. The local Better Business Bureaus also keep track of consumer complaints against these companies.
* Ask for references. Be wary if a job-search company refuses to give out references because of "client confidentiality." Try to check out the references themselves. R. J. Porter, the immediate past president of the International Association of Career Consulting Firms in Pittsburgh, said some disreputable firms provide phone numbers of "satisfied clients" that ring on a separate telephone in the firm's office.
* Check credentials. A professional organization that sets standards for individual job consultants is the International Board for Career Management Certification, and a group that sets standards for academic programs that train counselors is the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. If the person selling you the service is not the person who will be your consultant during the job search, ask to meet that person. 
* Get everything in writing. Make sure that all that is promised is in the contract. Address any discrepancies between spoken promises and written agreements. If the company says it has personal contact with hiring managers, ask for names and phone numbers.
* Scrutinize money-back guarantees. Some contracts stipulate timetables for clients to submit progress reports and other paperwork to get a refund.
* Take your time. Take the contract home and read it carefully. A company's insistence that you sign on the spot should raise a red flag. Be suspicious if a sales representative seems more concerned about money (and asks you about your credit status, for example) than what you want in a job. 
* Be alert for too much praise or criticism. Sales representatives use both of these strategies to force a deal: "With your credentials we should have you employed in a week" or "Your resume is a mess, and you'll never find a job without us." JULIE FLAHERTY

HEADLINE: Will Soft Touches Mean SofterSales for the Mighty F-150? 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
THE 2004 F-150 pickup truck from the Ford Motor Company will not even go on sale until this summer, but the debate over its design, which Ford has unsuccessfully tried to keep a secret, has been raging for months. At Web sites like F150online.com and Ford-trucks.com, message board postings burst with spy photographs and taut emotion: love, devotion, outrage.
 "The F-150 is a truck," wrote a man who identified himself as Matthew from Stillwater, Okla., "not a freaking glorified car." 
 Matthew was particularly dismayed by the presence of what will surely be the new truck's most controversial feature. For the first time on an American full-size truck, some of the high-end F-150's will have an automatic gearshift positioned between the seats instead of on the steering column. 
Like a car's.
This is welcome news to some people. "If the new F-150's are gonna look like that," wrote Arturo from Miami, "I'm just gonna go ahead and put my name on the waiting list now!" 
But it is heresy to others. "It might go over O.K. with women," said Shawn Crowe, 24, a Ford enthusiast from Lawrenceburg, Ky., in an interview about the gearshift, "but most men will throw an absolute fit."
The redesigned F-150 is the American auto industry's most important vehicle introduction in years. It will be unveiled to the news media tomorrow at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit; some models are shown for the first time in the official photographs accompanying this article.
Ford's F-Series trucks, dominated by the F-150, have been the most popular vehicle line in America for two decades. To Ford, they are at least as important as sport utility vehicles like the Explorer, the best-selling S.U.V. and the third-best-selling vehicle of any kind after the F-Series and the Chevrolet Silverado pickups.
But competition is mounting on all sides, and Ford has little margin for error. Not only will the new F-150 have to contend with other full-size trucks from Chevrolet, GMC, Dodge and Toyota, but for the first time this year Nissan will try to steal some of Ford's market share with its own full-size pickup.
Of even more concern to many analysts are the production costs of the truck, which was lavishly developed during the bull market. In a penny-pinching industry, the new F-150 will actually cost more to make than the current one, a problem that Ford executives have pledged to fix after production begins.
"Can they get the cost down to leave sufficient profit?" said David E. Cole, the president of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry consulting and research firm. "It's a tough hurdle. Everything I've seen and heard about it says it's a well-executed truck. The real question is: Can it be as profitable as it has been historically? And the answer is probably no because of the added competition and the added cost."
Both Ford and Nissan Motor will give official first looks at their new big pickups at the auto show, which opens to the public on Saturday.
As the migration of the shift lever indicates, Ford is trying to fend off competitors by making the F-150 a truck for every taste and driver, from the Marlboro man to the soccer mom. In all, there will be more than a dozen major configurations of the pickup, compared with the current eight, which range in price from $18,500 to $37,000.
The top-end versions of the new trucks, which Ford has not yet priced, even accomplish the modest feat of looking better inside than most American-made luxury cars.
Can one truck line be all things to all people? Can it appeal to desk jockeys and, at the same time, to construction workers who want pickups they can wash out with a hose? A true reading of public reaction is not possible from the spy photographs, which generally show snippets from only one of many versions of the truck. The formal debut at the auto show will offer a better indication of customer sentiment.
WHAT is clear is that Ford, which turns 100 in June, can ill afford to lose ground with the F-150. The company has rarely been more beleaguered. After a staggering $5.5 billion loss in 2001, it rebounded with a slim profit last year. But overall sales fell 8.8 percent in 2002, Ford reported on Friday. That will only add to Wall Street's skepticism about the pace of Ford's year-old corporate turnaround plan.
Ford's bonds are hovering near junk status, and its stock fell 40.8 percent in 2002. Its market share has been plunging as foreign automakers open plants in the United States and continue to flood the market with cars and trucks. Even General Motors, long moribund, has had small gains in market share for two years in a row.
"We take every launch seriously, but the F-150 is our flagship," said James J. Padilla, Ford's chief of North American operations. The truck, he added, "means a lot to our bottom line, and it means a lot to our dealers."
"Nearly a quarter of our North American sales comes from F-Series alone," he added.
In fact, the F-Series probably put Ford into the black last year, all by itself. Gary R. Lapidus, an auto analyst at Goldman, Sachs, estimated that the F-Series generated $2.6 billion in pretax income for Ford in 2002, $1 billion more than his projection for the entire company.
Ford executives have said they expect the F-Series to remain as profitable as it is now. Most analysts, though, say that will be difficult to achieve because of the cost of upgrading the trucks and because the F-150 will have a new competitor in Nissan.
Ronald A. Tadross, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, called the truck's high costs a holdover of the Jacques Nasser era. Mr. Nasser was Ford's chief executive until William Clay Ford Jr., the Ford family scion and chairman, forced him out in October 2001 and took over as chief executive himself.
Mr. Nasser was heavily criticized for not paying attention to the basics of the industry -- what Ford spends to build each vehicle, for example. Last summer, Mr. Ford installed David W. Thursfield, who also heads international operations, as the head of purchasing. Mr. Thursfield is a veteran cost cutter, but analysts say major changes can take years to show results.
Reducing costs is "really hard to do in an existing model," Mr. Tadross said.
"Where you have your best opportunities is when you're developing new models," he added, and cost savings can be designed and engineered from the ground up. Going back, he said, is considerably more complicated.
The F-150 "was designed on the old regime's watch, which means it has a lot of new content, a little higher cost structure than the old one and probably a little more complexity," he said.
Mr. Lapidus said he doubted that "the next-generation F-Series in aggregate will be as profitable as the last generation."
"No matter what they do," he added, "it will be very difficult to hit that objective."
Already, the F-Series' share of the full-size pickup market has slid. It was 38 percent last year, compared with nearly 43 percent in 1998, according to the Autodata Corporation, a research firm. The top competitor is General Motors, which has about 30 percent of the market with its Chevrolet Silverado, the second-best-selling vehicle in the country, and an additional 9 percent with the GMC Sierra. But Toyota Motor has perhaps the most to do with the F-Series' recent share slide.
Toyota's first full-size pickup, the T100, fizzled in the mid-1990's, but the company has gained traction with a new full-size pickup, the Tundra, since it was introduced in 1999. In 2001, at the peak of full-size pickup sales, Toyota sold more than 100,000 Tundras, versus sales of more than 900,000 F-Series trucks by Ford and 700,000 Silverados.
For years, the pantheon of the American pickup truck was an uncomplicated place. Mostly men drove trucks, slogans were blunt ("like a rock" or "built Ford tough") and the music in commercials was left to the likes of Bob Seger, Chevy's former pickup pitchman known for his blue-collar anthems.
LATELY, though, confusion has set in. Light trucks in general -- a government classification that includes pickups, S.U.V.'s and minivans -- now outsell passenger cars. Luxury car makers are increasingly making their money from trucks -- BMW, Toyota's Lexus brand and Mercedes have all introduced S.U.V.'s -- because many customers are willing to pay more for bigger vehicles.
In recent years, pickups have also become more luxurious. This trend reached an apotheosis in 2001, when Cadillac, of all unlikely brands, started selling a pickup. At a time when passenger-car sales are limping, manufacturers say pickups can offer much the same appeal that S.U.V.'s do: an aura of toughness with the trappings of comfort.
The growing popularity of light trucks has caused the fuel economy of the average American automobile to plummet to a 20-year low, despite many advances in technology. And light trucks pose dangers both to their own drivers, because of their increased risk of rollovers, and to car occupants because of the greater damage they inflict.
The new F-150 will have five major classes -- varying mostly in interior glitziness -- compared with just three now. In order, from no frills to fancy, are the XL, STX, XLT, FX4 and Lariat. Customers can order three different cab sizes: a regular cab has two seats, while the SuperCab and the jumbo SuperCrew have two rows of seats. The pickup bed is available in different lengths, and the sides of the truck can be ordered curvy ("flareside") or straight ("styleside"). Ford is also likely to continue offering limited-edition F-150's, like the upscale King Ranch and a model produced with Harley-Davidson.
Like many other American trucks and S.U.V.'s, the F-150 is getting bigger, with several inches added to its basic pickup bed and to the passenger compartment. The biggest version will cross the four-ton threshold for the first time. The grille is more imposing, and the oval Ford emblem at the back will almost double to nine inches in width.
The basic truck, the XL, is geared to the working man and has rubber floors in the passenger compartment that allow for hosing it out. At the top of the line, the Lariat is "geared toward buyers who view their trucks as a reward for achievement," according to the press kit.
The Lariat's interior comes in colors including "medium pebble" and has plenty of chrome, brushed steel and wood grains. It is not intended to be hosed out, nor is the FX4, which with its black leather seats looks more suited to a goateed bachelor -- or, to the dismay of some male pickup enthusiasts, a woman.
Women now buy 18 percent of all pickups, up from 15 percent in 1999, according to J. D. Power & Associates, which monitors sales data from more than 5,900 dealer franchises nationwide. Even the basic F-150 has features tailored to nonconstruction workers, like a tailgate that is half as heavy to lift as the current version.
"I wanted it to be comfortable and smooth, a quiet and smooth ride free of shakes and head tossing," said Julie Kurcz, the highest-ranking female engineer on the F-150 project.
"I like to think that that's something I can bring to the part, my perspective; I'm 5-2 without high heels," said Ms. Kurcz, a baby boomer who declined to give her age. She and her husband are rebuilding a home with the help of her 2002 F-150.
Among the pickup's other options are heated seats and a selection of modular overhead storage areas that accommodate things like DVD players and Palm Pilots. (The F-150 already offers adjustable foot pedals for smaller people.) And, of course, there is the shift lever.
Mr. Padilla said he thought such features would help Ford attract a wider range of customers for the F-150. "I'll bet some of them are soccer moms," he said.
One of the F-150's most potent competitors last year was the Dodge Ram, whose surging sales were bolstered by the seven-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty offered by its parent company, DaimlerChrysler. (Ford offers a three-year, 36-month bumper-to-bumper warranty.) Dodge's advertising cranks up the machismo. The guy who drives the Ram in the company's television commercials looks as if he were chiseled from granite, and the Ram's grille has become cartoonishly muscle-bound. But this has an appeal.
"I see the Ram as the strongest competition from my standpoint, personally," said Roger Lemere, an F-150 driver in Sacramento, Calif., who sells aftermarket parts for Fords. "I describe it as bold and a man's-looking truck," he said. "I do like it."
But for many people, including Mr. Lemere, buying anything but Ford is unthinkable. He worships his black 1997 F-150, which he outfitted with a custom tweed interior; the truck "doesn't see rain and it's a big money pit," he said.
MR. LAPIDUS of Goldman, Sachs, who has seen the new F-150's in the flesh, said their exteriors would hold up well and were "manly, like a truck should be."
He also said the transformation of pickups into luxury vehicles meant a fundamental change in how they are marketed and designed.
"I don't think they're ever going to replace the S-Class," he said, referring to the fancy Mercedes sedan, "but this is consistent with what we see all over the light-truck category.
"They're turning them into fashion-oriented private-use vehicles, and they do require more of the accouterments. The trouble is, they are more of a fashion item and will require more frequent upgrades and replacements. You're going to have to be constantly reinventing them to keep them fresh."

Quick! Name A Company That Merits Accolades

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
NAMING companies that have damaged the economy recently requires little thought. But a version of the opposite question is not so easy to answer: What one company has done the most to improve Americans' lives over the last few decades?
 No technology company seems up to the honor. It was the government, after all, that invented the Internet. 
 Drug companies, with the help of government research grants, have created perhaps the biggest benefits to society, discovering treatments for heart disease and AIDS. But the industry has also played down some effective, inexpensive drugs and trumpeted profitable but dubious alternatives.
So this column's vote goes to a company in one of the least popular businesses in the country: an airline. Founded in 1971, Southwest Airlines has almost single-handedly made air travel affordable for most Americans. Visits to faraway family members or new cities are possible for millions more people than they were 30 years ago. Hundreds of couples -- my wife and I once among them -- have sustained long-distance relationships thanks to cheap air fares.
Many of these people do not even fly Southwest, but it is often the reason they get on a plane. Whether a given route has one, two or three full-fare airlines flying it has little effect on ticket prices. When Southwest brings its bare-bones service and efficient operations to a route, however, prices fall sharply. 
Just look at the difference between the Chicago-Minneapolis and Chicago-St. Louis routes. American Airlines, United Airlines and Northwest Airlines all fly to Minneapolis, but a last-minute round-trip ticket still costs almost $900 on any of them. American, United and Southwest fly to St. Louis, and the price is only $200 even on American or United. 
As Southwest has grown and imitators like JetBlue Airways have sprung up, fares have come down across the country. Flying a mile cost 12.4 cents, on average, in 2001, less than half of what it cost in 1971, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Air Transport Association. United States airlines carried about a half-billion people last year, more than triple the number in 1971. 
The fare pressure has also brought much of the industry to the brink of ruin in recent months. Unable to compete with low-fare rivals, United and US Airways both filed for bankruptcy protection last year, and American, Northwest, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines continue to lose money.
The solution, as strange as it may sound, is more competition. 
When the federal government deregulated the industry in 1978, it gave airlines the freedom to set their own prices. No other industry deregulation has brought as many benefits with as few problems. Not only have prices fallen, but airlines have become safer. Still, the economics of the airline business is unusually distorted by regulation, and those distortions deserve much of the blame for today's problems.
Foreign companies, for example, sell some of the most popular cars, books, clothing, food and cellular phones in this country. They are prohibited by law from owning a domestic airline, however, and the rule has propped up poorly run airlines that regularly infuriate their customers, allowing the airlines to escape the full fury of a free market. 
During the weekend after Christmas, Delta lost so many bags that travelers calling a toll-free number for information about their luggage received busy signals for days. Regardless of their frustration, people in Atlanta, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City -- all Delta hubs -- have little choice but to keep flying the airline. 
THESE problems are not new. In 1999, when the industry seemed much healthier, a committee of private economists and other academics, set up by the National Research Council and financed by the Transportation Department, called on the government to increase competition. Foreign carriers should be allowed to invest in start-up airlines, the group said. Takeoff and landing rights at the nation's busiest airports should be sold, at a price based on the demand for them, rather than controlled by the airlines that have had them for years.
Measures like these would certainly bring further turmoil to the industry, but they would also make possible a new burst of innovation. Maybe a group of overseas airline executives can offer Southwest's prices without its bus-like service. Maybe JetBlue, which is starting to do that already, can grow to be bigger than United someday. Maybe, 30 years from now, another airline will deserve consideration as one of the nation's most important companies.

Now, Perhaps, the Years of Growing Modestly

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
EVEN if the bulls are right, and the long bear market is over, some ardent advocates of stock ownership are warning investors to forgo fantasies of a replay of the roaring 90's and to adopt significantly lower long-term expectations.
 The fat returns that had become routine before the stock bubble burst may be gone for a few -- or many -- years, they say. In any event, there is no reason to count on a recurrence and few are predicting it. 
 Jeremy J. Siegel, the author of "Stocks for the Long Run" (McGraw-Hill), said he believed that the American stock market hit bottom in early October. Still, his outlook is not particularly rosy. Over the long term, compound annual returns on stocks will be 7 percent to 9 percent, he said. 
Taking inflation into account, the real return on stocks will average 5 percent to 7 percent a year, according to Mr. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "You just have to come to grips with it," he said. "There's no reason that people should be expecting more."
Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Frank Russell Company in Tacoma, Wash., has no greater expectations. He said investors should plan for annual returns on stock investments of about 8 percent -- a real return of 6.3 percent -- and he warns against trying to jump in and out of the market to improve those gains.
In the two months after Oct. 9, he noted, the overall market shot up 16 percent. "If you missed that, you just missed two years of returns," he said.
Like Mr. Siegel, Mr. Ankrim said he still believed that stocks would have bigger returns than bonds over time. Over the next five years, Mr. Ankrim said, investors should expect annual gains of about 7.5 percent on stocks and about 4.4 percent on bonds.
For an investor with a conservative, diversified portfolio that is 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds, that would translate to gains of about 6.25 percent annually, or a total five-year gain of about 35 percent before taxes and the effects of inflation. For a more aggressive investor with 80 percent of money in stocks, it would translate to 6.88 percent annual gains, or almost 40 percent in five years.
Those projected returns may sound unattractive to investors wistful for the late 1990's, but they would be an about-face in the right direction, said Kurt Brouwer, a financial adviser at Brouwer & Janachowski in Tiburon, Calif.
"In the first order, individual investors would just like to make some money, whether it's 5 percent, 10 percent or 20 percent," he said. "They would just like to feel like they are starting to make some progress again."
Referring to the market's five consecutive years of gains of more than 19 percent, followed by three years of decline, Mr. Ankrim said "there's nobody out there that had any investment experience like this." The intensity and duration of the sell-off that started in early 2000 were new to almost all current investors, he said.
"If there is a very thin silver lining to the last six years, it's that there isn't any investor out there who doesn't know what risk feels like," Mr. Ankrim said. "People who got into the market in 1997, '98 or '99 had no sense of what risk in an equity market really looked like." Now they should know how much they can stomach, he said.
Like Mr. Ankrim, Mr. Brouwer is urging investors to return their focus to the fundamentals of investing: setting goals, like being able to pay college tuition and to retire in comfort, and deciding how much risk to take to meet them. "I'm a long-term investor," said Mr. Brouwer, who is 51 and has two sons younger than 6. "Most people are, but they can certainly get distracted. In that sense, nothing really has changed. It's time for back-to-basics investing."
Stock bulls take heart from market analyses by the likes of Mr. Siegel and the Leuthold Group of Minneapolis. According to Leuthold data, stocks have risen in value over every 10-year period since the early 1940's. In that span, the average gain for all 10-year periods was 11.2 percent. 
Mr. Brouwer said he was willing to accept that the market might be headed into a period like the 1970's, when it made little progress. (The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was only 4 percent higher at the end of 1978 than it had been nine years before.)
That would not necessarily be cause for alarm, he said. For reassurance, he points to the exploits of Warren Buffett, who built his reputation by racking up impressive gains in the 1970's.
Unlike Mr. Siegel, Mr. Brouwer is an advocate of actively managed stock funds. He believes he can choose seasoned managers who can outperform the market or particular benchmarks by picking stocks. "We believe, looking forward, that brainpower is really going to be important in the next 10 years," Mr. Brouwer said. "Stock pickers are going to do very well."
Academic studies have shown that when all of their costs are included, most managed funds do not perform as well as index funds that try to attain the return of the overall market. In his book, Mr. Siegel reported that, since 1971, the average stock fund's annualized return had fallen short of the market's by almost 1.5 percentage points, excluding fees.
One exceptional period, Mr. Siegel noted, was 1975 through 1983. During that nine-year stretch, he said, the average mutual fund outperformed the market. He attributed that anomaly to the performance of stocks of small companies, which returned more than twice as much as the S.& P. 500 over that period. Mr. Siegel said he did not expect another golden age of small-capitalization stocks anytime soon.
"Small stocks have held up pretty well," he said. "I don't think they're particularly attractive right now coming out of a bear market."
Most investors would be well advised to put the bulk of their long-term investments into the broadest market index funds or shares of index funds that trade on a stock market, Mr. Siegel said. He recommended avoiding investment grade corporate bonds because he expects interest rates to rise. Instead, he said, he preferred lower-grade bonds.
Mr. Brouwer countered that index funds worked well in the late 1990's when almost all stocks were rising and stock pickers were confounded. But in the wake of the long sell-off, he said, the market looks especially inefficient, with prices of some stocks far out of line with their true values.
"Some of the funds we use are buying companies whose market values are equal to the cash they have on hand," Mr. Brouwer said. "We're at one of the time periods where all the value people are finding great things to buy. Schumpeter talked about creative destruction of capitalism. We're seeing that now."
Mr. Brouwer says he tells clients to hope for the best but to plan for the worst case.
"Can you get double-digit returns?" he said. "Sure you can, but we don't assume that."
Mr. Brouwer says he buys a mix of value funds -- those whose managers hunt for bargains -- and so-called growth funds, building portfolios of 10 to 12 funds for each client. Among his favorites are Vanguard Capital Opportunity, FPA Capital, Selected American fund, Westport Select and Legg Mason Value Trust.
"We're looking for people we think are really smart and have been through the wars for many years, people you'd feel comfortable turning your money over to for 5 to 10 years," he said.
As examples, he cited the managers of Selected American, who have managed the fund to an annual gain of 11 percent over the last 10 years; Robert Rodriguez, who has managed FPA Capital to a 10-year annualized return of 15.5 percent; and Bill Miller, whose Legg Mason Value Trust has beaten the market for 12 consecutive years.
Still, each of those funds has lost money over the last year and the Legg Mason fund has had average losses of 11.9 percent a year over the last three years.
"That's the joy and the sorrow of being in the stock market," Mr. Brouwer said. "There's no way out of that. You can't participate in the stock market without taking some hits along the way."

HEADLINE: How the Well-to-Do Are Making Do 

BYLINE:  By KATHERINE ROSMAN 

 BODY:
LOOKING very apres ski, Jeff Cohen, barefoot in a pair of gray sweat pants, surveyed the five-bedroom mountaintop home on 10 richly remote acres in Stowe, Vt., where he and his family were spending their winter holiday.
 "I could have bought a place like this for a million dollars," Mr. Cohen, a 39-year-old investment adviser from Indianapolis, said with the casually confident tone of the affluent. He fiddled with the elaborate remote control for the entertainment center. . 
 Two years ago, holidays for the Cohens meant spending thousands of dollars in four-star hotels. Even so, the rooms never felt large enough for the two adults and their two young children to spread their wings. The Cohens were considering a $500,000 time-share apartment. Then Mr. Cohen happened upon Private Retreats, a three-year-old club whose benefits glittered in his eye for an unfamiliar reason. 
"It's a pretty good deal," he said. For $6,750 a year, plus the $185,000 membership fee, refundable if they want to leave the club, the Cohens get access to 25 vacation properties from Tortola to Telluride at $150 a night -- about the price of a high-season room at a Ramada Inn in Vermont.
"Arguably, I bought it for 185 grand," Mr. Cohen proudly said of the vacation house, which came with services worthy of a high-end spa. A Private Retreats hostess had logs ablaze in three fireplaces before the Cohens arrived. Rolling Rock and Champagne were chilling on ice. A masseuse would come by later. "This isn't home," Mr. Cohen said, "but it's pretty close."
That's if you don't mind sharing your home away from home with 190 other Private Retreats members.
Meet the new economy class. They are millionaires, mostly under 50. Rich by most of the world's standards but just comfortable by their own, they are tightening the belt but trying not to forgo the indulgences. Despite a precipitous fall of net worth among post-baby-boomers in the last two years, their appetite for the good life remains voracious.
Everyone from Harry Winston, the legendary jeweler, to couturiers like Christian Dior to the automotive, tourism and aircraft industries are catering to the new "frugal elite," as Rob McGrath, chief executive of Private Retreats calls affluent bargain hunters like Mr. Cohen. To vie for the precious dollars spent on elite goods in a down economy, marketers are retooling their product lines, creating modest alternatives to traditional luxuries before their customers (immodestly) ask. . Harry Winston has introduced a less expensive Twelve to Twilight line with pieces starting at $6,500. (The company spokeswoman, Carol Brodie Gelles, insisted that demand for smaller pieces, not the economy, led to the lower prices.) Rather than pay $30,000 for a haute couture Christian Dior wedding dress, brides can now wear embroidered satin bridal pieces by Dior for $1,700 to $13,000. And instead of paying all those first-class fares, moguls can buy their own jets for $850,000.
"When the stock market goes down, you see a lot of people begin to make more prudent choices," Mr. McGrath said. "Still, after 10 years of the go-go 90's, it's hard to give up the good life."
Bentley Motors, whose plain-vanilla models start at $200,000, often soaring to twice that after customizing, plans to offer a 2003 Continental GT Coupe retailing at $150,000. The model will have its debut late this year, and John Crawford, Bentley's director of public relations for the Americas, said the company expects to sell all 1,200 of the 2003 models that will be produced. (Mr. Crawford says Bentley usually sells about 500 cars a year.)
The frugal elite are in their 30's, 40's and early 50's, and are generally self-made. They are entrepreneurs and senior executives of midsize companies who are not averse to taking well-researched risks. Many have a net worth between $3 million and $15 million, according to Mr. McGrath. They have lost money in the dismal stock market but have not gone broke. David Wolfe, the creative director of the Doneger Group, a retail consulting firm that specializes in luxury fashion merchandising, characterized them as men who now feel that "it's no longer chic to have paid too much." 
(Scant statistics exist on the number of millionaires and their demographics. A report last year by Merrill Lynch/Cap Gemini Ernst & Young said that 2.2 million people in North America had investible assets of over $1 million, not including real estate, in 2001. The author of the report, Christopher Humphries, is forecasting that globally, the number of people in that category will show a drop for 2002, which would be the first decline since 1992.)
' In July, Hummer brought out its H2 model with a sticker price of $52,000 -- less than half the cost of its $116,000 H1 model.
"I thought we would do well," said Mike DiGiovanni, who oversees the Hummer brand for its parent company, General Motors. "But I never thought we'd do what we're doing. Last month, we sold 3,870 units without any discounts."
Luxury purveyors have always sought to entice the upwardly mobile, explained Dennis Virag, the president of the Automotive Consulting Group, a trend-tracking company. But the new availability of down-market vehicles with luxury brand names isn't just a reflection of marketers' desire to bring in younger, less well-established buyers. "What the manufacturers are doing is positioning for the rebound," Mr. Virag said, speaking of the economy. "And the luxury market is where they make much of their money." 
Some companies are taking sizable risks. They build their core appeal on extravagance, opulence and the suggestion that their products aren't really all that accessible. When discussing the benefits of his company's $150,000 GT Coupe, Mr. Crawford, the Bentley spokesman, was quick to point out, "It is not cheap -- it is less expensive."
Other brands find themselves only coincidentally well-positioned. Five years ago, when the market was hot, Vern Raburn founded Eclipse Aviation, a New Mexico manufacturer of private jets. "The frugal millionaire, the frugal multimillionaire -- that's our guy," said Mr. Raburn. With that person in mind, Eclipse hopes to retail its Eclipse 500 jet for $850,000 by 2005. The cost of operating such planes can easily run $200,000 a year.
The price has not scared off buyers because the median price for comparable jets is around $4 million. Eclipse has $2.5 billion in orders, Mr. Raburn said.
Manufacturers aren't entirely ignoring the more traditional markets for women. Designers of the most expensive bridal gowns are looking to the near affluent. "There are some really top-end designers like John Galliano and Christian Lacroix who are more rigorously going after the so called ready-to-wear bridal market," said Deborah Moses, editor in chief of Elegant Bride. Such dresses start at $2,500 compared with a $25,000 starting price for most couture gowns.
"It's not just the privileged who have access to these kind of products," she said.
Witness the reaction of Ms. Brodie Gelles, when asked about Harry Winston's new Twelve to Twilight line. "We are not offering products that are $200 at Harry Winston," she said sharply, in case anyone might suspect that the company is seeking a less exclusive clientele.
The company had its best holiday season in six years, largely because of the new line, which sold out, save two pieces. (The fact that Jennifer Lopez received a Harry Winston engagement ring just in time for holiday shopping didn't hurt.)
For some elite brands, catering to a less exclusive customer base may ultimately affect the brand, said Julie Cantwell, a reporter for Automotive News. Now that Mercedes-Benz is retailing its M-Class cars in the $30,000 range, Ms. Cantwell said that industry observers are skeptically asking: "What does that do to the brand? Does it tarnish it? Is Mercedes still aspirational, now that it's attainable?"
Brands relatively new to the luxury marketplace are exempt from that scrutiny. At Hummer, for example, no one is trying to put distance between the company and consumers like Jack Guy, 41, a successful photographer who specializes in celebrity portraiture. Last year, when he moved from New York City to Malibu, he bought an H2 because, he said, it was in keeping with the ethos of the times.
"It gets O.K. mileage, it holds gear and it looks good when you show up," he said. "This car is worth what it costs."
One day, when the economy picks up and when he has a bigger garage, Mr. Guy plans to indulge in an H1 as well.
Value is one of the most potent motivators for the frugal elite, impelled by the Internet market collapse and the accounting scandal. People threw money at institutions that had no real substance, said Jonathan Weber, a lawyer in Chicago. 
In the current economy, elite brands like Mercedes, Bentley and BMW will not sustain their market shares without basic value, he said, adding, "In the past, they didn't need to because people would still pay."
There is some small irony in the fact that the luxury market is now offering some of the best deals around, said Jerry Maglio, the owner of a telecommunications consulting boutique in Denver and a Private Retreats member. Between March and September 2003, he and his family will vacation in private homes in Colorado, Hawaii and Las Vegas, among other places.
In June they will spend a week on a houseboat cruising Lake Powell in Arizona. The package includes personal valet service, ski lift tickets, golf course greens fees and local spa access.
He considers the Private Retreats membership "one of my smartest investments."
Even for thrift-minded people, the concept of traveling or living like a billionaire on a millionaire's budget can be difficult to ignore. "We're very blessed and we have a nice home," said Dick Cray, president of Premium Beverage, a liquor and wine distributor in Kansas. "But I'm not going to spend what I call stupid money. We still buy tuna fish on sale."
Still, Mr. Cray is not above temptation. "A jet for under a million?" he mused recently. "Well, that gets your attention."

HEADLINE: Made in China, Bought in China 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
RARELY has a big international company spun its wheels as fecklessly as General Motors did when it first raced into China. Amid notions of fabled riches -- if just one in a hundred Chinese drove Chevrolets! -- G.M.'s 1992 foray collapsed after the company made about 300 pickup trucks, traded insults with its Chinese partner and entered local lore as another fool mesmerized by China's mythical market.
 G.M. has a different story to tell now. Its four flexible production lines churn out a subcompact family car, a leather-lined executive sedan and six other models -- 110,000 cars in 2002. Industry experts estimate that G.M.'s profit margins are at least twice as high on cars it makes in China as on similar models made in the United States. It is the skeptics, G.M. executives now say, who look like dupes. 
 "We had our moments of agony," said Philip Murtaugh, the company's top executive for China. "But I look back now and can say that China has been the smoothest and most successful venture G.M. has undertaken in recent history." 
A year after China joined the World Trade Organization, and two decades after it began allowing foreign companies to invest locally, China is no longer the impenetrable enigma and inevitable money pit it long seemed. Plenty of foreign investors still lose money. But they are increasingly outnumbered by multinationals making profits that if not quite justifying the exaggeration of the 1990's, at least make China an indispensable part of their global operations.
Just as remarkable is the way they are making money. Foreign companies have long taken advantage of China's low-cost skilled labor to make goods for export: China is the leading exporter in the developing world, with foreign-financed companies accounting for about half, or $275 billion, of China's total exports last year.
But many multinationals have shifted their sights to the domestic market, which has become more lucrative and more openly competitive than many imagined even a few years ago. China's economy, defying the global slowdown, has had economic growth rates of 7 to 8 percent in recent years. While most Chinese cannot afford even low-end foreign-made goods, the average annual income of people living in eastern China has reached $1,200 a year, creating a lower-middle-income market of 470 million people -- larger than in every other country in the world except India. 
Companies invested record amounts in China last year, probably more than $55 billion, primarily because they now aim to tap Chinese consumers as well as its workers.
ALREADY, the Chinese buy more cellphones than consumers anywhere else. They buy more film than the Japanese. They now buy as many vehicles as the Germans. Foreign companies dominate sales in those categories and have a hefty presence in scores of others, like DVD players, electrical power, heavy equipment, shampoo, software, even hamburgers.
Foreign companies operating in China are not required under local accounting rules to provide financial information about their operations, and most decline to provide details for, they say, competitive reasons. Still, growing numbers of multinationals are boasting that their China business now pads their global bottom line.
For companies like Siemens of Germany and Motorola of the United States, China has become the single most important market for mobile phone handsets and equipment, accounting for billions of dollars in annual revenue and outsized profits, their executives in China say.
Toshiba, the Japanese electronics and industrial equipment giant, once used China as an export base. It now sells two-thirds of what it makes in its 34 China-based operations to the Chinese. Local sales reached $2 billion in 2001, according to the company's China president.
McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken have 700 Chinese restaurants between them and open scores more each year. Eastman Kodak controls an estimated 63 percent of the domestic market for rolled film, prompting some grumbling in the Chinese news media that it has become a near monopoly. Even Starbucks has found plenty of urban tea drinkers ready to spend $2.50 for a latte.
A few companies have turned to their China operations to support parent companies that have hit hard times. The fallen telecom titans Lucent Technologies and Nortel have suffered enormous losses globally but continue to benefit from big China contracts, including a nearly $1 billion order placed when China's president, Jiang Zemin, visited the United States in October.
Siemens's consistent profits on its nearly $4 billion in China sales "help make up for losses we've suffered in other parts of the world," says Peter A. Borger, chairman of its China holding company.
AES, the power company based in Arlington, Va., once settled for low-single-digit returns from the seven power plants in which it invested around China. But while AES struggles to pay off debt and restructure operations at home, returns from China have improved substantially.
"China is now the best-performing business in the whole corporation and one of the top cash generators," said Bill Ruccius, president of AES Orient. "I go home these days with a much nicer story to tell." 
The success of a growing number of companies cuts against the persistent stereotype that China is a continental sinkhole for foreigners.
Since the age of Marco Polo, Westerners have tried, and usually failed, to create profitable businesses with the Middle Kingdom. Royal trade delegations failed to pry open the markets in the 1700's. British textiles makers never succeeded in lengthening Chinese shirttails by a foot, as the most exuberant among them imagined doing in the 19th century.
 WHEN China opened its doors to Western investment in the 1980's, almost all of the pioneers struck out. AT&T, Chrysler, McDonnell Douglas, Goldman Sachs and Occidental Petroleum were among the global brand names that invested heavily, hoping to reap a bonanza. By the mid-1990's, every one of them had scaled back amid losses, inconsistent government policy and brighter opportunities elsewhere.
Though Procter & Gamble and a handful of other early investors began making sizable sales and profits in the mid-1990's, they were regarded as aberrations. Sooner or later, the prevailing wisdom had it, Chinese consumers would reject foreign-made products. The Communist government, it was thought, was happy to use foreign businesses to strengthen its domestic market and transfer technology but would ultimately make it impossible for them to collect steady profits at the expense of domestic rivals.
"Like adventurers in the quest for some fabled relic, investors press unendingly forward -- if only on the basis that the legend may one day prove real," Joe Studwell, a leading commentator on the Chinese business world, wrote in his book "The China Dream," published last year. "The China investment proposition came down -- as it always had -- to hopes for the future."
To an extent, the image of China as a fickle, ornery place to do business is grounded in reality. China's corrupt legal system has only begun to honor property rights. Chinese entrepreneurs, with tacit support from local government officials, aggressively pirate Western products like cellphones, shampoo and software. 
Tripping over one another to court China's bureaucrats, multinationals have overpaid for licenses, industrial land and office space. Those costs, along with the fact that they can rarely identify even small niches that are free of fierce competition, often mean steady losses.
Though P.& G. created the market for shampoo in the country -- it promoted Head and Shoulders beginning in the late 1980's, when most Chinese washed their hair with soap -- it has more recently run into difficulties, former company officials and retail industry experts say.
Rampant piracy of its shampoos and its Tide and Ariel laundry detergent brands hurts sales. Once-sleepy domestic brands, like White Cat laundry detergent and Slek shampoo, have challenged P.& G. as top sellers. That has confined P.& G. and Unilever of Europe, with their higher costs, to the narrow premium end of the market.
Other ardent suitors have withdrawn entirely. Maytag announced plans to sell its stake in a China joint venture last year after suffering persistent losses. Leading international brewers, like Bass of Britain, Foster's of Australia and Miller of the United States, steamrolled into China in the 1990's but have pulled back. Even Durex, the condom maker, has had to sue domestic rivals that it contends stole its brand name and undermined sales.
Yet the broader picture may be more sanguine.
Huang Yasheng, a professor at the Harvard Business School and an expert on foreign investment in China, argues that the undiminished enthusiasm of foreign companies reflects weaknesses in China's half-state-run, half-private economy that outsiders can exploit. China's failure to overhaul its money-losing state industries, and its traditional ideology-based discrimination against local private firms, has allowed foreigners to sell many high-technology goods that the government once saw as vital national priorities, he says.
Mr. Huang also disputes the idea that foreigners routinely lose money. Government statistics show that foreign-financed companies received about $27 billion in dividends in 2000, compared with $6 billion in 1996. The total volume of incoming investment has grown more slowly over the same period, suggesting that companies are making better returns on capital, he said.
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund, examining average returns for foreign investors in developing countries during the mid- to late 1990's, found that companies with operations in China, much like those in Brazil, Mexico and Turkey, earned returns of 13 percent to 14 percent on invested capital. China was only average among emerging markets during the period, but investors did substantially better there than those who put money in India, where returns were just 6 percent.
"Foreign companies are not being stupid," Mr. Huang said. "Even in many of the capital-intensive industries, you see Western firms making good profits because domestic firms are so weak."
The auto industry, for example, has proved ripe. Though the government once tightly controlled nearly all aspects of production, investment and sales, it has relaxed its grip in recent years.
A more genial regulatory environment has paid off for G.M. After its initial frustration, the company agreed to open a modern factory with a Shanghai partner in 1997. Critics derided G.M. for agreeing to invest $1.5 billion in China after flopping miserably. Many also argued that its decision to make a high-end Buick sedan geared to Chinese executives looked risky.
The Buick sold briskly, however. Late last month, the company unveiled a remodeled Buick tailored to the local market. It has a bright chrome grill and a plush interior, with DVD players on the back of the front seats for people who ride in the rear. G.M. has had little trouble adding models, including several aimed at Chinese families. The company had hoped to sell 100,000 vehicles annually after five years of operation, but it reached that annual target in November, a year and a month ahead of schedule.
 LIKE G.M., many other multinationals stumbled before finding their footing. Microsoft found trouble almost as soon as it began marketing its Windows software in 1995. It peddled a version of the program translated into Mandarin by Taiwanese employees, who embedded some standard Taiwanese anti-Communist phraseology in the Chinese-language entry system, alarming mainland users.
Beijing has also encouraged local companies to adopt the Linux operating system, the free rival to Windows, because of domestic fears that the American government could use the secret Windows software code to gather information surreptitiously, a suspicion Microsoft called unfounded. Moreover, some 90 percent of Chinese computers run illegally copied versions of Microsoft's software.
Yet Microsoft has begun to turn things around. Late last year, it persuaded nearly all the major Chinese computer makers to pre-install -- and prepay Microsoft -- for the latest operating system, Windows XP. The Chinese news media have reported that the payment is nearly $80 a computer, not much less than what American computer makers pay.
"China is really improving the environment across the board for software makers," said Tom Robinson, one of Microsoft's Asia executives. He said the company's revenue in China is growing at a 40 percent rate, but he declined to provide numbers.
 IN the hypercompetitive market for consumer electronics, where nearly all the major international brand names have battled local companies, no one makes a consistent profit, industry analysts say. One exception in 2001 was Toshiba's joint venture in the northeastern city of Dalian, where it makes high-end projection TV's for wealthy Chinese.
"Of the 70 companies making color television in China, just one, ours, made a profit in 2001," said Nobumasa Hirata, the chief executive of Toshiba China, citing Chinese government statistics. "That shows that it is difficult, but that it can be done."
Over all, Toshiba's far-flung China operations, making notebook computers, refrigerators and industrial automation equipment, among other things, now operate in the black, though only marginally so, Mr. Hirata said. He said China suffers from an inadequate legal system and favoritism for local companies. But, he added, Toshiba has found the market more promising than his bosses in Tokyo had expected.
"The stereotype is still a country that has cheap labor, for export only," Mr. Hirata said. "But we have been surprised to see how big the domestic market has become."
For mobile-telephone companies, China long ago went beyond the realm of potential. By the end of the year, China had registered more than 200 million mobile-phone users. Two foreign companies, Motorola and Nokia of Finland, have dominated handset sales. They joined Ericsson of Sweden and Siemens in supplying equipment for China's mobile telecommunications networks.
Domestic producers have bulked up and forced prices down. But locals like TCL and Bird have yet to catch the foreign rivals. Motorola increased its share this year, jumping ahead of Nokia and accounting for nearly a third of all handset sales, according to local government data.
Motorola's success took patience. It has invested $3.5 billion in China in the last decade and built a semiconductor plant in Tianjin that is the first of its kind in China. Now the country accounts for almost 15 percent of Motorola's global revenue, company executives say.
Though telecommunications has long been a sensitive area in the one-party state, Motorola officials say Beijing has started to treat foreigners and domestic companies comparably. That eases fears that China will one day nationalize the industry.
"We used to all have to be government relations experts because any time anything came up we all had to deal with the government," said Jim Gradoville, a top company executive in China. "But increasingly it's clear that the deck is by no means stacked against us."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
A Bond Manager Says It's Time for a Dose of Risk

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
IN mid-December, Bill Gross, the portfolio manager of the $66 billion Pimco Total Return fund, shifted about 15 percent of the money in his personal 401(k) account into riskier territory: emerging-markets bonds and American junk bonds.
 Other bond investors may also want to consider such moves because, as Mr. Gross put it, "the salad days of the bond market are over." He is already adding risk to the Total Return portfolio, the world's largest mutual fund. 
 For three years, bonds have outperformed stocks by a wide margin. Now Mr. Gross thinks bond prices and yields will neither fall nor rise very much, which means that a small stock market rally could leave bonds in second place this year. 
As recently as last fall, Mr. Gross took a different view. Bonds were more attractive then because he worried about deflation and thought stocks would not be fairly valued until the Dow Jones industrial average fell to 5,000.
He is more sanguine about the economic outlook now but still does not think the economy is ready to take off. "I don't think it will necessarily thrive," he said, "but I think it will survive."
In this lukewarm environment, he does not think that his Total Return fund will be able to do better than a return of 4 percent to 5 percent this year, about half the fund's return in 2002 and in 2001 and well below the 11.6 percent return in 2000.
The reason for the lower expected return is simple: interest rates fell last year to levels not seen in decades and, absent another recession or some new terrorist attack, they cannot go much lower, he said. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.57 percent in October, the lowest since 1958. By Dec. 31, that yield had risen to only 3.82 percent.
If bond yields don't fall, there will be no capital gain for investors as bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, rise. Last year, half the 11.6 percent total return from the Treasury market came from the rise in prices as yields fell.
The return for investors this year is likely to be just the interest rate on the bonds they own, minus some capital losses as interest rates rise modestly and push prices lower, Mr. Gross said.
To get a return of 4 to 5 percent, Mr. Gross said, he will have to add some risk to the Pimco portfolio by moving money from safe Treasuries to emerging-markets bonds from countries like Brazil and Mexico, which offer much higher interest rates.
In an interview last month, Mr. Gross said he expected to increase the holdings of emerging-markets bonds in the Total Return fund to 5 percent from 4 percent during the first quarter this year.
He might also pick up a "pinch" of high-yield, or junk, bonds for the Total Return fund, he said. But while he likes junk bonds for his own portfolio, he is more comfortable in the Total Return fund with bonds like those of AT&T and Sprint, which are at the bottom of the investment grade category but still offer yields like those of junk bonds. He said that emerging-markets bonds gave him as high a risk position as high-yield bonds. But, he added, "I would not dissuade investors who cannot buy a 30-year Mexican bond or a Brazilian C bond" on their own. "I wouldn't dissuade them from buying a pinch of high yield," he said.
High-yield, emerging-markets and low-rated investment grade bonds bolster return in two ways. First, the bonds pay higher interest rates, easily more than twice those of comparable Treasuries. The other boost is through capital gains. 
IN improving economy in the United States and abroad is likely to be more of a plus for riskier bonds than for Treasuries. 
Economic growth may make investors worry about inflation and shift their assets into stocks, diminishing demand for all bonds. But a stronger economy can markedly improve the outlook for emerging-markets economies and the companies that sell junk bonds or lower-rated investment grade bonds. As a result, their prices are not as likely to fall as much as those of Treasuries, giving them a better total return.
But an investor has to pick the right time to take on added risk. As it turned out, 2002 might not have been the best year to do that because the Treasury market did quite well. Many bond fund managers, including Mr. Gross, did not think that Treasuries could rally as much as they did last year, so they lifted their exposure to higher-yield bonds, like those from emerging markets, downtrodden telecommunications companies and European governments to bolster return.
In Mr. Gross's case, this meant that he had less invested in Treasuries than his benchmark, the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Index, so outperforming the benchmark was difficult. In 2002, after fees, the fund had a total return of 9.69 percent, less than the 10.26 percent return for the index.
The return for the year and the gap between the fund's performance and the index's would have been worse if not for a November-December rally in some of his telecommunications, emerging-market and German bonds. Through September, his fund had a return of 7.57 percent, compared with 8.55 percent for the index.
"It was a November-December miracle," he said, adding that the interest rate cut by the European Central Bank in December finally enabled the German bonds he owned to outperform American Treasuries.
While Mr. Gross is taking on more risk, he said he would be restrained, a reminder of an important reason for buying bonds: they are safer investments than stocks. The goal of the Total Return fund is to make just one percentage point more than its benchmark, which Mr. Gross failed to do last year.
Based on current interest rates, he estimated that the return on the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate for 2003 should be about 4.3 percent, so his fund's target for the year is 5.3 percent.
But for Mr. Gross, falling short of his goal does not mean he will pile on more risk to bolster returns.
"A bond investor has to know the market is not always going to turn in near double-digit returns," he said. "And I don't feel that I have to go and get it for them. The way you survive is to scout out relative opportunities and shrink back into the woodwork when they are not there."

HEADLINE: The World: Breeding Trouble; 
In North Korea, Every New Bomb Is a Greater Peril

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHILE the Bush administration has insisted that North Korea's efforts to expand its nuclear arsenal is not a crisis, most experts believe it is the gravest security threat in Northeast Asia in a decade.
 The danger they see is in the difference between the North Korea of today -- a rogue state that United States intelligence says probably has one or two nuclear bombs -- and a North Korea with an arsenal of six or seven bombs and the means to produce more every year, exactly the fast track the country has put itself on. 
 Not only would such an expansion vastly increase the military threat to American allies and forces in the region, and potentially to the United States itself, it would also add to the risk that North Korea could sell fissile material on the black market. It could encourage nonnuclear states in Asia to build their own nuclear arms. If North Korea were ever to collapse, the task of locating and securing nuclear material would be more complicated. 
Still, Bush administration officials have gone out of their way to play down the significance of North Korea's nuclear effort. As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell put it at the start of last week, "It is not yet a crisis."
There seem to be several reasons the Bush administration has adopted that attitude. Publicly, officials say that the North Koreans are trying to generate a crisis atmosphere to wring concessions from Washington and that they are determined not to play along. 
But a senior official, who asked not to be identified, acknowledged that other factors, especially Iraq, are also at work. With American forces flowing to the Persian Gulf, the administration would like to contain the problem in North Korea while it concentrates on ousting Saddam Hussein.
The Bush administration is also trying to reassure nervous allies, especially South Korea, who fear that tough terms for any negotiations with North Korea will create new tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
Still, many analysts believe that North Korea's latest moves present a threat equal to the one the Clinton administration confronted almost a decade ago when North Korea unloaded the fuel rods from its Yongbyon reactor, raising fears it would reprocess them to produce bomb-grade plutonium. (Eventually, North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for promises of American aid to meet its energy needs in other ways.)
AFTER that crisis passed, American intelligence estimated that the North Koreans still had enough plutonium on hand to make one or two bombs. Though there is no proof that they actually made weapons from the plutonium, the C.I.A. has concluded that they have likely done so, since they have the scientific talent and they have had the time.
Whatever the country's current nuclear capability may be, there is no question that North Korea is poised to rapidly expand its arsenal. By reprocessing spent fuel from the Yongbyon reactor, North Korea could acquire about five bombs worth of plutonium in six months or less, according to current and former American officials. In addition, restarting the reactor itself would churn out enough plutonium for one bomb a year.
North Korea could also increase its arsenal by completing the construction of two larger reactors and by proceeding with its uranium enrichment efforts. North Korea could have a system to enrich uranium by the middle of the decade, the C.I.A. says, producing sufficient fissile material for two bombs a year.
Some administration hard-liners assert that an expanding arsenal does not represent a qualitatively new threat since it is likely that North Korea has already crossed the nuclear threshold. Still, most experts believe that a growing arsenal introduces new dangers.
If North Korea had half a dozen bombs or more it could threaten the South and Japan, and still have weapons left over to try to deter a retaliatory American attack. 
"If you have only one or two bombs you don't have a military strategy," said Robert J. Einhorn, a former senior State Department official, who led talks with North Korea during the Clinton administration. "But when you have six or seven you can develop a strategy of threatening or even using some weapons while holding some in reserve. You can do more than simply fire off a single weapon in desperation or in revenge."
An expansion would be all the more worrisome since North Korea has long been developing ocean-spanning missiles. Its missile efforts are far more advanced than those of Iran and Iraq. North Korea has a moratorium on missile test flights. But if it lifted that moratorium and finished developing its Taepo-Dong 2 missile, it might be able to strike the United States with a nuclear payload. 
Concern over that chain of events, in fact, was a driving force behind the Bush administration's push to build a missile defense. The expansion of North Korea's arsenal would also complicate any contingency plans the Pentagon might have for a pre-emptive strike. It is far more difficult to locate a dozen weapons than it is to find one or two.
Another big worry is that more North Korean nuclear weapons might mean more proliferation. There is no evidence that North Korea has ever sold fissile material. But if it was turning out several bombs' worth of fissile material a year, it would have some to spare. Selling nuclear material would be a serious provocation, but it is a step North Korea might take if it was politically and economically isolated and was trying to stave off collapse. 
"North Korea has a record of selling missiles for cash," said Gary Samore, director of studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the top official on proliferation on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council. "The more nuclear weapons they have the greater the danger is that they could spare some for money, and there certainly would be buyers."
THE expansion of North Korea's nuclear arsenal might also put pressure on South Korea and Japan to follow suit. Referring to the Japanese and South Koreans, Kurt Campbell, who was the Clinton administration's senior Defense Department official on Asia and now is the senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: "Those who have nuclear ambitions are clearly in the minority. But talk about nuclear options would no longer be taboo in polite strategic company."
Adding to the worry is the diplomatic impasse. The United States has said no direct negotiations will take place until North Korea first dismantles its efforts to make highly enriched uranium and freezes its plutonium production. Along with allied nations, it has cut off shipments of heavy fuel oil.
North Korea responded by evicting inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and announcing that it would restart its reactor at Yongbyon and reopen the factory that would reprocess spent fuel.
North Korea's actions contrast with the recent approach taken by Iraq, which has so far provided the latest group of United Nations inspectors unimpeded access.
Iraq, however, is what the United States is concentrating on. The administration is determined to prevent Iraq from joining the nuclear club. American officials have also concluded that an invasion of Iraq can be carried out quickly and at a minimal cost, in contrast to a war with North Korea. American military planning calls for a winter war if Iraq does not voluntarily disarm, and the administration does not intend to be thrown off course by the developments in Asia, however worrisome.
President Bush indicated as much on Thursday. "I believe the situation with North Korea will be resolved peacefully," he said, but Saddam Hussein's "day of reckoning is coming."

Been Down So Long, You Call This Up?

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THE fourth quarter was a good one for stock mutual funds, but the market declined so sharply in the nine previous months that 2002 ended as the third consecutive miserable year. 
 "It was nice to see something go up, but compared to where we were three years ago, it was a drop in the bucket," said Russ Kinnel, the director of funds research at Morningstar Inc. "We are still looking at some pretty sizable losses in many areas." 
 Fueled by the rise in major market averages, which spent the first two months of the quarter rallying from lows set in early October, the average domestic equity fund gained just less than 6 percent in the quarter, according to Morningstar data. But that gain merely pared nine months' worth of sizable losses: for the year, the average domestic equity fund lost more than 20 percent of its value. 
The last 12 months were the worst year for stock funds since 1974 and contrasted sharply with the 1990's, when the group rose in 8 of the 10 years. 
The 2002 declines were breathtakingly pervasive across the fund industry. Lipper Inc., which tracks fund performance, said 96 percent of equity funds finished the year in negative territory.
For the year, only two groups of funds had positive returns: precious-metals funds, up more than 65 percent, and real estate funds, up a bit more than 4 percent, according to Morningstar. 
"Last year was about as bad as it can get," said Thomas M. McManus, the chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities. "But the good thing about the sharp fall in stocks is that it makes the market more resistant to further declines.
"I suppose you could come up with some scenario in which people would want to sell stocks below their October lows," Mr. McManus added. "But we think the market is making a gradual recovery."
Those who did well in 2002 did so by "avoiding mistakes" in the stock market, said Thomas F. Marsico, the president and chief investment officer of Marsico Funds. "If you avoided Tyco, WorldCom and Enron, you outperformed the market," he said. 
At the end of 2001, he said, he was wary about what might happen over the next 12 months. "A year ago, our portfolios were pretty defensive," he said. "We are now somewhat more optimistic." 
It was a good quarter for natural-resources funds, which rode the sharp rise in the price of oil. The end of Brazil's two-stage election process, and the decisive victory of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in the presidential race, was a tonic to Latin American stocks. Emerging-markets funds in general did well, as did most funds that focus on foreign stock markets. 
For bond funds, it was another good quarter -- and a great year. 
Aided by the Federal Reserve's decision in early November to cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point, taxable bond funds gained 2.6 percent in the quarter, and more than 6 percent for the year. 
The year was also the third in a row that bonds outperformed stocks. That had not happened since 1939-41, according to Lehman Brothers. Investors continued to pile money into bond funds, even as interest rates sank to their lowest levels in decades.
Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund flows, said $125 billion to $130 billion poured into taxable bond funds in 2002, a record. "Investments in bond funds have been successful, and investors are not going to be willing to tamper with a winning formula until rising rates dictate another change," Mr. Adler said. 
Since the shift to bond funds began, "investors have not yet suffered in a market of rising rates," he said, noting that as interest rates rise, prices of outstanding bonds fall. 
Mr. Kinnel said he was not sure investors "realize the kind of haircut they are in for if rates go back up a percentage point or two." For much of 2002, gains in bond funds were largely relegated to ultrasafe investments like Treasuries and government-backed mortgage securities. 
But as rates continued to fall in the fourth quarter, and the economy showed a few signs of stabilizing, investors began to buy high-yield, or junk, bonds. For the quarter, high-yield bond funds gained 5.8 percent, according to Morningstar. 
Tom Soviero, who manages the $2.2 billion Fidelity Advisor High Income Advantage fund, said that if one event helped the high-yield market, it was the Fed's rate cut in early November. 
"That was a statement that liquidity was going to be provided," he said. "Also, the equity market helped quite a bit, led by technology and telecommunications stocks." 
Although High Income Advantage was up 15 percent for the quarter, it fell by more than 4 percent for all of 2002. 
"It's been a tough year," Mr. Soviero said. "I'm not bragging. But I hope the recent trend continues." 
It seemed to be a good quarter for technology and telecommunications stocks, which bounced sharply off what some analysts said were oversold levels. Still, many said fundamental indicators suggested weak demand for products from personal computers to fiber optic cable. The recovery, they argued, may be more technical than real. 
Nevertheless, technology funds posted a gain of just under 19 percent in the quarter. And communications funds rose more than 16 percent, according to Morningstar. 
But those gains did little to transform a horrific year for the sector.
For all of 2002, technology funds lost more than 40 percent of their value, according to Morningstar. Communications funds fell more than 34 percent. 
Steven F. Crowley, co-manager of the Kopp Emerging Growth fund, one of the quarter's best performers, has about 90 percent of his fund's assets in health care, medical technology and technology stocks. 
"In our opinion, these stocks went down to a valuation extreme," he said. "If the economy doesn't grow next year, you will be hard pressed to make the case that technology spending is going to grow."

Pursuing Growth, Fund Is a 10-Year Leader

BYLINE:  By RICHARD TEITELBAUM 

 BODY:
IT has been 10 tempestuous years for United States stocks, buffeted as they have been by torrential fear and gale-force greed. So it is appropriate that the manager of one of the top-performing diversified domestic stock funds for the last 10 years keeps an eye on risk. 
 "We're always looking over our shoulders," said, John P. Calamos Sr. of the Calamos Growth fund. "The cornerstone of our investment process is that the way you create wealth over the long term is by managing risk." To mitigate volatility, he relies on various tactics, including keen cash-flow analysis and in-house credit analysis. 
 Surprisingly, these tactics lead him not to safe, high-yielding value stocks, but to expensive growth stocks, including those of Internet companies. The earnings and sales growth rates of the fund's portfolio are both far higher than those of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. It is also noteworthy that Mr. Calamos, though the winner of laurels in the stock market, earned his reputation in bonds. 
Evidently, bond investors can pick stocks well. Calamos Growth, with $2.3 billion in assets, has beaten virtually all comers over the long term. Its Class A shares returned 17 percent, annualized, for the 10 years ended Dec. 31, versus 9.3 percent for the S.& P. 500 and 6.5 percent for the average mid-cap growth fund, according to Morningstar. (For the record, Fidelity New Millennium fund edged out Calamos Growth for the top 10-year spot with a 17.04 percent annualized return, versus 17.02 percent for Calamos.) 
Last year, Calamos lost 15.9 percent, far less than the losses of 23.4 percent for the S.& P. 500 and 27.1 percent for its peer group. (Adjusted for the 4.75 percent load, or sales charge, of the Class A shares, the fund has returned 16.5 percent, annualized, over 10 years, versus 6.3 percent for its peers.)
Mr. Calamos, 62, says his experience as an Air Force pilot in Vietnam informs his investing career. "They are both about managing risk," he said. "You're in a dangerous situation, but it's manageable." 
On a tour as a B-52 pilot with the Strategic Air Command, Mr. Calamos whiled away the time, ready to scramble at a moment's notice. He used the hours to scour financial books, developing an interest in hedging as a way to reduce risk. He also began focusing on convertibles, hybrid securities that combine a bond with an option to convert the security into a fixed number of the issuing companies' common shares. 
Mr. Calamos founded a firm specializing in convertibles and, in the 1980's, experimented with a new way to value them. He applied the Black-Scholes options pricing model, which weighs many variables to determine the value of a stock option, to the option component of convertibles. It was a success.
As institutional money flowed into his firm, Mr. Calamos rolled his individual accounts into the Calamos Convertible fund, one of the first open-end convertible funds. More Calamos funds followed, including, in 1990, Calamos Growth, which holds the stocks of many of the small-cap and midcap growth companies that issue convertibles. 
The funds' adviser, Calamos Investments of Naperville, Ill., now manages $12.8 billion, including nearly $6 billion in one closed-end and seven open-end mutual funds. For the first 11 months of 2002, fund assets have more than doubled, making it the fastest-growing family among the 25 best-selling groups. DESPITE its size, Calamos Investments remains a family business, something Mr. Calamos grew accustomed to while working at his parents' grocery in Chicago. Nick P. Calamos, a nephew, is chief investment officer and a manager of the funds, and John P. Calamos Jr., Mr. Calamos's son, is a manager for the funds as well.
The eclectic Calamos investment process begins with a macroeconomic outlook. John Calamos Sr. contends that the economy is emerging from a shallow, brief cyclical recession. This implies that it will grow slowly, in fits and starts, and suggests a period of low inflation. Consumers will benefit, he said, so the Growth fund has plowed 44 percent of its assets into consumer stocks. He also says productivity growth will be central to maintaining competitiveness, prompting him to buy stocks that stand to benefit from such growth. 
Unlike many equity investors, Calamos Investments pays scrupulous attention to balance sheets. The firm rates all stocks by credit quality, in real time, using a proprietary method. The 15 Calamos analysts gauge how much a company relies on having access to capital to sustain its growth, an approach that has helped the firm steer clear of many recent blowups. 
The firm screens about 5,000 stocks, looking for the top 10 or 20 percent of companies, ranked by factors like accelerating earnings, expanding margins, revenue growth or positive earnings surprises. Recently, the firm has put more emphasis on other kinds of research, including analyses of companies' credit quality. Still, focusing on earnings steered the Growth fund clear of profitless dot-coms in 2000. The fund returned 26.6 percent in that year while the average midcap growth fund lost 5.1 percent.
It falls to Calamos Investments' analysts to do much of the fundamental research. That includes visiting companies, attending conferences and badgering management as the analysts seek to understand a business, focusing on cash flow. They look for companies with returns on capital that are above the industry average. Then analysts seek to figure out how long a company can provide excess returns and develop an intrinsic value for the business based on that calculation. 
For example, Calamos Growth began buying shares of eBay, the online auction company, in late September 2001 at $43.45 a share; it closed 2002 at $67.82. The company has turned in positive earnings surprises each quarter for last two years. Return on capital teeters at 33 percent, according to Nick Calamos, who figures that eBay has at least five years before return on capital falls to the 14 to 15 percent range of a successful bricks-and-mortar retailer. "We think it's a tremendous business model," he said. 
A countercyclical investment is International Game Technology, which makes electronic slot machines and other gambling equipment. "We've always found gaming stocks tend to act well in a recession," John Calamos Sr. said. International Game has a 70 percent market share, leasing machines to casinos that provide the company with a cut of what gamblers lose. Return on capital has been 20 to 25 percent over the last 10 years, a figure that should tumble to about 11 percent over the next decade, Nick Calamos said. Calamos Growth began buying shares in November 2001 at $67 each; they closed 2002 at $75.92. 
The fund has also focused on education. It began buying shares of the Apollo Group, which owns schools and universities, in March 2002 for $35.58 a share; at year-end, the stock traded at $44. Apollo's programs are geared to working adults, many of whom are seeking skills that will improve their productivity. Earnings have grown by more than 30 percent, annualized, over the last five years. Apollo owns 88 percent of University of Phoenix Online, a separately traded Internet-based school.
Return on capital is about 34 percent, which Nick Calamos predicts will fall sharply as the economy gathers momentum. "We expect to be out of it in five years," he said.

Atthe Top of the List, Notable Reversals of Fortune

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
NOT many managers of stock mutual funds had a good 2002. Even many of the top-performing funds for the fourth quarter declined sharply for the year. 
Managers of three of those funds talked about what drove their returns in the fourth quarter and what they expect for the stock market in 2003.

The Phoenix Factor
 For investors in technology, the fourth-quarter rally closed the circle on a very long haul, said Steven F. Crowley, 39, who manages the $239 million Kopp Emerging Growth fund with Sally A. Anderson, 60, and LeRoy C. Kopp, 68. The fund took fifth place for the quarter with a return of 21.3 percent, but it fell 51.7 percent for the year. 
 "Investors have swung from thinking in 2000 that technology companies were the ultimate secular growth story to not even believing that they could be cyclical growth stories," Mr. Crowley said. "The fourth quarter has demonstrated to some folks that these stocks can go up."
Kopp Emerging Growth holds about 70 stocks with a median market capitalization of about $250 million. Roughly 65 percent of its assets are in technology stocks, compared with 16 percent for the Russell 2000.
The managers adhere to a buy-and-hold philosophy, and the fund's turnover averages 20 percent a year, compared with 129 percent, on average, for small growth funds, according to Morningstar.
Nine of the fund's stocks more than doubled in price in the quarter, Mr. Crowley said. Among the biggest winners were Vitesse Semiconductor, which more than tripled. Vitesse supplies high-performance integrated circuits, mostly to systems manufacturers in the fiber optic communications industry.
"We think that much of the value added in the communications hardware business is moving to the chip level," he said. "This stock had been deeply oversold, but investors have realized that the company is solid, and it's a good growth business."
The fund also made money with Vastera, a company in Dulles, Va., that develops international trade management software and services. The stock rose 163 percent. "It's another rebound story," Mr. Crowley said, adding, "International trade is a bigger and bigger part of the global economy, and the company is continuing to expand its footprint to Latin America in Europe."
Rational Software, up 140 percent, is another long-term growth story, he said. Based in Cupertino, Calif., it provides tools to develop and test software by geographically dispersed development teams, Mr. Crowley said. I.B.M. announced a cash acquisition of Rational for $10.50 a share in late 2002; the transaction is expected to close in the next 30 days, he said.
Mr. Crowley looks forward to a better 2003. "We expect these companies to re-establish themselves as growth stories," he said, "and rebuild their credibility with investors who had largely discarded them."

Wireless Wonders
Technology also drove the returns of the $114 million Legg Mason Focus Trust. For the quarter, it was in fourth place over all with a return of 21.4 percent, but it declined 9.1 percent for the year.
Its manager, Robert G. Hagstrom, 46, makes big bets on a small number of stocks; the fund holds no more than 20.
"We were willing to add risk when many high-quality technology and telecommunications companies were mercilessly sold off during July and October," he said.
One of his biggest winners was Nokia, the Finnish cellphone giant. Its American depository receipts rose 17 percent in the quarter.
"It's a big global leader in an economy-of-scale business," Mr. Hagstrom said. "More people are able to afford cellphones, and the models are carrying more and more features."
He also made money on the A.D.R.'s of the Vodafone Group of Britain, up 41 percent. Vodafone is one of the world's biggest wireless providers based on the number of subscribers.
"In technology and telecommunications, the biggest players are the winners because they have the ability to negotiate good deals with customers and suppliers," he said.
He said that he expected Vodafone and Nokia to gain significant numbers of customers, especially among 12- to 18-year-olds. 
The fund's biggest holding is Nextel Communications. "The market mistakenly mispriced the security at the end of the second quarter, when it was down to about $4 share," Mr. Hagstrom said. It ended 2002 at $11.55.
He says he is bullish about this year.
"We recognize that some geopolitical risks need to be resolved," Mr. Hagstrom said. "After that, we believe the market will do substantially better going forward and the economy will pick up speed as companies are willing to hire more workers and increased capital spending."

Counting on Discounts
The $30 million Gabelli Blue Chip Value AAA fund took eighth place in the quarter with a return of 19.6 percent. But it fell 31.65 percent for the year. 
"The stocks that led out of the third quarter were the ones that had taken it on the chin," said the fund's manager, Barbara G. Marcin, 45. "Many companies were tremendously discounted because investors had a fear and loathing for any companies that they perceived to have any risk."
Ms. Marcin says she is a "core value investor." 
"We look for companies with poor earnings or cash flow because of incorrect strategies or bad acquisitions that we expect to get back on their feet in the next one to three years," she added.
She also made money in Nextel, which she described as uniquely positioned among wireless companies because of its "push-to-talk" service, which essentially transforms cellphones into walkie-talkies.
Nextel is about six months to a year ahead of its competitors with that service, she said, so its earnings grew strongly in the last year while other companies' subscriber bases eroded.
Another winner was Hewlett-Packard, up 49 percent. Earnings and cash flow have steadily improved since the company's merger with Compaq last year.
"The multiple is beginning to expand as the luster comes back to Hewlett-Packard's image," she said, "as people see that Carly Fiorina is a quality C.E.O. and the company has a lot of good products."
Ms. Marcin profited from the Sprint Group, which rose 59 percent. "It's a plain rebound story, she said, "because the company got very cheap in the third quarter."
Despite their strong fourth-quarter performance, Sprint and Hewlett-Packard were down for the year and are still undervalued, Ms. Marcin said.
Looking ahead, she says she expects the overall market to strengthen. "There's a broad range of companies and sectors, like telecommunications and drug companies, that are trading at attractive historical multiples," she said.

Broad Real Estate Funds Carry Appeal, and Volatility

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO 

 BODY:
MOST real estate mutual funds invest mainly in real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, which must pay 90 percent of their taxable income as dividends.
 But some funds spice up the mix by concentrating on other forms of real estate investments, and those can have advantages, said Dan McNeela, a fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. "If you go with a fund that limits the manager to REIT's, he has a narrower range of investment choices," he said. "If REIT's are overvalued at the time, he can't look for opportunities elsewhere." 
 The dividend stream from REIT's is a main part of their appeal and helps to stabilize their performance because dividends provide much of the total return, Mr. McNeela said.
By contrast, real estate funds with relatively small holdings of REIT's usually have lower yields, making them more tax efficient but also more volatile. Last year, for example, home builders performed better than REIT's in the first half of the year and worse in the second half, ending at virtually the same level.
The three largest mutual funds that focus on real estate investments other than REIT's are Third Avenue Real Estate Value, CGM Realty and Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity, according to Morningstar.
They have different strategies, but all three funds have had a strong year. Their performance, like that of REIT funds, is generally not closely correlated to the overall stock market, so they can help diversify a portfolio. The three funds returned an average of 3.6 percent in 2002, compared with a decline of 4.2 percent for the average real estate fund, according to Morningstar.
Third Avenue Real Estate Value, with $337 million in assets, favors real estate operating companies because they are not required to pay dividends. "That enables the company to invest substantially more capital to grow the business," said Michael H. Winer, the fund's manager.
It returned 4.2 percent in 2002, including a 1.18 percent yield.
Real estate operating companies make up half of the portfolio, while REIT's account for 25 percent. The rest is invested in real estate management and housing manufacturing companies and in mortgage-backed securities.
Like all funds in the Third Avenue family, it invests in companies that trade at discounts to management's estimates of their net asset value. "Our mantra is 'safe and cheap,' " Mr. Winer said.
The fund's top 10 holdings account for about 60 percent of assets. These include the St. Joe Company, at 8.1 percent of the portfolio. Based in Jacksonville, Fla., the company owns a million acres of mostly undeveloped land in northwest Florida, including 30 to 40 miles of coastline on the Gulf of Mexico. "For many years, this was a sleepy timber company," he said.
Two years ago, St. Joe began selling million-dollar homes and condominiums on the gulf coast. "This is just the tip of the iceberg," Mr. Winer said. St. Joe has donated 1,000 acres to build an airport near Panama City, Fla., that could transform the region, he added.
The CGM Realty fund was entirely invested in REIT's until early 2001, when G. Kenneth Heebner, its manager, decided to bet on home builders, which now account for 60 percent of the portfolio.
"The home-building industry has become a lot more efficient over the last 10 years," he said. "Yet a lot of them are still valued as if they were smaller companies."
TEN of the largest home builders, all CGM Realty holdings, are trading around six times Mr. Heebner's estimate of their 2003 earnings. Home builders traded as high as 20 times earnings in 1984, during another housing boom, he said.
"Obviously, low mortgage rates are important," he said. Although rates have been at 30-year lows, he added, he is not worried about a possible uptick. As long as the population continues to grow through immigration, he said, housing starts should remain at current levels.
"We don't think the home-building business is a growing business; we think it's a stable business," he said.
Shares of the largest home builders will rise as their market share grows, he said. In 2001, the national home builders had 12.8 percent of the market, up from 4.4 percent in 1990. CGM Realty returned 3.5 percent last year, including a yield of 4.33 percent.
The Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity fund also tries to move its investments into strong sectors of the real estate market, said Samuel A. Lieber, the fund's manager. That strategy has led to a shift away from REIT's.
The fund, which does not pay a dividend, returned 3.1 percent in 2002. It holds 45 percent of its assets in the stocks of home builders, 37 percent in REIT's (down from 48 percent in November 2001) and 18 percent in real estate operating companies.
"We don't thumb our noses at REIT's," Mr. Lieber said. "Frankly, that's just not where we see the opportunities at this point."
The fund has $928 million in assets, according to Morningstar, and has been extremely volatile, outperforming nearly all real estate funds in 1995, 1997 and 2001 but falling into the bottom 16 percent of its peer group in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000.
Its investments have been eclectic. At times, the fund has owned theme-park companies like Walt Disney and Six Flags. Today, one of its holdings, at 2.5 percent of the portfolio, is Florida East Coast Industries, which owns a railroad, office parks and real estate development concerns.
Recently, the fund has been selling shares in mortgage REIT's, which invest in loans secured by real estate and use the interest they receive to pay dividends. "They've performed well, but we're at high tide," Mr. Lieber said of the across-the-board increases in their shares this year. In the future, he added, "we'll have to be much more selective."
He eliminated two holdings, Annaly Mortgage Management, based in New York, and FBR Asset Investment of Arlington, Va. Only Impac Mortgage Holdings, based in Newport Beach, Calif., remains, at 4.3 percent of the portfolio, down from 8 percent in early 2002.
Over all, the real estate market could be in for a tough year because the sector typically lags behind an economic recovery, Mr. Lieber said. "We're looking for niche plays," like developers of medical labs or shopping outlets, he said. "Anything so they are not affected by the commodity characteristics of the real estate market."

Affirmative Action Faces a New Wave of Anger

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
IN 1995, when Jennifer Gratz applied to the University of Michigan's flagship Ann Arbor campus, she wanted to become a doctor. When she was rejected, she said she abandoned that ambition.
 "I thought that if the University of Michigan didn't think I was good enough, I wasn't," Ms. Gratz, now 25 and working at a computer company in San Diego, said in an interview last year. "I think my life would be significantly different if I had been admitted." 
 Ms. Gratz's sense that her life would have been different, and better, underlies much of the opposition to the affirmative action at many colleges and universities. And that opposition, in the form of white applicants like Ms. Gratz who argue that their rightful places at the top schools are being given to black and Hispanic students of lesser ability, has been gaining momentum once again. 
Their anxiety -- that not getting into an elite academic institution will lead to a less prosperous and happy life -- is at the heart of the constitutional challenge to the admissions policies of the University of Michigan that the Supreme Court recently decided to hear.
"I sense that the anger is rising," said James O. Freedman, president emeritus of Dartmouth and author of "Liberal Education and the Public Interest" (University of Iowa Press, 2003). "I sense that people whose children go today to a school that's not one of the Top 25 in the U.S. News poll feel defensive, that they have to explain it to friends. It's like a failure."
A measure of this edginess is the rise in early applications to Harvard and Yale, programs that drew relatively few applicants three decades ago. This fall, 2,611 applicants sought early admission to Yale; 7,620 applied for early admission to Harvard. Each represented an increase of nearly 25 percent over last year.
A large number of the students who apply early are middle- and upper-middle-class whites. They apply, at least in part, because their college counselors have told them that the odds of being admitted early are often greater than in the main round -- when, not coincidentally, they will be pitted more directly against black and Hispanic applicants whose race is considered a plus by such colleges.
On the one hand, this frenzy to secure the imprimatur of an Ivy League institution is irrational, at least economically. In 2000, the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the federal Department of Education, examined the earnings of a group of college graduates five years after their graduation and concluded that the selectivity of their alma maters had had a minimal impact. A more important predictor of income was the person's undergraduate major.
Yet, Dr. Freedman acknowledges, these things still count. "I think for the first job, these credentials really do matter," he said. "Going to Dartmouth gets you an entree at Goldman Sachs. How you do at Goldman Sachs is up to you."
Moreover, an earnings survey can capture neither the quality of instruction at an elite college, nor the incalculable boost in status of students (and families) associated with the nation's elite schools. In a nation of few formal class distinctions, the college sticker on one's car may be the most potent.
Such issues are at the heart of the two cases seeking to undo the admissions policies of the undergraduate and law school programs at Michigan.
MS. GRATZ, a B student in high school, is one of the two white plaintiffs challenging the undergraduate policy at Michigan, where black and Hispanic applicants are given a 20-point bonus on a 150-point evaluation scale.
Like other selective universities, Michigan aids minority applicants for two main reasons: to level the playing field and to enrich the educational experiences of whites and nonwhites alike. But had Ann Arbor not given a statistical boost to applicants whose test scores and grades may have been lower than hers, Ms. Gratz contends, she would have had a better chance of getting in.
"They clearly discriminate based on the color of your skin," she said.
To Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College, a fierce race and class struggle is being waged in the arena of highly selective college admissions. "Call it Whites' Rights," said Professor Hacker, whose 1992 book "Two Nations" will be reissued by Simon & Schuster this year. 
To Professor Hacker, those whites who are most up in arms are those who indeed may be at the biggest disadvantage -- those in the lower and middle classes. Upper-class whites, he said, can still afford to attend the top high schools, whether private ones or public schools in the wealthiest suburbs, that place a disproportionate number of their graduates at marquee colleges.
But whites of lesser means, particularly in the Northeast, face competition as never before, not only from blacks and Hispanics but also from Asian-Americans who may have higher test scores. Northeasterners also face competition from applicants from states like Utah and Missouri, who are in relatively high demand because they offer "geographic diversity."
At highly selective private and public colleges, admissions officers acknowledge that they generally demand white applicants with well-educated parents to have the highest SAT scores, often at least a 1400 score on a 1600 scale.
A black applicant with similar grades, particularly one whose parents did not go to college, might get in with an 1150 score. The colleges' reasoning is that children of better-educated parents are exposed to the vocabulary and advanced problem-solving skills that yield higher SAT scores.
Fearing that they will be held to a higher standard, those well-to-do whites (and Asian-Americans, who are not considered minorities at many institutions) may spend thousands of dollars on tutors to help their children raise their SAT scores or to enlist the services of for-hire guidance counselors, who help students hone their applications, and then lobby colleges on their behalf. One such service in Manhattan, known as Ivy Wise, charges $29,000 for its top junior-senior package. (The company also counsels several minority applicants without charge.)
FOR those families that came to see a Harvard education as a birthright passed from one generation to the next, the idea that a so-called legacy applicant may be rejected in favor of an affirmative-action one can be a source of outrage. So, too, for a white applicant with near-perfect scores and grades who is passed over in favor of a minority applicant at the same high school with lower scores and grades.
Asked how, as president of Dartmouth, he soothed such anger, especially when addressing a parent, Dr. Freedman said he would typically respond: "Those kids seemed somehow to us to add qualities to the class that your son or daughter did not, which only may mean that your son or daughter was like 75 percent of the class that we've already admitted."
It's an answer that is unlikely to mollify the excluded.

Gifts Flow , but a Bit More Slowly

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino (COMPILED BY HUBERT B. HERRING) 

 BODY:
Even the country's top philanthropists seem to have been hit by the weak economy.
 Sure, big gifts still flowed in 2002, but nowhere near the amounts in recent years, said Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which last week published its list of the top 10 gifts and pledges by individuals in 2002. 
 "The extraordinary kinds of gifts didn't happen," she said -- nothing like the $2 billion that Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, gave in 2001 to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gateses were not even on the 2002 list.
The largest single gift last year was a $375 million bequest to the Annenberg Foundation from the publishing executive Walter Annenberg, who died in October.
Second was a $300 million gift from Eli Broad, chairman of SunAmerica, and his wife, Edythe, to the Broad Foundation. Third was $220 million from Thomas Monaghan, founder of Domino's Pizza, to create Ave Maria University near Naples, Fla. Vivian Marino

Holding Republican Governors' Feats to the Fire

BYLINE:  By DANIEL GROSS; Daniel Gross writes the Moneybox column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
THE Republican governors were the farm team for their party in the 1990's. Assisted by a national boom that produced a gusher of state revenues, these executives made their names by cutting taxes and pushing for innovative solutions on welfare, education, health care and the environment. 
 At the same time, they were staunch allies to Republicans in Washington, cooperating in efforts to reduce the federal role in designing and carrying out social policy. 
 No wonder, then, that so many of these 1990's governors are now in Washington. Besides the president himself, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and four cabinet secretaries have been drawn from their ranks. 
Today, the current Republican governors find their ability to innovate, thus making their national mark, more sharply constricted. Many of them were elected in time to spend money during the boom, and even lower taxes, but now they are finding themselves either cutting the very programs that were dear to their hearts or raising the taxes they cut. 
It was easy to be fiscally conservative and socially innovative in flush times. 
"The states have done the easy work," said Chris Edwards, director of fiscal policy at the Cato Institute, the libertarian group. Now, he said, during hard times, "that's when we start to get more smoke and mirrors."
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group, estimates that the states will face a collective deficit for the 2004 fiscal year -- which for most states starts in June 2003 -- between $60 billion and $80 billion. 
So far, Republicans are proving that they, like their Democratic counterparts, are not averse to a little creative accounting. Bill Owens, the governor of Colorado, received an A in the Cato Institute's recent state fiscal report card. It will be interesting to see if he can repeat the performance. 
To balance his state's deficit, Mr. Owens has turned to gimmicks. In November, he proposed cutting nearly half a billion from the $13.8 billion current fiscal budget in part by delaying salary payments to government employees by one day -- to July 1, 2003, from June 30, 2003, the last day of the fiscal year. That would push $268 million of spending into the 2003-4 budget, which is likely to be facing a deficit, too. 
Bob Taft, governor of Ohio and the vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is facing a $4 billion deficit in the coming fiscal year. 
HIS response? He has asked for across-the-board cuts in government spending -- except for education and Medicaid, which is a little like saying you're going to cut spending on soda, except on products made by Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Education and Medicaid are most of what states spend money on.
"Since he came into office, we haven't seen strong leadership in evaluating the fundamentals of the Medicaid program," said Sam Staley, president of the Buckeye Institute, a public policy group in Columbus, Ohio.
Dirk Kempthorne, the governor of Idaho, is a Republican in the mold of President Bush. The proudest achievement of his first term as governor was a $100 million tax cut. But he has also devoted more state resources to education -- which eats up about two-thirds of the state's general fund. 
In Mr. Kempthorne's first term, education funding per student rose 25 percent, more than twice the rate of inflation. Last summer, in his re-election campaign, Mr. Kempthorne vowed to increase education financing even more. But now he faces a shortfall of about $100 million. Something has to give.
Some governors are turning to Washington for help. Jeb Bush, governor of Florida, for example, is asking his brother in Washington for more federal money to cover the cost of the new elections equipment mandated by new federal laws. 
George Pataki, the governor of New York, is counting on more federal Medicaid money. But he himself created much of the state's problems. 
MR. PATAKI cruised to a third term last fall by aggressively courting traditional Democratic voters. He expanded Medicaid coverage greatly, and cut a deal to improve pay for the state health care workers' union, which has a large minority component.
"A big part of his political strategy has been to be Mr. Bountiful in the area of health care spending," said E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group.
But at his inauguration last week, Mr. Pataki admitted what everyone in the state had known for months: there's a fiscal crisis. New York faces a deficit of $2 billion in the current fiscal year and a $10 billion gap for next year.
"Now he's in his defining moment, because all the irreconcilables will come a cropper in this budget," Mr. McMahon said. To avoid tax increases, he'll have to reverse course on a lot of the Medicaid expansion that he supported. And to protect Medicaid, he'll have to undo some of the tax cuts that he enacted in his first term.
Yes, Mr. Pataki is one of the more liberal Republican governors, but that doesn't seem to matter. In Oklahoma, Gov. Frank Keating, a tax-cutting conservative, has sharply reduced the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which he helped create in the late 1990's.
One can feel some sympathy for these Republican governors. Raising taxes goes against their party's bedrock beliefs, while slashing popular education and health care programs might hinder efforts to attract more voters. For many, it's a question of whether they want to alienate their base or their more recent converts.

Attention, Skiers: Snowboarders Coming Through

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Snowboarding is not only changing the face of skiing, it is making it younger, too.
 Last year, for the first time in more than a decade, the median age of ski resort visitors fell, to 33 from 34 in 2001, according to the National Ski Areas Association. 
Michael Berry, president of the association, said that 99 percent of the people who leave the sport are aging alpine skiers. He said they are being replaced by snowboarders: 60 percent of those under 20 who are learning to ski use boards. He predicted that in 10 years half the people on the slopes would be snowboarders. 
 Mr. Berry said snowboarding is changing skiing's demographic mix. Snowboarding "is not quite as white, not quite as upper middle class and not quite as suburban," he said. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

If Only a Week Could Last a Whole Year

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks ended the old year on a slight upward trend and began 2003 like a firecracker. Thursday, the opening trading day of the year, was the best first day since 1988. 
 Unexpected good news about the health of the nation's manufacturers was the major catalyst for the Thursday surge. 
A settlement in a contentious, Enron-related lawsuit involving J. P. Morgan Chase and a group of insurance companies also helped. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 297.91 points, or 4 percent, to 8,601.69. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also climbed 4 percent, to 908.59 from 875.40. And the Nasdaq composite index rose 38.77 points, or 3 percent, to 1,387.08.
 Independent power producers, fallen angels in 2002, were the darlings last week. Dynegy, Williams Companies and Calpine posted gains of more than 20 percent on hopes that prices would rebound. 
 On the negative side, shares of Home Depot fell 10 percent for the week after it projected its biggest sales decline ever. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to the price, rose to 4.02 percent, up sharply from 3.81 percent the previous week. KENNETH N. GILPIN

BYLINE:  Compiled by Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
Americans are growing more confident with the safety of the Internet when it comes to conducting business, survey results released last week show.
 The survey, called the Consumer Internet Barometer, questioned 10,000 people nationwide in the fourth quarter last year. 
A third of the respondents said they felt that their online financial transactions would be safe, up from 27.5 percent in the period a year earlier. One-fourth felt that their personal information was safe when making purchases online, up from 21.9 percent. 
 "Consumers' concern about privacy of their personal information has a significant influence on their willingness to engage in business exchanges online," said Lynn Franco, director of the Consumer Research Center of the Conference Board. "This trust barrier is beginning to erode." 
The board, along with NFO WorldGroup and Forrester Research, produces the Consumer Internet Barometer, which tracks consumers' use and trust of the Internet over time and looks for trends.
The survey also found that 61 percent of consumers went online at least once a month last year, up from 58.7 percent in 2001. The primary reason for going online was personal communication, followed by work-related activities and research.

HEADLINE: Dividend Tax Cut: An Alternative 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Bush administration's proposal to reduce the tax on dividends ("If Tax History Is a Guide, the Poor Are in Trouble," Economic View, Dec. 8) is exactly the wrong solution to the so-called double tax on corporate earnings. 
 The extra retained (after-tax) income in the hands of affluent shareholders will not be spent to stimulate the economy. The extra incentive to declare dividends will weaken balance sheets and increase borrowing, which will also have an upward push on interest rates. Declaring dividends may raise stock prices, a point not to be overlooked by avaricious executives and directors holding stock options. 
 The way to reduce the double tax is to reduce corporate tax rates. Corporations would then retain more after-tax earnings, reduce borrowing, retain stronger balance sheets and have more financing for purchasing and investing in capital needs. It would also reduce the incentive to seek tax havens.
This would be a true stimulus and far exceed the benefit of leaving more money in the hands of shareholders.

HEADLINE: Annoyed By the Comfy Class 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Bells Are Ringing. Are You Listening?" attested to what may often make encounters with strangers in the city so stressful. 
That is a heightened self-absorption among some of our population. 
 As a petite black woman in her early 30's with a child, I find that maneuvering in the city can both dampen and boost my spirit. Although I was born and raised here, I am known for being polite, which could contradict the myth of the rude New Yorker.
 When I was visibly pregnant I rode the subway often, and was surprised at the number of women, especially women of color, who offered their seats to me, while few men did.
 Although we may well "value what manners represent: generosity of spirit, a sense of reciprocity and community," not all members of our city exhibit these manners, especially in the public sphere.
 I think what is at the core of the problem is the growing sense that the desires of the individual come before those of the community, and the increasing social, racial and economic shifts that are happening throughout the city.

HEADLINE: White House Wary of Cuba's Little Spy Engine That Could 

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal investigators' discoveries in recent years of Cuban espionage activities -- including an operation that penetrated the Pentagon's intelligence agency -- have cast light on what officials describe as a resilient intelligence service that continues to work aggressively in the United States. 
 Since 1998 in Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exposed a network of at least 16 accused or convicted Cuban spies who, while often pinched for cash by their country's economic troubles, succeeded in infiltrating several Cuban exile groups and worked patiently to try to get inside American military installations. 
 In a separate case in Miami, a senior immigration official convicted of disclosing classified information to a Cuban agent was sentenced in June 2001, and, last September, a federal judge imposed a 25-year prison term on the Pentagon's former senior intelligence analyst on Cuba, Ana B. Montes, who admitted to long service as a Cuban spy. 
The Cubans' success at stealing American secrets appears to have been mixed. But even so, these incidents, along with concerns about Cuba's possible involvement in developing biological weapons and aiding terrorists, have set off a new debate about whether Mr. Castro's Communist government remains a threat to American national security. 
"These activities and others prove that they are a hostile country," Otto J. Reich, the Bush administration's special envoy for the Western Hemisphere, said of the espionage cases. 
Predictably, the disagreement has set administration officials who want to step up pressure on the Castro government against bipartisan Congressional leaders who have been gaining ground in a campaign to ease restrictions on Cuba. 
But the matter has also taken on new urgency since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In one behind-the-scenes fight, some administration officials have sought the reassignment of one of the government's most senior intelligence analysts on Latin America, arguing, among other things, that he has been "soft" on the threats posed by Cuba, officials involved in the discussions said. 
Mr. Reich, officials said, was among several foreign policy officials who complained to the White House about government intelligence assessments on Cuba, in particular the work of the analyst, Fulton T. Armstrong, the national intelligence officer for Latin America. 
According to several officials, Mr. Armstrong has written skeptically about Cuba's importance as a military threat, its intention to develop offensive biological weapons and its continued inclusion on the State Department's annual list of countries that sponsor terrorism. Mr. Armstrong, a career Central Intelligence Agency analyst who now serves on the National Intelligence Council, an advisory body for the director of central intelligence, also worked on the National Security Council in the Clinton administration. 
But Mr. Armstrong's supporters respond that he has been targeted by ideologues who would distort the intelligence process to get the kind of analysis they want. These officials said that while Mr. Armstrong had sometimes ruffled feathers with his outspoken style, he was widely respected as an analyst and trusted by George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence. 
Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Reich and a spokesman for the C.I.A. all declined to comment on the matter. 
During the 1990's, after the demise of the Soviet bloc and its subsidies to Cuba, a consensus emerged among American analysts that the security threat Cuba posed had greatly diminished. In 1998, a major Defense Department report to Congress concluded that the island's Communist government posed "a negligible threat to the U.S. or surrounding countries." 
But that conclusion outraged Cuban-American political leaders and some others, who insist that the Castro government continues to threaten the United States in less conventional ways: by its alliances with countries like Libya and Iran, its support for several groups that use terrorism, and its development of biotechnology and cyberwarfare capabilities that could be used offensively. Cuban leaders deny any such threats. 
More recently, some Bush administration officials have offered a new explanation for the relatively sanguine views on Cuba that emerged during the Clinton administration: subversion within the American intelligence community. "A major reason," said the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, John R. Bolton, "is Cuba's aggressive intelligence operations against the United States." 
In a speech last year, Mr. Bolton noted that one of the early drafters of the Pentagon report was Ms. Montes, the Defense Intelligence Agency analyst who pleaded guilty to spying for Cuba for 16 years. Ms. Montes was not paid to spy but said she acted to help Cuba defend itself against what she saw as Washington's hostility toward the island. 
Intelligence officials said Ms. Montes gave her Cuban handlers volumes of defense and intelligence information about Cuba, including military contingency plans, details of intelligence-gathering efforts and profiles of American officials. But while a formal assessment of the security damage that Ms. Montes caused is continuing, several officials said there was no evidence that she was instructed to shade her analysis in order to influence policy. 
By contrast, the 16 Cuban spies indicted in Florida and known by their code name as La Red Avispa, or the Wasp Network, were unable to get their hands on any classified information at all. But it was not for lack of trying. 
The spies operated not under diplomatic cover but as what are known as "illegals" -- spies without any apparent tie to the Cuban government. They took cheap apartments, drove used cars and held their secret meetings at Burger King and Pollo Tropical, accounting to Havana for every dollar they spent. 
One Cuban agent stationed on Key West persuaded his handlers to let him move in with his girlfriend, a massage therapist, after arguing that he would save on expenses. (They told him to avoid marriage and children.) 
According to testimony and documents at the trial, the Cubans made mistakes. One illegal officer had to explain to Havana that his secure pager "drowned" when he left it in the pocket of his shorts and jumped into a swimming pool. 
At the same time, however, their message traffic pointed to a sophisticated intelligence infrastructure behind the Miami network, one that law-enforcement officials said compensated for its poverty with meticulousness and patience. 
Intelligence officials added that despite the recent blows it had suffered, Cuba's intelligence service might still have as many as a few hundred officers and agents operating in the United States. 
"They are one of the most aggressive intelligence services there is," said Hector M. Pesquera, the head of the F.B.I.'s Miami office. "They made some mistakes and we were able to capitalize on them, but they are still very good. They are very determined and they work the numbers. They know we can't cover everything." 
Cuba has vigorously defended five of the spies who fought and lost their cases in federal court (seven others have pleaded guilty), insisting that the men sought only to thwart terrorism by radical exiles, like a spate of Havana bombings in 1997 that killed an Italian tourist. Yet the decrypted documents also point to other, less benign pursuits. 
Among the "active measures" that the spies discussed -- but apparently did not carry out -- were making threatening phone calls, ostensibly from radical exiles, to the publisher of The Miami Herald at the time; sending a mail bomb to a person thought to be a C.I.A. agent; and sneaking boats with explosives into Florida. 
Officials said that what prompted the decision to prosecute most of the Wasp Network spies rather than simply deporting them (as is being done with the latest person accused of being a member of the network, who was arrested in May) was a link between two of the Cubans and the deaths of four exile activists whose planes were shot down by Cuban Air Force jets in 1996.

HIGHLIGHTS

HEADLINE: Taking the Oath, Then the Medicine; 
As Pataki Concedes Crisis, Critics Emerge Both Left and Right

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 4 

 BODY:
The words Gov. George E. Pataki uttered during his inaugural address on Wednesday were not that different from what he said throughout his campaign for re-election. 
 It was, in essence, a patriotic pep talk, short on details, in which the governor asserted confidently that his administration had solved budget shortfalls before and would do so again. 
 But the way those words have been received three months after the election suggests that some of Mr. Pataki's remarkable ability to avoid being associated with bad news has worn off. Democrats are accusing the governor of having used up New York's large reserves to avoid cutting spending before the election and then misleading the public about the depth of the state's budget shortfall until after he won the race. 
Conservatives, meanwhile, have stepped up their criticism of the governor for allowing spending to grow sharply over the last six years. They have prodded him to forsake his relatively new allies in the labor movement and return to the tough, austere budgeting policies of his first two years in office.
"People on the right are telling him, 'Go back to your roots,' " one Republican strategist said.
Why is Mr. Pataki's rhetoric not working as well now as it did during the fall?
For starters, Mr. Pataki himself has admitted that the state is in dire straits. During the campaign, he maintained that his rosy revenue estimates would hold together through the rest of the current fiscal year, even though he hedged a bit, saying there were "risks" in the last quarter. Then in December, he announced there would be a $2 billion hole in this year's budget and a much larger one next year, though he still has not said how big. 
A couple of weeks later, he hinted more than once that raising taxes was not out of the question, reversing his longstanding opposition during the campaign to any tax increase. 
Then, in his inaugural speech, Mr. Pataki used the word "crisis" for the first time to describe the state's finances, laying blame for the fiscal troubles on the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the national recession.
This slow shift has emboldened Mr. Pataki's critics. Conservatives and Republicans, who held their fire during the campaign because they liked the Democratic candidate even less, are now speaking up about the governor's fiscal management. Mr. Pataki's opponents among liberals and Democrats are saying, in essence, "We told you so." 
The governor's communications director, Michael McKeon, says the criticism has been unfair and is coming mostly from "the liberal media." Had Mr. Pataki said he was raising taxes, Mr McKeon said, reporters and editorial writers would have lauded him for bold leadership. Instead Mr. McKeon asserted, the governor is being pilloried for having held out hope that the economy would improve before painful cuts were necessary.
"It's self-serving pundits in the media who don't like the fact the governor won," he said. "Most of the criticism is from people who did not want the governor to win." 
Democrats, however, say Mr. Pataki can no longer sidestep hard questions about the budget as he did during the campaign, since he must unveil his plan by Feb.1.
"He's always been very good at staying on message and dodging the questions he doesn't want to answer," said the state Democratic chairman, Herman D. Farrell Jr. "Governance is different from elections. His message so far is, 'We will get through this.' But now he's going to have to show us how." 
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who lost to Mr. Pataki in 1994, put it more bluntly. "The truth is in the budget," he said in a radio interview on Friday. 
As the governor has slowly acknowledged the depth of the budget problem, the battle lines are being drawn over how to deal with it. On one side are labor leaders who supported him, as well as sundry other Democrats and liberals. Many of them argue that imposing a temporary tax on the very wealthy, and putting off planned tax cuts, would be better than severely reducing social services.
The conservative voices in state politics, meanwhile, want Mr. Pataki to cut spending to make up for a steep drop in income tax revenues. In practical terms, that would mean cutting aid to local schools and various health care programs, like drug subsidies for the elderly and health insurance for the poor.
So Mr. Pataki, who ran a campaign tailored to appeal to both the left and the right, now finds himself caught in a cross-fire. Conservatives are asking him to rein in spending, no matter what the social cost. Liberals want him to protect the social programs he promoted as his own during the election, even if it means raising taxes.
"Quite frankly, I'm hoping the governor's going to accept the challenge and go back to his conservative principles," said the chairman of the state's Conservative Party, Michael Long. "Spending is the problem, and both the executive and the legislative branch of the government have spent too much."
The Business Council of New York State is issuing fretful proclamations urging him not to raise taxes. Union leaders are warning that the governor should not expect them to accept layoffs or work-rule changes unless business owners also make sacrifices, like paying more in taxes.
For his part, Mr. Pataki has so far put only one concrete idea on the table: borrowing $4 billion backed by the annual payment the state receives from tobacco companies as part of a court settlement. That proposal has received a cold reception from Democrats in control of the Assembly, who want to see the governor's entire budget before giving him blanket authority to borrow such a large sum. 
Leaders of the state's powerful health care workers union, which backed Mr. Pataki to the hilt last fall, are also worried because the tobacco money now supports a number of health care programs they want to protect. How Mr. Pataki finances those programs will be a test of his resourcefulness.
In the end, some of Mr. Pataki's critics on both sides of the aisle say he is paying the price now for his habitual unwillingness to be the bearer of bad news or the standard-bearer for a controversial position. 
He successfully avoided answering questions during the campaign not only about how he would balance the budget this year, but also about whether there would be a fare increase on New York's subways and buses (there will be) and whether he was in favor of closing the Indian Point nuclear plant (he still has not said where he stands).
His cautious style stands in marked contrast to that of the newly elected Republican governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney. Mr. Pataki, facing what most analysts predict is an $8 billion shortfall next year, said at his inauguration that the answer to the state's fiscal problems was in the diversity of its people. "We've done it before," he said. "We will do it again. It will take time, teamwork, honesty and courage." 
Mr. Romney took a different tack in his inaugural speech, saying the $3 billion shortfall he faces means that the state "can afford only our core responsibilities" and that "many nonessential programs, even some that we like very much, will have to be downsized or even eliminated."
"I didn't run for governor to do that," Mr. Romney said, "but I will do my job."

HEADLINE: Vietnam, Poor but Orderly, Is Now Tourists' Safe Haven 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Jan. 4 

 BODY:
A generation after a war that made its jungles and rice paddies famous as places of violence and death, Vietnam is now relying on its relative stability to draw security-conscious foreign tourists.
 The Sept. 11 attacks, followed by bombings in Bali on Oct. 12, have contributed to a tourism boom in Vietnam that has packed upscale hotels and filled most international flights here. 
 Many tourists say, and tourism industry officials agree, that they were interested in coming anyway as Vietnam increasingly opens to the outside world.
But the tourists say that Vietnam's near absence of Muslims, who make up less than 1 percent of the population, as well as the country's controlled Communist society are reassuring at a time of travel warnings and attacks elsewhere. 
As John and Melissa Ryan, clothing store owners from Berkeley, Calif., rode a puttering motorboat up a palm-lined river toward Hoi An in central Vietnam a few days ago, both said they had no worries about terrorism in Vietnam. 
"It's Buddhist and Communist; I don't think the Communists would tolerate Muslim radicals at all," Mr. Ryan said, as the boat passed traditional fishermen in wood boats casting small, round fishing nets by hand into the muddy, slow-moving water. 
In 2001, 8.9 percent more tourists entered Vietnam than in the previous year, even as the Sept. 11 attacks produced a sharp drop in travel to many other countries. The number of foreign tourists rose another 12 percent in the first 11 months of 2002, compared with the same period a year earlier.
Tourism here increased despite the fact that flights to Vietnam are sparse and expensive. Government-owned Vietnam Airlines has severely limited the number of international flights here by foreign carriers. The limited competition has kept ticket prices among the highest in Asia. 
The tourism growth has been brisk enough to prompt the opening of new hotels, after years of problems for the country's tourism industry. Like many countries in Southeast Asia, Vietnam had built too many hotels in the boom of the mid-1990's, only to have some of them close during the region's financial crisis of 1997 and 1998. 
Construction of the Sheraton Saigon Hotel and Towers and Executive Residences complex, in what is now called Ho Chi Minh City, was completed in early 1999, but the building was sealed up and left unfurnished. But at the end of 2001, the owners and the management company, Six Continents, which owns the Sheraton brand, decided to open the complex.
All but 3 of the 92 apartments have been rented, and a luxury store selling Versace, Bulgari and Armani fashions to tourists is being opened, said Sean Hunt, the general manager of the project. He said the 380-room hotel would open in May. 
"Vietnam is continuing to grow in popularity because it's perceived to be a safe haven and a safe place to do business," Mr. Hunt said. 
Vietnam has also preserved many old buildings, especially in cities like Hoi An and Hanoi, as anemic economic growth, at least until recently, has discouraged the demolition of historic neighborhoods to build skyscrapers. Parts of Hanoi still look very French, even though Vietnam's colonial rulers left nearly half a century ago. 
Vietnam's continued poverty, especially compared with more affluent, capitalist countries in East Asia, has made it a bargain, aside from the air fare. Taxi rides can cost $1, while tailor-made suits sell for as little as $40, although the quality of the stitching is sometimes suspect. 
While tourism in Vietnam is booming, the number of visitors to Bali has not fallen as much as the tourism industry there had feared. 
Visits to Phuket Island, a Cancun-like resort area in a heavily Muslim area of southern Thailand, appear to have recovered as well. 
Accor S.A., the largest hotel operator in East Asia with 200 hotels, suffered a drop of 15 to 20 percent from a year earlier in visits to its Bali hotels in December, said David Baffsky, the chairman of the company's Asian and Pacific operations. 
But, he added, "The hotels in Bali were busier than a lot of people expected over Christmas and particularly over New Year's." 
Some human rights groups have urged tourists not to visit Myanmar, the former Burma, to avoid providing financial support for the ruling military regime. There has been no comparable effort by human rights groups to discourage tourists from shifting their plans away from countries like Indonesia, which has its own history of human rights violations.
But some travelers are skipping Thailand and Indonesia on their own initiative after reports of security threats. In fact, some visitors to Vietnam are coming from places with their own security concerns.
John and Sheila Bernson are Americans who live and work in Beirut, Lebanon, which has become much quieter in recent years after a civil war and kidnappings in the 1980's. 
The couple headed straight for Vietnam for their New Year's vacation this week. 
"I wouldn't even consider Phuket," Sheila Bernson said.

HEADLINE: Studios Using Digital Armor To Fight Piracy 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Lying dormant in virtually every digital cable box in America is technology that can prevent viewers from recording certain programs to watch them later. Soon, several Hollywood studios are planning to tell cable operators to flip the switch. 
 People who have become accustomed to recording pay-per-view and video-on-demand shows will probably still be able to, the studios say -- so long as they pay an extra fee. 
 The move is one of a range of new restrictions Hollywood is beginning to impose on digital movies, music and television. After years of battling online piracy in court, media executives are fighting technology with technology, locking up their products with the same types of digital tools that millions of people have used to get the products free over the Internet. 
"We need to put in speed bumps to keep people honest," said Jack Valenti, the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, which is lobbying federal regulators to require many devices to incorporate technology that prevents consumers from sending digital media files over the Internet. "If we don't, our future is bleak."
Hollywood's new strategy is likely to affect everyone from computer-adept users of online music services to the average couch potato. The digital future, hailed as more convenient and of higher quality than the scratchy, fuzzy analog past, is coming with multiple strings attached.
Already, people are finding unfamiliar constraints on how they can consume familiar media: listen to music on your PC, but do not try to copy it to your MP3 player; watch a movie in your home as often as you want for 24 hours -- because after that it will evaporate into the ether; marvel at your plasma-screen TV, but be prepared for your picture quality to be diminished if you do not have the latest model with anti-piracy equipment.
As consumers evaluate Hollywood's new deal, industry analysts are predicting a tug of war that could determine new ground rules of cultural consumption.
"We're entering a period of three to seven years where entertainment companies keep trying to control and consumers keep trying to escape it," said George F. Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research, a technology and media research firm. "There's a lot of money at stake here and Hollywood doesn't want to lose it."
For entertainment companies, the ability to use digital technology to lock down their material feels like poetic justice. The music industry attributes a precipitous drop in sales over the last two years to online file-trading by people who have become accustomed to getting their music free through computer programs like Napster and KaZaA, and movie studios fear the same fate is about to befall them as more people get high-speed Internet connections at home.
The aggressive countermeasures and the consumer ire they may inspire may sound risky for an industry that makes money by making people feel good. But entertainment executives say they are the only realistic response to millions of people who would never steal a CD or DVD from a store but show no compunction about doing so online.
Even if the security setups do not work perfectly -- many previous efforts to secure digital media have already been overcome by hackers -- the industry says they will serve as a deterrent, much the way video cameras deter shoplifting.
Hollywood continues to wage legal battles against technologies it views as aiding the infringement of its copyrights: 321 Studios, a maker of DVD copying software; ReplayTV, a device that allows consumers to record shows and skip commercials; and several widely used file-trading programs are all the subjects of lawsuits by major media companies.
But lately Hollywood has decided to take advantage of advances in copyright-protection tools developed by companies like Microsoft, Macrovision and RealNetworks known as digital rights management software. The technology, media executives say, will benefit consumers because it allows entertainment to be delivered digitally and packaged in dozens of new ways. Instead of a product, consumers will essentially purchase licenses to use digital movies or music under certain circumstances.
Depending on the rules dictated by the software, your ability to listen to a music track or watch a movie can expire after a day or remain in place forever. You can copy it once, twice, as many times as you want, or not at all. You can play it on all portable devices, no portable devices or a subset of portable devices. And you can be charged a different amount for each set of privileges.
"You're not buying music, you're buying a key," says Larry Kenswil, the president of the eLabs division of the Universal Music Group, the world's largest record company, which recently started charging 99 cents for a digital single that can be burned to a CD but not copied to certain portable devices, like the Apple iPod. "That's what digital rights management does: it enables business models."
The new software weapons, entertainment executives say, are already reinforcing a variety of new services, from movies on demand to online jukeboxes, that they say they would have been reluctant to offer before. Tempted by promises of a brave new digital world, eager consumers are testing out high-definition TV's and scooping up DVD's.
But in what may prove to be an old-fashioned analog awakening, consumers are beginning to suspect that the new tools take away more freedoms than they give.
Brian Wozny, 52, so liked the idea of watching a Steve McQueen movie without going to a video store that he recently paid $1.99 to download "The Hunter" over Movielink, an online service introduced by several movie studios in November. Then he learned that he could not transfer the film to another computer and that it would disappear from his hard drive 24 hours after he started watching it. 
"I don't mind them putting some limits on it, but it's one rule after another rule after another and it's hard to keep track," said Mr. Wozny, of Cleveland. "Being able to watch it for 30 days would be a lot better." 
Gary Merson, who reviews equipment for consumer electronics magazines, found last week that his state-of-the-art high-definition television system would not display several channels, including HBO and WCBS. Instead a message flashed on the $8,000 screen: "Notice -- Copy restrictions prevent the viewing of this program in the high definition format. For more information see the owner's manual for your satellite receiver."
DirecTV, Mr. Merson's satellite provider, said no one was available to comment on the company's policy on copy restrictions last week. But Mr. Merson said he was told by a customer service representative that the message was intended for television studios that want to activate anti-piracy measures. 
If DirecTV detects that a customer's equipment would allow certain shows to be transmitted over the Internet, the viewer is informed that the material can be seen only in standard format. In Mr. Merson's case, the message appears to have been a technical glitch, which did not make him any happier.
"These copy-protection schemes are a bill of goods," said Mr. Merson, who wrote about the experience in his Internet newsletter, The HDTV Insider. "The program providers get the higher profits and we get stuff that doesn't work right."
For now, consumers who do not like the new models can just stick with the old media. But soon they may not have a choice. 
This year, several of the major music companies have said they plan to begin embedding copy-protection technologies on a sizable percentage of their CD's. DVD's are already protected by a digital wrapper that prevents them from being copied. And a federal statute -- passed after heavy lobbying by the entertainment industry -- makes it illegal to break such digital safeguards, even to make a personal copy, something consumers have taken for granted in the past.
Hollywood's next move is an attempt to impose new electronic rules about recording and copying on digital broadcast television. 
Since the government eventually plans to reclaim the airways reserved for analog broadcasts, every household with a TV would be affected. 
To prevent trading of near-perfect copies of shows over the Internet, the entertainment industry wants to insert a digital tag in every program with instructions about whether it can be recorded and how many copies viewers can make. 
The Federal Communications Commission is under pressure to adopt such regulations as a way to spur the transition to digital television. The movie studios have said they will withhold the most sought-after programming from digital broadcasts until they know it can be adequately protected, either by an F.C.C. ruling or a legislative mandate from Congress.
"We have zero objection to anyone's ability to duplicate, to record, to play back and to save any copyable content whatsoever," said Peter Chernin, the president of 20th Century Fox. "But we'd be idiots not to be wary of the risks that come with that ability, and of the vulnerability of those of us supplying digitally unprotected films and shows."
The entertainment industry's lobbying efforts have ignited protests by consumer groups and some technology companies, which would need to modify their machines to make the arrangements work. They complain that many of the presumed benefits of the new digital world would be lost under such a system.
Someone who records a favorite show onto a hard drive in the living room would not be able to retrieve and watch it over a wireless network from another room, for instance, or from a country home. And since current DVD players would not recognize the new electronic flags, they would not be able to play back programs recorded under such a system. 
Besides, critics note, a handful of people are sure to find a way around the security system, as happened with DVD's. While most consumers never copy DVD's, thousands of films are freely available on the Internet because a small number of people do.
"This isn't going to stop serious hackers," said Mark Cooper, the research director for the Consumer Federation of America. "All you end up with here is an inconvenience to the average consumer."
Besides inconvenience, some critics argue that digitally enforced restrictions on copying threaten an aspect of free speech rights that copyright law has traditionally respected. This "fair use" right to use snippets of copyrighted works for the purpose of parody or criticism or scholarship, they say, is essentially impossible to exercise if the material is protected with digital locks and federal law makes it illegal to unlock them.
Hollywood executives say they know they may need to adjust to meet consumer demands. James B. Ramo, the chief executive of Movielink, the Internet movie service, said the security software's flexibility was one of its chief virtues.
"We're not locked into these rules," Mr. Ramo said. "We're just testing them out."

HEADLINE: Foes of Transit Contract Mount a Fierce Campaign 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Taped onto the wall of transit workers' locker rooms throughout the city, the fliers proclaim: "Second Class Contract. Vote No."
 They are part of a fierce campaign by several transit union leaders urging the union's 34,000 subway and bus workers to vote down the tentative contract announced on Dec. 16. Many fliers contend that the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, Roger Toussaint, sold out the workers and did not deliver on his promises. 
 Mail ballots were sent to members on Friday, and the votes are to be counted Jan. 21. The opponents insist that they have a shot at defeating the three-year contract and denounce its first-year wage freeze and the elimination of the no-layoff clause in the previous contract. 
Intent on winning ratification, Mr. Toussaint is waging his own feverish campaign, delivering four or five speeches a day at bus garages and subway terminals to press workers to approve the settlement. In an interview Friday, he insisted that the contract was excellent, considering the state of the economy, and said union opponents who hope to run against him think a contract fight will gain them publicity.
Dismissing claims that the agreement will be rejected, he said: "There's no possibility of it not being ratified. The only issue is whether the political opposition in our union can spur enough confusion to prevent an overwhelming vote in favor."
Several union insiders said that in a union known for its militancy, there are always people to the left of the leadership who are ready to denounce contract provisions as inadequate and a sellout. 
On Friday afternoon, Mr. Toussaint addressed 60 subway maintenance workers in a locker room deep below 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. 
"You told us in a survey that your No. 1 priority was health benefits, No. 2 was dignity and respect, and third was wages," Mr. Toussaint said, a megaphone slung over his right shoulder. "That's what's in the package we ended up with."
Mr. Toussaint said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would contribute nearly $400 million more over three years to safeguard health coverage and had agreed to overhaul the disciplinary system which workers hated. Voicing pride that the contract was improving health benefits when coverage for many other workers was deteriorating, he acknowledged that he did not get all he wanted on wages because of the transit authority's financial troubles. 
Besides the first-year wage freeze, the contract calls for a $1,000 one-time payment in the first year and a 3 percent raise in each of the second and third years.
Local 100's recording secretary, Noel Acevedo, the third-ranking official in the union, is leading the fight against the contract. Focusing on the elimination of the no-layoff clause, he said: "This is a bad deal. It jeopardizes members' jobs. Considering what's happening in the public and private sectors, job protection should be one of our primary concerns."
Mr. Acevedo praised the agreement's changes in health coverage and discipline, but said he was unhappy about the wage freeze. "The $1,000 bonus is not a raise," he said. "That's certainly an objection, but that's not a primary objection. It doesn't increase the wage base throughout the years."
The authority's chief spokesman, Tom Kelly, said the agency would seek arbitration if the workers rejected the agreement. 
The fate of the no-layoff clause has become the central issue. Transportation authority officials see dropping the clause as a step toward increasing productivity, but they said little about it until they decided that union leaders were boasting about how well they did in negotiations and making the authority look bad. 
Instead of the old no-layoff clause, the proposed contract says the authority will "make every effort to avoid involuntary reductions in force." Opponents say the change could open the door to layoffs, especially when the authority faces a deficit. 
Mr. Toussaint said, however, that the old clause was not invincible and would not have prevented layoffs during a fiscal crisis. He said authority officials had not raised the possibility of layoffs, while Gary Dellaverson, the authority's chief negotiator, said layoffs were not being contemplated and were a last resort.
Mr. Acevedo rejected Mr. Toussaint's assertions that he and his allies were opposing the contract for political reasons. "That's smoke," he said. "If you can't deal with the issues, you start generating smoke."
Mr. Toussaint said the leaders of the contract opposition included allies of Sonny Hall, a longtime Toussaint opponent who is president of the parent union, and Tim Schermerhorn, whom Mr. Toussaint defeated to become the candidate of the union's militant New Directions caucus.
At a bus depot at 14th Street and the Hudson River, there was intensive debate about the settlement.
"It's like any other agreement -- there's some good and some bad," said Eric Johnson, a bus driver for three years who said he would probably vote to approve. "The health provisions are definitely good."
Alex Borrero, a bus driver for 20 years, said he was leaning against voting for the contract. "At first I was supporting it," he said, "but there are a lot of things that don't look good, like getting rid of the no-layoff clause."
When Mr. Toussaint spoke in the locker room, a subway worker was applauded when he said: "I have my doubts about the contract, but I appreciate your coming down here to speak with us when other union leaders hardly ever showed their faces. Just your coming here is going to persuade me to vote for the contract."

HEADLINE: In a First, U.S. Officials Put Limits on California's Thirst 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz., Jan. 4 

 BODY:
Three of the eight pumps that tap into the glistening reservoir of Colorado River water near here are sitting idle, by order of the federal government.
 With the pumps switched off since 8 a.m. New Year's Day, less water is churning down the 242-mile aqueduct toward coastal Southern California, where 17 million people rely on snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains for washing dishes, flushing toilets and watering lawns. 
 This is a pivotal moment in the contentious history of water in the arid West, which more often than not has pitted California's unquenchable thirst against that of its smaller but equally parched neighbors.
For the first time since it was given the authority four decades ago, the United States Department of the Interior has said no to California's dipping into the Colorado River for more than its allotted share. 
Nudged on by six other states that draw from the river, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton described the enforcement last month as "a turning point in the history of the Colorado River." 
The circumstances that led to the crackdown involved a failed deal to move water from farms to cities in Southern California, a requirement of a federally brokered armistice along the Colorado two years ago. Though the farms-to-city provision was overshadowed by the consequences for California, it reflected an epic shift in the jostling for water that some water experts say could someday eclipse the rivalries among states.
Already as cities across the West look to agriculture to help meet growing water needs, demarcation lines are more likely to have swimming pools on one side and irrigation ditches on the other. Competing statehouses and cross-border agencies figure less into the calculation.
"Water has to move to the cities, and the only real issue now is under what terms," said Thomas J. Graff, regional director of the advocacy group Environmental Defense in Oakland, Calif., and a former member of the Colorado River Board of California.
The population in the West swelled by nearly one-fifth in the 1990's. California alone added 4.1 million people. The city of Phoenix grew by 350,000. At 66 percent, Nevada posted the fastest growth rate of any state.
Desperate to get water from a river whose every drop is spoken for, the booming urban centers that ring the Colorado River are looking inside their own states to entice farmers to break their century-old grip on irrigated water. While no one suggests agriculture will disappear, many farmers are likely to switch to crops that yield higher profits with less water. To make it happen, the rich urban areas are offering big sums of money and, when necessary, are exerting heavy political pressure.
That was demonstrated in striking fashion this week in the crackdown on California's water use, which was not limited to the idling of pumps here at Lake Havasu. The Interior Department, in another historic first, punished the most water-rich agricultural district in the West for not selling some water to San Diego County, where nearly three million people live with virtually no local water supplies.
Farmers in the district, the Imperial Irrigation District, pay $15.50 in delivery fees for each acre-foot of water they use. (An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, enough to fill an acre to a depth of one foot.) San Diego offered to buy up to 200,000 acre-feet a year -- about 7 percent of Imperial's supplies -- for $250 per acre-foot. Though in the end the district's board approved the sale, it loaded the deal down with conditions the Interior Department and other water districts would not accept.
With no deal, Ms. Norton ordered that the Imperial Irrigation District lose about the same amount of water from its annual Colorado River allotment, in this case without compensation. Separately, she directed cutbacks on surplus water to the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. It complied by turning off the pumps near here on Wednesday morning.
Together, the penalties mean cities and farms in Southern California could be denied nearly 650,000 acre-feet of water from the river this year, enough to meet the needs of about 3.8 million people or a city roughly the size of Los Angeles.
Even if the water cuts are restored, as the Interior Department has pledged they will be if a belated deal on the San Diego sale is struck, water experts from across the West predicted "a new era of limits" for the Colorado River basin.
"The secretary has bit the bullet, something that everybody had said was coming for 40 years but nobody believed would really happen," said Joseph L. Sax, a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, who served as counselor to former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and is a consultant to the United States Bureau of Reclamation.
"This is a historic moment," Professor Sax said. "California must live within its allotment. In particular, cutting back agricultural users by this administration will be remembered as quite an extraordinary thing."
The tilt toward cities, though still resisted by many water interests, has been acknowledged even in places like the Imperial Valley, where farmers have siphoned water from the Colorado for a century and where people speak openly of their disdain for coastal California.
The Imperial Irrigation District has transferred more than 100,000 acre-feet of water each year over the last decade to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the biggest urban water district in the West. The water came from savings realized from conservation measures in the farm district that the urban district paid for.
This week, in voting in favor of the failed plan to sell 200,000 acre-feet a year to San Diego County, one of the Imperial district's directors said he felt the hand of history at his back. The director, Bruce Kuhn, said giving up the water had been the hardest decision of his life. 
"History will be our judge," Mr. Kuhn said. "This decision will be talked about for at least 100 years."
Stella Mendoza, the board's president, voiced the fears of the farmers who turned up to oppose the sale. "I don't trust that San Diego will not come back for more," she said. "Once you take out the first pickle from the jar, the rest come easy."
Professor Sax said the consternation in the Imperial Valley was understandable, but was unlikely to change the eventual outcome in a material way.
"This is probably one of the more painful and more pathological versions of what is going to happen," he said. "But water has to move from agricultural to municipal use. There is no significant doubt about that."
The trick in the coming years will be striking a balance so that agriculture, which retains control of the vast majority of the water from the Colorado and is the biggest industry even in California, considers the transfers something farmers want to do.
Dennis B. Underwood, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Reclamation who is now a vice president of the Metropolitan Water District, said deals between farms and urban water districts were being fashioned so that the best farmland is preserved and farmers profit without forfeiting the future.
The Metropolitan district and the Palo Verde Irrigation District have agreed to a plan that would leave up to 29 percent of the district's farmland fallow in certain years to free water for Metropolitan's urban customers. "You take lands out for a year or two, they become more productive and then you bring them back into production," Mr. Underwood said. "It shores up the urban economy with water and also helps agriculture."
The greatest resistance, however, is likely to come when pressure grows for farmers in some districts to give up on water-guzzling crops like alfalfa and cotton.
"There is still going to be a lot of agriculture, but it is going to get by with less water used more efficiently and probably on higher value crops," Mr. Graff of Environmental Defense said. "Just throwing water on fields to grow grass or to grow cotton is increasingly inefficient and uneconomic."
In California, the urban sharing of farm water has become particularly urgent because of the enforcement of the Colorado River limit of 4.4 million acre-feet. More than three-quarters of that water is allotted to farms like those in the Imperial Valley and Palo Verde. With no new big reclamation projects like the Hoover Dam on the horizon -- more dams are being destroyed than built -- California has been compelled to find ways to redistribute its finite supply.
Mr. Underwood said urban water districts were also looking increasingly to "nonhydrological sources" like desalting seawater, recycling poor quality water and reducing demand through conservation. But some environmental groups fear the shift to agricultural water has actually lulled some districts into complacency about conservation.
"It has been a source of frustration of many on the environmental and agricultural sides that the U.S. government has not been strictly enforcing the conservation requirements in the urban sector," said Hal Candee, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Environmentalists also say they must be vigilant in ensuring that some of the water directed away from farms also goes to environmental projects, like restoring wetlands and water flows in depleted rivers. 
In the past, California was able to sidestep its chronic water problems by dipping deeper into Lake Havasu, which gets its water from releases upstream at the Hoover Dam. Some years, the state took as much as 5.2 million acre-feet, an action that irritated the other six Colorado River basin states but that was of no great consequence because those states did not need the water.
But by the late 1990's, that had changed. Two neighboring states on the river's lower basin, Arizona and Nevada, were experiencing phenomenal growth and a greater thirst for the water California was monopolizing. And the basin that feeds the Colorado River was undergoing the worst drought on record.
That combination led to stepped-up demands by the six states -- which also include New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah -- for the Interior Department to force California to live within the allotment dictated in a Supreme Court ruling in 1963. In a complex set of negotiations, the states, along with the Department of the Interior, agreed to give California until 2016 to break its habit. But when the Southern California water agencies missed the deadline for the San Diego sale, the cutoff became immediate.
Though California's neighbors played tough, some water officials inside and outside California said that finally bringing the simmering issue to a head helped to cool tempers among the seven basin states. Kay Brothers, the assistant general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said a decade of increased cooperation among the states on things like storing water underground across state boundaries had also helped.
"I think we are at a pivotal moment in the West, and with cooperation so much better over the past 10 years, no one wants to lose the momentum," Ms. Brothers said. "It is a mind-set change that has developed among the states."
In one indication of possibly changed times, Mr. Underwood said he started calling colleagues in the six other states when it became apparent on Dec. 31 that the San Diego deal had fallen apart. He said there were no angry shouts, just offers of assistance.
"We all realize they have to enforce the law of the river," Mr. Underwood said. "But if you tear at the fabric, at the common thread, then everything unravels and you end up in the 1920's. That would be in nobody's best interest."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: INSIDE BASEBALL; 
The Best Deal Never Made

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Early in 1972, George Steinbrenner, a 41-year-old Cleveland native, thought that he and his partners had just become owners of the hometown Indians.
 "We had a deal with Jimmy Stouffer, the elder of the Stouffer children," Steinbrenner recalled the other day, referring to the family that owned the Indians. "We thought we had bought the Indians and we were celebrating, and the next day we picked up the paper and saw that Nick Mileti had bought the team. Vernon Stouffer was very close to my family. But Vernon made a deal with Nick Mileti." 
 Because Vernon Stouffer was the owner, his deal counted, and so baseball history was written. 
Who knows what would have happened to Steinbrenner had his deal been the one that counted? Would he have lasted longer than the five years Mileti remained as the Indians' owner? Would he, too, have succumbed to the dreary economics that for many years undermined the Indians, a perennial loser (21 losing seasons in a 25-year stretch)?
No one knows what the outcome of a Steinbrenner ownership of the Indians would have been. What we do know is that a year later Steinbrenner and partners bought the Yankees, and 30 years later, 30 years from last Friday, to be exact, Steinbrenner holds a unique place in Major League Baseball.
Respect him or detest him, the 72-year-old Steinbrenner is the only owner from 1973 still on the job. The other teams have had a total of 71 owners or ownership groups, and the Yankees have had none. Put another way, in 30 years the other 29 teams, including six post-1973 expansion teams, have had a combined 94 ownership groups, and the Yankees have had one. 
Bud Selig is the only active management person who preceded Steinbrenner, and he is now the commissioner of baseball, no longer the Milwaukee Brewers' operating owner.
"I've had my ups and downs, I've made a lot of mistakes, a few things I've done right," Steinbrenner said on the eve of the 30th anniversary of his purchase, a transaction, one of those 94 owners said, that rivals the purchase of Manhattan from the Indians.
About that purchase: The price the Steinbrenner group paid CBS has always been put at $10 million, but another figure, $8.8 million, has been cited. Why the discrepancy?
"When we purchased the Yankees," Steinbrenner said, relating a piece of information that he either had never told or had been long forgotten, "CBS owned a couple parking lots that the city had been trying to buy. I sold the lots to the city for $1.2 million so the net for us was 8.8."
When Steinbrenner bought into Major League Baseball, he joined a group of men -- and one woman -- whose names were far better known than his, both for baseball and nonbaseball reasons. Among them were Phil Wrigley, Walter O'Malley, John Fetzer, John Galbreath, Gussie Busch, Tom Yawkey, Charles Bronfman, Joan Payson, Gene Autry, Charles O. Finley and Calvin Griffith. 
"I was scared stiff at the first meeting I went to," Steinbrenner related. "They said, 'You sit on this side; this is where the American League sits.' I look over and see the guy whose gum I had chewed since I was 5 years old. Walter O'Malley said, 'The way we're talking, Mr. Steinbrenner is going to wonder why he ever got into this sport.' "
But then O'Malley, the imposing Dodgers owner, made Steinbrenner feel at home. Pointing to Louis Nippert of the Cincinnati Reds, O'Malley said: "You see Mr. Nippert sitting there? He went to Culver. I'm a graduate of Culver."
The bond was instant. His fellow graduates of Culver Military Academy in Indiana would make the newcomer welcome.
Steinbrenner agreed that his road would have been unpredictable had he bought the Indians in 1972.
"Nick Mileti had a terrible time," he said. "Cleveland was not New York. I always remember the Sinatra song, 'If you make it there, you can make it anywhere.' That has a lot of meaning. The rewards are tremendous on the upside."
Steinbrenner has enjoyed the rewards in two different periods of his ownership, when he initially restored the Yankees to championship status in the 70's and in the current period of World Series success, four championships in seven years.
However smart the decisions and judgments of the owner and his baseball people have been in those periods, they have been fueled by revenue that was available to the Yankees but would not have been to the Indians. No cable-television outlet in Cleveland has ever given the Indians $493.5 million over 12 years, as the Yankees have earned. That money was especially critical in the 90's.
Steinbrenner does not apologize for having had the revenue available to sign players like Reggie Jackson, Rich Gossage, Dave Winfield, David Cone, Mike Mussina and Jason Giambi. But in the last decade the Yankees have moved beyond free agency. They have built a minor league system that has further separated them from the masses.
Marvin Goldklang is in a unique position to understand the significance of both major league and minor league operations. He has been a limited partner in the Yankees' ownership since 1979, and he owns minor league teams independent of the Yankees.
"From a partner's standpoint, there generally are two things you look for in a managing partner: Does he run a quality operation and does he make money for his partners?" Goldklang said. "From that perspective, George gets an A-plus. From a minor league perspective, there are 29 organizations and then there are the Yankees. You see the difference in how the people in the organization conduct themselves, from Triple A down to rookie ball."
Steinbrenner would have it no other way. 
"George probably is more driven than any other individual with whom I have come into contact," Goldklang said. "He's always on. That intensity creates difficulties for people who work for him or with him, but in terms of achieving an objective, it's tough to beat it. I think George's drive, his intensity, his energy level have probably exceeded those of all the other owners who have come and gone in the interim.
"The Yankees right now are the poster boys for everybody who wants to complain about revenue or competitive imbalance, but look where the Yankees were 30 years ago. The change was on George's watch."
Mistakes, though, he's made a few, Steinbrenner said, naming his biggest. He mentioned his two suspensions, for which he said he held no grudges. "I get letters from Fay Vincent when we do good things," he said while referring to the second suspending commissioner.
And he mentioned the way he dismissed Yogi Berra as manager, getting off to a bad start in his relationship with Joe DiMaggio, his feud with Winfield and letting Jackson leave as a free agent.
"Billy Martin was a strange relationship," he added. "I had a lot of strange relationships."

Principal Owner Names Names
The Yankees, during George Steinbrenner's ownership, have always listed the names of all of the partners in their media guide. Whether it is in the interest of full disclosure or a nod to the partners, Steinbrenner makes sure the names are there.
The same cannot be said for all of the other teams. The guides of six teams do not even list who the primary owner is, let alone the minority partners.
The Chicago Cubs do not acknowledge that the Tribune Company owns them, even though the Tribune Company has owned them for 20 years. The Milwaukee Brewers list the Tribune Company as the Cubs' owner in the guide's opponents section, but nowhere in the guide does it say who owns the Brewers.
AOL Time Warner does not exist in the Atlanta Braves guide even though AOL Time Warner owns the Braves. The Seattle guide does not list the owner of the Mariners except buried in the team's history, where it says that in 1992 the team was bought by the Seattle Mariners Baseball Club, a convenient corporate name with no mention of the Nintendo people who actually own the team.
The Los Angeles Dodgers also appear ownerless except for a buried mention of the Fox Group in their guide's history section.
Finally, there is the Montreal guide, which does not acknowledge the Expos' owner in the English section. The only mention of the ownership by Major League Baseball is in the biographies of the team's top three executives, where it says they were appointed by Major League Baseball, or le Baseball Majeur.

The High Price of Talent
The average annual salaries of seven of the Yankees' roster of eight starting pitchers total $51 million. Add a conservative $4.5 million for the unsigned Orlando Hernandez for a total of $55.5 million. 
That total exceeds the complete 2002 luxury tax payrolls, not including benefit payments, of eight teams. Add in benefit payments, and the Yankees' starters still exceed the payrolls of four clubs.
Roger Clemens is among the starters because George Steinbrenner wanted him back. He wanted him back for two reasons. One reason was so that he could gain his 300th career victory with the Yankees. Leadership was the other reason.
"He's a true warrior and he's a leader," Steinbrenner said. "You can't lead the charge unless you know how to sit the saddle and he knows how to sit the saddle."

RECOVERY SEEN

BYLINE:  By Jeremy Pearce 

 BODY:
 Rutgers economists say New Jersey is emerging from recession. Although the state's unemployment rate last year was the highest in six years, at 5.6 percent, the trend recently reversed and the number of jobs grew slightly. 
James E. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said the state should gain 40,000 jobs this year and each of the next four years. But he said some industries, including health care and telecommunications and other high-technology businesses, might continue to lag. Even so, the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia has forecast moderate growth overall for the state this year. Jeremy Pearce

RENT GOUGING OUTLAWED

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 Landlords within 10 miles of a natural disaster area will be prohibited from rent gouging under a bill signed by Governor McGreevey. 
The law is in response to reports that landlords around Bound Brook and Manville tripled and quadrupled rents after Hurricane Floyd in 1999 when people, who had been flooded out of homes, were looking for apartments, said a spokesman for Assemblyman Peter J. Biondi, the bill's sponsor. The law allows the governor to declare a rent protection emergency, which would prohibit landlords from raising rates more than twice the rate of inflation for the preceding nine months.

MUSEUM FANTASY MEETS REALITY

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
 Two years ago, when it was first proposed, it was hard to believe anything as fantastic as Frank Gehry's cloud-shaped, titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum could ever be built on Lower Manhattan's waterfront. 
Last week, the $950 million fantasy met the reality of a weak economy and the museum's financial straits. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation withdrew the proposal. David W. Dunlap

HEADLINE: Princeton's Plan Is Exactly Right 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Let me provide a few additional facts on Princeton's downtown redevelopment project (Dec. 22): 
 *The garage in the project will contain 500 parking spaces. 
That's 231 more than the 289 on the flat lots being replaced. Shared use -- diners and residents at night, shoppers and library users in the daytime -- maximize the benefit derived.
*There are not 85 spaces being "given over" to Princeton Township for library use. That's what happens if the garage is NOT built. It is agreed that a garage of 500 spaces will more than accommodate library users without the need to segregate reserved spaces for them.
*The $3,000-a-month rent reported for the new apartments is an exaggeration. The 32 one-bedroom units are expected to rent at an average of $1,900, and the 33 two-bedroom units at an average of less than $2,600 a month. That's reasonable market value in the fast-growing Central Jersey region. Rents for the 12 units reserved for low- and moderate-income people will vary but are expected to average $725 a month.
The need is there. The financing is sound. Princeton's downtown will be the stronger.

Every Man A Kingpin

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER 

 BODY:
AMONG the dreary statistics compiled at the end of 2002 -- from sputtering stock market returns to accumulating layoffs and flagging consumer confidence -- there was at least one tally that, while obscure, seemed immune to the malaise. Indeed, if you're looking to score big in these dark times, you might want to try your local bowling alley.
 The nation's bowling scores are up. 
 Way up. Too far up.
 In 1970, there were roughly 400 million league-level, nonprofessional games bowled around the country. Of those, 854 were perfect games -- that's a score of 300, or all strikes. By 2002, the number of games bowled had dwindled to 170 million, but a whopping 42,000 of those were perfect, according to the American Bowling Congress. That's 42,000 games with no spares, no ugly 7-10 splits, no gutter balls. 
 All in the wrist? Nah. It's in the oil.
 By applying protective wood lacquer in specific patterns, bowling center operators can substantially improve (or ruin) even a novice bowler's game. A thick application down the middle of the lane, for instance, with drier boards along the gutters, will help nudge wayward balls back toward the sweet spot. Lanes with a dry center and oiled edges, in contrast, are notoriously hard to play. 
 "Society has changed to one of instant gratification," said Roger Dalkin, the executive director of the American Bowling Congress, the game's largest membership organization. Bowling centers have to cater to a public that wants to have fun and bowl better without the work, without the practice.
The delicate balance between technology and integrity in sports is, of course, almost always in need of tweaking. Last August, for instance, golf's two governing bodies quietly scrapped plans to allow recreational players to use hot drivers, designed to hit the ball farther. The new clubs had been scheduled to hit the links last Wednesday. 
 Researchers at Pacific University in Oregon equipped players with special light-filtering contact lenses that improved batting averages on the school's baseball team. And last spring, Major League Baseball cracked down on batters wearing large elbow pads that allow them to crowd the plate safely.
 But unlike pads and hot drivers and even tinted contacts, lane oiling is invisible.
 "If they're trying to give casual bowlers more fun and they're not pulling the wool over their eyes, absent other wrongdoing, I see no problem," said Marcia Sage, the president of the Sports Ethics Institute, a nonprofit Web-based research group (SportsEthicsInstitute.com). "But if they're using different patterns for different leagues or otherwise undermining or influencing the outcomes of a competition, well, that's a no-brainer."
 Professional competitions avoid such pitfalls by closely regulating oiling patterns. And the American Bowling Congress has responded to the explosion of perfect games among its members by developing and promoting a hard distinction between casual bowling, and what it calls sport bowling. Officially sanctioned competitions in the latter category must use oiling patterns that place the emphasis back on form and skill, a tack that Mr. Dalkin feels makes better long-term sense -- both for the sport and business of bowling. 
 "When you give people instant gratification, you give them a quick feeling of euphoria," he said. "But in the longer term, people come to feel they haven't earned it."

GRAPHIC: Photo (Gramercy Pictures) Chart: "No Need for Silly Superstition"Over the last 30 years, the number of Americans participating in organized bowling has steadily declined, despite recent bowling-themed movies like"Kingpin" and "The Big Lebowski" (left). But even with fewer league bowlers, the number of perfect games has risen steadily. Chart shows decrease in League bowled games each decade since 1980 compared to 1910 through 1970 where League games were increasing by decade. Chart shows increases in Perfect games bowled each decade since 1980. How to Succeed in Bowling Without Really TryingBowling center operators can make a lane more or less difficult to play by applying oil in certain patterns on the first two-thirds of the lane. Top Hat or Blocked Wall PatternThis is a common pattern, generally considered the easiest and most forgiving. 1. THE DRIFTAlthough speed and trajectory will always drive an ill-thrown ball into the gutter, shots that drift gently to the edges are not doomed if the lane is oiled to correct this. 2. THE DRY BOARDSWhile the ball will glide and slide over the well-oiled parts of the lane, when it hits the comparatively dry outer boards, the friction between wood and ball increases. This is called a wall of friction. 3. THE CORRECTIONIf the player has put a favorable hook on the ball, the friction provided by the drier outer boards will emphasize the rotation, and help guide the ball back toward the sweet spot. The back end of the lane, having little or no oil, also emphasizes the hook. 4. THE BALL AND PINSThe rubber in bowling balls themselves has been replaced by materials like urethane or resin, which provide more friction. And some bowlers have argued that the pins seem livelier than in years past. Flat OilThis is simply an even distribution of the oil across the lane. Few alleys use this. Repeated throws of the ball eventually creates a Reverse Block pattern (below). Reverse BlockNot usually created deliberately, but an oft-found condition in open-play alleys that are not well-maintained. It is a hook bowler's nightmare. Christmas TreeConsidered the fairest pattern. Most sport bowling and professional tournaments use a variation of this pattern, which caters to most throwing styles without favoring one in particular.

HEADLINE: THE AMERICAN EMPIRE; 
The Burden

BYLINE:  By Michael Ignatieff; Michael Ignatieff, director of the Carr Center at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, has written recently for The Times Magazine about Bosnia and Afghanistan. He is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
I.
In a speech to graduating cadets at West Point in June, President Bush declared, "America has no empire to extend or utopia to establish." When he spoke to veterans assembled at the White House in November, he said: America has "no territorial ambitions. We don't seek an empire. Our nation is committed to freedom for ourselves and for others."
 Ever since George Washington warned his countrymen against foreign entanglements, empire abroad has been seen as the republic's permanent temptation and its potential nemesis. Yet what word but "empire" describes the awesome thing that America is becoming? It is the only nation that polices the world through five global military commands; maintains more than a million men and women at arms on four continents; deploys carrier battle groups on watch in every ocean; guarantees the survival of countries from Israel to South Korea; drives the wheels of global trade and commerce; and fills the hearts and minds of an entire planet with its dreams and desires. 
 A historian once remarked that Britain acquired its empire in "a fit of absence of mind." If Americans have an empire, they have acquired it in a state of deep denial. But Sept. 11 was an awakening, a moment of reckoning with the extent of American power and the avenging hatreds it arouses. Americans may not have thought of the World Trade Center or the Pentagon as the symbolic headquarters of a world empire, but the men with the box cutters certainly did, and so do numberless millions who cheered their terrifying exercise in the propaganda of the deed. 
Being an imperial power, however, is more than being the most powerful nation or just the most hated one. It means enforcing such order as there is in the world and doing so in the American interest. It means laying down the rules America wants (on everything from markets to weapons of mass destruction) while exempting itself from other rules (the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and the International Criminal Court) that go against its interest. It also means carrying out imperial functions in places America has inherited from the failed empires of the 20th century -- Ottoman, British and Soviet. In the 21st century, America rules alone, struggling to manage the insurgent zones -- Palestine and the northwest frontier of Pakistan, to name but two -- that have proved to be the nemeses of empires past. 
Iraq lays bare the realities of America's new role. Iraq itself is an imperial fiction, cobbled together at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919 by the French and British and held together by force and violence since independence. Now an expansionist rights violator holds it together with terror. The United Nations lay dozing like a dog before the fire, happy to ignore Saddam, until an American president seized it by the scruff of the neck and made it bark. Multilateral solutions to the world's problems are all very well, but they have no teeth unless America bares its fangs. 
America's empire is not like empires of times past, built on colonies, conquest and the white man's burden. We are no longer in the era of the United Fruit Company, when American corporations needed the Marines to secure their investments overseas. The 21st century imperium is a new invention in the annals of political science, an empire lite, a global hegemony whose grace notes are free markets, human rights and democracy, enforced by the most awesome military power the world has ever known. It is the imperialism of a people who remember that their country secured its independence by revolt against an empire, and who like to think of themselves as the friend of freedom everywhere. It is an empire without consciousness of itself as such, constantly shocked that its good intentions arouse resentment abroad. But that does not make it any less of an empire, with a conviction that it alone, in Herman Melville's words, bears "the ark of the liberties of the world." 
In this vein, the president's National Security Strategy, announced in September, commits America to lead other nations toward "the single sustainable model for national success," by which he meant free markets and liberal democracy. This is strange rhetoric for a Texas politician who ran for office opposing nation-building abroad and calling for a more humble America overseas. But Sept. 11 changed everyone, including a laconic and anti-rhetorical president. His messianic note may be new to him, but it is not new to his office. It has been present in the American vocabulary at least since Woodrow Wilson went to Versailles in 1919 and told the world that he wanted to make it safe for democracy. 
Ever since Wilson, presidents have sounded the same redemptive note while "frantically avoiding recognition of the imperialism that we in fact exercise," as the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr said in 1960. Even now, as President Bush appears to be maneuvering the country toward war with Iraq, the deepest implication of what is happening has not been fully faced: that Iraq is an imperial operation that would commit a reluctant republic to become the guarantor of peace, stability, democratization and oil supplies in a combustible region of Islamic peoples stretching from Egypt to Afghanistan. A role once played by the Ottoman Empire, then by the French and the British, will now be played by a nation that has to ask whether in becoming an empire it risks losing its soul as a republic. 
As the United States faces this moment of truth, John Quincy Adams's warning of 1821 remains stark and pertinent: if America were tempted to "become the dictatress of the world, she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit." What empires lavish abroad, they cannot spend on good republican government at home: on hospitals or roads or schools. A distended military budget only aggravates America's continuing failure to keep its egalitarian promise to itself. And these are not the only costs of empire. Detaining two American citizens without charge or access to counsel in military brigs, maintaining illegal combatants on a foreign island in a legal limbo, keeping lawful aliens under permanent surveillance while deporting others after secret hearings: these are not the actions of a republic that lives by the rule of law but of an imperial power reluctant to trust its own liberties. Such actions may still be a long way short of Roosevelt's internment of the Japanese, but that may mean only that the worst -- following, say, another large attack on United States citizens that produces mass casualties -- is yet to come. 
The impending operation in Iraq is thus a defining moment in America's long debate with itself about whether its overseas role as an empire threatens or strengthens its existence as a republic. The American electorate, while still supporting the president, wonders whether his proclamation of a war without end against terrorists and tyrants may only increase its vulnerability while endangering its liberties and its economic health at home. A nation that rarely counts the cost of what it really values now must ask what the "liberation" of Iraq is worth. A republic that has paid a tiny burden to maintain its empire -- no more than about 4 percent of its gross domestic product -- now contemplates a bill that is altogether steeper. Even if victory is rapid, a war in Iraq and a postwar occupation may cost anywhere from $120 billion to $200 billion. 
What every schoolchild also knows about empires is that they eventually face nemeses. To call America the new Rome is at once to recall Rome's glory and its eventual fate at the hands of the barbarians. A confident and carefree republic -- the city on a hill, whose people have always believed they are immune from history's harms -- now has to confront not just an unending imperial destiny but also a remote possibility that seems to haunt the history of empire: hubris followed by defeat. 

II.
Even at this late date, it is still possible to ask: Why should a republic take on the risks of empire? Won't it run a chance of endangering its identity as a free people? The problem is that this implies innocent options that in the case of Iraq may no longer exist. Iraq is not just about whether the United States can retain its republican virtue in a wicked world. Virtuous disengagement is no longer a possibility. Since Sept. 11, it has been about whether the republic can survive in safety at home without imperial policing abroad. Face to face with "evil empires" of the past, the republic reluctantly accepted a division of the world based on mutually assured destruction. But now it faces much less stable and reliable opponents -- rogue states like Iraq and North Korea with the potential to supply weapons of mass destruction to a terrorist internationale. Iraq represents the first in a series of struggles to contain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the first attempt to shut off the potential supply of lethal technologies to a global terrorist network.
Containment rather than war would be the better course, but the Bush administration seems to have concluded that containment has reached its limits -- and the conclusion is not unreasonable. Containment is not designed to stop production of sarin, VX nerve gas, anthrax and nuclear weapons. Threatened retaliation might deter Saddam from using these weapons, but his continued development of them increases his capacity to intimidate and deter others, including the United States. Already his weapons have sharply raised the cost of any invasion, and as time goes by this could become prohibitive. The possibility that North Korea might quickly develop weapons of mass destruction makes regime change on the Korean peninsula all but unthinkable. Weapons of mass destruction would render Saddam the master of a region that, because it has so much of the world's proven oil reserves, makes it what a military strategist would call the empire's center of gravity. 
Iraq may claim to have ceased manufacturing these weapons after 1991, but these claims remain unconvincing, because inspectors found evidence of activity after that date. So what to do? Efforts to embargo and sanction the regime have hurt only the Iraqi people. What is left? An inspections program, even a permanent one, might slow the dictator's weapons programs down, but inspections are easily evaded. That leaves us, but only as a reluctant last resort, with regime change. 
Regime change is an imperial task par excellence, since it assumes that the empire's interest has a right to trump the sovereignty of a state. The Bush administration would ask, What moral authority rests with a sovereign who murders and ethnically cleanses his own people, has twice invaded neighboring countries and usurps his people's wealth in order to build palaces and lethal weapons? And the administration is not alone. Not even Kofi Annan, the secretary general, charged with defending the United Nations Charter, says that sovereignty confers impunity for such crimes, though he has made it clear he would prefer to leave a disarmed Saddam in power rather than risk the conflagration of war to unseat him.
Regime change also raises the difficult question for Americans of whether their own freedom entails a duty to defend the freedom of others beyond their borders. The precedents here are inconclusive. Just because Wilson and Roosevelt sent Americans to fight and die for freedom in Europe and Asia doesn't mean their successors are committed to this duty everywhere and forever. The war in Vietnam was sold to a skeptical American public as another battle for freedom, and it led the republic into defeat and disgrace. 
Yet it remains a fact -- as disagreeable to those left wingers who regard American imperialism as the root of all evil as it is to the right-wing isolationists, who believe that the world beyond our shores is none of our business -- that there are many peoples who owe their freedom to an exercise of American military power. It's not just the Japanese and the Germans, who became democrats under the watchful eye of Generals MacArthur and Clay. There are the Bosnians, whose nation survived because American air power and diplomacy forced an end to a war the Europeans couldn't stop. There are the Kosovars, who would still be imprisoned in Serbia if not for Gen. Wesley Clark and the Air Force. The list of people whose freedom depends on American air and ground power also includes the Afghans and, most inconveniently of all, the Iraqis. 
The moral evaluation of empire gets complicated when one of its benefits might be freedom for the oppressed. Iraqi exiles are adamant: even if the Iraqi people might be the immediate victims of an American attack, they would also be its ultimate beneficiaries. It would make the case for military intervention easier, of course, if the Iraqi exiles cut a more impressive figure. They feud and squabble and hate one another nearly as much as they hate Saddam. But what else is to be expected from a political culture pulverized by 40 years of state terror?
If only invasion, and not containment, can build democracy in Iraq, then the question becomes whether the Bush administration actually has any real intention of doing so. The exiles fear that a mere change of regime, a coup in which one Baathist thug replaces another, would suit American interests just as well, provided the thug complied with the interests of the Pentagon and American oil companies. Whenever it has exerted power overseas, America has never been sure whether it values stability -- which means not only political stability but also the steady, profitable flow of goods and raw materials -- more than it values its own rhetoric about democracy. Where the two values have collided, American power has come down heavily on the side of stability, for example, toppling democratically elected leaders from Mossadegh in Iran to Allende in Chile. Iraq is yet another test of this choice. Next door in Iran, from the 1950's to the 1970's, America backed stability over democracy, propping up the autocratic rule of the shah, only to reap the whirlwind of an Islamic fundamentalist revolution in 1979 that delivered neither stability nor real democracy. Does the same fate await an American operation in Iraq? 
International human rights groups, like Amnesty International, are dismayed at the way both the British government of Tony Blair and the Bush administration are citing the human rights abuses of Saddam to defend the idea of regime change. Certainly the British and the American governments maintained a complicit and dishonorable silence when Saddam gassed the Kurds in 1988. Yet now that the two governments are taking decisive action, human rights groups seem more outraged by the prospect of action than they are by the abuses they once denounced. The fact that states are both late and hypocritical in their adoption of human rights does not deprive them of the right to use force to defend them. 
The disagreeable reality for those who believe in human rights is that there are some occasions -- and Iraq may be one of them -- when war is the only real remedy for regimes that live by terror. This does not mean the choice is morally unproblematic. The choice is one between two evils, between containing and leaving a tyrant in place and the targeted use of force, which will kill people but free a nation from the tyrant's grip. 

III.
Still, the claim that a free republic may sense a duty to help other people attain their freedom does not answer the prudential question of whether the republic should run such risks. For the risks are huge, and they are imperial. Order, let alone democracy, will take a decade to consolidate in Iraq. The Iraqi opposition's blueprints for a democratic and secular federation of Iraq's component peoples -- Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkomans and others -- are noble documents, but they are just paper unless American and then international troops, under United Nations mandate, remain to keep the peace until Iraqis trust one another sufficiently to police themselves. Like all imperial exercises in creating order, it will work only if the puppets the Americans install cease to be puppets and build independent political legitimacy of their own.
If America takes on Iraq, it takes on the reordering of the whole region. It will have to stick at it through many successive administrations. The burden of empire is of long duration, and democracies are impatient with long-lasting burdens -- none more so than America. These burdens include opening up a dialogue with the Iranians, who appear to be in a political upsurge themselves, so that they do not feel threatened by a United States-led democracy on their border. The Turks will have to be reassured, and the Kurds will have to be instructed that the real aim of United States policy is not the creation of a Kurdish state that goes on to dismember Turkey. The Syrians will have to be coaxed into abandoning their claims against the Israelis and making peace. The Saudis, once democracy takes root next door in Iraq, will have to be coaxed into embracing democratic change themselves. 
All this is possible, but there is a larger challenge still. Unseating an Arab government in Iraq while leaving the Palestinians to face Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships is a virtual guarantee of unending Islamic wrath against the United States. The chief danger in the whole Iraqi gamble lies here -- in supposing that victory over Saddam, in the absence of a Palestinian-Israeli settlement, would leave the United States with a stable hegemony over the Middle East. Absent a Middle East peace, victory in Iraq would still leave the Palestinians face to face with the Israelis in a conflict in which they would destroy not only each other but American authority in the Islamic world as well. 
The Americans have played imperial guarantor in the region since Roosevelt met with Ibn Saud in 1945 and Truman recognized Ben-Gurion's Israel in 1948. But it paid little or no price for its imperial pre-eminence until the rise of an armed Palestinian resistance after 1987. Now, with every day that American power appears complicit in Israeli attacks that kill civilians in the West Bank and in Gaza, and with the Arab nations giving their tacit support to Palestinian suicide bombers, the imperial guarantor finds itself dragged into a regional conflict that is one long hemorrhage of its diplomatic and military authority. 
Properly understood, then, the operation in Iraq entails a commitment, so far unstated, to enforce a peace on the Palestinians and Israelis. Such a peace must, at a minimum, give the Palestinians a viable, contiguous state capable of providing land and employment for three million people. It must include a commitment to rebuild their shattered government infrastructure, possibly through a United Nations transitional administration, with U.N.-mandated peacekeepers to provide security for Israelis and Palestinians. This is an awesomely tall order, but if America cannot find the will to enforce this minimum of justice, neither it nor Israel will have any safety from terror. This remains true even if you accept that there are terrorists in the Arab world who will never be content unless Israel is driven into the sea. A successful American political strategy against terror depends on providing enough peace for both Israelis and Palestinians that extremists on either side begin to lose the support that keeps violence alive.
Paradoxically, reducing the size of the task does not reduce the risks. If an invasion of Iraq is delinked from Middle East peace, then all America will gain for victory in Iraq is more terror cells in the Muslim world. If America goes on to help the Palestinians achieve a state, the result will not win over those, like Osama bin Laden, who hate America for what it is. But at least it would address the rage of those who hate it for what it does. 
This is finally what makes an invasion of Iraq an imperial act: for it to succeed, it will have to build freedom, not just for the Iraqis but also for the Palestinians, along with a greater sense of security for Israel. Again, the paradox of the Iraq operation is that half measures are more dangerous than whole measures. Imperial powers do not have the luxury of timidity, for timidity is not prudence; it is a confession of weakness. 

IV.
The question, then, is not whether America is too powerful but whether it is powerful enough. Does it have what it takes to be grandmaster of what Colin Powell has called the chessboard of the world's most inflammable region?
America has been more successful than most great powers in understanding its strengths as well as its limitations. It has become adept at using what is called soft power -- influence, example and persuasion -- in preference to hard power. Adepts of soft power understand that even the most powerful country in the world can't get its way all the time. Even client states have to be deferred to. When an ally like Saudi Arabia asks the United States to avoid flying over its country when bombing Afghanistan, America complies. When America seeks to use Turkey as a base for hostilities in Iraq, it must accept Turkish preconditions. Being an empire doesn't mean being omnipotent. 
Nowhere is this clearer than in America's relations with Israel. America's ally is anything but a client state. Its prime minister has refused direct orders from the president of the United States in the past, and he can be counted on to do so again. An Iraq operation requires the United States not merely to prevent Israel from entering the fray but to make peace with a bitter enemy. Since 1948, American and Israeli security interests have been at one. But as the death struggle in Palestine continues, it exposes the United States to global hatreds that make it impossible for it to align its interests with those Israelis who are opposed to any settlement with the Palestinians that does not amount, in effect, to Palestinian capitulation. The issue is not whether the United States should continue to support the state of Israel, but which state, with which borders and which set of relations with its neighbors, it is willing to risk its imperial authority to secure. The apocalyptic violence of one side and the justified refusal to negotiate under fire on the other side leave precious little time to salvage a two-state solution for the Middle East. But this, even more than rescuing Iraq, is the supreme task -- and test -- of American leadership.

V.
What assets does American leadership have at its disposal? At a time when an imperial peace in the Middle East requires diplomats, aid workers and civilians with all the skills in rebuilding shattered societies, American power projection in the area overwhelmingly wears a military uniform. "Every great power, whatever its ideology," Arthur Schlesinger Jr. once wrote, "has its warrior caste." Without realizing the consequences of what they were doing, successive American presidents have turned the projection of American power to the warrior caste, according to the findings of research by Robert J. Lieber of Georgetown University. In President Kennedy's time, Lieber has found, the United States spent 1 percent of its G.D.P. on the nonmilitary aspects of promoting its influence overseas -- State Department, foreign aid, the United Nations, information programs. Under Bush's presidency, the number has declined to just 0.2 percent.
Special Forces are more in evidence in the world's developing nations than Peace Corps volunteers and USAID food experts. As Dana Priest demonstrates in "The Mission," a soon-to-be-published study of the American military, the Pentagon's regional commanders exercise more overseas diplomatic and political leverage than the State Department's ambassadors. Even if you accept that generals can make good diplomats and Special Forces captains can make friends for the United States, it still remains true that the American presence overseas is increasingly armed, in uniform and behind barbed wire and high walls. With every American Embassy now hardened against terrorist attack, the empire's overseas outposts look increasingly like Fort Apache. American power is visible to the world in carrier battle groups patrolling offshore and F-16's whistling overhead. In southern Afghanistan, it is the 82nd Airborne, bulked up in body armor, helmets and weapons, that Pashtun peasants see, not American aid workers and water engineers. Each month the United States spends an estimated $1 billion on military operations in Afghanistan and only $25 million on aid. 
This sort of projection of power, hunkered down against attack, can earn the United States fear and respect, but not admiration and affection. America's very strength -- in military power -- cannot conceal its weakness in the areas that really matter: the elements of power that do not subdue by force of arms but inspire by force of example. 

VI.
It is unsurprising that force projection overseas should awaken resentment among America's enemies. More troubling is the hostility it arouses among friends, those whose security is guaranteed by American power. Nowhere is this more obvious than in Europe. At a moment when the costs of empire are mounting for America, her rich European allies matter financially. But in America's emerging global strategy, they have been demoted to reluctant junior partners. This makes them resentful and unwilling allies, less and less able to understand the nation that liberated them in 1945.
For 50 years, Europe rebuilt itself economically while passing on the costs of its defense to the United States. This was a matter of more than just reducing its armed forces and the proportion of national income spent on the military. All Western European countries reduced the martial elements in their national identities. In the process, European identity (with the possible exception of Britain) became postmilitary and postnational. This opened a widening gap with the United States. It remained a nation in which flag, sacrifice and martial honor are central to national identity. Europeans who had once invented the idea of the martial nation-state now looked at American patriotism, the last example of the form, and no longer recognized it as anything but flag-waving extremism. The world's only empire was isolated, not just because it was the biggest power but also because it was the West's last military nation-state. 
Sept. 11 rubbed in the lesson that global power is still measured by military capability. The Europeans discovered that they lacked the military instruments to be taken seriously and that their erstwhile defenders, the Americans, regarded them, in a moment of crisis, with suspicious contempt. 
Yet the Americans cannot afford to create a global order all on their own. European participation in peacekeeping, nation-building and humanitarian reconstruction is so important that the Americans are required, even when they are unwilling to do so, to include Europeans in the governance of their evolving imperial project. The Americans essentially dictate Europe's place in this new grand design. The United States is multilateral when it wants to be, unilateral when it must be; and it enforces a new division of labor in which America does the fighting, the French, British and Germans do the police patrols in the border zones and the Dutch, Swiss and Scandinavians provide the humanitarian aid.
This is a very different picture of the world than the one entertained by liberal international lawyers and human rights activists who had hoped to see American power integrated into a transnational legal and economic order organized around the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Criminal Court and other international human rights and environmental institutions and mechanisms. Successive American administrations have signed on to those pieces of the transnational legal order that suit their purposes (the World Trade Organization, for example) while ignoring or even sabotaging those parts (the International Criminal Court or the Kyoto Protocol) that do not. A new international order is emerging, but it is designed to suit American imperial objectives. America's allies want a multilateral order that will essentially constrain American power. But the empire will not be tied down like Gulliver with a thousand legal strings. 

VII.
On the new imperial frontier, in places like Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo, American military power, together with European money and humanitarian motives, is producing a form of imperial rule for a postimperial age. If this sounds contradictory, it is because the impulses that have gone into this new exercise of power are contradictory. On the one hand, the semiofficial ideology of the Western world -- human rights -- sustains the principle of self-determination, the right of each people to rule themselves free of outside interference. This was the ethical principle that inspired the decolonization of Asia and Africa after World War II. Now we are living through the collapse of many of these former colonial states. Into the resulting vacuum of chaos and massacre a new imperialism has reluctantly stepped -- reluctantly because these places are dangerous and because they seemed, at least until Sept. 11, to be marginal to the interests of the powers concerned. But, gradually, this reluctance has been replaced by an understanding of why order needs to be brought to these places.
Nowhere, after all, could have been more distant than Afghanistan, yet that remote and desperate place was where the attacks of Sept. 11 were prepared. Terror has collapsed distance, and with this collapse has come a sharpened American focus on the necessity of bringing order to the frontier zones. Bringing order is the paradigmatic imperial task, but it is essential, for reasons of both economy and principle, to do so without denying local peoples their rights to some degree of self-determination. 
The old European imperialism justified itself as a mission to civilize, to prepare tribes and so-called lesser breeds in the habits of self-discipline necessary for the exercise of self-rule. Self-rule did not necessarily have to happen soon -- the imperial administrators hoped to enjoy the sunset as long as possible -- but it was held out as a distant incentive, and the incentive was crucial in co-opting local elites and preventing them from passing into open rebellion. In the new imperialism, this promise of self-rule cannot be kept so distant, for local elites are all creations of modern nationalism, and modern nationalism's primary ethical content is self-determination. If there is an invasion of Iraq, local elites must be "empowered" to take over as soon as the American imperial forces have restored order and the European humanitarians have rebuilt the roads, schools and houses. Nation-building seeks to reconcile imperial power and local self-determination through the medium of an exit strategy. This is imperialism in a hurry: to spend money, to get results, to turn the place back to the locals and get out. But it is similar to the old imperialism in the sense that real power in these zones -- Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan and soon, perhaps, Iraq -- will remain in Washington. 

VIII.
At the beginning of the first volume of "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," published in 1776, Edward Gibbon remarked that empires endure only so long as their rulers take care not to overextend their borders. Augustus bequeathed his successors an empire "within those limits which nature seemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries: on the west the Atlantic Ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the Euphrates on the east; and towards the south the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa." Beyond these boundaries lay the barbarians. But the "vanity or ignorance" of the Romans, Gibbon went on, led them to "despise and sometimes to forget the outlying countries that had been left in the enjoyment of a barbarous independence." As a result, the proud Romans were lulled into making the fatal mistake of "confounding the Roman monarchy with the globe of the earth."
This characteristic delusion of imperial power is to confuse global power with global domination. The Americans may have the former, but they do not have the latter. They cannot rebuild each failed state or appease each anti-American hatred, and the more they try, the more they expose themselves to the overreach that eventually undermined the classical empires of old. 
The secretary of defense may be right when he warns the North Koreans that America is capable of fighting on two fronts -- in Korea and Iraq -- simultaneously, but Americans at home cannot be overjoyed at such a prospect, and if two fronts are possible at once, a much larger number of fronts is not. If conflict in Iraq, North Korea or both becomes a possibility, Al Qaeda can be counted on to seek to strike a busy and overextended empire in the back. What this suggests is not just that overwhelming power never confers the security it promises but also that even the overwhelmingly powerful need friends and allies. In the cold war, the road to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, led through Moscow and Beijing. Now America needs its old cold war adversaries more than ever to control the breakaway, bankrupt Communist rogue that is threatening America and her clients from Tokyo to Seoul. 
Empires survive when they understand that diplomacy, backed by force, is always to be preferred to force alone. Looking into the still more distant future, say a generation ahead, resurgent Russia and China will demand recognition both as world powers and as regional hegemons. As the North Korean case shows, America needs to share the policing of nonproliferation and other threats with these powers, and if it tries, as the current National Security Strategy suggests, to prevent the emergence of any competitor to American global dominance, it risks everything that Gibbon predicted: overextension followed by defeat.
America will also remain vulnerable, despite its overwhelming military power, because its primary enemy, Iraq and North Korea notwithstanding, is not a state, susceptible to deterrence, influence and coercion, but a shadowy cell of fanatics who have proved that they cannot be deterred and coerced and who have hijacked a global ideology -- Islam -- that gives them a bottomless supply of recruits and allies in a war, a war not just against America but against her client regimes in the Islamic world. In many countries in that part of the world, America is caught in the middle of a civil war raging between incompetent and authoritarian regimes and the Islamic revolutionaries who want to return the Arab world to the time of the prophet. It is a civil war between the politics of pure reaction and the politics of the impossible, with America unfortunately aligned on the side of reaction. On Sept. 11, the American empire discovered that in the Middle East its local pillars were literally built on sand. 
Until Sept. 11, successive United States administrations treated their Middle Eastern clients like gas stations. This was part of a larger pattern. After 1991 and the collapse of the Soviet empire, American presidents thought they could have imperial domination on the cheap, ruling the world without putting in place any new imperial architecture -- new military alliances, new legal institutions, new international development organisms -- for a postcolonial, post-Soviet world.
The Greeks taught the Romans to call this failure hubris. It was also, in the 1990's, a general failure of the historical imagination, an inability of the post-cold-war West to grasp that the emerging crisis of state order in so many overlapping zones of the world -- from Egypt to Afghanistan -- would eventually become a security threat at home. Radical Islam would never have succeeded in winning adherents if the Muslim countries that won independence from the European empires had been able to convert dreams of self-determination into the reality of competent, rule-abiding states. America has inherited this crisis of self-determination from the empires of the past. Its solution -- to create democracy in Iraq, then hopefully roll out the same happy experiment throughout the Middle East -- is both noble and dangerous: noble because, if successful, it will finally give these peoples the self-determination they vainly fought for against the empires of the past; dangerous because, if it fails, there will be nobody left to blame but the Americans. 
The dual nemeses of empire in the 20th century were nationalism, the desire of peoples to rule themselves free of alien domination, and narcissism, the incurable delusion of imperial rulers that the "lesser breeds" aspired only to be versions of themselves. Both nationalism and narcissism have threatened the American reassertion of global power since Sept. 11.

IX.
As the Iraqi operation looms, it is worth keeping Vietnam in mind. Vietnam was a titanic clash between two nation-building strategies, the Americans in support of the South Vietnamese versus the Communists in the north. Yet it proved impossible for foreigners to build stability in a divided country against resistance from a Communist elite fighting in the name of the Vietnamese nation. Vietnam is now one country, its civil war over and its long-term stability assured. An American operation in Iraq will not face a competing nationalist project, but across the Islamic world it will rouse the nationalist passions of people who want to rule themselves and worship as they please. As Vietnam shows, empire is no match, long-term, for nationalism.
America's success in the 20th century owed a great deal to the shrewd understanding that America's interest lay in aligning itself with freedom. Franklin Roosevelt, for example, told his advisers at Yalta in 1945, when he was dividing up the postwar world with Churchill and Stalin, that there were more than a billion "brown people" living in Asia, "ruled by a handful of whites." They resent it, the president mused aloud. America's goal, he said, "must be to help them achieve independence -- 1,100,000,000 enemies are dangerous."
The core beliefs of our time are the creations of the anticolonial revolt against empire: the idea that all human beings are equal and that each human group has a right to rule itself free of foreign interference. It is at least ironic that American believers in these ideas have ended up supporting the creation of a new form of temporary colonial tutelage for Bosnians, Kosovars and Afghans -- and could for Iraqis. The reason is simply that, however right these principles may be, the political form in which they are realized -- the nationalist nation-building project -- so often delivers liberated colonies straight to tyranny, as in the case of Baath Party rule in Iraq, or straight to chaos, as in Bosnia or Afghanistan. For every nationalist struggle that succeeds in giving its people self-determination and dignity, there are more that deliver their people only up to slaughter or terror or both. For every Vietnam brought about by nationalist struggle, there is a Palestinian struggle trapped in a downward spiral of terror and military oppression.
The age of empire ought to have been succeeded by an age of independent, equal and self-governing nation-states. But that has not come to pass. America has inherited a world scarred not just by the failures of empires past but also by the failure of nationalist movements to create and secure free states -- and now, suddenly, by the desire of Islamists to build theocratic tyrannies on the ruins of failed nationalist dreams. 
Those who want America to remain a republic rather than become an empire imagine rightly, but they have not factored in what tyranny or chaos can do to vital American interests. The case for empire is that it has become, in a place like Iraq, the last hope for democracy and stability alike. Even so, empires survive only by understanding their limits. Sept. 11 pitched the Islamic world into the beginning of a long and bloody struggle to determine how it will be ruled and by whom: the authoritarians, the Islamists or perhaps the democrats. America can help repress and contain the struggle, but even though its own security depends on the outcome, it cannot ultimately control it. Only a very deluded imperialist would believe otherwise.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 5 about the United States as the ruler of a new kind of empire associated a political theory erroneously with a recent study by a Georgetown University professor about nonmilitary aspects of promoting American interests abroad. "Warrior caste," a concept introduced by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and defined as the military presence used by a world power to project its influence, was not cited in the study by Robert J. Lieber.

HEADLINE: ON LOCATION; 
New Rochelle? No, Yonkers

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
A GOOD bit of "Catch Me If You Can," the holiday hit movie directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, is set in New Rochelle. The movie is based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who grew up in New Rochelle in the 1960's, and at a young age began a life of of check fraud, impersonation and escape. With gumption, charm and forged credentials, Mr. Abagnale masqueraded an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. He also became a master check counterfeiter, cashing millions of dollars worth of bad checks. His father, a proud Rotarian, had some disputes with the I.R.S. and fell on hard times, losing the family business, a stationery store in town. But none of the film was shot in Mr. Abagnale's hometown. Most of it was made in Hollywood. Three scenes, however, were shot in Yonkers. Mr. Hanks, as the F.B.I. agent in pursuit of Abignale, played by Mr. DiCaprio, makes a phone call at a phone booth in Larkin Park. A Laundromat at 151 Lake Ave. was used in the film too, as well as a portion of Buena Vista Street (between 108-100), which Mr. DiCaprio runs down. 
 The three scenes were shot in one day and with a crew of 150, said Danielle Spring, director of the Yonkers film office. Though the City of Yonkers charges a minimal amount for film permits, Ms. Spring said that the single day of shooting, meant about $100,000 in income for the city of Yonkers, including $25,000 to $30,000 for overtime for the fire, police and public works departments. Large crowds came out to try to get glimpses of Mr. Hanks and Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Spring said they obliged their fans with waves. 
 Ms. Spring added that Mr. Spielberg was very friendly and worked with a crisp efficiency. "One, two, three, they shot and moved locations," she said.
Three other major motion pictures were partially shot in Yonkers in 2002: "Maid in Manhattan," "School of Rock" and "Mona Lisa's Smile." The city is at an advantage when it comes to filming because it is within the union zone of New York City, so New York crews do not require the extra fee they are paid for traveling beyond it. 
Yonkers offers a wide range of urban and suburban settings. Besides the three big movies, seven independent films, many commercials and episodes of television series including "Law and Order" and "The Sopranos."
Mayor John Spencer says the city makes an aggressive push to get film business. "It's spirit building for Yonkers and it adds to the economy," he said, adding that the monetary impact is difficult to quantify because so much money is spent privately at local establishments. Mr. Spencer said he was always on hand to greet film crews. "I always tell them, I'm a politician, a mayor, give me a role" he said. "I haven't gotten one yet, but I'd take one. I'm a hambone."

HEADLINE: Have Merrill's Bulls Been Ledto Pasture? 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
IN quick succession, just days after E. Stanley O'Neal took over as chief executive of Merrill Lynch on Dec. 2, the firm announced several executive changes. G. Kelly Martin, a member of Merrill's executive committee, stepped down as president of the international private client business to pursue other interests. Michael J. P. Marks, the chairman of its European, Middle East and African operations, retired. Paul D. Roy, the co-president of its global markets and investment banking business, said that he, too, would leave the firm.
 Absorbing their portfolios were James P. Gorman, president of Merrill's brokerage network in the United States and a former McKinsey & Company executive who joined the firm in 1999, and Arshad R. Zakaria, Mr. Roy's co-president, who at 40 is now the youngest head of any big banking and securities division on Wall Street, the unit responsible for 60 percent of Merrill's profits. 
 It happens all the time -- a new chief executive names his own team, after all. But at Merrill, the bloodletting has actually been going on since Mr. O'Neal became president in July 2001, starting with the resignations, under pressure, of Jeffrey R. Peek, the head of asset management, and Thomas W. Davis, who had run the firm's investment banking business. 
More important, it signals a cultural and management revolution unique in the firm's history. In contrast with its peers on the Street, Merrill, under Mr. O'Neal's iron grip, is ruled by the cold, hard view that the current malaise of the markets will not dissolve anytime soon.
Mr. O'Neal's Merrill, it seems, is no longer bullish on America.
Over the last two years, Mr. O'Neal's crew, which also includes Thomas H. Patrick, the executive vice chairman, has presided over the loss of 18,600 jobs at Merrill, or 25.8 percent of the work force. No other investment firm has come close to cutting so deeply.
Merrill's new management team is viewed by insiders and outsiders alike as extraordinarily numbers-oriented -- realists, to supporters; cynics, to detractors.
Mr. Zakaria's ascent, in particular, has raised eyebrows on Wall Street. He is "a quant," expert at putting together complicated financial instruments, but lacking in experience in relationship banking, which generally demands more advanced people skills, investment bankers who have worked with him say.
That Mr. Zakaria is talented, there is no doubt. What matters more to Mr. O'Neal, however, is loyalty, which all in the new guard at Merrill have in spades.
The revolution will be complete in April, when David H. Komansky, the former chief executive and current chairman, departs. Mr. Komansky, with his back-slapping bonhomie, born of his years as a top-producing broker, is already a faded symbol of a global expansion strategy that resulted in the corporate bloat that Mr. O'Neal is working so hard to pare.
Inside Merrill, several employees said, morale is grim. One former employee likened the environment in the investment banking ranks to Afghanistan under the Taliban. Bankers who have left Merrill in recent years express amazement that the banking and securities business -- home to high-profile areas like mergers and acquisitions and equity underwriting -- is being run by Mr. Zakaria. He may be recognized within the firm as a tax expert and may well have made a large number of client calls last year, but he is no relationship banker, they say.
Mr. O'Neal and company -- all of whom declined to be interviewed for this article -- do have supporters who believe that they are the right managers at the right time.
"These guys are workers," said Stephen L. Hammerman, a former Merrill vice chairman who retired from the company last February. "They are rolling their sleeves up and are here to do a job. They know how to deal with clients and they know how to deal with money."
TO impose his view, Mr. O'Neal has brought in a group of people that contrasts sharply with past management teams.
Mr. Gorman, 44, is from Melbourne, Australia. Mr. Zakaria hails from Bombay. The new chief financial officer, Ahmass L. Fakahany, also 44, is from Cairo. Sergio Ermotti, 42, co-head of global equity markets, is from Lugano, Switzerland. Dow Kim, 40, the firm's head of global debt, is a native of Seoul, South Korea. 
Robert C. Doll Jr., a 48-year-old American from Philadelphia, now heads asset management.
Merrill's top managers are among the youngest executives on the Street. None have been with Merrill Lynch for more than 20 years, and none have risen from within the firm's vast private client group -- Merrill's usual source for top managers. For all of them, starting with Mr. O'Neal, the idea of Mother Merrill as a nurturing bureaucratic womb is dead, according to top bankers at the firm. Mr. Zakaria is the prime example of that. His startling ascent through the Merrill management ranks and his instinctive understanding of some of the most esoteric, profitable and controversial financial products that Wall Street has to offer, combined with his uncanny ability to navigate the firm's byzantine political ways, symbolizes the new Merrill manager in many ways.
Throughout his 15-year career at Merrill, Mr. Zakaria has had a hand in devising and selling some of the most lucrative financial products ever to come out of Merrill Lynch. These range from off-balance-sheet tax-shelter partnerships in the late 1980's to a variety of equity-linked instruments in the mid-1990's that allowed Merrill's corporate and individual clients to raise billions in cash while escaping hundreds of millions in taxes.
The son of an upper-class family in Bombay (his brother Fareed is a columnist and the editor of Newsweek International), Mr. Zakaria has always been at the top of his class. At Harvard, he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in applied mathematics and won an $8,000 prize from Morgan Stanley for a paper he wrote on pricing call options.
In 1985, he made the unusual jump directly to the Harvard Business School -- and he breezed through it, winning a Baker scholarship and a Loeb Rhoades finance fellowship.
After earning his M.B.A. in 1987, and after a vigorous bidding war for him among all the big investment banks, he signed on with Merrill Lynch for $150,000 a year, an extremely high salary for a business-school graduate with no full-time banking experience.
Mr. Zakaria skipped through the training program and went directly to work for E. S. Purandar Das, a managing director and fellow Indian who was involved in an effort to create tax-shelter partnerships and sell them to Fortune 500 companies looking to avoid capital gains taxes. Mr. Das, a former chemical engineer with a deep understanding of the United States tax code, had less expertise in creating financial products -- where Mr. Zakaria was useful.
At the time, according to court documents cited in news accounts, several big Merrill Lynch clients, like Schering-Plough, AlliedSignal and Colgate-Palmolive, were eager to lower the taxes they were paying on subsidiary sales. Mr. Zakaria worked on a team with Mr. Das that solved the problem with a plan to set up an offshore fund with a foreign partner for each client. Within the fund, securities would be bought and sold, generating an eventual loss that could be carried forward to offset the company's capital gain.
It was a brilliant piece of financial craftsmanship. One of the first purchasers was Robert P. Luciano, then the chief executive of Schering-Plough and a Merrill board member, a position he still holds. The fees for Merrill ran as high as $15 million a client.
By 1990, Mr. Zakaria was a full-fledged star. As the recession's teeth sank deeply into the firm, Mr. Zakaria, Mr. Das and Mr. Luciano's son, Richard, who had joined their team, flew around the country in a Gulfstream jet, pitching their partnerships to eager corporate clients, the court papers show.
That year, say a number of former Merrill bankers who declined to be identified, that small group pulled in more than $100 million in revenue. The combined cut for Mr. Das and Mr. Zakaria was around 20 percent, these people say. Their rewards were so large that Barry S. Friedberg, the head of investment banking at the time and a member of the compensation committee, made a private deal with his two banking stars to prevent the spread of jealousy. Mr. Friedberg, who is leaving the company, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
Nevertheless, word spread: Mr. Zakaria, then 27 and just three years out of business school, was pulling down nearly $5 million, making him one of the highest-paid bankers not only at Merrill but also on Wall Street. 
In the end, though, the partnerships were too good to be true. By 1995, the Internal Revenue Service had begun to close them down as part of a drive to close tax loopholes. Mr. Das, his career already on the wane, was forced to testify in court on the nature of the partnerships and went on to identify the clients involved. Mr. Das, who later left the company, refused to comment.
Mr. Zakaria, however, moved on and has never been tainted by the fallout from the partnerships. 
By that time, he had developed a close relationship with Mr. Patrick, a senior Merrill Lynch banker with a keen interest in the tax work that Mr. Zakaria was doing.
Mr. Patrick oversees all finance, tax, legal and research functions within Merrill and is a close adviser to Mr. O'Neal. He is seen within the firm as a de facto president and as an architect of its restructuring efforts.
During his 24 years at the firm, Mr. Patrick has twice served as chief financial officer, has headed the equity markets group and has run the insurance business. He is best known for having helped invent zero-coupon bond instruments convertible into equity, called Lyons for liquid-yield option notes, in the mid-1980's.
Arcane yet lucrative, these products opened a new vista for Merrill corporate clients, allowing them to raise cash by issuing debt, pay out less in interest and get a tax break in the process. They were a wild success, generating hundreds of millions in fees for Merrill and spurring copycat products from Merrill's peers.
IMPRESSED with Mr. Zakaria's work on the tax shelters, Mr. Patrick became his mentor and moved him to the firm's corporate finance group. Although the tax shelters were an embarrassment for the firm, the powerful demand for them, together with the success of the Lyons, made it clear to top Merrill executives like Mr. Patrick that the real potential on Wall Street was in the design of instruments that allowed clients to raise money while paying less taxes.
By the mid-1990's, Mr. Zakaria and his team, under the careful eye of Mr. Patrick, were churning out and marketing several similar tax-avoiding financial instruments. Called trust-preferred securities, they were an evolution of the Lyons product, with specific trademarked names like Strypes and Prides.
Each served a different purpose, but the overriding aim was the same: to allow a company or individual to raise cash while paying as little tax as legally permissible.
Mr. Zakaria's team manufactured the products, and Mr. Patrick, an experienced relationship banker, sold them to clients like Sam Zell, the Chicago-based real estate investor, and Eli Broad, the chairman of SunAmerica. While the I.R.S. has raised questions from time to time about these products, it has never prohibited them and they have wide acceptance on the Street.
On the surface, the relationship between Mr. Patrick and Mr. Zakaria seems an odd one. Gruff and cocksure, Mr. Patrick, 57, is of Irish descent, a graduate of Rutgers with an M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh, and a product of gritty Youngstown, Ohio. The urbane Mr. Zakaria comes from a different world.
But many who know them say they have much in common. They are both schooled in numbers and are supremely confident in their own abilities, sharing a propensity to snap at those who fail to grasp their logic. Both are golf enthusiasts and have been known to drop everything to play.
They even invest together. They were partners in their own personal investment fund, called Youngstown Global Partners, after Mr. Patrick's hometown. The fund would take positions in everything from stocks traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange to hot initial public offerings like Einstein Bagels, a company that Merrill bankers took public in 1996, which later filed for bankruptcy protection and is now owned by New World Coffee-Manhattan Bagel.
The Youngstown fund is inactive, but it is indicative of the pair's close relationship. 
In 2000, Mr. Patrick was appointed chief financial officer for the second time by Mr. Komansky. One of his first moves was to recommend that Mr. Zakaria be named head of corporate risk management. That happened in May 2000, with Mr. Zakaria reporting to Mr. Patrick.
About that time, the race to succeed Mr. Komansky as chief executive was heating up. The Merrill board had decreed that by the end of 2001, Mr. Komansky was to anoint a president who would then take over as chief.
It was a bitterly contested race among Mr. O'Neal, who headed the private client business at the time; Mr. Peek, of asset management; and Mr. Davis, of investment banking. Top Merrill executives picked their horses early and hoped for the best, knowing that their jobs could well depend on who eventually won. 
Early on, several Merrill bankers said, Mr. Patrick sided with Mr. O'Neal. Mr. Patrick knew Mr. O'Neal when he was a rising star in Merrill's high-yield bond department in the early 1990's, and had been impressed with his analytical mind as well as his client skills. What's more, Mr. Patrick had a contentious relationship with Mr. Peek, who was seen as a favorite of Mr. Komansky's. 
Mr. Patrick and Mr. Komansky had their differences, too. 
In 1993, the two were contenders for the presidency of Merrill, and when Mr. Komansky won, Mr. Patrick endured seven years of exile in Chicago, running the firm's special advisory group.
Mr. Patrick has always had a green-eyeshade mentality when looking to the firm's future. He looked askance at Mr. Komansky's charge into new markets like Canada, Australia and Japan, insiders say. In fact, like many other Merrill executives, he was an aggressive seller of the company's stock through much of 2000 and 2001, according to securities filings.
In July 2001, the Merrill board, concerned about the firm's shrinking profits, forced Mr. Komansky's hand, and Mr. O'Neal became president and the chief executive heir apparent. 
Driving the decision was Mr. Luciano, who in his position as chairman of the board's management committee led the search for a new chief. He remembered Mr. Patrick and Mr. Zakaria well from their work 10 years earlier on the tax shelters for Schering-Plough and came to know Mr. O'Neal through them. The four also shared a passion for golf and spent hours together at Mr. Luciano's various golf clubs. 
Several senior Merrill Lynch bankers now say Mr. Luciano was convinced that Mr. O'Neal -- with Mr. Patrick and Mr. Zakaria being crucial members of his team -- would have the colder, more objective approach needed to cut the fat from the firm. 
Behind the scenes, William A. Schreyer, Merrill's chief executive during the 1980's, also played a significant role, these people say. He, too, knew Mr. Zakaria and Mr. Patrick from their tax-shelter work and cast his influential vote in favor of the O'Neal team.
On Oct. 5, 2001, Mr. O'Neal promoted Mr. Zakaria to his current post at global markets and investment banking. Later, in November, he named Mr. Patrick executive vice chairman.
For the moment, analysts are cheering Mr. O'Neal and his number crunchers. Profit margins in important areas like investment banking and the brokerage business are rising in the wake of the layoffs. The company's stock fell 27 percent in 2002, in line with other brokerage stocks, and closed on Friday at $39.97, 32 percent off its 52-week high.
OTHER large Wall Street firms are increasing layoffs, a sign that they, too, are growing more concerned about the depths of the market's slide.
"Although you worry that they may have cut too far, the fact that Merrill's competitors are throwing in the towel is a confirmation that O'Neal was right," said Guy Moszkowski, a brokerage analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "And while they have downsized at just about every level, they have kept their rainmakers."
Still, many wonder how a bear-market Merrill will fare when equity markets rebound. Over the last year, many top deal makers have left the firm, and Merrill has dropped to sixth place, from third, in worldwide merger advisory work. If Mr. O'Neal and his team are wrong about the length of the market's collapse, Merrill may well suffer -- and require another redesign.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Waiting for the President to Pass the Tax-Cut Gravy

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH is expected to deliver a big tax-cut package to the nation on Tuesday, a New Year's present that he hopes will jump-start the economy. It is not yet clear what the package will include, but, thanks to a full-force lobbying effort, corporate America is sure to benefit.
 In the president's last tax cut, corporations were forced to accept much less than they had wanted so that individuals could get relief. Having agreed to sit out one gravy train, they now feel owed. 
 Chances are, the president will advocate faster depreciation on capital equipment purchases, an idea that some think will juice the long-dead market for technological gear.
But it is hard to see how significant demand for goods will result if companies can write off bigger and bigger amounts more quickly on equipment purchases. There remains a glut of capital equipment, and the capacity utilization rate, representing how much of the nation's potential output is being used, recently stood around 75 percent.
There's only one way that a change in depreciation might increase investment in equipment now -- if the new rules made the write-offs immense and immediate. In other words, if the rules make buying gear like buying a tax shelter. 
The real mystery is why corporations should get any new tax breaks at all. After all, companies are paying less and less in taxes each year, making the 35 percent corporate tax rate a fiction. Effective corporate tax rates are, at many highly profitable companies, far below what individuals pay. 
Consider General Electric. Its effective tax rate has tumbled to 20.5 percent in the third quarter of 2002, from 31.2 percent in 1999. The decline at the company's financial services unit, GE Capital, has been even sharper. Its effective tax rate, 27.1 percent in 1999, fell to 14 percent in the third quarter of 2002. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb is another example. In 2001, its effective tax rate on continuing operations fell to 15.4 percent from 25.2 percent in 2000. And Procter & Gamble's effective tax rate dropped to 31.8 percent in 2001 from 36.7 percent in 2000.
Because most companies use their annual reports to provide details on their tax rates, investors will have to wait a few months to see if the trend of the incredibly shrinking corporate tax rate continues.
But there are two good reasons to believe it will, according to Lee Sheppard, contributing editor for the journal Tax Notes. First, companies face a saturated domestic market and are looking overseas for more profits, and companies doing business overseas have greater opportunities to manipulate their tax rates. 
In addition, Ms. Sheppard said that more American companies were morphing into businesses that look like banks but that are not regulated like banks. (Think Ford, General Motors, even computer makers.) And these businesses are better able than others to take advantage of the tax code because they have more control over the timing, location and nature of their income. 
"Being a financial intermediary is a lot like being a tax shelter because you have a lot of control over your income," Ms. Sheppard said. "And more big companies are evolving into financial intermediaries. You've got a whole economy moving to a form that we don't know how to tax. In the post-industrial society, we have to get serious about how to tax these things."
This probably won't be the year for that.

HEADLINE: Rescaling the Guggenheim 

 BODY:
The Guggenheim Museum has announced that it is shelving its plans to build an enormous new museum, designed by Frank Gehry, on the East River in Lower Manhattan. In the present fund-raising climate, it would have been nearly impossible for the Guggenheim's director, Thomas Krens, to raise the amount of money needed for such a project, nearly $1 billion. Besides, the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site is likely to include amenities like museums or concert halls that will shift the cultural center of gravity to the western side of Lower Manhattan, away from the area where the Guggenheim had planned to build. 
 By any measure except pride, abandoning the East River Guggenheim plan is simply the right thing to do. But it comes at a time when pride is very much on the Guggenheim's mind. For a time, in the late 1990's, the Guggenheim looked like the brand to beat in the museum world. And, in a sense, it behaved more like a corporation expanding a brand and its market share than a museum. Suddenly it seemed there were Guggenheims everywhere -- in Bilbao, Berlin, Venice, SoHo and Las Vegas, not to mention the landmark home museum on upper Fifth Avenue. There were lofty plans to brand cyberspace with the Guggenheim name as well, in affiliation with the Hermitage. There seemed to be Guggenheim plans everywhere. 
 But in the past few months, many of these projects have shipwrecked. The Internet plans basically evaporated. The SoHo museum closed. The Las Vegas Guggenheim, in a building designed by Rem Koolhaas, will close today, though the management says this is only temporary -- until a sponsor can be found for the next exhibition. Perhaps most dramatic of all, the chairman of the Guggenheim's board of trustees, Peter Lewis, recently made a $12 million gift conditional on a revamped financial plan. In other words, he forced Mr. Krens to face reality.
Mr. Krens's supporters will argue that he has faced reality all along, riding a wave of stunning national prosperity to a peak of cultural ambition. But closer attention to the details of the Guggenheim's expansion, including its operations in Bilbao, where a Gehry-designed building brought it enormous cultural credit, suggest that the Guggenheim was sometimes running, like Alice, as fast as it could to stay in one place. That seems especially true now that the museum has cut back sharply on its budget and curatorial staff. Any universe that could contain all the planned Guggenheims, not to mention the actual ones, would be a wildly inflationary universe. We lived in such a place for a while, but no more.
All of this may bode well for the Guggenheim and its role in New York's cultural world. These retrenchments will surely strengthen the museum's financial position and make it possible to concentrate on the task of exhibiting art, rather than multiplying like so many Benettons. But before it can reclaim what it has lost in the way of reputation, it will have to find a way to rebuild a decimated curatorial staff and an endowment that has been eaten away by ambition. It will be very tempting to think of the eventual cultural proposals for the World Trade Center site as a new portal for Guggenheim expansion. But that temptation should be resisted, if only for the Guggenheim's own good.

HEADLINE: Save the Dividend Tax 

BYLINE:  By Martin Mayer; Martin Mayer, author of the "The Bankers" and "The Fed," is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y. 

 BODY:
President Bush's new economic plan, scheduled to be unveiled this week, will include a tax break for people who receive dividends from stocks. The president is right to focus on the dividend tax -- but he should give the tax break to the corporations that pay the dividends, especially if he wants to encourage a change in corporate behavior.
 The problem is that today's tax code gets in the way of prudent corporate financial management. Corporations pay interest on their debts out of their profits before taxes, while dividends must be paid from profits after taxes. Thus the tax code gives companies an incentive to finance their activities by borrowing money rather than by selling stock, which would spread the risks and rewards of the enterprise among the community of stockholders. 
 Some of the worst excesses of the recent boom were in effect sponsored by this element in the tax code. Because corporations tend to borrow instead of issuing stock (and sometimes use the cash from borrowing to buy back their own stock), our economy is more highly leveraged, and more fragile, than it would otherwise be. Even very profitable companies that don't have to borrow to buy back their stock are encouraged by the current tax code to use their profits to buy other companies.
When a company buys its own stock on the market, it reduces the supply available to investors, thereby increasing the likelihood that its share price will rise. The process of increasing debt and decreasing equity appears to raise earnings per share (fewer shares, after all), apparently justifying the higher stock prices. Thus corporate managers who consider their great mission to be "enhancing shareholder value" can perform that mission -- albeit briefly -- without improving the real performance of the company. Meanwhile, the corporation accumulates stock for rewarding executives with lucrative options packages.
Cutting the individual income tax on dividends would do little to discourage such corporate mischief. Moreover, it would be unfair and appallingly complicated for the institutions that serve as investment vehicles for ordinary Americans.
Most Americans who invest in the stock market don't currently pay taxes on dividend income. Their savings are in retirement plans like 401(k)'s, and dividends paid to these funds are not taxed. A law that made dividends tax-free would do nothing to put money in the pockets of people with all their stock in retirement plans.
Under the proposals reported to be in preparation, people who have saved money in certificates of deposit, savings accounts and government bonds would still get Form 1099's at the beginning of the year, notifying them that the I.R.S. had been told about their interest income and that they are expected to pay taxes on it. One does not envy the Republican Congressional candidate who has to explain to middle-class voters that under the Bush tax plan they will still have to pay taxes on the interest earned in their savings accounts -- but voters who own stock will no longer need to pay taxes on dividends.
Of course, exempting dividend payments from corporate income would probably reduce federal revenues -- but the loss may not be as great as many fear. Corporations may react to the change in the tax code by paying more dividends, and some significant fraction of those payments would go to accounts that are not tax-deferred, resulting in greater personal taxable income.
The impulse to revise the dividend tax is a good one. Today's tax code distorts corporate accounting and warps corporate behavior. The president's plan, however, would do little to remedy the damage wrought by an ill-conceived tax code -- and would make it even more unfair.

HEADLINE: A War for Oil? 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Our family spent winter vacation in Colorado, and one day I saw the most unusual site: two women marching around the Aspen Mountain ski lift, waving signs protesting against war in Iraq. One sign said: "Just War or Just Oil?" As I watched this two-woman demonstration, I couldn't help notice the auto traffic whizzing by them: one gas-guzzling S.U.V. or Jeep after another, with even a Humvee or two tossed in for good measure. The whole scene made me wonder whether those two women weren't -- indeed -- asking the right question: Is the war that the Bush team is preparing to launch in Iraq really a war for oil?
 My short answer is yes. Any war we launch in Iraq will certainly be -- in part -- about oil. To deny that is laughable. But whether it is seen to be only about oil will depend on how we behave before an invasion and what we try to build once we're there. 
 I say this possible Iraq war is partly about oil because it is impossible to explain the Bush team's behavior otherwise. Why are they going after Saddam Hussein with the 82nd Airborne and North Korea with diplomatic kid gloves -- when North Korea already has nuclear weapons, the missiles to deliver them, a record of selling dangerous weapons to anyone with cash, 100,000 U.S. troops in its missile range and a leader who is even more cruel to his own people than Saddam?
One reason, of course, is that it is easier to go after Saddam. But the other reason is oil -- even if the president doesn't want to admit it. (Mr. Bush's recent attempt to hype the Iraqi threat by saying that an Iraqi attack on America -- which is most unlikely -- "would cripple our economy" was embarrassing. It made the president look as if he was groping for an excuse to go to war, absent a smoking gun.)
Let's cut the nonsense. The primary reason the Bush team is more focused on Saddam is because if he were to acquire weapons of mass destruction, it might give him the leverage he has long sought -- not to attack us, but to extend his influence over the world's largest source of oil, the Persian Gulf.
But wait a minute. There is nothing illegitimate or immoral about the U.S. being concerned that an evil, megalomaniacal dictator might acquire excessive influence over the natural resource that powers the world's industrial base.
"Would those women protesting in Aspen prefer that Saddam Hussein control the oil instead -- is that morally better?" asks Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns Hopkins foreign policy expert and author of "The Ideas That Conquered the World." "Up to now, Saddam has used his oil wealth not to benefit his people, but to wage war against all his neighbors, build lavish palaces and acquire weapons of mass destruction."
This is a good point, but the Bush team would have a stronger case for fighting a war partly for oil if it made clear by its behavior that it was acting for the benefit of the planet, not simply to fuel American excesses.
I have no problem with a war for oil -- if we accompany it with a real program for energy conservation. But when we tell the world that we couldn't care less about climate change, that we feel entitled to drive whatever big cars we feel like, that we feel entitled to consume however much oil we like, the message we send is that a war for oil in the gulf is not a war to protect the world's right to economic survival -- but our right to indulge. Now that will be seen as immoral.
And should we end up occupying Iraq, and the first thing we do is hand out drilling concessions to U.S. oil companies alone, that perception would only be intensified.
And that leads to my second point. If we occupy Iraq and simply install a more pro-U.S. autocrat to run the Iraqi gas station (as we have in other Arab oil states), then this war partly for oil would also be immoral.
If, on the other hand, the Bush team, and the American people, prove willing to stay in Iraq and pay the full price, in money and manpower, needed to help Iraqis build a more progressive, democratizing Arab state -- one that would use its oil income for the benefit of all its people and serve as a model for its neighbors -- then a war partly over oil would be quite legitimate. It would be a critical step toward building a better Middle East.
So, I have no problem with a war for oil -- provided that it is to fuel the first progressive Arab regime, and not just our S.U.V.'s, and provided we behave in a way that makes clear to the world we are protecting everyone's access to oil at reasonable prices -- not simply our right to binge on it.

HEADLINE: New York's Tomorrow: 12 Visions 

BYLINE:  This article was compiled by Leslie Berger. 

 BODY:
AS NEW YORK confronts momentous questions -- about the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, its budget woes, the danger of terrorism, the prospect of the Olympics in 2012 -- there is no shortage of predictions on where the city is headed in the next few decades.
 To peer into the future, the City section has consulted a dozen historians, sociologists, political scientists and urban planners who make such forecasting their business. Such prognosticators are rarely household names, but the changes they envision are striking. They speak of developments ranging from the rise of Red Hook, Brooklyn, and the birth of a new sleaze district to the emergence of the Hispanic bagel. 
 One expects an Asian-Latino mayor; another predicts a rise in individual vehicles, like motorized scooters. Here's the face of the future New York, as they see it.

The Hispanic Bagel

JUAN FLORES
Professor of sociology and Latino studies, Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center; author of "From Bomba to Hip-Hip: Puerto Rican Culture and Latino Identity"
 We're approaching a time when a Latino will have just as much of a chance to become mayor as someone of any other nationality. If there's a Latino mayor, it will probably be a younger person, and probably a Colombian or Dominican, not a Puerto Rican. Puerto Ricans are still the largest group here, but Dominicans are catching up fast and by 2015 could be the largest proportion of Latinos.
 We already have lots of overlap and fusion in food, like the old Chinese-Cuban restaurants with their divided menus. There's a place in my neighborhood in Brooklyn, Park Slope, called Convivium that's Portuguese and Italian, and another, called Tamari, that features Japanese tapas. I could envision an Indian restaurant that also serves Latin American food in Jackson Heights or Elmhurst, Queens, where many Latin Americans and Indians share the same neighborhoods.
 We could see a Hispanic bagel, something between a tortilla and a regular bagel. But instead of cutting it in half and putting cream cheese and lox on it, it could be used to scoop up pico de gallo or mofongo.

Some Traveling Music

RAYMOND W. GASTIL
Director of the Van Alen Institute: Projects in Public Architecture; author of "Beyond the Edge: New York's New Waterfront"
 The city will become known for its healthy, active lifestyle, not just the night club-drug addict-rock and roll-art opening culture. People will move around the city in different ways, in individual, motorized ways, maybe using Segways, the motorized scooter. 
 We'll need ways for people to move around the city that are faster than walking. We'll have some amazing safety suits that we haven't even imagined yet, something head to toe, beyond bike helmets or elbow and knee pads. We'll gear up when we leave our apartments. 

Lattes, Dockside

SHARON ZUKIN
Broeklundian Professor of Sociology, Brooklyn College; co-editor of "After the World Trade Center: Rethinking New York City"
 Because of Brooklyn's growing visibility as a cultural center and high rents in Manhattan, the area around the Brooklyn Academy of Music will become even more of an alternative cultural center. The BAM area will be bigger, and all along the Brooklyn waterfront there will be colorful places to shop and eat. I see Dumbo becoming an alternative to Madison Avenue, the way BAM is to Lincoln Center.
 At least in the short term, every neighborhood will be formed around a hub of Starbucks, Banana Republic and Barnes & Noble. Multistory stores like Bergdorf's and Macy's will shrink to one story because no one wants to go up in an elevator to shop anymore. People have gotten used to the suburbanization of city shopping. That means one-story shops with big windows facing the street. You go in, you see what you want, and you leave.

Hello, Red Hook

MITCHELL L. MOSS
Henry Hart Rice Professor of Urban Policy and Planning, New York University's Wagner School, and director of the Taub Urban Research Center
 As Manhattan becomes increasingly attractive as a place to live, we'll see more reverse commuting, something that already exists in San Francisco. And because New York has such a strong sense of place, the city and the suburbs will forge stronger ties and will be more intertwined, not less, and increasingly share places of work and play.
 All along the East River, from Greenpoint to Red Hook, we'll see the revival of the waterfront as a place to live. This development will lead to greater use of ferries and will connect people to the water in a new way. 
 Red Hook, Brooklyn, will be the most interesting up-and-coming neighborhood. It has the best sun and light in all New York. People are buying old buildings and fixing them up. If the neighborhood can be linked to Manhattan by ferry, Red Hook could be the Sausalito of New York. 

The Flower Lane

MICHAEL SORKIN
Director of the Graduate Urban Design Program at CUNY; co-editor of "After the World Trade Center: Rethinking New York City"
One thing I hope we can look forward to is a system of "greenfill" that would reclaim at least one lane of every street in New York from the automobile. This would open up room for tree planting, gardening, public toilets, day care centers, playgrounds, bike lanes, and offer a way of reforming our insane waste disposal system -- heaping mountains of garbage bags on our sidewalks. Streets are far and away the city's main public space, and they should support more people and plants and a lot less roaring metal. 

Mom-and-Pop Power

THOMAS BENDER
Professor of history at New York University; author of "The Unfinished City: New York and the Metropolitan Idea"
 The future of New York is in the boroughs. Those are the centers of immigration. That's where you have multicultural entrepreneurial communities being formed and re-formed. They'll transform themselves and ultimately transform Manhattan -- its economy and culture. The proportion of immigrants in the city today roughly matches that at the turn of the century. Unless the city tries to freeze history, we can expect a repetition of the cycle of immigrant transformation that the city experienced between 1890 and 1950. The announcement that Deutsche Bank will stay downtown is nice. But I'm more interested in new, locally generated businesses, like the old Emigrant Savings Bank, now a part of an international banking corporation. 
 We'll see many instances of small beginnings -- often working class and immigrant -- becoming big. We'll see new social movements, led by a new generation of leaders. Typically, they'll be of immigrant backgrounds, like Roger Toussaint, a Trinidadian of talent and drive, who benefited from the city's inexpensive system of higher education and is now a figure in the city, helping to shape its future.

Olympic Impetus

RON SHIFFMAN
Director, Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development
 We have a real shot at being the host for the Olympics in 2012 if we make the city function better and if we leave a legacy for the future, as they did in Barcelona. The Olympics would be the impetus to develop a waterborne transportation system and a network of public spaces that will help bring about greater social cohesion. I'm talking about sports facilities, parks, swimming pools, and a stadium not on the West Side but near Shea Stadium, a more rational place. 
 The No. 7 line would be extended to the far West Side of Manhattan to serve new offices, existing manufacturers and residential neighborhoods. These would be mixed-use buildings, because the reality is that many people will work in their neighborhood, often at the local coffee shop, and go out at night, also to someplace in their neighborhood. Telecommuting will create social places like cafes where people can socialize and interact with other people. 
 I see more places like Ozzie's, the locally owned coffee shops in Park Slope, Brooklyn, rather than Starbucks. People are shying away from chains. They want something more reflective of New York and its indigenous communities.

Taxpayers' Revolt

RICHARD FLANAGAN
Professor of political science and a specialist in New York government, College of Staten Island
 One national trend I see hitting New York in the next decade is the direct democracy movement that we see in other states, like California. New York, both city and state, is the last stronghold of strong interest groups, and they're melting.
 We've seen this trend with term limits for the City Council, and I think that pressure will spread to Albany. Things will look more like California, where the most important decisions will be put before voters on a ballot referendum. I could see a ballot measure for major capital investment in new housing. There could also be a groundswell of Californian-like opposition to the Olympics on the grounds that they will still require significant capital outlay.

Asian-Latino Melange

JOHN KUO WEI TCHEN
Associate professor of history and director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute at New York University; author of "New York Before Chinatown"
 The Asian and Latino populations will continue to increase dramatically and together will become a majority of the city. In 10 years, we'll have an Asian-Latino mayor. 
 Among the chic? Soon, with foreign policy prerogatives and global cooling/warming, Central Asian cuisine and fashion will become popular. Kebobs will be like tacos. Finer Central Asian "court cuisines" will become popular in Manhattan, and the boroughs outside Manhattan will offer more authentic, down-home cuisines of these populations.
 The mixing of cultures, creolization, will accelerate. There will be more interracial marriage, especially outside Manhattan. New immigrants will move to neighborhoods like Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where I live. Besides Latinos, there are also many Chinese, Vietnamese and Arabs, and on my block the older Italians and Scandinavians and Irish, who stayed. Sunset Park is the future. 

The New Caretakers

J. PHILLIP THOMPSON
Associate professor of urban studies and planning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; author of the forthcoming "Double Trouble," on black politics in New York
 The new elderly population, which will be largely white, will depend heavily on young minorities to take care of them and to pay for their care through new forms of taxes. These younger minority workers will want to be better paid. And because they'll be American citizens, they'll be able to vote and be much more politically influential. Home health aides and other domestic help will absolutely be unionized. I imagine that now about 40 percent of those workers are immigrants and can't vote. In the future, nearly all of them will be able to vote, which will have a dramatic impact on politics.
 We'll also see campuses that combine high school, community college and graduate schools, all in the same place. And we'll see these integrated campuses become neighborhood centers, just as public markets and village square were neighborhood meetings places in the 19th century. As a result, we'll see neighborhoods differentiated less by race or class than by profession and intellectual interest. 

University Smorgasbords

NAN ROTHSCHILD
Anthropology professor, Barnard College; author of the forthcoming "Colonial Encounters in Native North America"
 We have three big universities here -- Columbia, N.Y.U. and CUNY -- and because faculty are becoming more specialized, graduate students especially are beginning to circulate among them. A Columbia student can take a course at N.Y.U. or CUNY. So advanced students could do this kind of boutique thing, shopping for courses among schools that fit their particular interest. 

Times Square II

ANN DOUGLAS
Parr Professor of Comparative Literature, Columbia University; author of "Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920's"
 A new Times Square will develop. There will once again be a part of the city where you have a creative low life. Great world cities will always produce vice because they have every kind of human being in them. The vicious and degraded are not only a significant portion of the population but we all have a little bit of that in us. And a city is a universe, not just a place. 
 No place has symbolized that more dramatically than New York, with its skyscrapers going right up into the heavens and its underground culture, where many of our greatest cultural movements began. Bebop is an example. The Beats not only cut their teeth in Times Square, they lived in decaying parts of the Upper West Side. It's bohemia; it's where artists go.
 Despite the rise of the Internet, E-books never took off, and so we'll still have agents and publishing parties. I'm reminded of a poem by Louise Bogan in which she asks, "Why go to a party?" And the answer is that there she finds "malice, wisdom's guide." To me, that's the essence of publishing and publishing parties. You go to see who's there, who's not, what kind of party your agent or editor was willing to throw for you. It's our world of Balzac or Jane Austen. 
 Some things we need to do face to face. There are kinds of interaction you can't have with a computer screen. We're all in bodies that live and thicken and die. That gives us an attachment to perishable things. And New York is home to some of the most wonderful perishable things.

HEADLINE: It's His Party 

BYLINE:  By David Frum; David Frum, a presidential speechwriter from 2001 to 2002, is author of the forthcoming "The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When George W. Bush took the oath of office two years ago, many people doubted that he would ever be able to govern effectively. During the campaign, an unprophetic pundit observed on TV, "One thing George Bush is going to have trouble asserting when he gets to office is that he's got a mandate for government." 
 That unprophetic pundit was me. In the 24 months since Inauguration Day, Mr. Bush has made his own mandate. Today, Mr. Bush is more than a strong president: he dominates his own party in a way that few modern presidents ever have. 
 Unlike Lyndon B. Johnson (who was never trusted by Democratic liberals) or Dwight D. Eisenhower (who was only grudgingly tolerated by Republican conservatives), Mr. Bush has been accepted by all important Republican factions without so much as a squeak of public dissent. And while even Franklin D. Roosevelt was humiliated when he tried to get rid of some disobedient Democratic senators in the 1938 primaries, Mr. Bush pretty much fired the Senate majority leader without suffering so much as a bruise or a scratch himself. 
This power enables Mr. Bush to do much more than just lead his party. It has enabled him to change it. 
For those of us who believed in the more radical conservatism espoused by Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, Mr. Bush's softer Republicanism can often be difficult to adjust to. "Compassionate conservatism" sounded less like a philosophy than a marketing slogan: "The same ideological taste you love -- now with less controversy." But it was also true that with every passing election, Reagan-Gingrich conservatism seemed to be appealing less and less to the American people. The old conservative rhetoric was getting stale. Voters wanted something new. And at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia in 2000, something new was exactly what Mr. Bush promised to provide.
Halfway through his term, we can see what this new kind of Republicanism has turned out to be.
George Bush's party is less economically libertarian than the Republican Party of the 1980's and 1990's. Mr. Bush's tax cut, for example, was only one-third as large as Ronald Reagan's, relative to the size of the United States economy. And while Mr. Reagan's cut took effect in only three years, Mr. Bush's won't be complete for 10. 
Similarly, Mr. Reagan's tax cut allowed all Americans to keep more of what they earned. By contrast, Mr. Bush's tax cut metes out its rewards according to family status rather than economic activity. For most middle-class Americans, the $500 increase in the per-child tax credit will be far more lucrative than the comparatively modest reduction in their income-tax rates.
There is no more talk of radical tax simplification and tax reform -- instead, the tax code continues to bulk up with benefits meant to encourage government-preferred activities like installing solar heating or attending community college. And there is not much talk of a deregulation agenda. After Enron, deregulation went out of style. 
Ronald Reagan fought an unending, and ultimately unsuccessful, struggle against the growth of entitlements. Mr. Bush is presiding over the expansion of Medicaid into something that is coming to look more and more like a universal health insurance program. He uncomplainingly signed the biggest farm bill in history, jettisoned school vouchers to win his education bill and let his Social Security reform commission quietly expire.
The Bush administration remains largely a pro-growth, pro-free-enterprise administration. But just as Bill Clinton declared an end to the era of big government, so George W. Bush has put an end to the era of antigovernment. In the fight against government growth, he makes no promises to do more than hold the line.
If Mr. Bush has been much more cautious than Mr. Reagan on the economy, however, he has been far bolder on social issues. 
In the months from his first State of the Union address until Sept. 11, Mr. Bush gave only one televised speech to the nation. It was his speech to explain his decision to ban most stem-cell research. 
Stem-cell research contemplates the cloning -- and destruction -- of human embryos. For religious conservatives, it represents a horrifying industrialization of abortion. At the same time, stem-cell research offers correspondingly large benefits: the possibility of treatments for horrific diseases, replacements for damaged human organs, conceivably even the halting of the aging process. 
Many Republicans offer the pro-life movement rhetorical tributes. Mr. Bush has brought the concerns of religious conservatives in from the periphery of American politics to its center. His stem-cell policy is the biggest political victory the pro-life movement has had in years. More significantly, he delivered that victory without alienating or frightening those Americans who are not pro-life. 
Mr. Bush has found a new language on social issues, one that stresses the commonalities between the religious and the secular. He has kept his distance from anything that might seem censorious, avoiding mention, for example, of the debate over civil unions for gay couples and carefully inserting the words "and of none" after his references to "good people of all faiths."
In the 19th century, the Republican Party was defined by region. It was the North against the South. In the 20th century, it became a party defined by class -- the white-collar middle class as opposed to the poor and the metropolitan rich. Under George W. Bush, the party in the 21st century is on its way to becoming a party defined by faith. In 2000, Mr. Bush beat Vice President Al Gore among people who attend church at least once a week by a margin of 57 percent to 40 percent. The margin was 25 percent larger than his margin of victory among those who earn more than $100,000 a year. 
 Yet of all the ways that Mr. Bush is changing his party, none is as profound or as surprising as the change he has made in its foreign policy. Republicans returned to office in 2000 fed up with the random do-goodery of the Clinton years. As a candidate, Mr. Bush promised a "humble" foreign policy. Today, a quarter of a million American and allied troops are unhumbly poised to topple the Iraqi regime.
Critics of the president's Iraq policy warn that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein could destabilize the entire Arab world, including allies like Saudi Arabia. That, presumably, is an outcome Mr. Bush would wish to avoid. But on the evening of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Bush pledged to defeat not just the terrorist organizations that had attacked the United States, but also the states that sponsor and shelter terrorists. That commitment has drawn him toward conflict with many of those same Arab allies. 
It sometimes seemed to me, as I watched the debate between the administration's hawks and doves from the inside, that I was witnessing a reprise of the great strategic debates of the Civil War. Back then, official Washington was divided between the realists, who wanted to fight the smallest possible war in order (as they said) to save the Union as it was, and the idealists, who sought the biggest possible victory, even if it meant smashing the old order in the South forever. Today's realists, like their 19th-century counterparts, are more frightened of change than they are of defeat. 
At every step, President Bush has opted for the course that offers the hope of a bigger victory -- even at the price of a wider war. Surprisingly, the Republican Party has followed. And so the president who once talked of scaling back America's overseas commitments now finds himself crusading for democracy not only in Iraq, but also for the entire Arab world.
Republicans usually like to see themselves as steely realists. Foreign-policy realism is the tradition from which President Bush and his top foreign-policy advisers have come. But under the pressure of war, Mr. Bush has found what the great American presidents have believed: that American principles are as "real" as ships and armies and wealth. It's not just Mr. Bush's party that is changing. It is Mr. Bush himself.

HEADLINE: In New G.O.P. Era, DeLay Drives Agenda for Congress 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 

 BODY:
Republicans returning on Tuesday to take over Congress have been bestowed with a precious political opportunity -- the second chance.
 They bring with them not only historic gains in midterm elections but also the hope of proving to voters the benefits of one-party control, power they lost after just a few months in 2001. They say they are convinced they can leave behind the Trent Lott controversy over race and will instead be able to focus on a broad legislative agenda. 
 In short, they are intent on solidifying their hold on a vastly changed Washington as the dominating Republican Party moves toward the 2004 presidential election.
But one man will stand out among Congressional Republicans as they make their triumphant entrance on Tuesday: Tom DeLay of Texas, the incoming House majority leader, a fierce conservative who as the whip has done as much as anyone to engineer the new Republican hegemony by virtue of his campaign and legislative operations. 
Mr. DeLay is already considered a chief architect of Republican policy in Congress, and surrounded by his hand-picked lieutenants, he will become one of the most prominent public faces of the new Republican-controlled Congress. He is expected to maintain a firm grip on the party's agenda.
"He understood from Day 1 what it took to be a majority and keep it," said former Representative Tillie Fowler of Florida.
Even so, Mr. DeLay hopes this time around to soften his tough-as-nails reputation and redefine his nickname, the Hammer.
"The hammer," he said, "is the most important tool a builder has."
Mr. DeLay, described by opponents and allies alike as a ruthless tactician, has been invaluable in restoring to Republicans the full control of the lawmaking machinery that was abruptly snatched away in mid-2001 with the party switch of Senator James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont. That shift in the balance of Senate power led to one legislative impasse after another. This time, Republicans plan to move forward quickly, before the next presidential election intrudes.
They are readying an agenda of tax cuts, Medicare changes, increased energy production, legal liability limits and welfare revisions that they hope will maintain their ascendancy.
"We have got the skids greased to really get some good public policy enacted," said Representative Sue W. Kelly, Republican of New York.
Mr. DeLay will not be the only lawmaker moving into an enhanced position of authority under Representative J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois and speaker of the House. In fact, of the eight top party leaders in the House and Senate, six will be new in their jobs, with one, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, elevated unexpectedly by virtue of the furor that toppled Mr. Lott from his majority leader's position.
Democrats, stung by the election losses, have been re-energized by the controversy over racially tinged remarks Mr. Lott made at Strom Thurmond's birthday party. Now Democrats intend to try to draw sharper distinctions between themselves and their Republican counterparts and do their best to derail legislation they do not like.
"We can't do the rope-a-dope," said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader, who used the boxing analogy to suggest that Democrats were not going to allow Republicans to back them into a corner and then try to dodge conservative proposals on the environment, taxes and health care.
Mr. DeLay, who has demonstrated formidable power in the past, will not easily be denied. While much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on the Senate and Dr. Frist, Mr. DeLay, given his wide circle of influence among lawmakers and lobbyists, looms large.
Mr. DeLay, a former exterminator who was driven into politics by his anger at environmental restrictions on pest control, has built his House constituency one lawmaker at a time, with intervention on matters as crucial as a threat to their re-election and as mundane as providing pizza and ribs during a late-night vote.
His attention to such detail and a reputation for keeping his word have won him fierce loyalty in the Republican caucus, even among more moderate members who might not share his ideological views. Members can recount how Mr. DeLay bailed them out on what might have seemed a minor issue, how he agreed to let them vote against the party on another, how he followed through on a pledge.
"You have got to know how far you can ask members to go on any given day on any given issue," said Bill Paxon, a former New York congressman who is a close friend of Mr. DeLay's. "But while the members know that he will push them hard, he will never push them too hard."
Elected whip in 1994, Mr. DeLay can be seen working the floor on close votes, smilingly persuading some lawmakers to go with the party, cajoling others and glowering when he thinks it might work. He very rarely loses.
Mr. Lott, the former House Republican whip who brought Mr. DeLay into the fold as one of his assistants, called Mr. DeLay the "best whip they ever had in the House, and that is a lot for me to say."
Democrats find Mr. DeLay effective as well but say one of his signatures has been to block sound legislation, like a measure on patients' rights, by refusing to deal.
"He takes no prisoners and he has been the point man for the very hard-line, noncompromising, extreme wing of the party," said Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the new No. 2 House Democrat.
Many Democrats revile Mr. DeLay for his push for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. Mr. DeLay, a born-again Christian who abhorred Mr. Clinton, insisted on a House vote on articles of impeachment even when it seemed Republican enthusiasm had waned.
"Everyone thought impeachment was dead," said Representative Peter T. King of New York, who was one of the most outspoken Republicans against impeachment. But Mr. King said Mr. DeLay employed talk radio and other avenues to rally conservative Republicans and ultimately force a floor vote.
"He really, in just a matter of weeks, mobilized a base that almost brought down the president of the United States," Mr. King said.
Democrats also resent what they view as Mr. DeLay's heavy-handed efforts to pressure lobbying firms and trade associations to show loyalty to Republicans by cutting off contributions to Democrats or hiring Republicans. Mr. DeLay was once upbraided by the House ethics committee for pushing too hard. Democrats continue to say Mr. DeLay is too close to lobbyists.
Mr. DeLay's allies say his reputation as a tough guy is exaggerated. "He is the most overrated boogeyman in Washington, D.C.," Representative Kelly said. Mr. DeLay himself said he did not fully fathom his public image.
"It is just not me," he said. "I'm very passionate about what I believe in, and I am very aggressive about accomplishing that. Some people find that mean-spirited, but I don't find myself to be mean-spirited."
While Mr. DeLay's role as the internal vote counter kept him somewhat behind the scenes, his new position will force him more into the public eye. 
His allies and others believe he can make the adjustment, since the job in some ways plays to what many see as his strong point. 
"One of Tom's greatest strengths is that he is so strategic," said Susan Hirschmann, his former chief of staff, who is now a lobbyist. "He is always looking at the next election, figuring out what Republicans have to do to grow the majority, and then he spends the rest of the time implementing that strategy."
House Republicans also say Mr. DeLay has proven willing to get behind legislation he opposes if Mr. Hastert and others believe it is the politically shrewd move to make. They point to Mr. Bush's education measure, which Mr. DeLay helped pass despite his own problems with it.
Other Republicans say that Mr. Hastert wields considerable power of his own within the caucus and that Mr. DeLay is hardly unchecked. "Any time it has really come down to it, I have thought that Denny was definitely the top guy," Mr. King said.
Many Republicans say the House leadership team is now extremely tight-knit, a relationship strengthened in some ways by the departure of Dick Armey, the outgoing majority leader, who did not always enjoy a smooth relationship with Mr. DeLay. Above Mr. DeLay is Mr. Hastert, whose rise to speaker Mr. DeLay made possible. The new whip is Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mr. DeLay's trusted assistant. Other top posts have been filled by DeLay acolytes as well. 
In looking at one of the most important connections in Republican-controlled Washington, Mr. DeLay said he had a "very straightforward personal relationship" with President Bush. "We can talk very frankly with each other," Mr. DeLay said.
The unknown quantity in the new Republican hierarchy may be Dr. Frist. The House leaders were all accustomed to dealing with Mr. Lott, and aides say that neither Mr. Hastert nor Mr. DeLay has had extensive dealings with Dr. Frist, a surgeon. Mr. Blunt, who worked with Dr. Frist on Mr. Bush's campaign, may know him best. He anticipates a strong working arrangement between House and Senate.
And he expects Republicans, still relatively new to the majority Congressional status enjoyed for so long by Democrats, to get it right this time.
"We have gotten a little better at being in the majority every single month," Mr. Blunt said. "We still make some mistakes and are going to make some this year, but I think we are increasingly improving our ability to get things done."

GRAPHIC: Photos/Chart: "Republicans to Watch in the New Congress" SENATE LEADERSHIP Bill Frist -- TennesseeSenate majority leaderA heart-lung transplant surgeon and the unknown quantity in the new Republican hierarchy. He gives his party new credibility on health care issues, but lacks experience in the nitty-gritty of Senate floor operations. As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he recruited most of the candidates who gave Republicans their 51-49 control of the chamber. Mitch McConnell -- KentuckyAssistant majority leaderThe new No. 2 Republican in the Senate. He has not been a floor leader before, but is picking up most of those duties because the majority leader, Bill Frist, has even less experience. Cerebral and droll, he is perhaps best known for leading a determined but losing fight against overhauling the campaign finance law. Rick Santorum -- PennsylvaniaChairman of Republican conferenceOne of the youngest and most conservative senators. He arrived in the Senate in 1995 with a reputation as an aggressive rebel against Democratic leadership in the House. Though his brash style upset some senior colleagues, he has built strong support in his party as a leader on abortion, welfare and President Bush's religion-based initiative. Jon Kyl -- ArizonaChairman of Republican policy committeeLeader of the committee that provides analysis and argument to support party positions. He has promised an aggressive operation. Though less well known than his Arizona colleague, John McCain, he is a committed conservative whose guidance is sought on military and intelligence issues. He is a longtime advocate of eliminating the estate tax. SENATE COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN John McCain -- ArizonaChairman of Commerce CommitteeOne of the few senators with a national following, thanks to his presidential bid and an independent streak that attracts lots of media attention. His willingness to challenge the administration and work with Democrats could be a problem for Senate Republicans and President Bush. Charles E. Grassley -- IowaChairman of Finance CommitteeHe likes to say that 70 percent of President Bush's legislative agenda must pass through his panel, which will exert jurisdiction over taxes and health care policy. He has an independent streak and is capable of breaking with the administration. He has said that he wants to lower marginal tax rates and make the child tax credit permanent. Orrin G. Hatch -- UtahChairman of Judiciary CommitteeHis committee is a flash point for conflict over nominations to the federal bench. With many anticipating a Supreme Court vacancy, he could oversee a tense battle with implications for the coming presidential campaign. He and his colleagues have promised to quickly revisit some controversial judicial nominations that stalled under Democratic control. HOUSE LEADERSHIP AND COMMITTEES Tom DeLay -- Texas, 22nd DistrictHouse Republican leaderA chief architect of the Republican majority in the House. Blunt and uncompromising, he is a favorite of the conservative base of the party and was the force behind a getout- the-vote effort that helped Republicans expand their House numbers in the midterm elections. As majority leader, he says he will involve Republican committee chairmen more closely in$; party strategy. Roy Blunt -- Missouri, 7th DistrictMajority whipElected to statewide office in Missouri at 34, he quickly demonstrated political skills when he arrived in Congress in 1997. Tom DeLay made him his chief deputy whip, and he now succeeds his mentor. A smooth-spoken former president of Southwest Baptist University, Mr. Blunt might assume a higher public profile than Mr. DeLay. Bill Thomas -- Calif., 21st DistrictChairman of Ways and Means CommitteeThe House point man on tax and health care policy. He will play a major role in moving Republican economic proposals and any Medicare initiatives. Deeply knowledgeable about such issues, he has been known to show impatience with those who are not. He can be obstinate and is not afraid to challenge the House leadership. (The New York Times; photographs by Associated Press, except Dr. Frist and Mr. Blunt by Reuters)(pg. 20)

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
The President's Team Changes Some Players But Not Its Game Plan

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 

 BODY:
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., President Bush's budget director, observed the other day that the White House was "changing lines on the fly," a hockey term for switching important players in the middle of the action. "A good team does that," Mr. Daniels added, "without missing a play."
 But what a lot of players, and what a lot of action: At the churning halfway mark of Mr. Bush's term, no fewer than five senior officials have recently quit or been shoved out the White House back door, two of them from top economic posts just as Mr. Bush is to announce a major economic initiative. 
 The departures are particularly striking in a "Father Knows Best" White House known for its loyalty, predictability and discipline, where turnover has been as rare as an unauthorized leak.
The reality, though, is that the current staff turnover has had little effect on the economic stimulus package Mr. Bush is to announce next week, or on policy over all. People in and outside the Bush court say the economic plan was hammered out months ago by a small core of still-in-place presidential advisers -- Vice President Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, Andrew H. Card Jr. and Joshua Bolten -- who control all domestic policy in an administration where power is ever more tightly held at the White House. 
Mr. Bush is to formally present what administration officials say is a $600 billion package of tax cuts and new spending measures on Tuesday in Chicago, before his new Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, is even confirmed by the Senate.
Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman at Goldman Sachs, started work as Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser only on Friday. (William H. Donaldson, Mr. Bush's selection for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, also awaits Senate confirmation.)
Republicans close to the White House say that the two newest economic faces, Mr. Snow and Mr. Friedman, are to be more salesmen than architects. Their predecessors, former Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's former economic adviser, were ousted in large part for their inability to sell economic policies drafted in the heart of the West Wing by the Bush inner circle.
"They've already written the melody," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee and a regular critic of the White House. "They've just gotten a different piano player to go on stage and present it to the audience." 
Or as Stephen Moore, the president of a conservative lobbying group, the Club for Growth, put it: "Either the new team will sell the plan effectively, or there will be another new team."
Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, disputed the notion that power was tightly held by a handful of aides -- "the president has an inclusive decision-making process in which he reviews the beliefs of all of his experts" -- while Mr. Rove, the president's top political adviser, said that people were overemphasizing his role and those of other senior aides at the expense of Mr. Bush. 
The president, Mr. Rove said, gave the broad outlines of the economic policy "to a broad group of people who went back and hashed them out and brought them back to him, and he went for some of them, and some of them he didn't."
The most influential adviser of the five leaving the administration is Nicholas E. Calio, President Bush's liaison to Congress. Mr. Calio, who is to become chief lobbyist for Citigroup, is close to the president and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the former majority leader who was efficiently jettisoned by the White House last month after Mr. Lott made remarks widely attacked as racist and damaging to the president and the party.
Mr. Calio is to be replaced by his deputy, David Hobbs, who does not have a close relationship with Mr. Bush or with the incoming Republican majority leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. But administration officials said that Mr. Hobbs knew the job, and that in any case Mr. Frist, a White House favorite, was close to Mr. Rove.
Mary Matalin, a top strategist for Mr. Cheney, is leaving to return to television, perhaps CNN or NBC, while Joe M. Allbaugh, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has announced that he will leave in March for the private sector. Mr. Allbaugh was the manager of Mr. Bush's 2000 campaign.
White House officials said the departures were all part of the natural attrition that takes place in any administration at the midway point, when people have had enough of the hours, the pressures or the government salaries. (Ms. Matalin and Mr. Calio, who both earned $145,000 a year, said they were leaving to see their families and to make more money. Ms. Matalin, who was on the CNN political talk show "Crossfire" from 1999 to 2001, said that she had taken a 90 percent pay cut to work at the White House. Mr. Calio, who was once one of Washington's most successful lobbyists, earned nearly $1 million in 2000.)
The recent departures aside, even Democrats acknowledged that Mr. Bush had been unusually successful in keeping crucial players. One main reason, Republicans close to the White House say, is that Mr. Bush, the former fraternity president with a streak of temper and an open door, inspires tremendous loyalty and a measure of fear. 
"It's a whole series of reasons, not to mention the fact that it's a very exciting time to be in government," said a Republican close to the White House. "The issues you are dealing with are issues of tremendous importance -- the war on terror, the battle with Saddam and trying to save the economy."

Interviews with the jurors who in early 2001 deadlocked over the death penalty for two men convicted in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa in 1998 put the deliberations in a new light. The interviews show two jurors violated the judge's directive by consulting their pastors during deliberations, another confused the court during jury selection about his willingness to impose a death sentence, and another, the lone Jew on the panel, said he felt particularly vulnerable to retaliation. 1

THE COST OF WAR

BYLINE:  By Elisabeth Bumiller

 BODY:
 Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the Bush administration's budget director, estimated that the cost of an Iraq war could be $50 billion to $60 billion, a figure similar to the cost of the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
The estimate was well below one by Lawrence B. Lindsey, President Bush's former chief economic adviser, who had said last fall that an Iraq war could cost $100 billion to $200 billion. Democrats said that Mr. Daniels was playing down the cost to make a war more politically palatable. Elisabeth Bumiller

HEADLINE: Disney Enlists Theater Innovators for Theme Park Shows 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Think Disney, and what often spring to mind are cartoon characters and animated movies. But since it hired the director and designer Julie Taymor to create the hit 1998 Broadway production of "The Lion King," this entertainment company has been playing against type by enlisting devoted theater and opera talent for new work that is dedicated to the stage, not the screen.
 Broadway projects in development include "Mary Poppins," with the London producer Cameron Mackintosh; "The Little Mermaid," adapted by Matthew Bourne, who created the all-male "Swan Lake"; Ms. Taymor's version of "Pinocchio"; and "Tarzan," with music by Phil Collins (including new songs added to the score he created for the Disney animated version) and a set by the Tony Award-winning designer Bob Crowley. 
 Now, in what appears to be an effort to increase flagging theme-park attendance, Disney has taken established stage talent to its newest theme park, California Adventure in Anaheim, which opened in February 2001 near Disneyland. There Disney is about to open "Aladdin," a new stage adaptation of its 1992 animated film. 
Times have been tough for Disney's theme park business. The company's stock dropped 10 percent last year, a result of the recession and the terrorist attacks. Because the theme-park division makes up about 40 percent of Disney's annual operating income, the company's performance depends on improved attendance. 
"Disney's Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular" appears to be an attempt to draw larger crowds. The musical features songs from the film score, with music by by Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice. Mr. Menken has written music and lyrics for a new song in the show, "To Be Free."
"Aladdin," which has been in previews and officially opens on Jan. 17 at the Hyperion Theater in the park, will conform to the standards of the other theme-park minimusicals that Disney has adapted from its films, playing four times a day and running a mere 40 minutes. But in its theatrical creative team and emphasis on traditional staging rather than pyrotechnics, it departs from typical theme-park fare.
"Aladdin" is the first Disney project led by Anne Hamburger, who has a new position at the company: executive vice president for creative entertainment for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The founder and artistic director of En Garde Arts, a theater company, now defunct, that presented events at unusual sites around New York City, she was more recently artistic director of La Jolla Playhouse in California.
"Aladdin" is directed by Francesca Zambello, who has staged musicals and operas around the world: at the Royal National Theater and the Royal Opera at Covent Garden in London, and in France, Los Angeles and Santa Fe, N.M. She will direct Berlioz's "Troyens" for the Metropolitan Opera in New York next month.
The dances in "Aladdin" were created by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, who choreographed and directed "Swing" and the Tony-winning "Titanic" on Broadway and a recent piece for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. The professionals responsible for the show's look include Peter J. Davison, the set designer who won a Tony Award for "Copenhagen"; the costume designer Anita Yavich; and the lighting designer Mark McCullough, the last two known for work in major opera houses. The musical arranger is Timothy Mark Williams, composer of the West End musical "Napoleon." 
Arnold J. Mungioli, the casting agent for "Aladdin," primarily handles Broadway musicals. The actors have been drawn from New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and several have performed on Broadway as well as in the national tours of shows like "Rent," "Miss Saigon" and "The Lion King."
James A. Rasulo, president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said the emphasis on theatrical talent was part of a strategy to originate work that was artistically distinctive as well as entertaining.
"Our business, like any other, has a classic nature but also needs to evolve," he said. "We are committed to continuing to push the envelope, to continue to present to our guests new, exciting forms of storytelling."
Mr. Rasulo, formerly chief executive of Euro Disney, became president of the company's parks and resorts in September, after Paul Pressler left to become chief executive of the Gap. Mr. Pressler had hired Ms. Hamburger, who in turn brought in Ms. Zambello and the rest of the "Aladdin" creative team.
Ms. Hamburger has also commissioned a Disneyland "Snow White" musical from Dara Cloud, a playwright, and Eric Schaeffer, artistic director of the Signature Theater Company in Arlington, Va., who recently completed the Sondheim Celebration at the Kennedy Center in Washington.
In addition Ms. Hamburger said Disney was producing a new parade for Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla. Its creators are Andrew Jackness, who recently designed the set for "Mourning Becomes Electra" at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, and Candice Donnelly, who designed the costumes for "This Thing of Darkness" at the Atlantic Theater Company in Manhattan.
Although its magic carpet indeed flies, this "Aladdin" leans toward old-fashioned theater, with painted backdrops. "The whole philosophy behind doing this is to take it up a notch, so theme-park entertainment is on a par with Broadway entertainment," Ms. Zambello, the director, said. 
Some of the creators said that they had to make a psychological leap to work for a theme park, but that the salaries, resources and sense of adventure made the Disney project worth trying.
"In the last few years I've been making a serious attempt to do less opera and more populist-based things," Ms. Zambello said, adding that the more accessible the entertainment was, the broader the impact. "Any way we can reach out to a wider audience, we should," she said. "Something like 40,000 people could see the show in one week."
While some purists may bemoan the blurring of the lines between theater and mass-market entertainment, Ms. Hamburger called the project a positive step. "In 1975 a person like me would never have ended up at Disney," she said. "Economics have caused a lot more cross-pollination." As an example she cited "Urinetown," the Tony Award-winning Broadway show that originated at the Fringe Festival on the Lower East Side. "It's healthy for the arts and healthy for the world," she said.
The park's 2,000-seat Hyperion Theater has two balconies and a 50-foot proscenium stage the size of the one at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center.
It was designed by Hugh Hardy, of Hardy Holzmann Pfeiffer in Manhattan, who oversaw the renovation of the New Amsterdam and New Victory Theaters on 42nd Street in Manhattan and the new home for Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
"I was taken when I saw the theater," Ms. Zambello said. "I immediately saw there was a great relationship between the stage and the audience." 
The show, which is free with park admission ($45 for adults and $35 for children), plays seven days a week. There are 18 scene changes, 250 costume changes and 2 full casts of 28 who alternate performances, as well as another backup cast and 2 stage crews.
It wasn't easy to get actors to audition for it. Ms. Hamburger said: "There was some resistance from agents: 'What? You want my client to go to a theme park?' "
At first she was wary herself, she said, having come from En Garde Arts, with an annual operating budget of $800,000, and the La Jolla Playhouse, with a budget of $6 million. (Disney will not release budget figures, but they are considerably higher.) Still, Ms. Hamburger said she felt ready for a drastic professional change. 
"I've never been much interested in preaching to the converted," she said. "I've always been interested in how do you wake up people to the possibilities of what live theater can do."
"I am an entrepreneur at heart," she continued. "This allows me to be an entrepreneur with the resources of being at a multibillion-dollar company. If I can bring great artists into this division to work here, I can have an impact which is unparalleled with anything I can do in the theater."
Ms. Zambello said her Disney experience had proved to be less of a departure then she had expected. "As a director, whatever you're doing, your job is to tell the story," she said. "It doesn't really differ. Am I fully discovering characters in a way that the audience will be drawn into it?"
Still, there have been some adjustments for the creators of "Aladdin," like having to comply with Disney's tight rehearsal timetable. "Everything is slightly compressed, which is sometimes frustrating," Ms. Taylor-Corbett said. "We're trying to infuse each other with new knowledge." 
But she said she felt reassured by the show's emphasis on traditional theatrical values. "I'm so happy that it doesn't rely on special effects," she said. "It really is about your imagination."

HEADLINE: More Cities Set Up Wireless Networks 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
Add urban renewal to the growing list of reasons to deploy wireless computing networks.
 The city of Long Beach, Calif., plans to announce on Friday that it will make free wireless Internet access available in its downtown area as part of an effort to attract visitors and companies to the business district. The city will use the increasingly popular standard known as Wi-Fi, which lets personal computers and other hand-held devices connect to the Internet without wires at high speed. 
 The new service is one of the first examples of a city's setting up a free wireless Internet system. It is being supported in part by equipment donations from a group of companies, with the city underwriting the $2,500 annual cost of an Internet connection.
The project will initially provide wireless service to a four-block area around the city's convention district along Pine Street, but there are plans to extend the network to other Long Beach neighborhoods including the marina and the airport, said Bruce Mayes, the acting technology officer for the Long Beach Economic Development Bureau.
He said the city wanted to expand its high technology base and viewed the network as a good way to advertise its commitment.
Long Beach is one of a growing number of cities and community groups that are considering free wireless Internet access. A number of cities are exploring the idea of installing such networks in downtown areas or throughout entire communities; they include San Francisco; Seattle; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Lodi, Calif.
"You can think of these as urban renewal projects," said Douglas H. Klein, the chief executive of Vernier Networks, one of the companies that will supply equipment for the service in Long Beach. Vernier Networks, which is privately owned, is based in Mountain View, Calif., and makes systems for managing and controlling access to wireless networks.
In recent months, Mr. Klein said, the company has noticed a growing interest from local governments eager to find ways to make their city centers more attractive.
"People like to feel like they're in a comfort zone," he said. "If they can attract a certain clientele, it starts to create that aura." 
Such networks send a message for municipalities, said C. Brian Grimm, the communications director for the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry group. "It's 'don't leave downtown for lunch,' " he said. "It's high-visibility and high-value, and it permits a municipality to easily serve its residents."
Municipal governments are joining a community movement of more than 30 organizations around the United States that now deliver wireless Internet service.
In addition to Long Beach, the Bay Area Wireless Regional Network in San Francisco this week plans to switch on its first experimental access point atop San Bruno Mountain, in the southern part of the city. The network should make the Internet available over roughly an eight-mile radius to users with special antennas.
The Bay Area wireless group is a hobbyist experiment, run by just four volunteers with a donated Internet connection, but the project illustrates the low costs of wireless networks based on the industry's 802.11 wireless standard.
According to Tim Pozar, a radio engineer who is one of the leaders of the experiment, the group will spend about $2,000 to install the system and will increase capacity by adding low-cost antennas.
"In general we believe the Internet is a ubiquitous medium that is a basic tool that should be available to as many people as possible," Mr. Pozar said. It's a slam-dunk and very easy to do."

HEADLINE: Experts See Vulnerability As Outsiders Code Software 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
As American companies increasingly move their software development tasks out of their own offices to computer programming companies here and abroad, new concerns are being raised about the security risks involved.
 Some of these concerns over the practice, known as outsourcing, are being raised by people with an obvious self-interest -- for example, programmers who have seen their livelihoods shift to less expensive operations overseas. And the companies providing outsourcing services argue that they take all necessary precautions to limit risk. But the question of whether the booming business in exporting high-tech jobs is heightening the risk of theft, sabotage or cyberterrorism from rogue programmers has been raised in discussions at the White House, before Congress and in boardrooms. 
 "I can't cite any examples of this happening -- but what that means is we haven't found any," said James Lewis, director of the technology program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "It's clearly a temptation for people, and it's a concern," he said. 
While operations in some countries, like the United States, Britain and India, are considered generally safe for such software outsourcing, nervousness is beginning to grow at companies and in the government about the possibility of abuse by hackers, organized crime agents and cyberterrorists in nations like Pakistan, the Philippines and Russia.
To Mr. Lewis, the potential for problems in the software design process goes beyond the earlier trend of running back-office operations and call centers in other countries.
"The banks have done a fairly good job of insulating themselves," he said, keeping their call centers overseas from being able to engage in unwanted activity. But letting outsiders work on the software that runs businesses and financial institutions could be opening up a world of trouble, he said. "You're going to have code that will be written in countries like India and China," he explained, "and no one's going to know what's in it."
David McCurdy, a former congressman and executive director of the Internet Security Alliance, an industry group, said that although he considered himself a "free trader" with a strong belief in the benefits of global commerce, he believed that the risk from offshore outsourcing was "the most serious of the industry-based issues that this country faces."
The issue has been discussed quietly at the highest levels of government, said Howard Schmidt, vice chairman of the president's critical infrastructure protection board. At the White House, he said, "this has come up as part of a broader discussion of how do we get trust and reliability" in computer systems.
He said, however, that the issue was outsourcing itself, not simply the overseas kind, and cited spies like Aldrich H. Ames and Robert Hanssen as examples of how Americans could do just as much damage to the nation from within as outsiders could. "Irrespective of where it's done, we need to make sure that our code is clean and protected across the board," he said.
It is easy to see why companies find the economics of outsourcing compelling; cost savings can be 25 to 40 percent. Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., predicted in a recent report that the acceleration in outsourcing would result in 3.3 million American jobs' moving offshore by 2015, an exodus reminiscent of the tide of American blue-collar jobs that moved to East Asia in the 1980's. Forrester estimates that 70 percent of these jobs will move to India, 20 percent to the Philippines and 10 percent to China.
Patrick P. Gelsinger, the chief technology officer of Intel, said the cost of one engineer in the United States would pay for the services of three Indians, four Chinese or five Russians. But he said he was not concerned about the potential for mischief within his own company's overseas software development. The software is reviewed, he said, to avoid surprises.
"Is it possible?" he said. "Sure, it's possible. Is it a unique risk there? No, it isn't." 
Offshore outsourcing got its trial run in preparations for the Year 2000 changeover, when government and industry had to check every line of software for glitches that could make computer networks and even building security systems shut down at 12 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2000. 
Much of that work was done overseas, and although industry experts warned that foreign programmers might commit crimes or lay the groundwork for terrorism, no evidence of sabotage occurred, said Jay Ehrenreich, senior manager for cybercrime prevention and response at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm. After that experience, he said, many companies felt comfortable sending software work overseas, and now such bespoke programming is done around the world.
Programmers say the confidence is not justified. 
"Anyone tells you that 'offshoring' computer systems does not put the infrastructure at risk is lying," said Ken O'Neil, a programmer who lives on Long Island. He and other programmers talk of "sleeper bugs" that could be set to go off at a later date, or back doors that would let intruders in to shuttle money around, steal fractions of a penny from millions of transactions or shut down the system entirely. They warn of risks from political instability, organized crime and terror cells, and even from governments that might demand the ability to spy.
Such talk could be dismissed as the grumblings of disgruntled white-collar workers who have seen their high-paying jobs move elsewhere. "Nobody is going to cry for people who make $75,000 or $100,000 a year," said Marc Alan Fink, who lost his programming job more than a year ago.
In fact, some of the newly expressed concern is part of a long-running and acrimonious fight by programmers to hold on to their jobs in the face of relaxed immigration standards for technical workers and increased outsourcing. They attack the rise in special visas for immigrant engineers, known as H1-B visas, and the trend toward sending jobs overseas.
The companies that provide software outsourcing services say that they take rigorous precautions to ensure that their employees are trustworthy and their code is secure. 
Arup Gupta, president of Tata Consultancy Services, an Indian company that is part of a conglomerate, said he had gotten worried calls from clients after the recent F.B.I. raid on Ptech, a software company in Quincy, Mass. The agents were looking for connections between the company and Yasin al-Qadi, a Saudi Arabian financier suspected of financing terrorism, but early speculation in news reports focused on questions about whether the company, which provides software used by many government agencies, including the F.B.I., was secure.
Mr. Gupta assured his clients that his company used exacting background checks and multiple reviews of company-written software based on industry standards. "With all these in place, we can guarantee, basically, that the code we deliver will be bug-free and will perform to specifications and will not have holes in it," he said. 
He said he could speak for only his own company, but he added that since the Sept. 11 attacks, security fears and economic troubles had shrunk his industry and brought about the consolidation of the major Indian software houses. "The top five or six companies, you can be assured that they are conforming to these standards," he said. "The others, you cannot be sure -- but maybe they are."
United States technology services companies are also expanding their overseas outsourcing offerings. Electronic Data Systems provides outsourcing services in 93 "solution centers" that it has opened around the world since 1990. Paul D. Clark, the chief information security and privacy executive for the company, said E.D.S. understood that the threat of sabotage in outsourcing is real. He said, "To say that it isn't is to deny the realities." That is why the company adheres to security and testing standards wherever code is written, he said, adding, "whether it's India or Indiana, it doesn't make any difference." 
The company is careful about what code it releases to which countries, said Dan Zadorozny, president of application services for EDS Solutions Consulting; some federal government work, he said, is done only in the United States and Britain, and "we're not going to move that anywhere." But E.D.S. insists that its standards are high enough that its outsourcing sites offer "a more secure environment than you can provide yourself."
Some programmers, however, argue that reviews are less thorough than companies say. "If code runs, I assure you, nobody ever looks at it," said one, who said conducting a line-by-line review would be like having an electrician tear into walls to check wiring even though the lights were working. "It never gets done in practice."
Mr. Ehrenreich, the crime consultant, said that it was up to companies to demand that kind of security, even if it cost more. He recalled a case in which he was asked to investigate the possibility of illegal activity on an Indian outsourcing contract and discovered that it was nothing more than run-of-the-mill overbilling fraud. 
What struck him, however, was that the company had no idea how big the problem was. He said far-worse crimes could have been committed without anyone's knowing. "The risk was there that more could have been done," he said. "They clearly did not have the controls in place to mitigate it, control it."
"You can outsource the work," he said, "but you can't outsource the risk."

HEADLINE: From Russia, Without Twang But With Country in Their Hearts; 
Despite Hard Breaks, Bering Strait Hopes to Make It in Nashville

BYLINE:  By JILL ABRAMSON 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE 

 BODY:
"Porushka-Paranya," a traditional Russian folk song, would seem an odd choice to close out the Grand Ole Opry's late show at Ryman Auditorium, the mother church of country music. But Nashville veterans like Charley Pride and Jim Ed Brown are enthusiastically tapping their toes to the dizzying banjo and fiddle riffs that transform the song into a bluegrass stomp. 
 Around Nashville, the seven musicians in the band Bering Strait are known as "the Russian kids." After four years of struggle and broken record deals, the kids, now in their early 20's, are on the cusp of doing something none of their countrymen have ever done: make it on Music Row. 
 Bering Strait's cross-cultural blend of pop rock (reminiscent of the Pretenders and 10,000 Maniacs) and classic country is beginning to catch on, and not only in Nashville. At a dressy charity benefit held at the gilded residence of the Russian ambassador in Washington in late November, four members of the band performed before a cheering audience full of Embassy Row grandees more accustomed to the dulcet strains of Tchaikovsky.
The group's first album, "Bering Strait," will be released on Jan. 14 by Universal South, a relatively new and hot country label, a division of Universal Records. 
Next month comes the release of a documentary film, "The Ballad of Bering Strait," which lovingly chronicles the band's rocky road from a classical music conservatory in Russia to the country big-time. The band is planning live appearances in New York, including one at B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill on Feb. 12, and a few other cities when the film has its theatrical release in Manhattan on Feb. 7. A full-fledged tour is also in the works. 
"What sets these kids apart is what fine musicians they are," said Pete Fisher, the Opry's general manager, who has booked them to play at the Ryman and the bigger, Disneyfied Opryland several times.
But with country record labels going bust and stiffer competition for air time on the radio, "it's probably tougher than ever to break through," said Lon Helton, the Nashville bureau chief of Radio & Records, a publication that closely tracks the music charts. Others in the country music world say it is vital for the band to be more than a novelty act known for its Russian roots. On Bering Strait's CD all songs but one are sung in English (without twang) and show virtually no trace of the group's foreign origins.
In some ways, the band's story -- compellingly captured by Nina Gilden Seavey, who runs the documentary film center at George Washington University in Washington and won an Emmy for a previous documentary film about polio -- is more distinctive than its music.
Bering Strait's obsession with country music began as the fall of Communism ushered in a period when American culture, from cowboy hats to music, flooded into Russia. In Obninsk, 65 miles southwest of Moscow and noteworthy mainly as the home of the world's first commercial nuclear power plant and a city once closed to visitors, almost all the group's members shared a strict music teacher who put the band together. An admirer of Earl Monroe and Lester Flatt, he taught Ilya Toshinsky the banjo and Alexander Ostrovsky the Dobro, requiring them to practice 10 hours a day. There is a hilarious scene in the movie where Mr. Toshinsky plays a feisty "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" on the banjo as part of his conservatory examination for a pair of somewhat perplexed professors. "The banjo is not really played that much in Russia," Mr. Toshinsky explained in a recent interview.
When Bering Strait was performing at a Mexican restaurant in Moscow in the late 1990's, Ray Johnson, an American art dealer, wandered in, hoping to have dinner without being subjected to live music. But when Mr. Johnson heard Bering Strait's expertly played bluegrass, he was enchanted. He paid for the teenagers to travel to Nashville, where they connected with a longtime producer, Tim DuBois, now at Universal South, and Mike Kinnamon, their manager.
In some ways, the person with the most riding on all this is Mr. Kinnamon, who for years had all seven members of the band living in makeshift bunk beds at his modest three-bedroom, one-bathroom home outside Nashville. Helping support the band for nearly four years has brought Mr. Kinnamon to the brink of bankruptcy, he said during a recent interview at his home, where two members of the band still reside. "I've got enough money to make it to the end of the month, but that's all," said Mr. Kinnamon, who nonetheless helped members of the band scrape together the funds to make it back home to Russia this Christmas.
Mr. Kinnamon, who has managed other rock and country acts, is accustomed to risk. He ran away from home to join the circus when he was a boy and learned to be a tightrope walker, a skill he still performs. He is a total believer in the band, talks about the members like a proud father and watches their newly produced videos in reverential silence. "I kept waiting for them to grow up," he said, "but it's me who did."
He has stuck by Bering Strait through four previously canceled record deals. Because of visa restrictions, the band members cannot work other jobs. More than once, he said, he and the band drove past the annual Country Music Association Awards ceremony certain that "this should be our year," only to confront fresh setbacks. The four-year wait for the CD's debut took a toll on the group's homesick fiddler, Sergei Passov, who left the band a few months ago and returned to Russia.
"The worst part was the fear and the waiting and not knowing what would happen," said Natasha Borzilova, the band's lead vocalist, who like a lot of young American women is fond of changing her hair color and has gone from the brown braids she wore as a teenager to a blond punk cut to the red curls she tossed onstage at the Opry last month.
At one point, just after three band members got their own place in Nashville, their apartment building burned to the ground. It is easy to see why the father of Lydia Salnikova, the group's keyboard player and backup vocalist, sternly cautions her in the film, "Musician today, unemployed tomorrow."
Ms. Seavey, who shot parts of her film in Russia and interviewed the band's family, teachers and friends, said that the band members still derived a lot of their cultural nourishment from home. Mr. Toshinsky said he long ago accepted that it would be impossible to support himself in Russia playing country music.
Now he and the other band members consider Nashville home. Ms. Borzilova and Ms. Salnikova are fixtures in a local yoga class.
"They are really good musicians," Jim Ed Brown said, watching the Russian performers take their bows at the Opry. "They could do it. All they need is a hit song."

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia and Russia Agree to ManageOil Prices 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
The oil-producing giants, Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed today to keep their supplies flowing to world markets in a bid to control prices that could jeopardize global economic growth.
 The meeting in Riyadh of the world's top two oil exporters came as prices soared amid fears that a war in Iraq could disrupt exports throughout the gulf and as a strike in Venezuela threatens supply in the United States. 
 "Both sides discussed the importance of stabilizing oil prices," the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said, and the need to keep those prices from rising to the point where they could hurt global economic growth. 
"The kingdom and Russia agree that cooperation is necessary to ensure that there is no lack of oil supplies," Mr. Naimi said after meeting with the Russian energy minister, Igor K. Yusufov.
Mr. Naimi told the official Saudi Press Agency that the oil markets were "in bad shape" and that all producers had to cooperate to ensure a stable market.
"During our meeting," Mr. Naimi said, "we discussed the importance of coordination and cooperation between our countries and all other oil-exporting countries as well as oil consumers for the stability of the market at all times."
Saudi Arabia, with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has promised to fill any supply gap created by any United States attack on Iraq.
For its part, OPEC is set to raise output quotas in mid-January by up to one million barrels a day, the organization's president, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, said today. OPEC could increase its production by 500,000 to one million barrels a day, Mr. Attiyah, the oil minister of Qatar, said in an interview.
Russia's oil output is set to rise to an average of 8.4 million barrels a day this year, up 800,000 barrels a day from 2002.
Analysts say Russia could easily turn up the taps by an additional two million barrels a day over the next few years and overtake Saudi Arabia, which was pumping a touch more than eight million barrels a day in the latter part of last year.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Sugar Coating 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The governor of New York could, if he wanted to be a stand-up guy, tell the hard truth about the state's calamitous fiscal situation. George E. Pataki could go on television and, with his eyes fixed honestly and sincerely on the voters, talk about the billions in deficits that are piling up, and the programs and policies that are necessary to correct (rather than conceal) the madness.
 He could do that. But don't bet on it. Mr. Pataki is, above all, a defensive politician. He has mastered the art of camouflage, and avoids at all costs the danger inherent in too much candor and exposure. That's the governor's great talent. Politically, you never know where he's likely to emerge. He darts right, then left. Now you see him cutting taxes. Now you see him raising spending. One moment he's the embodiment of the Republican Party's conservative principles. The next moment he's sprinting to the left of Carl McCall. Trying to pin the governor down is like trying to measure simultaneously the precise location and the velocity of a quantum particle. It can't be done. 
 The deficit in the budget for the current fiscal year, which ends in three months, is roughly $2 billion. This is the budget that the governor and the Legislature put together with smoke and mirrors last spring. They did their Albany moon dance (of which the first and most important step is overestimating revenues) and declared the budget balanced. Then everybody winked and nodded and chuckled at one another. The budget wasn't balanced, and the pols all knew it. But, hey, it was an election year. What the voters didn't know wouldn't hurt them.
Now it's January and we need $2 billion to close the gap in a budget we were told was balanced last spring. And we need it quickly because the deficit staring us in the face for the upcoming fiscal year, which starts April 1, is an additional $10 billion.
If you had listened to Governor Pataki's inaugural address Wednesday, you would not have gotten the impression that the state is facing its worst financial crisis in many decades, perhaps since the Depression. Oh, he mentioned the crisis. And he asked that New Yorkers face up to it with courage and unity. But he did not talk about the very tough measures that will have to be taken and the real pain that will have to be endured to bring the state budget into real balance.
And he sure didn't talk about the fact that he and the leaders of both major parties behaved for the better part of a year as if this very dangerous situation didn't even exist.
How are we going to get out of this mess? What services will be cut? What taxes or fees raised? Will state employees be laid off? Will the public schools suffer? Stay tuned.
The governor's refusal to even acknowledge the dimensions of the crisis not only postponed the necessary hard work for a year, it also worsened the fiscal crisis faced by New York City. The governor was running a feel-good campaign for re-election. So for most of last year, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a fellow Republican, covered Mr. Pataki's political flank by insisting there was no need to raise taxes to cope with the city's burgeoning deficit.
That fiction evaporated last month when the mayor signed an 18.5 percent increase in the property tax, the largest hike in history. The city still faces a substantial budget deficit.
At least Mayor Bloomberg acted. No one knows what Governor Pataki is up to. Will he begin the heavy lifting that is necessary to ward off a long-term catastrophe? Will he seek to raise taxes where it's necessary and wield his scalpel wisely when it comes to service cuts?
Will he ask for a measure of shared sacrifice from all New Yorkers?
If his past behavior (and the behavior of most politicians) is a guide, Governor Pataki will do whatever best feeds his ambitions. The feeling is that he longs to join the Bush administration, either as the president's running mate in 2004 (highly unlikely) or in a cabinet post. That could make him reluctant to defy Republican orthodoxy by substantially raising taxes.
Another moon dance is probably on tap. The state will most likely raid the tobacco settlement money, which was supposed to be used for health care programs. And the pols will scout around for any other temporary financing they can find. But they are running out of schemes and ploys and ruses.
Pretty soon the honest truth will be the only tool available.

HEADLINE: Veteran Lawmaker Is Restyling Himself As Can-Do Candidate 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: HILTON HEAD, S.C., Jan. 3 

 BODY:
On paper, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the latest entry for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, has a lot going for him.
 A seasoned player with experience on the full spectrum of national issues, he is the only Democrat among at least a half-dozen hopefuls who has run for the nomination before. 
 He has raised impressive sums of money and has the ability to raise much more.
From tirelessly campaigning for his House colleagues for more than two decades, he has developed a nationwide network of grass-roots loyalists and local officeholders. He won Iowa when he ran in 1988. He has had a long and close relationship with organized labor, which might provide crucial muscle in getting out the vote. 
All of this adds up to something for his rivals to worry about: this time, Dick Gephardt may have staying power.
It was what he noticeably lacked in 1988. Since he dropped out of that race, fate smiled briefly on Mr. Gephardt when a quirk of circumstance propelled him into the job of majority leader, but he never became speaker, the post he craved, because the Democrats lost the House in 1994. Yet because Speaker Thomas S. Foley lost his seat, the task of presiding over the transfer of power to the Republicans fell to his No. 2, Mr. Gephardt.
"With resignation but with resolve, I hereby end 40 years of Democratic rule of this House," Mr. Gephardt said as he handed the gavel to Newt Gingrich in a humiliating public ceremony.
Mr. Gephardt later called it "one of the worst days of my life." Since then, he has been the public face of the losing Democratic Party, failing four times in a row to retake the House.
After the most recent setback, in November, Mr. Gephardt quit as minority leader and retreated to the shadows, distancing himself from the public discussion of how his party lost and laying the groundwork instead for his second and possibly last try for the presidency.
Now, relaxing on a couch in a rental house here where his family spent the holidays, fresh from kitchen duty whipping up a batch of crab soup, Mr. Gephardt offered a succinct analysis of the November loss.
"Security trumped economics," he said, skipping over the dispiriting effect that his own support for President Bush's war efforts had on his Democratic colleagues.
Rather, as he emerges into what he clearly hopes will be a more successful phase of his life in national politics, he is eager to talk about what he calls his "new ideas for a new America."
With can-do enthusiasm, he spoke of providing all Americans with health insurance through their employers, using tax incentives; offering preschool programs in all public schools; simplifying the tax code so that 70 percent of taxpayers would pay a flat rate of 10 percent; seeking through the World Trade Organization an international minimum wage that would vary by country; and overseeing a "futuristic, optimistic, long-term energy policy" that would wean the nation from overseas oil and focus more on wind and solar power.
Punctuating his recitation with assertions of "We can do this!" he said he would strengthen domestic security by directing more money to local fire and police departments. He said he would start a teacher corps in which the federal government would pay tuition for college students to train as teachers (he likened it to R.O.T.C.); in return they would teach for five years in needy school districts.
More inchoate is a plan to spread democratic values around the world as a way to counteract the root causes of terrorism, something he says President Bush has ignored. He said he would establish exchange programs, set up loans and urge retiring baby boomers to volunteer for a Senior Peace Corps to help countries build their economies and incorporate some of the nuts and bolts of democracy, like the free flow of information. (Also unformed is how he would pay for all of these programs, although he suggested that his health care plan could be covered by rejecting Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut.)
Mr. Gephardt says that what he brings to the table is experience.
"I've been through every health care fight there's been," he said. "I think I know what can pass and what can't pass. I led the effort with the Clinton health care plan, and we failed. I'm sorry we failed. But it had a lot of components that you just could not politically sell. I've thought a lot about this."
He indicated that the last election showed his party could not succeed without offering a clear alternative to White House proposals.
"We've got to put a distinctive alternative out and say to people, if these problems bother you and you want these problems solved, here's a way to get it done," he said. "Here is a national set of issues, and here is a national candidacy."
Emphasizing his experience is an important way for Mr. Gephardt to draw attention to the inexperience of some of his rivals. It counters the call for a fresh face, which Gephardt supporters say could be unwise in wartime. But it also reminds voters that Mr. Gephardt, who will turn 62 at the end of this month, is a creature of Washington. He has been on the inside for a quarter-century and has yet to solve the problems that he says he understands so well.
Despite his career in Congress, where he has earned the almost universal good will and respect of House Democrats, Mr. Gephardt has not captured the public imagination. This may explain why he is so determined to infuse his persona with a new, positive energy and cast himself as a forward-looking figure.
"He doesn't have a compelling biography, and he seems like someone whose time has passed," said a Democratic strategist who admires Mr. Gephardt. "I'd bet money that Dick Gephardt doesn't take off, which isn't fair because I think he'd make a good president. But that's not what this is about."
What it is about, of course, is being able to win. That is the big question mark for Mr. Gephardt.
Steve Rosenthal, political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that few candidates had been as sympathetic to labor as Mr. Gephardt, and yet he is not assured of the organization's backing.
"People will be saying, 'We love Dick, but can he win?' " Mr. Rosenthal said. "He's really got to prove over the next several months that he's got a strategy that can move him to the White House. Nobody should assume that Gephardt will get the endorsement -- that's a very, very tough, uphill fight. He's got to go union by union."
Until Mr. Gephardt can prove that he can win, said another Democratic strategist, the unions are likely to sit on their hands, making it all the harder for him to advance. This is especially true in Iowa, where antiwar sentiment is strong and could work against him.
"The Iowa caucuses are wide open," said Sheila McGuire Riggs, the state's Democratic chairwoman until last month. Mr. Gephardt "has some level of support because he has worked hard and traveled a lot." Ms. Riggs said. But, she added, "He has no special advantage because it's been so long since he won Iowa, and now it's an entirely new mix of people he's running against."
Mr. Gephardt may also have trouble defining himself. He has switched his positions so often (on taxes, abortion and trade, among other things) and has split the difference so often as a legislative deal broker that there is some confusion about where his heart lies. This extends even to the location of his campaign headquarters, which he said he would establish in both St. Louis and Washington.
"This straddling goes back to his big problem -- being definitive on the issues and who he is," a longtime friend said.
His aides said he hoped that by leaving his leadership post, he could more easily present himself in bolder relief.
"The challenge is for him to transcend his role as a legislative leader, where everything went through the Cuisinart of House politics," said Bill Carrick, a party strategist who worked for Mr. Gephardt in 1988 and is doing so again. "People have a view of him as the Democratic leader, and they have to have a view of him as doing something else."
Mr. Gephardt, referring to other potential weaknesses of his candidacy, said: "The answer to it all has to come in the campaign. Either the ideas I have, my personality, who I am, what people think I can do, has to come across or it doesn't. I understand the thought, but we overcame that in Iowa in '88. People didn't see me as bland. They saw me as someone who could make change happen, and I've been able to do that in political campaigns 13 times in Missouri."
But after Iowa, he won again only in South Dakota and was crushed in the multiple-state races on Super Tuesday.
That dry run and his years as his party's spokesman in the House, however, have given him seasoning.
"He isn't approaching the national microphone for the first time and tapping it uncertainly and saying, 'Testing, one, two, three,' " said David E. Dreyer, a corporate communications strategist who was Mr. Gephardt's spokesman in the majority leader's office. "He can deliver his message from a degree of confidence that comes from having done this before."
Already, his campaign is more advanced than most. He has named Richard Sullivan, a North Carolina lawyer and top Democratic fund-raiser, as his chief fund-raiser, and Steve Murphy, who ran his Iowa campaign in 1988, as his campaign manager.
As for the notion that his timing is off, Mr. Gephardt said the opposite was true.
"The time is better now," he said. "I have a clearer feeling today about why I want to run than I even did in '88. The issues are clearer, what I want to do about them is clearer. I feel more strongly about it than I ever have, and that's why I want to do it."

HEADLINE: Chance of Better Days for Highway 99, Central California's Asphalt Artery 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: FAIRMEAD, Calif. 

 BODY:
Somewhere around the Mammoth Orange, a ramshackle orange-shaped burger stand that is the lone survivor of hundreds that dotted California roadsides in the 1950's, the two faces of Highway 99 merge.
 There is the wildly unromantic back-alley 99, a blur of cellphone towers, salvage yards, used car lots, strip malls and phosphorescent billboards for personal injury lawyers. 
 But there is another 99, found fleetingly in places like Selma ("The Raisin Capital of the World"), Fairmead ("Elev: 246") and even rapidly growing cities like Fresno. It is the 99 of early March, when peach and almond blossoms burst forth by the thousands on every tree, and of late September, when it is possible to roll down the windows and smell grapes drying into raisins.
"Not a single peach, raisin or nectarine leaves here without journeying along Highway 99," said David Mas Masumoto, a writer and organic farmer who grows peaches and raisin grapes outside Fresno. "It's our conduit, the Mississippi of the Central Valley in asphalt." 
The 250-mile stretch of Highway 99 that slices through about 30 communities in eight counties, from just south of Bakersfield to Sacramento, is the main economic and transportation artery for California's agricultural heartland, though its significance has long been obscured by its scabbiness and severe lack of escapist appeal. Route 66 it's not.
Yet this unheralded historic highway, pipeline for migrants and Bay Area commuters as well as almonds, pistachios, grapes, cotton, walnuts, Roma tomatoes, strawberries and potatoes, may have its moment yet. It is, after all, the Main Street of the Central Valley, where the pastoral landscape is fading, development is spreading with weedlike intensity, and profound demographic and political changes are shifting the state's balance of power inland.
"Highway 99 is where the population growth is," said Dr. Kevin Starr, a historian and the state librarian. "It's the spine of the next California."
This impending transformation has mayors, former mayors, civic leaders, business owners, people at nonprofit groups and assorted interested residents rethinking a highway that many had never given much thought to before.
It is a road that inspires a singular passion among some residents.
"It's fittingly ugly," said C. G. Hanzlicek, a Fresno poet (yes, there is a Fresno school of poetry). "It's a thunka thunka thunka highway, a working-class highway. It should be a little rough and tumble. It fits the severity of the landscape. Even the shoulders are grim." 
The California state transportation authority, or Caltrans, is planning to smooth the rough edges with $1.2 billion in improvements for 99, perhaps best known for the notorious winter fog that envelops it.
What remains of the highway's distinctive rural heritage and character, meanwhile -- flashes of beauty forming flickering windshield images amid debris -- is finally being recognized.
This month, Scenic America, a national nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C., that champions distinctive vistas, will designate Highway 99 in the Central Valley one of the country's 10 most endangered landscapes, prompted largely by agricultural land giving way to Bed Bath and Beyonds.
For the same reasons, the Great Valley Center, a nonprofit research organization in Modesto, is spearheading new efforts to spruce up 99, including erecting roadside signs identifying crops and drafting model ordinances to control billboards.
The center is being joined in Fresno County by the Association for the Beautification of 99, a group of four cities along a 32-mile stretch of the highway that have banded together to create a zoning district. Still being planned, the district would require businesses to pay attention to appearances: erecting walls to block views of junkyards, for example.
Growth has already transformed the Central Valley, which includes some of the country's most impoverished and environmentally degraded areas. From 1996 to 1998, the San Joaquin Valley, the southern part of the Central Valley, led the state in the conversion of irrigated farmland to urbanization, with eight of the state's top 10 counties experiencing loss, according to the Great Valley Center.
High housing prices in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles have helped to make the San Joaquin Valley, along with Riverside County, the fastest-growing region of California, the latest census shows. By 2020, it is projected to grow by 52 percent, to five million, most of it along the Highway 99 corridor.
Andrew Arnold, 40, sees the changes firsthand as he commutes from his Mediterranean-style house with a pool in Canterbury, a new subdivision on former vineyards in Turlock, to his job as a manager for a division of John Deere in Lathrop, an 80-mile round trip. "You see the ebb and flow of agriculture, the farmers' decisions to sell, the shopping centers in almond orchards," said Mr. Arnold, who grew up in Modesto. "There's a dynamic that gets played out almost daily as you drive."
The Central Valley's newfound status comes with a steep price: Many Valley towns have chronic housing shortages. Persistent double-digit unemployment reflects the seasonal nature of farm labor. The Valley now rivals Los Angeles for the worst air quality in the nation, in addition to pesticide-contaminated rivers, streams and drainage canals, waste runoff from dairies and feedlots, and vanishing wetlands, including vernal pools at the base of the Sierras that are considered critical plant and animal habitats. 
Nevertheless, those seeking the authentic soul of California could do worse than to pull off 99 at Selma, where this year's raisin glut seemed to fill the fragrant loaves at Dino's Bakery, or Kingsburg, founded by Swedish immigrants in the late 1800's, where breakfast includes Swedish pancakes with lingonberry sauce and shoppers are serenaded by Swedish music.
Nowhere is the "next" California more anticipated by some than in Merced County, where nearly 22 percent of families live below the poverty level, and winter unemployment is 11 percent to 18 percent. In the fall, ground was broken for the 10th campus of the University of California, the first since 1965, scheduled to open in 2004 with an eventual enrollment of 25,000. Today, downtown Merced is a place of hipness-in-waiting, where immigrants push ice cream carts past somnolent storefronts while a new Internet cafe serves an espresso drink called "the Hway 99."
The present-day highway, which bears about 50 percent more traffic than Interstate 5 and carries about 24,000 trucks a day, parallels and has subsumed portions of the original 99, a 20-foot-wide strip of pavement that connected small towns like Earlimart, Pixley, Tipton and Tulare. The towns were established in the late 19th century along the tracks of Central Pacific railroad.
The current highway, which still has fearsome cross-traffic in places, was built in stages from 1955 to 1997. The bright promise of postwar California is embodied in the spherical, now embattled Mammoth Orange -- not to be confused with the vanished Giant Orange or Whoa-Boy Orange -- the last relic of the era when motorists parched from long drives with no air-conditioning could stop for burgers and fresh-squeezed orange juice every 22 miles.
The Orange is in limbo, its highway access threatened by a proposed interchange. The "plight of the Orange" has been the subject of impassioned editorials in The Fresno Bee, and Representative George P. Radanovich has taken up its cause as a cultural landmark.
"It's beat up," said Doris Stiggins, the Orange's owner. "It's old. And people love it."
And so it is with Highway 99. A coalition led by Carol Whiteside, the former mayor of Modesto and president of the Great Valley Center, has formed to protect open space, control blight and lobby for federal highway scenic enhancement money.
Among the 99ers is Pete Bakker, a Modesto businessman, who became so disgusted with highway litter that he took a dump truck full of fliers plucked from 99 and elsewhere and dumped it at City Hall. He is financing a new $250,000 "Welcome to Modesto" arch for the freeway off-ramp. "We look like a hickville, to put it bluntly," Mr. Bakker said, echoing the grand tradition of highway boosters past.
Ms. Whiteside said one goal was to influence Caltrans' master plan to take into account the regions' nuances; for instance, "getting Caltrans to open up vistas so that when you cross a bridge you can actually see a river." Kiosks for travelers and roadside farmers markets are also being discussed.
"People don't value what they're sitting in the middle of," she said. "Paying attention will cause some things to change.'

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: The West; 
California Ups and Downs Ripple in the West

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Calif., Jan. 5 

 BODY:
Rafael Pineda barely feels California's economic pain.
 Mr. Pineda, 18, whose family emigrated from Mexico 11 years ago, has a job as a cashier at Bed Bath and Beyond in fast-growing San Bernardino County. He attends community college and sees a boundless future in the ministry or teaching. 
 "California is where you can make a name for yourself and make money and be successful in any area you want," he said during a lunch break recently. "I know the state has some problems now, but it can turn around in an instant." 
About 350 miles north in the San Francisco Bay Area where tens of thousands of refugees from the dot-com collapse have yet to pick up the pieces, the mood is decidedly darker. Just ask Gerrold Kaplan, an Internet pioneer who said he made and then lost most of $500 million when the dot-com bubble burst. 
"I like to joke that I used to be retired," he said mordantly. "Now I'm just unemployed. It's very relaxing." He has been out of work since 2001.
Mr. Pineda and Mr. Kaplan are in many ways emblematic. For California's is a tale of two economies.
Southern California, particularly the counties south and east of Los Angeles, is faring relatively well, with unemployment below the national average, personal income growth outpacing the nation and military contractors riding a wave of Pentagon and domestic security spending. The film industry set box-office records last year, and consumers took advantage of low interest rates to invest in new homes and automobiles.
But the San Francisco Bay Area remains mired in a technology slump, with skilled and formerly wealthy workers fleeing to find jobs elsewhere and analysts worried that it could be years before the next new thing revitalizes Silicon Valley.
"It's like two separate countries," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Wells Fargo bank. 
"For the time being," he said, "California will lag the U.S. economy, primarily because it's being dragged down by the Bay Area."
Viewed as a whole, California, which accounts for roughly one-seventh of the nation's total output, reflects the wobbly national economic picture. 
Employers are investing little and hiring less, waiting for the promised recovery that always seems to be six months away. Consumers, who propped up the economy through much of last year, are cooling off their credit cards. And the state's government, facing a $35 billion budget hole, is preparing to lay off thousands of workers, drastically cut spending and raise taxes.
As a result, Californians' fabled optimism has taken a sharp blow.
In early 2001, before the technology crash and the terrorist attacks, 70 percent of California residents said the state was enjoying good economic times. Eighteen months later, that view had turned upside down, with just 20 percent of Californians describing the state as prospering, according to a survey last fall by the Field Institute.

Ring of Gold
 The brightest spot in the state economy is the ring of fast-growing counties around Los Angeles where Mr. Pineda lives -- San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange and San Diego. Unemployment in these counties ranges from 4 to 5.5 percent, kept low by an expansion in retail and business services, along with the growth of biotechnology companies and a burst of spending on Pentagon research and development. The statewide unemployment rate is 6.4 percent.
But in Silicon Valley the news is bleak.
The technology industries in the Bay Area continue to shed jobs, with employment falling by 87,000 people last year. An estimated 40,000 people have left Silicon Valley in the past year in search of work elsewhere. Unemployment in precincts once seen as a model of the new, technological future, has jumped from less than 2 percent in 2000 to nearly 7 percent at the end of this year. In some areas, it is much worse.
"In my neighborhood, I would personally estimate that there's probably 40 percent unemployment among senior executives," said Mr. Kaplan, 50, who lives in Hillsborough, a wealthy enclave south of San Francisco. He has been out of work since his latest company, Egghead.com, crashed in 2001.
He tries to make light of the problems in his neighborhood, noting that there is a lot of managerial talent on the sidelines of his daughters' soccer league.
"One of the rituals of the league is that each team has a big banner with the names of the kids," Mr. Kaplan said. "These things have gotten distinctly better because the parents have so much time on their hands. They've become wonderful hand-embroidered pieces of folk art." 
His black humor does little to disguise the fact that the economic indicators for San Francisco and the area southward to San Jose are almost unrelievedly grim.
Housing prices have fallen, in some cases by as much as 25 percent over the past two years, but the median home price in the Bay Area is still $540,000. That leaves housing unaffordable to all but about 18 percent of residents. By contrast, 43 percent of working families in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties can afford an average home there, which costs less than $200,000.
Another measure of the Bay Area's distress is the acres of empty office space.
In early 2000, at the height of the technology boom, the vacancy rate was less than 2 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Today, the figure is approaching 20 percent. The value of commercial construction permits statewide fell 22.5 percent from October 2001 to October 2002.
No one knows when -- or if -- the turnaround will begin. "The Bay Area is waiting patiently for that tech bounce-back that may never come," said Edward Leamer, director of the Anderson Forecast at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It has priced itself out of virtually any other economic function."
He noted that technology operates in decade-long cycles and that the current slump could last until an innovation comes along to spark another boom -- perhaps in biotechnology or wireless communications. The personal computer, software and the Internet are now mature technologies, unlikely to reignite the region.

Spinoff Affects Neighbors
 California's huge economy -- it is the fifth or sixth largest in the world, either just ahead of or just behind France, depending on the exchange rate -- exerts a strong gravitational pull on neighboring states.
Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii all are heavily dependent on tourism and on California's market for their manufactured goods. When California suffers, they traditionally tend to suffer as well.
This time, however, California's troubles have had some benefits for Arizona, which offers potential employers lower wages, ample land, fewer taxes and less government regulation. And California's 35 million consumers are an easy drive away.
Officials from Arizona's Department of Commerce have actively sought to lure California businesses to locate or expand in Arizona, with some success. Michele Pino, director of economic development for the state, said 31 companies had moved operations from California to Arizona in the past three years.
One of those companies is Catalytica Energy Systems, a developer of low-emissions gas turbines for producing electrical power. The company is based in Mountain View, Calif., north of San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley. But when company officials decided to expand from research into production, they looked outside of California.
"The economic climate has changed a great deal in California," Megan Meloni, manager of investor relations for the company, said. "When we decided to move into commercial manufacturing, Phoenix offered a more cost-effective way to do that."
The new facility, in Gilbert, Ariz., went on line in early 2001, employing 34 people. Catalytica's headquarters and engineering departments remained in Mountain View.
Over all, Arizona has fared slightly better than the rest of the nation in the current slowdown, but only marginally. Statewide unemployment was 5.8 percent in November, compared with the national rate of 6 percent, but electronics and aerospace are adding jobs. 
Construction is soft because of overbuilding in the late 1990's; the office vacancy rate in Phoenix is higher than in San Francisco.
Nevada is recovering from a downturn in tourism that hit immediately after Sept. 11, 2001. Business travel remains soft. Tourism and gambling revenues are still down, but the number of visitors has been growing slowly as the fears of terrorism diminish.
"One reason for that is we get a significant amount of visitor traffic by car," said Keith Schwer, director of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas's center for business and economic research.
Mr. Schwer described Nevada as "muddling through" and hoping for a rebound in the second half of 2003. The only parts of the Nevada economy showing healthy growth are business and personal services and health care, which is not surprising because the state has become one of the nation's hottest retirement havens.
The greatest risks to Nevada's economy, Mr. Schwer said, are war with Iraq or another terrorist strike. "As we saw last year and during the first gulf war, that sets off a cocooning effect," he said. "People are afraid to travel and decide to stay home. We're still way off in foreign visitors."
Nevada also has serious state budget problems, with a deficit amounting to 10 percent of its annual spending. In the 1980's, Nevada cut homeowners' taxes and raised the state sales tax, making the state dependent on consumption by residents and visitors. That revenue has plunged over the last year and officials are looking for ways to come up with $800 million to balance the state budget over the next two years, Mr. Schwer said. 

The Hawaiian Response
 Hawaii, because of its heavy dependence on tourism, presents a particular challenge. The state has suffered a nearly decade-long slump, largely because of the protracted recession in Japan, whose free-spending tourists enriched Hawaii throughout the 1980's. As the tourists from Asia and the Americas have vacationed closer to home, residents of Hawaii have fled the islands in large numbers looking for work elsewhere.
Linda Lingle, the newly elected Republican governor of Hawaii, is trying to diversify the islands' economy and lure the refugees back.
Officially, unemployment in Hawaii is 4 percent. But Ms. Lingle said that number masked a deep economic malaise.
"More than 100,000 people left Hawaii in the 1990's for the mainland," she said in a telephone interview from Honolulu. "Many of the people who are still here are no longer looking for jobs, so they don't show up in the unemployment numbers."
Tourism generates a quarter of the state's income, but it is highly dependent on conditions across the water. Like Nevada, Hawaii experienced a steep drop in tourist arrivals after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The visitors are only now starting to come back, according to state statistics. The hotel occupancy rate fell from 76 percent in 2000 to 70 percent in 2001 and it is not expected to be much better in 2002. During the boom years in Japanese tourism in the mid-1980's, occupancy rates reached 80 percent and above.
But Ms. Lingle said the state had to diversify or forever be subjected to these sharp swings. She said that the island's unique environment offered opportunities to expand in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, astronomy, ocean sciences, filmmaking and renewable energy. She plans to ask the Legislature to approve tax credits and money to finance a new marine science center to induce businesses to expand in Hawaii.
She also hopes to loosen state regulation and to dismantle a culture of political cronyism -- a legacy of 40 years of Democratic rule -- which she said had put a stranglehold on growth.
"Hawaii has a reputation as a place where you have to know someone to get things done," she said. "We have to convince people we're changing and actually make those changes."

The Business of War
 While the possibility of war poses a threat to tourism-based economies like those of Hawaii and Nevada, it could benefit California's military and aerospace contractors.
The region's military complex suffered enormously a decade ago when the cold war ended, losing 137,000 high-paying jobs in California alone. The cuts caused a slump that lasted through the first half of the 1990's.
But the biggest defense buildup since the Reagan administration has given the weapons business new life. Projects such as the missile defense shield and the Joint Strike Fighter are expected to create jobs and pour billions of dollars into Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Boeing and scores of subcontractors.
"This spending could not have come to Southern California at a more opportune time," Mr. Sohn, the Wells Fargo economist, wrote recently. "Technology companies that were part of the dot-come boom are now switching gears to try and get a piece of the growing national defense pie."
Another staple of the California economy, agriculture, has been blessed and cursed with several good growing seasons. Production is up, but prices are falling for many commodity crops. Bulk wine grapes, for example, are selling for $65 a ton in the spot market, compared with more than $200 two years ago. The glut means great bargains at the supermarket for consumers, but growers are suffering.
"There is a blessed overabundance," Karen Ross, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, said. 
Ms. Ross said lower prices for grapes allowed California wineries to compete on more favorable terms with Australia, Chile and South Africa for low-shelf wine buyers, those looking for bottles in the $6 to $10 range.
The motion picture industry set a box office record last year, selling more than $9 billion worth of tickets. Television is enjoying a modest rebound in advertising revenue. Theme parks are struggling to attract visitors, but attendance is up compared with the immediate post-9/11 period.
One business that seems utterly immune to the vagaries of the broader economy is pornography, which is centered in the San Fernando Valley. It may be semi-subterranean, but it generates an estimated $4 billion to $10 billion a year and employs thousands of workers, rain or shine.
"Adult entertainment is doing well, from all we've heard," an economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, Jack Kyser, said. "You can't really measure it because state employment data captures only about a half to a quarter of people employed in the industry. So many of the people involved in that business are independent contractors."

Budget.com
 One of the great uncertainties in California as the new year begins is how state officials will address a budget shortfall of $35 billion over the next 18 months. The state has used most of the one-time gimmicks available to it -- like borrowing against payments under the nationwide settlement with tobacco companies -- and is now being forced to measure virtually every state operation for deep cuts.
California's fiscal distress is largely related to the steep drop in revenues from taxes on capital gains and stock options from the technology boom. The state's take from such taxes plunged from $17 billion in 2000 to less than $5 billion last year.
Mr. Kaplan, the Internet pioneer, said that at the peak of his earnings in the late 1990's he was paying the state more than $5 million a year in taxes. Now the state won't get a penny from him.
"My adjusted gross income this year is negative," he said. "I will pay no taxes, and rightfully so."
Businesses and consumers are bracing for tax increases to make up part of the shortfall, and some economists say they fear that higher taxes will make it harder for California, which already has a reputation as antibusiness, to attract new employers.
Yet despite all of the problems, millions still consider California a golden land. The state's population continues to grow at a rate of 1.5 percent a year through boom and bust, and entrepreneurs still fantasize about striking it rich in the mother lode of American markets. McDonald's was inspired by a hamburger stand in San Bernardino. Hewlett-Packard was born in a garage in Palo Alto.
Siua Taufa, 50, who moved here 25 years ago from the Pacific island of Tonga, is a supervisor in an Ontario distribution center for a women's clothing chain. His dream is to start a warehousing operation of his own, taking advantage of the rapid growth of the so-called Inland Empire east of Los Angeles and the area's close proximity to Mexico.
"I'm doing everything I can to survive, but I'm optimistic," Mr. Taufa said.
When asked if he thought California would soon emerge from its current slowdown, he looked briefly at his wife, Nandy, and said, "That's a very hard question to answer, but we're hoping for the best."

HEADLINE: Sterilization Offer to Addicts Reopens Ethics Issue 

BYLINE:  By CECILIA M. VEGA 

 BODY:
A flier hanging on a pole in Brooklyn looks, at first glance, as if it might offer a room for rent or a job. There are phone numbers, dollar signs and tabs for people to tear off and take with them.
 But the offer is intended for a specific group: drug-addicted men and women. "Get birth control, get cash," the flier reads. "If you are addicted to drugs and/or alcohol then this offer is for you." 
 While offers of birth control to drug addicts are common -- distribution of condoms in particular, as a means not only for birth control but also to stem the spread of AIDS -- this offer is much more radical. It offers men and women $200 to be sterilized or put on long-term birth control. 
The group making the offer, Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity, or Crack, contends that the program is a humane effort to keep children from being born to women ill-equipped to raise them. Critics counter that it is little more than a bribe to women to make an irreversible decision, and argue that counseling is the best method for both ending drug use and promoting responsible parenthood.
So far, the presence of the group in New York is minimal; it is based in California, and its only chapter here consists of a 27-year-old office worker from Brooklyn, who with the help of her husband and another volunteer has posted fliers across the city and held meetings with hospitals and community groups. But if Crack's reception in other cities is any indication, there is likely to be heated debate about the efficacy and the ethics of its offer.
"The program is fundamentally incompatible with a health care policy that respects a woman's right to choose," said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "It certainly raises policy concerns for government entities to be providing referrals to this program or endorsing it in any way."
The organization was started in Orange County, Calif., in 1997 by Barbara Harris, a housewife and former waitress, after she adopted four children from the same drug-addicted mother. Children born to drug addicts regularly suffer emotional scars and medical disabilities and end up in foster care at taxpayers' expense, she said.
"It's common sense," she said. "Why should a drug or alcohol addict get pregnant? I watched how my children suffered when I brought them home from the hospital, and no child should go through that."
Critics, however, say that Crack's stance is aimed not at helping children but at selective breeding. They point to comments like those Mrs. Harris made in 1998, when she was quoted in the British edition of Marie Claire magazine saying: "We don't allow dogs to breed. We spay them. We neuter them. We try to keep them from having unwanted puppies, and yet these women are literally having litters of children." The organization has softened its message, and now refers to itself as Project Prevention as often as it calls itself Crack.
But opponents say Crack's $200 offer misses the real issue, which is helping people get treatment for their addiction.
"What she's doing is suggesting there are certain neighborhoods where it is dangerous for some people to be reproducing," said Lynn Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women. "It suggests they are not worthy of reproducing. It is very much like the eugenics history in America. The Nazis said if you just sterilized the sick people and Jews you would improve the economy."
When it first started, Crack offered payments on a sliding scale, giving more money to women who chose tubal ligations and men who chose vasectomies than to those who chose long-term birth control like intrauterine devices, Norplant or Depo-Provera. 
But the criticism was so harsh that the group changed its policy and began offering a flat payment of $200. Women submit such documents as an arrest report or doctor's letter to prove they use drugs. They have the procedure done, usually paid for with government assistance, and then they send Crack written proof.
Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn has plans to refer patients recovering in the psychiatric emergency room to Crack, officials there said. The director of chemical dependency services at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn said he was reviewing the program.
Dr. Attilio Rizzo Jr., a social worker in Brookdale's psychiatric emergency room, said that the program was "a godsend" and that he had already referred one woman, who did not respond to his offer. "A lot of them are homeless and have H.I.V. and are on drugs and they don't want to have any more babies," Dr. Rizzo said. "I believe it's up to the individual to make that decision."
The program was introduced to the hospital by Asia Tepper, 27, a Brooklyn resident who heard about Crack on a radio program two years ago and volunteered to run its fledgling local chapter. She spends many evenings and weekends carrying a black bag filled with rolls of tape for the fliers and handouts on the organization and scouting out what she calls "prostitution-infected areas."
"To me it's about the children. That's it," she said. "It's about preventing a child from being born in what is not the best environment."
She said she had received favorable comments at police precinct stations and hospitals and from social workers. "They're being very, very helpful," she said.
But not everyone is lining up to support the program.
Dr. Van Dunn, the chief medical officer of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees hospitals in all five boroughs, said no hospital in his organization would have anything to do with Crack.
"It raises a lot of ethical questions about trying to pay women for sterilization," he said. "Reproductive choice should always be an option, and people shouldn't be paid. You provide family planning counseling and let them make their decision."
Across the country, reaction also has been mixed.
In the San Francisco area, opponents tore down Crack's signs; in Kansas City, billboard companies took down the group's messages after a public outcry. But since May, Crack volunteers in Albuquerque have met weekly with female inmates in the county jail, said Matthew Elwell, programs director for the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center. And last spring about 30 Crack billboards stood in Detroit, where Mrs. Harris was invited to speak to a predominately black church congregation of 5,000 people.
"I don't see the controversy," said the Rev. Charles H. Ellis III of the Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, where Mrs. Harris spoke. "People in the Betty Ford Clinic have some kind of support. In urban Detroit, a lot of time there is no support system."
Of the 833 women and 21 men nationwide who have been paid by Crack since its inception, 369 have been sterilized and the others have had long-term birth control, Mrs. Harris said.
Theresa Prautzsch, 24, an alcoholic who lives in a drug rehabilitation home in Niagara Falls, N.Y., accepted Crack's offer to get Depo-Provera birth control injections last year. 
"When you're using you don't think about a condom," she said. "The women are under the influence. I've seen the children that have been born on drugs, and I'd rather have them have their tubes tied than have those babies. If anything, it's the smartest thing they can do."

Soaring Plans, Somewhere Over Rainbow

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
IT doesn't happen often in proudly loud New York, but occasionally the city has one of those "the emperor's got no clothes" moments, when the obvious begs for notice, but the most influential keep mum or act as though the naked guy is wearing Armani.
 The naked ones in this instance are the nine architectural plans for rebuilding the World Trade Center site. The plans were made public with great fanfare last month by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and were instantly reproduced in glowing color, analyzed and subjected to instant polls and reprints. 
 The fanciful designs of gardens in the sky, reflecting pools and symbolic towers, are on display at the Winter Garden downtown, will be the subject of a public hearing next Monday, and have been generating more excitement than last year's race for governor. 
This would strongly suggest that one of those nine designs will be built. But since the days of government largess, what has been successfully built in New York City in the absence of a few essentials: sufficient financing, a viable market, prospective tenants and a developer championing his own design?
"They've created the wrong picture in the minds of the public, aspirations for something that isn't going to happen," said one prominent developer and planner. "The buildings they proposed are not commercially viable. Now they have to go from all those designs to the real issue, especially the street plan. What is it going to be?"
Before soaring towers come questions of zoning, sewer lines, height and bulk. Not the stuff of museumlike displays or instant CNN polls.
Alexander Garvin, the head of planning for the development corporation and a chief sponsor of the design exercise, said he thought it was clear that this was no competition. He then said that it was always possible one of the designs could be selected. But not quite.
"If we select a particular scheme to go forward, that is going to be adjusted to the real world," he explained in an interview. "No matter where we go, those schemes are going to have to be adjusted to reality." The designs "are illustrative," he added, drawing comparisons to the generation-long redevelopment of Times Square. 
For more than 20 years, there were false starts, discards, changes, delay after delay and multiple cancellations. Development succeeded only when the market made it economically viable. Government created site plans (an office tower here, a store there) and design guidelines (about size, building materials, signage); developers selected their own architects.(Larry A. Silverstein currently has the lease for the trade center site, but it is not clear if that will continue over time.) 
WOULDN'T developers look past these touted designs and select their own architects downtown? "That's very true," said Joseph J. Seymour, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. "I was wondering when that was going to come out." 
Mr. Seymour, echoing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's emphasis on transportation and infrastructure, sees a need to improve transportation downtown before anything else is even considered. "Should we have a Rockefeller Center-like development at the trade center site?" he asked. "If so, we need the Rockefeller family to put up the finances and develop it. But we know that is not going to happen. We're not in the real estate business anymore. There's a high vacancy rate in Lower Manhattan, and there is not a market for massive development at this time."
With the Port Authority and the development corporation on different wavelengths and with the one person who might square the circle -- Gov. George E. Pataki -- notably silent, it is hard to predict the fate of the nine designs. As soon as next month the two institutions will issue a land use plan -- guidelines about everything from transportation hubs to the possible restoration of the street grid and burial of West Street. The plan will also determine the scope of the memorial, selected separately. 
Then what? Presumably, the market will decide the timing and shape of both office and residential development, and developers and their architects will begin anew to determine the aesthetics for everything but gardens and public buildings.
Maybe the current nine-way round of design will turn out to be an audition. Maybe it will provide some inspiration. Maybe it will fade into the archives. But how nice if first, someone with enough authority to command the public's attention would concede that we are not now choosing the cut, shape or weave of the emperor's Armani.

You Think Traffic Is Jammed on the Belt Parkway? Take a Look at Aisle 9

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
Along the notoriously backed-up Belt Parkway, traffic is crazier than ever.
 Blame Exit 15, where an old eyesore, a 230-acre Brooklyn landfill, has been transformed into a $192 million shopping mall. With its own exit ramp and a lineup of retailers that includes Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Old Navy and the Home Depot, the Gateway Center has become a big-box retail wonderland. 
 Few will admit it without goading, but some shoppers say they can practically hear the stores' calling out to them, indeed forcing them off the Belt Parkway, right into the mall parking lot. 
It is that difficult to resist them, shoppers claim, and even harder to believe that Gateway, a sleek, sprawling suburban-style strip mall bigger than 10 football fields, is in East New York, a stretch of Brooklyn often considered better bypassed than visited.
"There was nothing here before," said Pete Confresi of Queens. "You wouldn't even bother to look. Now you can't get near the place some days. The traffic, it goes back as far as Exit 9 sometimes."
Only recently has Mr. Confresi come to view the mall and the traffic created by its arrival as good. When Gateway opened in September, Mr. Confresi said he mostly sat in traffic watching with a commuter's contempt as car after car made its way toward Exit 15.
He vowed he would not be sucked in.
On New Year's Eve, though, Mr. Confresi gave in, lured by the promise of cheap DVD's at Target.
"If you're driving out here on the Belt every day, you can't help but see the traffic it's getting," he said somewhat defensively, standing in Target's entertainment section, debating with his daughter Chloe, 12, and son Nick, 4, about whether to buy the 10 recordings they had selected.
"It's close to home, too," Mr. Confresi added. "It gets a little hard to resist the convenience."
Several of the mall's retailers say that type of thinking has so far kept the cash registers at Gateway humming. Just what that means in actual sales is unclear, since retailers avoid discussing specific numbers, but Gateway's typically packed parking lot and the crowded aisles of the stores themselves offer clear evidence of the mall's popularity.
"Being out here along the Belt has definitely been good to us," said John Zeoli, the manager of the Home Depot, now the chain's largest store in Brooklyn. "We're exceeding our sales goals, and we're seeing over 19,000 customers a week. They're coming from everywhere -- Crown Heights, Howard Beach, the Rockaways, Ridgewood."
Bari Fagin, a spokeswoman for Bed Bath & Beyond, said her company had been as surprised by the reception given to its first Brooklyn store as by the mall itself.
"Who would have thought this would have come out of the sand off the Belt Parkway?" said Ms. Fagin, a frequent traveler on the Belt Parkway who for years had watched the old landfill go undeveloped. "It's an exciting place to be. It's easy to look at, easy to access -- one-stop suburban-style shopping in an urban Brooklyn setting."
Around East New York, Gateway has become synonymous with more than just discount prices and pretty buildings: it is a place to find a job in a neighborhood where economic opportunities can be hard to come by.
As promised during Gateway's initial development, the project created about 1,700 jobs, the bulk of them filled by people from the neighborhood, said Glenn Goldstein, a senior vice president in charge of Gateway development for the Related Retail Corporation, the mall's developer.
The Home Depot, for example, hired 200 of its 248 employees from around East New York. And sales at the store have been so robust that an an extra 25 neighborhood residents have been added to the payroll, Mr. Zeoli said.
Tyrone Salazar, 33, an assistant manager at the store, said, "It's a good thing to be able to get a job right here in the neighborhood -- a job with benefits, not some mom and pop place way off in the city."
Along with the added jobs, the mall is expected to bring in $40 million in annual revenue for the city and state, based on a combination of income, real estate and sales taxes, Mr. Goldstein said.
"The more people that get off the Belt and come here, or to Target or one of the restaurants, that's another chance for another job to be created," Mr. Salazar said. "You give people here a chance to work, maybe you create a reason for things to happen all over East New York, not just out at Gateway."

HEADLINE: A Sturdy Survivor Gets Back to Work; 
Herculean Effort to Restore A Landmark Battered on 9/11

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The gaping holes in the tan-brick facade of the Verizon Building are still open to the ground zero void. The blasted steelwork is jacked up like a Rube Goldberg contraption. Only four tortured pieces of the 72-foot ornamental entranceway bronze work now exist. Such are the wounds inflicted by the crushing debris from not one, but three, neighboring buildings: the north and south towers of the World Trade Center, and 7 World Trade Center, which pancaked next door. 
 But the Verizon Building is very much alive. Enduring a daily chaos of cement mixers and the sparks from welders' arcs, the building at 140 West Street is again sending out dial tones to 34,000 customers. It is putting stockbrokers online. It is generating revenue. 
 It is doing so without the 1,700 office workers who have been relocated to other buildings. Aside from communications equipment, the Verizon Building is populated only by a temporary staff of construction engineers and the 250 hard hats who are toiling there to bring it all back. 
This seat-of-the-pants reconstruction of the landmark 32-story building could use a metaphor, and Dominic P. Veltri, Verizon's New York manager for design and construction, is ready to supply one. "What we're doing here is engineering on the fly," he said. "We're changing a flat tire on a bus going down the highway at 60 miles an hour." 
Some bus. For four decades, the landmark 1926 Art Deco building at the corner of Vesey Street was the headquarters of the New York Telephone Company. It is currently the most visible symbol of reconstruction efforts at ground zero. For thousands of tourists gawking at the building, the grievous damage, and the army of construction workers swarming to mend it, are a sobering reminder not only of the horrors of the terrorist attack but also of the heroic efforts to clear the rubble and bring back Lower Manhattan.
Beyond this, the construction effort is a boost for a company that was besieged by service-restoration complaints after the terrorist attack, and has subsequently battled the Communications Workers of America in an eye-blackening advertising war over job security.
That culminated when Verizon, citing cellular and cable competition and federal regulatory strictures, laid off more than 2,700 workers in New York and New Jersey last month, generating a Christmas blizzard of news media reports about the plight of the newly unemployed. 
To date, the reconstruction effort has not been affected by the fight with the union, although if picket lines materialize during contract negotiations next August, some construction workers may not cross. 
The repopulation of 140 West Street with some office workers is now scheduled to begin at the end of 2003, but the rebuilding could continue for years. 
So far, $70 million has been spent to stabilize the building, and the restoration is expected to cost at least $140 million more, only part of the $1.4 billion that Verizon is spending downtown to restore equipment and cables.
Since the day the building opened in 1926, it has been a beehive of both administrative and technical activity, and its design was considerably more than functional: it was intended to establish a presence, given the building's role as administrative headquarters and central office. 
Nevertheless, according to George Famulare, Verizon's manager of corporate real estate, "the building is a tank." Built with reinforced concrete and steel, its floors can hold 250 to 300 pounds per square foot, constructed to support the giant electromechanical switching assemblies that were replaced long ago by electronic alternatives. 
If that sturdiness accounted for its survival, the subsequent efforts to protect and restore 140 West Street have been nothing short of Homeric. Verizon lost two of its technicians, who were working above the crash zones, in the World Trade Center attack. None died in the Verizon Building. 
Mr. Famulare supervised the evacuation after seeing people jumping from the towers. He found himself trapped under his desk after the ceiling fell during the collapse of the south tower. Eventually he escaped through the cloud of ash and dust looking like "a white powdered doughnut," he recalls. Then he stayed to shut down crucial equipment. 
During the collapses, steel projectiles from the towers hit the Verizon building, sliced the mains and left water cascading into the building's five subbasements, filling the lowermost vaults like a swimming pool. A javelin of steel actually speared through the sidewalk concrete and lodged in the basement. The building's fuel oil tanks were submerged in water, then burst.
Up in the topmost subbasement, a pool of shin-deep water made unusable the miles of snaking phone cables (black for copper, orange for fiber optics) in the 250-foot-long, 60-foot-wide cable vault. At 10:21 p.m., the building's backup batteries ran out of power and the last call went through the switching equipment. 
Below, Subbasement B held much of the telephone company's historical records, memorabilia and antique equipment, which was damaged by the flood. It took two months to pump out 12 million gallons of water mixed with 40,000 gallons of petroleum. 
The building controlled 300,000 dial tone lines -- 35,000 of them in the twin towers themselves -- in a several-blocks-wide swath of Lower Manhattan stretching from the Hudson to the East River, affecting 20,000 residences and 14,000 businesses including the New York Stock Exchange. 
Also down and out were 4.5 million data circuits, including high-speed Internet lines and connections to brokerages, Lotto terminals and A.T.M.'s. 
"We deal with problems all the time -- hurricanes, floods, fires -- but this was an effort that had no parallel," said David A. Rosenzweig, vice president for northeast network operations. "It will never compare with what the police and firemen did, but our war was to restore service. For us, there was nothing else in the world." 
As the salvage work began, all of the damaged phone systems were bypassed. And so, waterlogged, crushed phone lines in the cable vault were cut with a chain saw. New cables were spliced in, then snaked out to the sidewalks; soon 140 West Street was festooned with above-ground replacement cables. 
Upstairs in the formerly sacrosanct, climate-controlled clean rooms that housed hundreds of telephone cabinets bearing computer switching cards, the walls had gone unimaginably missing; firefighters established their hoses there to fight the raging fire in 7 World Trade Center. 
Some of the once-cosseted switching cabinets were actually suspended in midair, open to the elements, hanging from the building only by their power cables. 
Service began to be restored three days after the terrorist attack. Ultimately, the workers brought back not just the infrastructure's "pots" but also the "pans": communications jargon for "plain old telephone service" and "pretty amazing new stuff," including high-speed T1 and T3 lines, multiplex connections (from electric to fiber optics) and digital cross-connect systems. 
"It was like the Frankenstein monster," Mr. Veltri said. "Slowly, it came back to life." Ultimately, workers installed 45 miles of fiber optic cable and 22 miles of copper cable. 
By the end of 2001, service was mostly restored, "though there were horror stories where people had problems into the next year," Mr. Rosenzweig said. 
Now, much of the 14 floors of damage to the south-facing wall has been refaced with custom-fabricated brick from Stone Creek, Ohio. Gone is the 7 World Trade Center debris that was stacked up to Verizon's fifth floor. 
Seven of the building's 23 elevators have been brought back. All 1,800 windows are being replaced. The restoration will ultimately require 520,000 facade bricks, 22,500 cinder blocks and 93 tons of structural steel. 
In the lobby, 15 linen-backed ceiling murals -- a flapper-era celebration of the history of communications also declared a landmark -- were damaged by burst water mains and firefighting efforts. Four need extensive repair; all need cleaning.
Some of the most challenging restoration is proceeding far from the building. In a three-story former tin-ceiling plant in Brooklyn, a bronze foundry is using a 5,000-year-old casting procedure -- the lost-wax method -- to painstakingly restore the building's intricate bronze detailing. 
There was damage to bronze at the main entrance on Washington Street, as well as to the decorations above the blown-out former retail storefronts, with their hand-rolled textured glass.
A vast fantastical bronze bas-relief of whales, pelicans and sea horses is being recast. "The molding process is sensitive enough to reproduce a fingerprint," said Bill Gold, president of the Excalibur Bronze Foundry, which also restored the bronze work in such landmarks as the main reading room of the New York Public Library.
Only four twisted chunks of the frieze -- heated and bent in the collapse of "seven," as ground-zero hard hats call 7 World Trade Center -- survived. The remainder is being copied from the building's undamaged western frieze. 
As the effort proceeds, new workers will have to be trained in the art of bronze restoration, but already the veterans take special pride in their labor. The job "has no precedent," said a welder at the foundry, Milton Osborne. But though he is helping to rebuild 140 West Street, he has never gone to see the building "because," he said, "of the emotion of it."

HEADLINE: Rightist Wins Presidency In Lithuania 

BYLINE:  Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, Monday, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Rolandas Paksas, a right-wing former prime minister, won a surprise victory in the Lithuanian presidential runoff election today, ousting Valdas Adamkus, the man who worked to get the country into NATO and the European Union. 
 With results of all the country's 2,015 polling stations counted, Mr. Paksas beat Mr. Adamkus 54.91 to 45.09 percent, according to provisional final results released by the election commission. 
 It said Mr. Paksas had received 776,764 and Mr. Adamkus 637,908 of the more than 1.3 million votes cast.
Mr. Paksas, 46, will be charged with seeing the country through to membership in both the European Union and NATO in 2004. He said he was committed to both goals.
"I am a sincere supporter of Lithuania's integration to NATO and the E.U. and have proved this in my political career," he said.
Mr. Adamkus conceded defeat tonight on Lithuanian television.
"I want to congratulate the future president," he said. "The background has been laid, and I do believe he will lead Lithuania on the same track."
Mr. Adamkus, a 76-year-old returnee from the United States, had been widely predicted to win after garnering 35 percent of the vote in the first round two weeks ago.
Analysts said Mr. Paksas won on the strength of well-focused campaigning against Mr. Adamkus's low-profile approach of stressing stability and foreign policy successes.
"Despite all this public optimism after invitations to NATO and E.U., we do have to accept that quite a big part of the Lithuanian population is not so happy," said Alvydas Lukosaitis, a political expert from the Vilnius Institute of International Relations and Political Science. "Paksas was carefully listening to this part of the population, and during the election campaign, he hit the bull's eye and was talking about the issues people wanted to hear: pensions, salaries, corruption."
The new president is scheduled to take office at the end of February.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Trenton: Incinerator Bailout Plan Scrapped 

BYLINE:  AP (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 The state has quietly scrapped a bailout plan for county incinerators, trash transfer stations and garbage dumps at risk of defaulting on loans. Gov. 
James E. McGreevey chose not to put the plan into effect by the Dec. 31 deadline because it would have added to the state's long-term debt, officials said. The plan would have allowed counties to refinance up to $1.1 billion in debt on trash facilities through a state agency, the Economic Development Authority, for lower interest payments. The state would then agree to pay off half the cost of these debts, a limit of $680 million over 30 years.

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Calls for a Monetary Policy Anchor 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor, Edward M. Gramlich, said on Saturday that monetary policy needed an "anchor" or long-term strategy, but he stopped short of joining some of his colleagues who have advocated formal inflation targets at the central bank. 
 Mr. 
Gramlich said a clear strategy would help the Fed react to economic problems like a surge in unemployment without unnerving financial markets. 
 "To earn this credibility the Fed should behave in a systematic way," he told the Allied Social Science Association. 
The Fed governor said the underpinning of any long-term strategy needed to be a focus on price stability, avoiding either inflation or its opposite, deflation. He cited different approaches to setting up a strategy that would earn credibility. 
One was flexible inflation targeting and another was the Taylor Rule, named for John Taylor, an economist who is now Treasury's foreign affairs point man. He conceived a method of setting interest rates based on inflation and the output gap. 
One of the newest members of the Fed's board of governors, Ben S. Bernanke, is a strong advocate of inflation targeting.
On Friday, another Fed official, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., also spoke in strong support of the practice. 
"Ultimately, high-quality monetary policy," Mr. Broaddus said, "is too important to be dependent on exceptional leadership alone, which after all cannot be guaranteed over the long pull."
"The progress in recent years needs to be institutionalized -- locked in -- in some manner," he said, referring to strides made under the current Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, in controlling inflation. 
Mr. Greenspan opposes that approach, as do some other members of the Fed board. Its opponents maintain that such a system would limit the Fed's flexibility.

HEADLINE: Debate on Bank of Japan Chief 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FUKUOKA, Japan, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
Japan's next central bank chief needs to set a goal to raise consumer prices as a four-year slide saps business growth here, a top ruling party official said today.
 "What we're facing now is an emergency situation," said Taku Yamasaki, the Liberal Democratic Party's secretary general. 
"We need someone with a strong personality, even if it's a little overbearing." 
 Mr. Yamasaki indicated that the government may pick a more compliant Bank of Japan governor to succeed Masaru Hayami, whose five-year term ends March 19. Toshihiko Fukui, a front-runner and former central bank deputy chief, may be too concerned about keeping the independence won by the central bank in 1998, Mr. Yamasaki said.
"We don't need to have an agreement with the Bank of Japan to set the target if we can communicate well," Mr. Yamasaki later said on Japanese television. "I want someone who can harmonize with us as a new Bank of Japan governor."
But an investor in Japan said that Mr. Yamasaki and other politicians may be losing sight of the more immediate problem of ballooning bad loans at Japan's private lenders.
"Tackling deflation is one goal," said the investor, Yukari Sato, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia. "But, ideally, the next B.O.J. governor will be someone who can cooperate on government efforts to accelerate bad loan disposal."
Japanese banks are struggling to wipe away bad loans that amounted to 52.4 trillion yen, or $437 billion, as of March 31, according to government figures. Japan is the world's second-largest economy after America.

HEADLINE: Museum Explores Capitalism's Feats and Follies 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
What would John D. Rockefeller say?
 In the basement of his Standard Oil Building, just steps from Wall Street, where the Museum of American Financial History celebrates the wonders of capitalism, an exhibit wall is papered with gaily colored stock certificates carrying names like Enron, WorldCom and ImClone Systems. 
 It's the dark side of the American dream. But the dot-com debacles and infamous bankruptcies of the infant millennium are as much part of the nation's financial heritage as scandals of the past and the stock market crash of 1929, says the museum, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. 
Exhibits about that Black October Friday that ushered in the Great Depression, and accouterments like the plunging ticker tape record, have long been the biggest draw of this low-profile and literally underground museum, in its 15th year at 28 Broadway, where Rockefeller first moved into a smaller building in 1883, on same the site where Alexander Hamilton's law office once stood.
But now, said Meg Ventrudo, the museum's historian and assistant director for exhibits and education, "people are more interested in the recent bankruptcies and scandals, because they have affected their own finances."
"People want to come when the market is bad as well as good, to see why it's on a downturn," she said. With investing now widely democratic, average Americans have a stake in the market and want to see how it works. "Wall Street and Main Street have met," Ms. Ventrudo said.
Some 35,000 visitors a year come to the museum, half of them schoolchildren. The museum was founded in 1988 by John E. Herzog, chairman of the Herzog Heine Geduld securities firm, and it now operates on an annual budget of nearly $1 million, painstakingly raised from benefactors. The suggested admission is $2.
"People think because we're a financial museum we have money," Ms. Ventrudo said.
The latest exhibition of one-share stock certificates, worth virtually nothing except to collectors, were donated by Scripophily.com, the Internet's largest buyer and seller of collectible stock and bond certificates. The hobby of collecting such nonredeemable paper is called Scripophily (pronounced skrih-POFF-a-lee). 
By way of historical perspective, an older certificate was mounted nearby. This one, a $1,000 bond, had been issued by Insull Utilities Investments. 
As an exhibit panel and a longer article in the museum's magazine, Financial History, explain, Samuel Insull, a British-born entrepreneur, had been Thomas Edison's private secretary in the 1880's and built his own huge Midwest electric utilities trust worth $2 billion by 1930 ($21.5 billion in today's dollars). But when the Depression hit and he was shunned by the New York banking establishment he had alienated, his interlocking pyramid of companies collapsed. He fled to Greece, was tried for embezzlement and fraud and was acquitted. His reputation ruined, he left for France, where he died of a heart attack on the Metro. In a final indignity, his wallet was stolen.
The stock certificates are on display until Feb. 28. Other exhibits now at the museum include one of the four remaining largest bills ever issued by the United States: a $100,000 gold note issued in 1934 and depicting Woodrow Wilson. It was used for monetary transfers between Federal Reserve banks. Until 1969 the government circulated bills in $10,000, $5,000, $1,000 and $500 denominations. Today the largest is only $100, largely to thwart money launderers.
Another exhibit displays an exquisite palette of high-denomination bills issued by other countries during periods of runaway inflation, including, from Germany between the world wars, a trillion-mark note.
But the most impressive and eloquent display may still be the Standard Oil Building itself, designed by Carrere & Hastings and Shreve, Lamb & Blake, and built from 1920 to 1928, a temple of capital so imposing it covered one of the largest lots in Lower Manhattan and towered over the skyline. 
The cavernous lobby is branded throughout with escutcheons of S.O., huge hanging lamps and a painted clock, its hands worked into an S and an O. High overhead, panels below the ceiling mark the symbolic places around the Standard Oil conference table where the directors sat. The northwest wall bears the name John D. Rockefeller.

HEADLINE: The Seven Dwarfs 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Way back in 1988, Republicans derided the open field of Democratic presidential candidates as "the Seven Dwarfs." Any group of politicians taking on a sitting president must come to grips with the stature gap: the chief executive dominating the news from the Oval Office, Rose Garden or the commanding heights of Camp David seems larger than life.
 The president as candidate can be brought down to size, as Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter and George Bush the elder have shown. That is why conservatives should resist the urge to characterize the many Democratic hopefuls these days as so many clowns climbing out of a tiny circus car. 
 I fell into that trap last week by directing an old New York put-down at freshman Senator John Edwards, calling him "light enough to do a tap dance on a charlotte russe."
This not only drew e-mail from boomers unfamiliar with airy desserts ("Who was Charlotte Russe?"), but also a packet from an aide of the senator enclosing a file of serious, substantive speeches made recently by the former North Carolina personal injury lawyer.
I am duty-bound to read and weigh these speeches, as well as position papers and public stands of other candidates as they come down the exploratory-committee chute. You can learn a lot by reading speeches: they tell you what the candidate really thinks, or what he thinks he should appear to think, or how adept he is at attracting and being able to pay for good thinkers, pollsters and writers. I'll study those respectfully before asking to see him. 
Meanwhile, it's instructive to watch Edwards develop the presentation of his persona on television. Last year on NBC's "Meet the Press" he projected profound shallowness, recalling Bill Clinton's dismal performance at a convention before he got the hang of captivating an audience. But yesterday on ABC's "This Week," Edwards swung the other way. He was overly rehearsed, with tightly organized pitches substituting for direct answers. He seemed programmed to use the selling words "strong" and "leadership." 
Because Edwards is (a) the Democratic candidate from the South, (b) willing to criticize unscrupulous trial lawyers who make up part of his financial base, (c) free to decide on running for re-election in North Carolina after any loss in the New Hampshire primary and (d) able to give lessons in slickness to Willie himself, this "fresh face" could be our next president, in the event of military disaster and major depression.
Senator John Kerry, contrariwise, has legislative experience, wartime heroism and antiwar activism going for him. What he lacks in charisma he makes up in heft, and he could drag Massachusetts into the Democratic column. Kerry gives thoughtful answers that do not lend themselves to sound bites, which makes him the tortoise to Edwards's hare. 
Both Kerry and Edwards are yes-but on Iraq, the defining issue of the pre-election year. Tom Daschle, though he voted right on the Iraq resolution and is not yet a stale face, is a more reluctant warrior. Dick Gephardt, and soon-to-announce Joe Lieberman, are the modern-day Scoop Jacksons, and that liberal hawk was never able to get the Democratic nomination. 
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont is the Gene McCarthy dove ("clean for Dean") and would gain by catastrophe. Similarly, if homeland security failed, Gary Hart would be the Comeback Kid. Al Sharpton, running to take the place of Jesse Jackson in mobilizing blacks, will be the most deferred-to candidate in seven-man TV debates no matter what he says.
Strange as it seems, one of these guys will be the Democratic candidate. By smiting the others in early primaries, he will emerge as media giant, gaining momentum by promising to tax only the rich and to bring a new prosperity without war. 
But what if, against all odds, the early primaries are inconclusive? What if stature eludes all? Al Gore, well regarded for speaking out all year with no political motive, would be draftable. Or, against all plans for the timing of the Restoration in 2008, the desperate party convention could turn to Hillary Clinton for salvation in 2004. 
Partisans on left and right would love that. And what a campaign Bush II vs. Clinton II would be. The Seven Dwarfs would have found their Snow White.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
An Invisible Aide Leaves Fingerprints

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Josh Bolten is the White House aide you've never heard of who has his fingerprints all over President Bush's new $600 billion economic plan, the legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security and just about every other domestic policy concocted in his powerful little corner deep in the West Wing.
 Mr. Bolten, 48, once made a lot of money working for Goldman Sachs and grew up in northwest Washington as the son of a Central Intelligence Agency officer who worked in the directorate of operations, the agency's covert espionage arm. Perhaps taking a lesson from his father, he declined to be interviewed for this article, saying he liked his life undercover. 
 Still, Mr. Bolten can't hide his revealing title -- White House deputy chief of staff for policy -- and a growing reputation as the hub of the administration's domestic agenda, which is increasingly set by a small handful of West Wing aides under the command of Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, and Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff.
"You can't point to a lot of things and say this was the inspiration of Josh Bolten and Josh Bolten alone," said Mr. Rove. "But you could to every piece of policy and see his fingerprints on the process. He's got a very agile mind where he's thinking through, 'What would a president want to know?' "
Mr. Bolten's job description sounds inside-the-Beltway boring -- to coordinate the ideas coming out of two competing White House entities, the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic Council, but it is the crux of his power. As a result of this role, Mr. Bolten is the one who oversees the 45 minutes that Mr. Bush has scheduled for "policy time" on most days the president is in Washington.
Mr. Bolten is in charge of parceling out those precious minutes, usually in the afternoons. He decides what is discussed, when it is to be discussed and who is invited. If it is to be an education topic, Mr. Bolten includes Education Secretary Rod Paige as well as Margaret Spellings, the president's chief education adviser. If policy time is to focus on the economy, Mr. Bolten makes sure to invite Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the president's budget director.
But tellingly, at least in a town where presidential face time is power, Mr. Bolten always attends, no matter the topic. So do Mr. Card, Mr. Rove and Nicholas E. Calio, the departing White House liaison with Congress. Vice President Dick Cheney has a standing invitation, as do Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, and Dan Bartlett, the communications director.
"I really view him as underrated in the outside world," Mr. Bartlett said of Mr. Bolten, "but highly valued inside the West Wing." 
Mr. Bolten's beliefs about the economy and other domestic policies are a mystery, as is the substance of any advice he gives to the president. Like any dutiful White House aide, he would readily say that Mr. Bush's views are his own. But at Goldman Sachs, the investment banking firm where he worked for nearly six years in the 1990's, Mr. Bolten was considered a pragmatist who liked tax cuts, and not a supply-side true believer, as are many of the economists who have influenced Mr. Bush's economic programs.
"He's one of those people, though, who is on message and loyal to a fault," said Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Bolten worked for a short time as Mr. Corzine's chief of staff at Goldman Sachs, but spent most of his time based in London, as the firm's chief lobbyist at the European Union's headquarters in Brussels. 
At the White House, Mr. Bolten is known for his calm disposition -- "I'd use the word 'sweet' if it didn't make me look odd," Mr. Rove said -- as well as his long hours. Although Mr. Bolten manages to arrive at an early-bird White House barely in time for the 7:30 a.m. senior staff meeting, he often stays until midnight. But these days Mr. Bolten has a girlfriend, and Mr. Rove reports that "he's gotten better about going out to dinner and trying to have a reasonable life."
Mr. Bolten, who was the issues director of Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, graduated from St. Albans, the exclusive private boys' school in Washington, and Princeton and Stanford Law School. On Hanukkah, he brought in dreidels and gold chocolate coins for the entire senior staff. 
"He's the explainer of all things Jewish to the White House," Mr. Rove said.
Mr. Bolten owns a house in Key West, Fla., which his mother inhabits for months at a time, bought back in his Goldman Sachs days. (Mr. Bolten's most recent financial disclosure form lists assets of as much as $4 million, which pales compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars that senior people like Mr. Corzine made at the firm. But Mr. Bolten was not a Goldman managing director, and he was not at the firm when it went public.)
When Mr. Bolten was growing up, he was instructed to tell his friends that his father worked at the Defense Department, not the C.I.A. He owns two motorcycles, a Harley-Davidson and a Victory. Also, he recently grew a beard, an unusual act in the Bush White House, and he likes to bowl.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
U.S. in No Rush Over North Korea's Food Aid

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
For months, President Bush has pledged not to use food as a weapon against North Korea. But as the confrontation deepens over the North's nuclear weapons program, the United States has continued to withhold the approval of grain shipments sought by relief groups to avert starvation in North Korea.
 The World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations, says the suspension of food aid by the United States and Japan, and severe cutbacks by South Korea, have meant that, for the first time in years, it will miss its food distribution goals in North Korea this winter "by a wide margin." 
 "We're very concerned about it," said a World Food Program official. "We understand that there are political considerations. But this is a population that is suffering, with women and children the most vulnerable." 
The Bush administration says it has been withholding food, not to pressure North Korea, but because of lapses in the system for monitoring where the food is distributed.
"Our intention is to go forward, but we do need to solve these monitoring problems first," said an administration official. He added that food could not be distributed until Congress approved the State Department budget for the program, in the next month or two.
But World Food Program officials say they have "no hard evidence" that food intended for starving Korean civilians has been diverted to the military. "We have relatively good confidence that the food is reaching the people who need it," one program official said.
Whatever the reasons, the food crisis has thrust itself into the middle of urgent meetings by the United States and North Korea's neighbors -- Russia, China, South Korea and Japan -- on how to handle North Korea's recent decision to reactivate its nuclear weapons program.
American, Japanese and South Korean officials are to meet in Washington on Monday to determine the next steps, including whether to reach out to North Korea to head off its nuclear weapons buildup, and if so, by what means, and whether to tighten or ease economic pressure on North Korea.
Today, Russian officials offered to serve as mediators in the standoff with North Korea. "The Russians said they would try their best to use their channel to North Korea," said South Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kim Hang Kyung, who met with the Russian Foreign Ministry's top Asia expert, Aleksandr Losyukov, and other senior Russian officials in Moscow. "They will talk to North Korea and discuss" a peaceful end to the crisis, he said.
On Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency is to meet to discuss what to do about North Korea's move last month to dismantle the inspections equipment at its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, where weapons-grade plutonium has been manufactured and possibly used to make two nuclear weapons.
Agency inspectors were ejected from North Korea last week, increasing anxiety throughout the West and complicating the Bush administration's efforts to mobilize a worldwide coalition against Iraq, whose nuclear weapons program is considered far less advanced than North Korea's.
The three-way talks in Washington have been roiled, in part, by the political transition in South Korea, with President Kim Dae Jung preparing to yield power next month to Roh Moo Hyun.
Both men are strong advocates of engagement with North Korea. Indeed, in the last few days, Mr. Roh's advisers have begun floating ideas about how to break the impasse that has arisen over the American policy of not negotiating with North Korea until it disavows its nuclear program. Mr. Roh has called for just such negotiations.
One of Mr. Roh's transition advisers said last week that the president-elect wanted the United States to go along with a proposal by North Korea that the United States commit itself to a nonaggression pact with the North, as part of a deal in which North Korea would back away from its nuclear program.
In Washington, Bush administration officials say they have not rejected this idea out of hand. Mr. Bush, they noted, has repeatedly declared that the United States has no intention of attacking North Korea. Therefore, they said, some sort of an agreement of nonaggression might well be part of an eventual deal on weapons.
"The new guys in South Korea want to introduce some new ideas, and that's not unhealthy," said an administration official.
"But we can't get caught making concessions to get them to meet the commitments they've already made," he added, referring to North Korea. 
The official pointed to the 1994 agreement by North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, which the United States discovered last summer had been violated by North Korea for several years. 
As for the food aid, diplomats say the United States will be urged to avoid a new round of pressure on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, who has not emphasized that issue.
Although South Korea has reduced its own food aid to the North, officials in Seoul criticized the Bush administration for forcing other nations to go along with its demand for a cutoff of fuel shipments to North Korea last year, even though the shipments had been arranged as part of the 1994 agreement, now broken.
Until this winter, the United States has supplied 20 to 30 percent of the food provided by the World Food Program to North Korea. Since the mid-1990's, this has amounted to 1.7 million tons, or $600 million worth, a program official said.
But this year the total appeal for North Korea is 512,000 tons. The United States has withheld its support for this appeal, as has Japan, which cut off food aid last year because of anger over North Korea's acknowledgment that it had abducted several Japanese citizens during the cold war.
South Korea has also cut back its supplies because of rising tensions with the North, the World Food Program official said. About 80,000 tons is needed immediately to avert starvation, the official said.
The official said the program itself had long been concerned about monitoring supplies, which was why it has increased its international staff to 39 from just one in 1995. 
The program's policy, officials say, is to distribute food only in those parts of North Korea where monitors are allowed to ensure that the right people receive it. Food is not distributed in the roughly 20 percent of the country where monitors are barred, apparently because of North Korea's security concerns. "We have always had a policy of 'no access, no food' even though there are hungry people in areas we cannot enter," the program official said.
Many other decisions must be faced by Washington and its allies. For example, although the United States has persuaded other countries to stop oil shipments, the Korean Energy Development Organization, or KEDO, which was set up to send the fuel, remains intact. 
The organization, made up of the United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union, must also decide early this year whether to proceed with plans to help North Korea generate energy by building two light-water nuclear reactors whose spent fuel cannot easily be converted into bombs.
"We've got to decide what KEDO does about further deliveries of equipment and construction materials," said an administration official. Once again, there is disagreement among the partners, with South Korea fearing that the American desire for a cutoff will only provoke North Korea further.
Another issue that may be confronted this week in Washington is how to approach North Korea -- whether one of the nations in the region should make contact in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, or whether this should be done through North Korea's mission at the United Nations, or whether a different country or person should serve as an intermediary.
"We know that plenty of people have contacts with North Korea," said an administration official. "The first thing that has to be conveyed is a consistent message."

U.S. Preparing Plan For Iraq After Hussein
President Bush's national security team is assembling final plans for administering and democratizing Iraq after the expected ouster of Saddam Hussein. They will call for a heavy American military presence in the country, military trials of the senior Iraqi leaders, and a quick takeover of the country's oil fields to pay for reconstruction. A1

U.N. weapons inspectors confined thousands of people at a sprawling government research complex, including the Iraqi ambassador to the U.N., for almost six hours.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE WHITE HOUSE; 
U.S. IS COMPLETING PLAN TO PROMOTE A DEMOCRATIC IRAQ

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush's national security team is assembling final plans for administering and democratizing Iraq after the expected ouster of Saddam Hussein. Those plans call for a heavy American military presence in the country for at least 18 months, military trials of only the most senior Iraqi leaders and quick takeover of the country's oil fields to pay for reconstruction.
 The proposals, according to administration officials who have been developing them for several months, have been discussed informally with Mr. Bush in considerable detail. They would amount to the most ambitious American effort to administer a country since the occupations of Japan and Germany at the end of World War II. With Mr. Bush's return here this afternoon, his principal foreign policy advisers are expected to shape the final details in White House meetings and then formally present them to the president. 
 Many elements of the plans are highly classified, and some are still being debated as Mr. Bush's team tries to allay concerns that the United States would seek to be a colonial power in Iraq. But the broad outlines show the enormous complexity of the task in months ahead, and point to some of the difficulties that would follow even a swift and successful removal of Mr. Hussein from power, including these: 
*Though Mr. Bush came to office expressing distaste for using the military for what he called nation building, the Pentagon is preparing for at least a year and a half of military control of Iraq, with forces that would keep the peace, hunt down Mr. Hussein's top leaders and weapons of mass destruction and, in the words of one of Mr. Bush's senior advisers, "keep the country whole." 
*A civilian administrator -- perhaps designated by the United Nations -- would run the country's economy, rebuild its schools and political institutions, and administer aid programs. Placing those powers in nonmilitary hands, administration officials hope, will quell Arab concerns that a military commander would wield the kind of unchallenged authority that Gen. Douglas MacArthur exercised as supreme commander in Japan.
*Only "key" senior officials of the Hussein government "would need to be removed and called to account," according to an administration document summarizing plans for war trials. People in the Iraqi hierarchy who help bring down the government may be offered leniency.
*The administration plan says, "Government elements closely identified with Saddam's regime, such as the revolutionary courts or the special security organization, will be eliminated, but much of the rest of the government will be reformed and kept."
*While publicly saying Iraqi oil would remain what one senior official calls "the patrimony of the Iraqi people," the administration is debating how to protect oil fields during the conflict and how an occupied Iraq would be represented in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, if at all. 
*After long debate, especially between the Pentagon and the State Department, the White House has rejected for now the idea of creating a provisional government before any invasion.
Officials involved in the planning caution that no matter how detailed their plans, many crucial decisions would have to be made on the ground in Iraq. So for now they have focused on legal precedents -- including an examination of the legal basis for taking control of the country at all -- and a study of past successes and failures in nation building, reaching back to the American administration of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War. 
The plans presented to Mr. Bush will include several contingencies that depend heavily, officials say, on how Mr. Hussein leaves power. "So much rides on the conflict itself, if it becomes a conflict, and on how the conflict starts and how the conflict ends," one of Mr. Bush's top advisers said. 
Much also depends on whether the arriving American troops would be welcomed or shot at, and the Central Intelligence Agency has been drawing up scenarios that range from a friendly occupation to a hostile one.
Yet under all of the possibilities, the American military would remain the central player in running the country for some time. The Pentagon has warned that it would take at least a year to be certain that all of Mr. Hussein's weapons stores were destroyed.
Notably, the administration's written description of its goals include these two objectives: "preserve Iraq as a unitary state, with its territorial integrity intact," and "prevent unhelpful outside interference, military or nonmilitary," apparently a warning to neighboring countries.
Administration officials insist American forces would not stay in Iraq a day longer than is necessary to stabilize the country.
"I don't think we're talking about months," one of Mr. Bush's top advisers said of the planned occupation. "But I don't think we're talking a lot of years, either."

The Command
Military Joined With Civilian
When administration officials first began publicly discussing the idea of an American military administration for Iraq, the reaction in the Arab world was swift: The Arabs wanted no American Caesar in Iraq, no symbol of a colonial governor. "The last thing we need," a senior official said, in an allusion to General MacArthur, "is someone walking around with a corncob pipe, telling Iraqis how to form a government."
As a result, the steering group on Iraq policy is now discussing a hybrid command with an American military commander in charge of security and some kind of civilian administrator -- of theoretically equal influence -- to get the schools running, the oil fields pumping and the economy jump-started. It is not clear whether that administrator would be an American or if the United Nations would take the lead in that part of the operation.
It is widely assumed that in the first chaotic months, the military commander will have unquestioned authority. "Remember, you will have decapitated the command and control for the Iraqi military forces," a senior official said. "Who is going to make sure that score-settling does not break out, that there is not fights between the various ethnic communities? It is going to have to be the U.S. military for some period of time, and if there is a military command, there will certainly be a military commander."
But the handover of more and more responsibility from the military administration to an international civilian administration -- and several years down the road to an Iraqi-run government -- is still murky. Officials, referring to the ruling Baath Party, say "de-Baathification" of the nation will be at least as complex as de-Nazification was in Germany.
"We know one thing," said a diplomat involved in the planning. "Things will have to come together a lot faster than they have in Afghanistan."

The Oil
Protecting It For the Iraqis
There is no more delicate question for the administration than how to deal with Iraq's oil reserves -- the world's second largest, behind Saudi Arabia's -- and how to raise money from oil sales for rebuilding without prompting charges that control of oil, not disarming Iraq, is Mr. Bush's true aim.
Administration officials have been careful always to talk about Iraqi oil as the property of the Iraqi people. But in the White House, the major concern is that Mr. Hussein may plan to destroy the oil infrastructure in the first days of any war, while trying to make it appear as if the destruction was the work of American forces.
"What happens if he started systematically destroying the fields?" a senior official said. "It's a big source of concern, and we are trying to take account of it as we plan how to use our military forces."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, speaking on Dec. 29, hinted at such a military plan when he said, "If coalition forces go into those oil fields, we would want to protect those fields and make sure that they are used to benefit the people of Iraq, and are not destroyed or damaged by a failing regime on the way out the door."
The White House has already concluded that the United Nations' oil-for-food program, under which Iraq is permitted to sell a limited amount of oil to buy civilian goods, will have to be amended quickly so oil revenues can be used more broadly in the country. But it is unclear how the administration plans to finesse the question of Iraq's role in OPEC and who would represent occupied Iraq at the organization's meetings.
The administration is already anticipating that neighboring Arab nations may accuse occupied Iraq of pumping oil beyond OPEC quotas. One official said Washington "fully expects" that the United States will be suspected of undermining the oil organization, and it is working on strategies, which he would not describe, to allay those fears.

The Leadership
Planning Both Trials And Incentives
Mr. Bush has been warning since October that Iraqi generals who obeyed any orders to use chemical or biological weapons against American troops would be punished, perhaps as war criminals.
Now, as part of the effort to undermine Mr. Hussein's government and get evidence that has so far eluded United Nations inspectors, the White House is putting a slightly different spin on that kind of talk.
Those who have helped build Mr. Hussein's weapons stockpile, officials say, may win some redemption by helping inspectors -- and American forces.
That approach appears to be part of a strategy to encourage a coup and persuade military leaders and scientists to give up the country's chemical and biological stockpiles and its nuclear research efforts. "The politics of Iraq are so opaque that it's just hard to know what is or isn't rumbling under the surface," one of Mr. Bush's most senior advisers say. As a result, the president is looking to create "maximum pressure" on the top leadership.
Already the C.I.A. and others have drawn up lists of Mr. Hussein's top command and the heads of his security forces who would probably be put on trial.
One State Department working group is studying a kind of "truth and reconciliation" process, modeled after the one in South Africa, which could publicly shame, but not necessarily punish, human rights violators.

The Transition
No to Installing Provisional Rulers
Few issues have divided the administration more bitterly than how to create a transitional Iraqi government that could serve as a bridge between the American military occupation and a permanent, democratic government. The issue reflects the administration's ideological fault lines, and in recent months Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, has stepped in, as one senior aide said, "to make sure there was not a public food fight on this one."
White House officials say that those divisions have now been resolved, and that while planning is going forward, the United States will not overtly install a provisional government or designate its leaders.
The division was a familiar one. Senior civilian officials in the Pentagon and some advisers to Vice President Dick Cheney argued for the creation of a provisional government even before Baghdad falls. It would be led, at least initially, by Iraqi exiles. The proponents argue that such a government in exile would speed creation of a permanent government if Mr. Hussein is removed, allowing United States forces to withdraw sooner. Among the reported advocates were Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who wants the military's role to be brief.
"The quicker you get a transition from military victory to transitional government, the better," a senior Pentagon official said. "We want to be there as long as necessary, but as short as possible."
On the other side of the debate are advocates of giving more power to Iraqis now living in Iraq. These advocates, mainly in the State Department and C.I.A., say the Iraqi exiles have no legitimacy among the Iraqi people. One proposal favored by State Department officials calls for having an international civilian agency, advised by Iraqis and protected by allied peacekeeping forces, run the nation while Iraqis elect local governments, create a new constitution and eventually select a national legislature, somewhat along the postwar model of Afghanistan.
The White House has tried to finesse those differences by saying it favors a government formed by "free Iraqis" both inside and outside Iraq. 
But inside the Pentagon there are doubts. "The argument that you have to leave seats at the table for people inside Iraq has one problem: there is no one inside," said a senior official who supports the Iraqi National Congress. 
An official close to Mr. Bush acknowledged that "there are not a lot of free Iraqis inside Iraq." Pausing, he added, "But there will be."

HEADLINE: BUSH BUDGET PLAN WOULD ELIMINATE TAX ON DIVIDENDS 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush will propose eliminating taxes on corporate dividends paid to shareholders, a measure that could cost the government $300 billion over 10 years and would be far bolder than some of his advisers had been suggesting, administration officials said today.
 Until a few days ago, administration officials had suggested cutting dividend taxes in half. By Friday, they said the reduction would be bigger. Today they confirmed that Mr. Bush would propose eliminating the dividend tax entirely. Rather than phase in the change, a White House official said, Mr. Bush will propose making it effective immediately. 
 The move will be the centerpiece of what is now a $600 billion package that is aimed at spurring economic growth, but it would also create much bigger budget deficits for the future. 
Supporters of the idea say it will correct a major distortion in the tax system, which is that dividends are taxed twice -- once at the corporate level as profits and a second time as dividend income to shareholders.
But even before Mr. Bush describes his proposal in a speech in Chicago on Tuesday, Democrats stepped up their accusations today that his plan would benefit the very wealthiest and ignore the needs of middle-income families.
"When they direct their tax programs to benefit the very, very, very few and eliminate the majority from any benefit of these tax cuts, it is class war," said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate's assistant Democratic leader, on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
Eliminating dividend taxes, administration officials contend, would greatly increase the value of corporate profits and should lead to an increase in stock market valuations.
Many economists predict that the plan will help stock prices, but say they are skeptical that it will do much to increase business investment or consumer spending in the short term. 
In addition to excluding dividend taxes, the proposal seeks to speed up rate reductions scheduled to take hold in 2004 and 2006 and is likely to include added tax breaks to stimulate investment by corporations, White House officials said. 
White House officials said today that much of Mr. Bush's plan would be "front-loaded," with a disproportionate share of the tax cuts and new spending coming in the first year.
The package is likely to include an extension of federal unemployment benefits; an immediate increase in the child care tax credit; a more rapid reduction in the so-called marriage penalty for two-income households; and new money for state governments.
Administration officials are hoping that a full elimination of taxes on the dividends that shareholders are paid by corporations will give the stock market a powerful lift and shore up confidence. The decision was first reported by Time magazine's online edition. 
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has suggested that the move could lift stock prices by 20 percent. 
Even enthusiastic supporters were surprised by Mr. Bush's plan. "I am surprised and happy," said Kevin Hasset, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group here. "This will provide a lot of juice to the market."
But many economists said they were dubious about the impact on either business investment or consumer spending. The proposal would give shareholders more money, but probably not until they submitted their taxes in 2004. And corporations would not save any tax money.
Partly for those reasons, business groups have not pushed for lower taxes on dividends. But now, faced with Mr. Bush's determination, business lobbyists say they are behind him.
"The animal spirits of business have been depressed," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "There is no question but that the impact of this on confidence will be immediate. The first thing that chief executives do when they get up in the morning is check the price of their stock."
Though many details of the plan remained unclear tonight, tax analysts said several kinds of tax reductions would inherently hit sooner rather than later.
An increase in the child care tax credit, to $1,000 from $600, would be one quick option. Another would be to expand last year's big "bonus depreciation" for corporations, a temporary tax break that allows companies to write off 30 percent of their investment in certain kinds of equipment in their first year. 
Regardless of the fine print, the tax plan would lead to higher budget deficits at a time when the possibility of a war against Iraq could add tens of billions in extra costs.
Even without new tax cuts, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the government's shortfall this year will be $145 billion. The new tax cuts could easily push the deficit to more than $200 billion, and a war in Iraq could send it higher still. White House officials say the deficit would still be modest in relation to the overall economy, and pose much less danger than the prospect of slower growth.
Mr. Bush is apt to face little difficulty with his plan in the House of Representatives, where Republicans are in the majority and have a strong grip on the legislative process.
He faces more difficulty in the Senate, where Republicans have a tiny majority but not enough votes to override a Democratic filibuster.
"It doesn't matter how good the policy is if you can't get it through," said Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
Mr. Grassley, a moderate Republican who prides himself on winning support from Democrats, said a dividend tax cut would have to be accompanied by measures like a bigger child care tax credit that affect middle-income taxpayers.
Mr. Grassley said the most important question for him was not any particular proposal by Mr. Bush, but rather his willingness to be flexible in the forthcoming political battles.
Politically, the biggest issue is almost certain to be the question of fairness. Analysts have estimated that more than half the tax benefit of eliminating dividend taxes would flow to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers.
Democratic lawmakers are already accusing Mr. Bush of looking out only for the rich, but even a few Republicans are nervous.
"I think it's very important that we give low-income Americans a break," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
Mr. McCain noted that he had voted against Mr. Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 because it was "too tilted" to the rich. "If that's continued, obviously then I wouldn't support that," he said.
Some of the more combative Republicans in Congress said the analysts' statistics were a red herring, because many middle-income and lower-income people do not pay any federal income taxes.
"You've got to start out with the fact that about 37 percent of the people in this country don't pay federal income taxes," said Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the third-ranked Republican in the Senate. "When you start out that the top two-thirds of the people in this country are the folks who pay taxes," Mr. Santorum said on "Fox News Sunday," "those are the folks you're going to have to give tax cuts to."

HEADLINE: Bear Stearns And City Hall At an Impasse On Tax Breaks 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The city's effort to persuade Bear, Stearns & Company to keep 1,500 employees in Brooklyn has turned into a standoff with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg refusing the investment bank's demand for a new round of tax breaks and Bear Stearns mulling a proposal from its current landlord.
 Bear Stearns claims that its occupancy costs at the MetroTech Center in downtown Brooklyn will skyrocket when its lease expires in 2004. So it has threatened to move the workers to less expensive space in New Jersey, unless the city provides a subsidy package to move them to Lower Manhattan. 
 But in a Dec. 18 meeting with Bear Stearns executives at their headquarters on Madison Avenue, Mayor Bloomberg said the city would not go beyond the agreement it struck in 1997 to provide the company with $75 million in tax breaks and other incentives in return for its remaining in the city, building a new headquarters on Madison Avenue and promising to add thousands of new jobs.
Bear Stearns's latest demand for tax incentives and other subsidies, the third since 1991, has prompted criticism from urban planners and budget watchdogs of corporate retention deals in general, and the 1997 Bear Stearns agreement in particular. 
"There's something wrong with these retention deals if companies can take hundreds of jobs to New Jersey and still be in compliance," said Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research organization.
"Over the years," Mr. Bowles said, "Bear has played New York against New Jersey admirably. They've gotten tax breaks from both states and they'll continue to play both states against each other until this ridiculous border war ends."
Mayor Bloomberg has expressed misgivings about retention deals and Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff has said that the administration is, with few exceptions, opposed to paying companies to stay in New York.
As did his predecessors, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani often agreed to provide tax breaks, cheap electricity and other incentives to Bear Stearns and other major New York companies that threatened to relocate some or all of their employees. Fearing the decimation of New York's financial services industry, city officials argued that they had to give in or risk losing jobs to New Jersey and Connecticut.
As early as 1987, Mayor Edward I. Koch gave $235 million in incentives to Chase Manhattan Bank after it threatened to move workers to the suburbs.
The practice continued under Mayor David N. Dinkins in the early 1990's, and strikingly increased under Mayor Giuliani, whose administration struck deals providing more than $2 billion in benefits to more than 50 companies, including Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston, Travelers and The New York Times.
Retention deals became so prevalent, according to real estate experts and former city officials, that top executives routinely demanded the same tax breaks that their competitors were getting, whether or not they intended to move out of the city.
Critics have argued that the retention deals ultimately shift the tax burden from large corporations to small and midsize companies and deprive the city coffers of scarce revenues that could be used to improve mass transit and schools.
The incentives are not large enough, they argue, to persuade a company to stay once it has made an economic decision to move employees outside the city.
"The deals are not a factor in a company's business location decisions," said Brian Backstrom, president of Change-NY, an antitax group. "The idea of sustained economic development should involve making the entire metropolitan region as competitive as possible, not selecting favorites in a high-stakes game."
In 1991, Bear Stearns said it was considering moving 1,500 employees to Whippany, N.J., where the bank had bought a 68-acre office park. Mayor Dinkins granted the company a $36 million incentive package after it agreed to move the workers to Brooklyn instead and to keep at least 3,100 employees in New York City.
So it was something of a surprise on Aug. 27, 1997, when Mayor Giuliani and James E. Cayne, then vice chairman of Bear Stearns, announced a new $75 million deal at a City Hall news conference. Mr. Cayne said at the time that he was building a new headquarters on Madison Avenue and was not threatening to leave the city. For his part, Mr. Giuliani described it as a landmark deal ensuring that Bear Stearns would keep at least 5,700 employees in New York for the next 50 years. The $75 million included $30 million in benefits the company would get if it added up to 13,300 jobs during those 50 years.
The deal was also unusual, current and former city officials said, because it was put together very quickly and without the lengthy and often torturous negotiations that accompany these kinds of transactions. Some officials and critics also questioned the involvement of Fred Wilpon, a Bear Stearns director and the owner of the New York Mets, and Randy Levine, a former labor negotiator for Major League Baseball who was then the deputy mayor for economic development.
The day before the news conference, Bear Stearns signed a lease with the owners of the Madison Avenue property to build what would become an $850 million tower. Later that afternoon, Deputy Mayor Levine told Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, to meet with William J. Montgoris, chief operating officer of Bear Stearns, and Mr. Wilpon, at Shea Stadium.
Mr. Wilpon said that Mr. Levine, who was still a consultant for Major League Baseball, was not part of the negotiations, although current and former city officials and a Bear Stearns executive said that Mr. Levine talked by telephone with Mr. Millard at the stadium. Mr. Montgoris and Mr. Wilpon pushed for a larger package than the city initially offered. In the end, the bank got $45 million for its existing employees and up to $30 million in tax breaks for new jobs.
"Before anything was agreed upon," recalled a Bear Stearns executive who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, "Millard talked to him."
A 1997 ruling by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board had barred Mr. Levine from dealing with officials of Major League Baseball or the Yankees and the Mets, but apparently did not prohibit him from having contact with Mr. Wilpon when the Mets owner was acting on behalf of Bear Stearns.
"This deal was consistent with all previous corporate retention transactions for companies that were going to construct new buildings and create new jobs," Mr. Levine said in an interview Friday. He said that it was recommended by the Economic Development Corporation and approved by "everybody in the administration."
"Any revisionist history now occurring is obviously meant as a distraction for these parties who now have their own issues," he said.
However, a review of city documents indicates that Bear Stearns did not formally apply for the benefits package until Sept. 4, a week after the news conference. Indeed, there is not a single memo or letter about the deal before that date. The two sides did bargain for months over the details and the proposed penalties, before the city's Industrial Development Agency formally approved the deal in December 1997. "It was not a cakewalk," said Leonard Boxer, the lawyer who represented Bear Stearns.
Last summer, Bear Stearns executives approached the Bloomberg administration asking the city to provide tax breaks to move its 1,500 employees at MetroTech Center to Lower Manhattan. The investment company complained that it was facing a sharp increase in both rent and taxes at MetroTech, and could save as much as $40 million by going to New Jersey.
But city officials, knowing that Bear Stearns was given financial incentives to move jobs to Brooklyn a decade ago, were reluctant to provide additional subsidies for the company to move them back to Manhattan, no matter how beleaguered the downtown area was after the attack on the World Trade Center.
Some city officials contend that Bear Stearns is reneging on its promises, a claim the bank disputes, arguing that the 1991 deal as well as its Brooklyn lease expire next year. The bank has earned an estimated $100 million in fees from the city and the state for underwriting work over the past three years related to $19.4 billion in bonds, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.
"We have fulfilled all of our obligations under our agreements with the city," said Elizabeth Ventura, a spokeswoman for Bear Stearns. "Bear Stearns served as a pioneer at MetroTech and has been key to its overall success. We hope that it will be financially viable and competitive so that we can stay."
Under the 1997 deal, Bear Stearns, because of the size of its current payroll, will incur only modest penalties if it moves fewer than 1,000 employees out of the city. But if the company's New York City payroll falls below 5,187, it will be required to pay back twice the benefits it has received to date, which would amount to about $50 million.
"We're optimistic that Bear Stearns will keep its employees in New York City," said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg. "But I can't comment on any discussions taking place."

HEADLINE: Thousands March at Rites for 2 Slain in Clashes in Venezuela 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
The streets of this capital, turned into a battleground 48 hours ago, became the scene of a mass funeral procession today as thousands of supporters of President Hugo Chavez denounced the violence stemming from a monthlong strike aimed at forcing the president from power.
 The marchers, led by the vice president and several other high-level government officials, escorted the coffins of two men who were killed on Friday in clashes between government opponents and pro-Chavez groups. 
 Relatives of the dead said both victims were staunch supporters of Mr. Chavez, a former paratrooper who rose to power four years ago on promises to serve as a champion for the poor. 
One of the dead, Oscar Gomez Aponte, 24, was a security guard at the Education Ministry. The other, Jairo Gregorio Moran, 33, made and sold jewelry. He had two children.
Pallbearers wearing red berets, a signature of Mr. Chavez's supporters, carried the coffins from a funeral home to the gates of the luxury hotel where officials from the Organization of American States have struggled for weeks to negotiate a settlement to the political conflict that fueled the violence last week and threatens to push the nation in to anarchy. They chanted for peace and justice. Many chanted for vengeance.
"If things keep going like this, then we will be at civil war," said Elvira Becerra, Mr. Moran's sister. "How many people have to die before the fighting ends?"
For nearly six weeks, government opponents, backed by most of the country's private television stations and newspapers, have staged a nationwide strike to demand that Mr. Chavez resign and call early elections.
The opposition charges that the president's changes have plunged the country into recession and undermined democracy. They also charge that President Chavez intends to install a Cuban-style government. The strike has shut most businesses and the state-owned oil company, the engine of the nation's economy and a chief supplier to the United States.
The violence on Friday came during an anti-Chavez protest. It continued on Saturday night, when funeral services for the dead were interrupted by gunfire.
"I am a loyal member of the president's party," said Ramiro Gomez, father of the slain security guard. "I ask him and the opposition to do everything they can to find a solution to this situation. I want my son to be the last death in this conflict."
The march today came as leaders on both sides assessed and hardened their positions at what would normally be the end of the holiday season and a return to work and classes. 
On Saturday, leaders of seven unions representing about 250,000 teachers declared that they would join the strike. 
Bank workers, who have kept most branches open for at least three hours each business day, threatened a full walkout as well.
Small groups of government opponents protested on Saturday night outside businesses and restaurants that have reopened since the start of the strike. 
Dozens of customers at one supermarket held up business on Saturday afternoon until management agreed not to charge taxes on their purchases.
"If we want a normal country and a decent life, all of us have to join the fight," said Carlos Fernandez, president of the main national business organization, Fedecamaras. "But it is not worth much to stay at home and watch the marches on television. We must go out."
Meanwhile, President Chavez said after the violence on Friday that he was considering declaring a state of emergency. Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel charged that officers of the metropolitan police, controlled by a bitter opponent of Mr. Chavez, were responsible for the two killings and said federal officials might move to take control of the police.
On Saturday, government officials announced the firing of some 250 managers at the state-run oil company. They pledged to normalize oil production with the help of experts from countries including Brazil, Mexico, Algeria and Trinidad and Tobago.

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: BERND HEINRICH; 
Signs of Survival In a Frozen Forest

BYLINE:  By JAMES GORMAN 

DATELINE: NEAR MOUNT BLUE STATE PARK, Me. 

 BODY:
Bernd Heinrich is standing within sight of his cabin at the edge of the woods, examining a winterberry bush full of bright red berries. For years he was puzzled because he never saw any creatures eating the berries. Then, one late fall day a few years ago, he watched a flock of robins descend on the bush and pick it clean. 
 Asked if the berries are poisonous to people, he says, "I don't think so," and pops one in his mouth. He chews for a moment. Then he starts spitting. "But I wouldn't eat them." 
 Dr. Heinrich, a biologist at the University of Vermont, likes his knowledge firsthand. Are winter berries good to eat? Try them. How comfortable is a beaver lodge in winter? Crawl in and check it out. How many seeds can a chipmunk carry in its cheeks? Find one dead on the road and start stuffing it with sunflower seeds. (The answer is at least 60 in each cheek.) 
How much fuel does a gold-crowned kinglet, weighing about a fifth of an ounce, need to keep its small internal furnace stoked so that it can survive 30-below nights? Try heating and cooling a couple dead ones, with and without feathers, and calculate the energy lost. 
Dr. Heinrich grew up in Maine from the time he was 10, tramping the woods with his father, who collected insects for himself and birds and other creatures for museums, and with a neighbor, who taught him to hunt deer. For a time he ended up studying bioenergetics (how animals fuel their lives) in the laboratory. One result was "Bumblebee Economics," the first of his eight books. 
The time in the woods had left an indelible impact, however. He says he "imprinted" on the Maine forest. In 1974, he bought 300 acres a couple of hours north of Portland. It was on this land that he built a cabin and studied ravens, setting out carcasses for them, hiding in blinds, getting to know individual birds. The resulting books, "Ravens in Winter" and "The Mind of the Raven," are among his most popular. 
It is on this land -- he insists that it be described only as near Mount Blue State Park -- that he teaches winter ecology to about 10 University of Vermont students a year. They camp for a week in his cabin, taking field trips in his woods. This work inspired his latest book, "Winter World: The Ingenuity of Animal Survival," published this month by Ecco. It is this land he is tramping. 
He was attracted to his new subject because of the challenge winter presents to a variety of creatures. "I'm interested in problems," he says, "and how animals solve problems." It is not a purely intellectual interest, he admits. "A lot of times you've got to experience it. When I read about a little bird in the woods that can stand the cold, it really doesn't mean that much until I'm actually out there myself."
He has spent much time in these woods in the last 25 years, studying them. Knowledge, he says, changes the way people see a place and what they look for. "If I didn't know anything, I think it would be difficult for me to even want to go out," he says. "I know -- well, I might find a squirrel there. Will I see a weasel track there, will the deer be there, might there be a moose there, is the woodpecker going to be working on that tree again? It's all these different things that bring me out."
What first drew him to study a forest was hunting. "Hunting is one way of connecting, especially before I was intellectually involved," he says. "Now I don't need that, but I still like to go out deer hunting." 
Dr. Heinrich constantly interrupts himself to note deer tracks: "These are kind of spread apart. That's more typical of bucks and the size is big too, so I'm pretty sure that this is a really nice sized buck."
Bucks are bigger and broader than does, he said, and they walk with a kind of swagger. He swings his legs around in illustration -- a biologist mimicking a deer impersonating John Wayne. "This one is going a little faster," he says. And then, "This one here is jumping, making big jumps."
At one point he glimpses a deer as it bounds off, and he hurries through brush to follow the tracks to a spot where the snow has been roughed up. Pointing at the ground, he says: "He stood right here. That's where he turned around. He was watching us the whole time we were down there."
Tracks are not the only signs of life. They are simply the most obvious. Dr. Heinrich pays equal attention to the smaller clues. What looks like a bump on a twig no bigger than a winterberry is actually a mass of 50 to 100 tent caterpillar eggs, overwintering in a hardened lump formed of foam exuded when the eggs are laid. The foam acts like quick-drying cement and the eggs are preserved by natural antifreeze. "The eggs are somewhere around 30 to 40 percent glycerol," Dr. Heinrich says. "They are just pickled with that stuff."
There are hints everywhere of animals feeding. The tops of saplings are snipped off about six feet above ground. Moose. Just above stomach level something has been scraping away the bark of red maple, through the cambium, down to the wood. Moose again, using their bottom incisors as chisels and scraping upward. Dr. Heinrich says the animals do not like sugar maple. "My students have a hard time telling the difference between a sugar maple and a red maple," he says. "I tell them, if there's a moose feeding on it, it's a red maple."
Low stumps served as perches for red squirrels as they took apart red spruce cones to get at the seeds within. The bracts of the cones, or their scale-like leaves, are scattered around the stumps like sunflower seed shells in a baseball dugout.
"This is porcupine," Dr. Heinrich says, pointing to a place on a hemlock where porcupines had stripped off bark and twigs. He indicates a rusty bit of barbed wire, the end of which is embedded in a stump. "This is human," he says. "This was a pasture not too long ago."
He stops to point to a fleeing snowshoe hare, and to deer tracks full of snowfleas (not fleas at all but springtails, another sort of insect), to moose scat and to two fleeing moose. The wind is strong but chickadees call above it, and a raucous blue jay once, and then another call. 
"There's a raven," he says. "You hear the hee-yah, hee-yah, hee-yah. This is about the only place you hear a raven make that sound. They have a very distinct dialect; I don't ever hear that in Vermont. This might be my friend Goliath, who nests over behind the cabin, but I can't be certain about that."
At one point a faint peep comes from the trees. Dr. Heinrich says it is probably a gold-crowned kinglet. The kinglet is perhaps the central character of his new book, because its survival is so improbable. It must feed unceasingly all day before finding a way, perhaps through some kind of torpor, perhaps by finding some kind of shelter, to last until the next day.
But until Dr. Heinrich shot 10 kinglets -- over the course of three winters -- and examined their stomach contents, no one had known what exactly the birds were eating in the winter woods. It turned out they were eating the larvae of geometrid moths, inchworms, which were attached to the twigs of sugar maples and other trees, and frozen solid when it was cold enough. 
In order to identify the species of moth, Dr. Heinrich tried for several years running to raise caterpillars gathered by slamming the trunks of trees with a big stick and collecting what fell. Eventually he succeeded, and a specialist, Dr. Douglas Ferguson of the Smithsonian, identified it as Hypagyrtis unipunctata, known as the variant moth because of the variety of markings.
This story is recounted in "Winter World" along with many, many others. Animals, as he makes clear, take every imaginable approach to staying alive in the cold. Some hibernate like bears and chipmunks. Others run themselves ragged all winter like red squirrels and kinglets. Beavers store up food and spend the winter sealed into their houses with entries under the ice. Turtles, air breathing animals, spend months in the mud without taking a breath.
There is even an insect, a woolly caterpillar living at the northern limit of its range, within 100 miles of the North Pole, that freezes solid winter after winter. Because it has so little time in the arctic summer to eat, it may take it more than a dozen years of foraging and freezing solid, foraging and freezing solid, to be ready for metamorphosis. The adult moths, he writes, "mate, lay eggs, and die a few days later." 
Reading his books, it is sometimes hard to know which impulse is stronger, the curiosity of the scientist and naturalist, or the writer's need to tell the story. Near the end of the walk, approaching his cabin, Dr. Heinrich leaps for a low branch and scrambles 30 feet up a tree to check a bird box he had placed there. 
Next, he stops to point out how red squirrels do maple sugaring. Their methods are much like people's, he said. "The squirrels go from tree to tree, biting," he says, "making a single bite, and then leaving. Just biting, leaving, biting, leaving, biting, leaving." Sap runs from the small wounds and evaporates, leaving concentrated sugar. Then, he says, "the squirrels came back to visit all the trees and eat up all the sugar." 
The behavior had not been recorded, as far as he knew, in scientific literature, so he published it in The Journal of Mammalogy.
That was the end of the scientific research, but not of the story. This trick of winter survival may not have been in the scientific literature, but it had been noticed by others who observant of winter survival. 
"As it turned out," he says, "according to legend, Indian legend, an Indian boy discovered about maple syrup by watching a red squirrel. Of course, we learned how to do it from the Iroquois," he smiles, "but they learned from the red squirrels."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Jan. 7 about the ways animals survive in winter included an erroneous statistic from the book "Winter World: The Ingenuity of Animal Survival," by Bernd Heinrich, for the northern limit of a type of woolly caterpillar. It is 450 miles from the North Pole, not 100 miles.

 BODY:
Attack of the Frogs
At the Battle of Bunker Hill, legend has it, the rebel troops didn't fire until they saw the whites of the British soldiers' eyes.
 For the bright-thighed poison frog of South America, apparently, things are a bit more complicated. Males of the species will attack other males that invade their territory, but according to new research, two things have to happen. A frog defending its turf must hear the invader's call, and at the same time must see a pouch of skin under the jaw, called a vocal sac, expand. Without those two simultaneous signals, the frog won't attack. 
 Researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Vienna conducted experiments in which they observed how frogs responded to a fake invader. This model was painted to look like the real thing and was equipped with a rubber vocal sac that could be inflated on cue. The researchers placed the fake frog on an imitation log containing speakers through which they piped in simulated frog calls.
As reported in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, real frogs approached the speakers when calls were made but the vocal sac was not inflated. When the sac was inflated but the calls were turned off, the frogs had no response at all. But when inflation occurred at the same time as calls, the frogs attacked their fake brethren.
The researchers say their results show that, as with many other species, these frogs can integrate more than one kind of signal -- aural as well as visual -- in communication.

Catapulting Horses
The key to speed for a football player, particularly for a hulking 300-pound lineman, is in the footwork. The legs may be powerful, but it's the feet that really have to move quickly, planting, pushing and lifting over and over again.
What applies to a football player applies to a horse too -- perhaps even more so, as a horse has more weight to lug around (and spindlier legs).
Scientists have never determined exactly how a galloping horse gets its feet up and out of the way quickly, ready to plant them again in a split second. The horse's muscles act too slowly and produce too little power to lift the legs directly.
Now, however, researchers in Britain have figured out how a horse does it. Writing in the journal Nature, they describe what in effect is a catapult action of the horse's leg that lifts it out of the way during trotting and galloping.
In a catapult, energy is stored slowly and then released suddenly. In the classic version, the energy is stored in a twisted rope. In the horse version, it is stored in the bicep muscle between the shoulder and elbow. This muscle is slowly "cocked" as the horse's leg pushes forward, its foot on the ground. 
At the same time, the lower part of the leg is extended, its muscles and ligaments in tension as well. When the leg moves forward past a certain point, however, the situation becomes unstable. The leg first bends at the knee, setting off the catapult -- releasing the tension on the bicep, which quickly jerks the bending leg up off the ground.

A Salty Moon
The Moon may not be made of cheese, but Jupiter's moon Io, it turns out, is made of salt -- at least a little bit of it. 
That's the conclusion of astronomers from the Observatoire de Paris and other institutions that took spectral readings using a radio telescope in Spain. Their findings, reported in Nature, are that Io's atmosphere contains about 0.3 percent vaporous sodium chloride.
The salt vapor is found only in patches, indicating it is emitted by volcanoes. (Io is the most volcanic object in the solar system.)
The finding helps to explain what had seemed an odd discovery when it was made 30 years ago -- that Io was surrounded by a cloud of sodium ions -- and a more recent discovery of a doughnut-shaped track in Io's orbital path that contains chlorine ions.

HEADLINE: For Retired Chimps, A Life of Leisure 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. 

 BODY:
The chimpanzees at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center were acting up.
 Jessie, a pink-faced 20-year-old, slapped her ample belly and hooted wildly from behind a steel gate. Dover, a mischievous 4-year-old, spied an unfamiliar human and served up his standard greeting for strangers, a fistful of feces, pitched with remarkable accuracy. 
 Jessie and Dover do not really have to be at Yerkes, but there is nowhere else for them to go. Bred for biomedical research, they are now unemployed, a result of a vast surplus of laboratory chimpanzees. They pass their days in small steel-and-concrete enclosures, playing with burlap bags and shredding old telephone books for entertainment. 
But there may be better times ahead for these great apes and hundreds of their captive kin. Acting on a mandate from Congress, the National Institutes of Health announced last year that it would spend $24 million to help build and operate a chimpanzee sanctuary, in essence, a taxpayer-supported retirement home for research chimps.
"It's a good moment for chimps, a very good moment," said Dr. Frans de Waal, a Yerkes primatologist who is on the board of Chimp Haven, the organization that received the contract for the sanctuary. "If we are not going to use them for biomedical studies, let's move them to a situation that is attractive to the chimps for retirement."
Of the 1,600 laboratory chimps in the United States, N.I.H. officials estimate that more than 400 are not involved in experiments. Chimp Haven, which officials hope to open in 2004, will be on 200 acres of donated land near Shreveport, La. It may eventually be home to up to 300 chimps. Others may retire to a private sanctuary in Florida. 
Some scientists, however, including Dr. Stuart Zola, the Yerkes director, fear that the federal government is setting a bad precedent by giving its imprimatur to the retirement concept.
"I see the retirement community idea as simply another ploy by the animal rights community to reach their eventual goal of abolishing the use of animals in research," Dr. Zola said. "I'm not opposed to it. But I think it is being driven by an animal rights point of view."
Advocates for animal rights are angry because the legislation that authorized the sanctuary included a provision permitting the animals to be returned to laboratories in a public health emergency.
"They cannot call a place a sanctuary if what it really is is a holding pen for when they need the chimps the next time," said Holly Hazard, executive director of the Doris Day Animal League, a lobbying group in Washington. Still, Ms. Hazard said, "Any day the chimps have enjoying the sunshine is one day more than before."
The surplus is an unexpected legacy of AIDS. In the early days of the epidemic, scientists theorized that the chimp would be a useful model to study the disease in people.
In 1986, the health institutes began an aggressive breeding program that doubled the laboratory chimp population, only to find that although chimpanzees could contract the AIDS virus, they rarely became sick from it.
That distinction makes it hard to use the animals to test treatments or vaccines.
With their striking genetic similarity to people -- chimps and humans share the same blood types, and their DNA is more than 98 percent identical -- the apes are attractive to scientists. The vaccine for hepatitis B, for instance, was developed in chimps, and they are still used to study hepatitis C and malaria, among other diseases.
Moreover, Dr. Zola said, the scientists who mapped the human genome are now planning to do the same for chimpanzees, an effort that may make the apes even more valuable to science. "They may provide us with very important information," he said, "about what makes us human."
The similarities have also created a growing sentiment, even among scientists, that chimps, the only great apes still used in medical research in the United States, should not be treated like other lab animals.
In 1997, a panel of scientific experts said reducing the chimp population by euthanizing excess apes would be unethical. Citing the genetic similarities, the experts said the government had "a moral responsibility" for chimpanzees' long-term care. The report prompted Congress, in 2000, to pass the law that led to the sanctuary.
"They are animals that have powerful emotions and powerful intellects, and it is really quite inhumane to keep them contained in little enclosures," said Representative James C. Greenwood, the Republican of Pennsylvania who sponsored the bill. The sanctuary, Mr. Greenwood said, will allow the chimps to "feel comfortable and socialize as repayment for all the service they have rendered to science."
With life spans of 50 years or more, some chimps may outlive the scientists who do research on them.
Big and strong, they are expensive to maintain. Yerkes, which has 174 chimps at three locations, budgets $500,000 a year for their care.
In addition to housing and veterinary care, the apes also need activities. Federal regulations demand "enrichment programs" for captive primates, whether or not they are used for experiments. At Yerkes and elsewhere, experts say, television is a favorite entertainment.
"There are some that like soap operas," said Dr. Linda Brent, a behavioral researcher and director of enrichment at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio. "I knew one named Sammy. He liked to watch Barney. Sometimes, they like shows like Jerry Springer, because it looks like the people are fighting. They like the action."
In 1993, while completing a doctoral dissertation on the development of infant chimpanzees, Dr. Brent visited Gombe National Park, near Kigoma, Tanzania, where Dr. Jane Goodall has studied chimps for more than 40 years. "It was a life-changing experience," she said. 
Two years later, Dr. Brent founded Chimp Haven.
Relocating the chimps will not be easy, she added. Chimps reared apart will have to be carefully introduced to one another, a process that could take months. "Biohazardous" apes, those that carry infectious diseases, will be the last to move. 
Nearly all research chimps in this country were born in captivity. Dr. Brent said she intended to push the labs to quickly retire the remaining apes born in the wild. She hopes they will pass on their knowledge to chimps born in captivity.
"We'd like to see them in a place where they can use their smarts," she said. "They know how to build nests. They know how to search for termites. They know the things they need to do to live in the wild. I think we have a really unique opportunity to help the chimps become chimps again."
Although the Chimp Haven sanctuary will be the only one with taxpayer support, it will not be the first of its kind.
Three years ago, the Center for Captive Chimpanzee Care opened a sanctuary on 190 acres near Fort Pierce, Fla., with 20 former Air Force chimps that were descendants of the "chimponauts" that flew into space in the 1950's.
"I've never worked with chimps more screwy, more altered, more disturbed than these chimps," the director of the center, Dr. Carole Noon, said. "Each one came in with some kind of crazy behavior."
In September, the center took over a colony of 266 chimps and 61 monkeys that had been maintained by the Coulston Foundation, a private laboratory in Alamagordo, N.M., whose checkered history included citations by federal animal welfare officials for mistreatment of chimpanzees. Eventually, Dr. Noon said, she hopes to retire the Coulston apes to Florida.
At Yerkes, the nation's oldest primate center, about 100 chimpanzees, including nine infected with the AIDS virus, live in the biomedical research compound in Atlanta, which is off-limits to reporters. An additional 20 are in New Iberia, La., and 55 are here in Lawrenceville, at a 117-acre field station where Dr. de Waal studies their social behavior.
The 40 or so apes in his studies are clearly the more fortunate ones. They live in two separate spacious outdoor yards, each with playground equipment for swinging and climbing. On a fall morning, they lolled about in the sun, grooming and picking nits from one another's fur. Dr. de Waal, who studies how chimps fight and reconcile, has been teaching them to use a joystick to identify pictures on a computer screen.
Jessie and Dover, however, are not part of the behavioral research, and despite their unemployment, they are not likely to be among the first Yerkes chimps to relocate; Dr. Zola, the Yerkes director, said the New Iberia chimps will probably move first. While Dr. Zola said he would love to build similar large outdoor enclosures for Jesse, Dover and other unemployed apes, the hard reality is that he has neither the space nor the money to do it. 
Of their current living situation, he said, "It isn't optimal."

HEADLINE: Jazzmen Pay Homage To Catalonia; 
Barcelona Embraces American Musicians Building Careers

BYLINE:  By BEN RATLIFF 

DATELINE: BARCELONA 

 BODY:
If you're a young jazz musician in New York, you can scrape by on sideman gigs, weddings, private students and if you're lucky, writing music for advertising. Or you can come here. 
 This is where the lodging is affordable, and even if your wallet is thin, what you will eat for dinner becomes a matter of typically Catalan seriousness. Haute-bourgeois professionals and bohemian students alike seem ready for challenging music, and an average weeknight out, even for people with jobs, rarely ends before 1 a.m. The city is both remarkably medieval and infused with modern art and design. Being a jazz musician actually makes some sense here. 
 Yet even in a city that welcomes American musicians, jazz scenes don't just appear; they must be created. Over the last decade, two Barceloneans, a top-level musician and a record producer, have built a kind of exchange system between the young musicians of New York and Barcelona. It has been beneficial for both sides. 
Drawn by appreciative audiences, plenty of gigs, recording opportunities and a lower cost of good living, more and more jazz musicians are finding at least a part-time home here. The tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry is one. After toughing it out in New York for four years with little success, Mr. McHenry came to Barcelona in 1996 with a Spanish vocabulary of 100 words and $400. In short order he found work teaching at a small music school in a suburb, Bellaterra, and performing at the Pipa Club in town. By the time he left a year and a half later, he was integrated into the local jazz scene. He had fans. He was a jazz musician of note.
Mr. McHenry, 30 and originally from Maine, is a combination of moon-faced innocence and cosmopolitan wit. But in 1996 innocence had the upper hand. He initially went to some of the other smaller towns around Barcelona in Catalonia, the autonomously governed region of northeast Spain, with another New Yorker, the pianist Ben Waltzer.
"We got a few gigs that we wouldn't normally get, just based on the fact that we were from New York," he recalled, eating pintxos and drinking a glass of Basque white wine at a tapas bar in El Born, a neighborhood on the edge of the Barri Gotic section with its cheery huddle of 13th-to-15th-century buildings on narrow cobblestone streets.
"We didn't have any resume to speak of," he added. "When we arrived in these towns, we'd see newspaper articles about the jazz musicians coming from New York to play in their town. When we returned to New York, the fact that we'd been somewhere else and played gigs gave us another sort of reputation. And when we came back here, the fact that we'd been gigging in New York added to our previous false fame."
But he may be on the way to actual fame, or, considering that this is serious jazz where returns are small, at least to a kind of subcultural significance. He has become one of the better saxophonists in New York. His third album, about to be released by Fresh Sound records, was recorded with a band that included the drummer Paul Motian. The Fresh Sound label, which is based here, has been recording a lot of New York players at Mr. McHenry's stratum -- musicians and bandleaders both here and in New York -- with skill and vision. (Some of them, like Ethan Iverson and Kurt Rosenwinkel, have recently broken through to the major labels.)
The story of American jazz musicians on a European sojourn is an old one. If there were plenty of unremarkable jazz exiles in Paris and Copenhagen from the 1950's to the 1970's who dined out on their American authenticity, there were also plenty of advanced musicians who correctly surmised that the audience for jazz was small but deep and essentially worldwide. Steve Lacy, the saxophonist, just returned to America from a 30-year stretch in Paris; the pianist Mal Waldron, who died last month, had lived in Munich and Brussels since 1965. Both were able to keep their profiles reasonably high in America and continued to make strong music.
There have long been audiences for jazz in Barcelona, too. One spot is the club Jamboree on the Placa Reial in the center of town, where Mr. McHenry played for three nights in December in a Catalan-American group led by the American drummer Joe Smith. The first set starts at 11. In fact, it's the only set, ending at 1 a.m., when the bartenders fold up the chairs, and the club turns into a discotheque to accommodate the swell of students coming off Paseo de las Ramblas, the city's elegant, tree-lined boulevard. 
The club opened in 1960; though small, squeezing in about 120 people, it's the most distinguished jazz club in Barcelona. Dexter Gordon played there; so did Ornette Coleman, Stephane Grappelli and Art Farmer. Chet Baker played at Jamboree for a month in December 1963, in part because he found a steady supply of palfium, a heroin substitute, legally prescribed by a local doctor. Thus he could ignore the dealers that used to crowd the square around the iron sculpture of Hermes by Antonio Gaudi.
But the drifting jazz-junkie is a thing of the past; volume of work determines where a musician goes, and Mr. McHenry had just played his third gig since touching down in Catalonia a few days earlier. It was a solo-saxophone concert in the basement cave of an antiques shop; admission 7 euros ($7, more or less), with a glass of sparkling Cava included. About 40 people showed up to hear him rip through "Cherokee," Harry Warren's "Lulu's Back in Town," some Debussy and his own material.
Mr. McHenry has only returned here for short spells since the 16 months he spent in Catalonia; it's not a good idea to lose touch with the pool of excellent musicians in New York. But if he wanted to return for a long stay, he could easily manage. A three-bedroom apartment can be rented for under $1,000 a month; a trip to the beach costs $1.50 and a half-hour on a commuter train. 
Besides a healthy amount of work and an eager record label, there are plenty of jazz students enrolled at the many small, private music schools in Catalonia. It is customary for many of the American musicians who pass through to teach at these schools, and some young New Yorkers, like Mr. Rosenwinkel and Ben Monder, both guitarists, are revered in student circles. 
Serious jazz musicians here don't play weddings: they don't have to. And the competitiveness isn't debilitating.
"It's kind of a throwback to a time in jazz when there was a little more work around, and musicians weren't so uptight," said Mr. McHenry. "Barcelona is good for self-esteem. In the States nobody is working enough, and it makes everybody competitive. The absence of fear is really good for music."
The flow of musicians between the cities is not one-way. Many of the best in the region, including Jorge Rossy, Gorka Benitez, Perico Sambeat, Elizabet Raspall and Albert Sanz, have found a way to get to New York to study for a short period or to play gigs. "Everyone knows each other," Mr. Waltzer said. "It's as though Barcelona is another borough of New York."
The pianist Sergi Escue, 24, was ready to leave for New York by the end of December to study privately with Mr. Waltzer for three months, on a $5,000 scholarship from the Catalonian government. His first album with his trio, named Unexpected, is to be released next month by Fresh Sound. What he hears in New York musicians like Mr. McHenry, Mr. Waltzer, Mr. Iverson and Mr. Rosenwinkel is an inspiring intellectual freedom. 
"There's a lot of feeling in what they play," Mr. Escue said. "They don't worry if it's jazz. Sometimes it sounds more like pop or something else. They are searching." In Barcelona he took four-hour lessons with the Argentinian jazz composer Guillermo Klein, one of the most exciting composers living here. (A few years ago, Mr. Klein was one of the most exciting composers living in New York.)
The most important figures in the New York-Barcelona jazz connection have been Jordi Pujol, the record producer who runs Fresh Sound, and Mr. Rossy, a Catalan drummer who brought his friends, one by one, to play and record in his hometown. 
For a decade Mr. Rossy has been the drummer in Brad Mehldau's trio, which is one of the most dependable and successful jobs in jazz. He now tours the world playing music for half a year; then he stays at home in Begues, a mountain village south of Barcelona, with his wife and two children. When he returned to Spain with Mr. Mehldau in 1992 to play at Jamboree, the gig was recorded; Mr. Pujol bought the tape and put out the record under the title "New York-Barcelona Connection," and it has become his label's best seller among new productions. 
Mr. Pujol sensed that Mr. Rossy could act as his liaison in New York, and Mr. Rossy eagerly took the challenge; he was responsible for the signing and fairly quick release of discs by artists like Reid Anderson, Mr. Rosenwinkel and George Colligan among others.
Now the label, which has released 151 new recordings on its New Talent imprint, has a life of its own; if you hear about a new player making the rounds in New York, he's probably about to record for Fresh Sound. (The discs are most easily found on www.freshsoundrecords.com, the label's Web site.)
Mr. Pujol started his record label 20 years ago by traveling to Los Angeles to record older West Coast jazz musicians; since then he has built an enormous catalog of jazz, Latin, pop and rock music: more than 500 discs, including a successful collection of music by the Argentinian singer Carlos Gardel (which has sold around 50,000 copies) and a groundbreaking box set devoted to the work of the Cuban conga player Chano Pozo. 
His economic model is to put out lots of records in small editions; he makes records fast and cheaply, paying for the musicians, engineering and mastering but hardly anything for marketing or publicity.
The bigger sellers of the back catalog pay for the new, unrecognized artists. One of his most successful moves was releasing a set of Louis Armstrong, recorded live in 1955 at his only concert in Barcelona. Mr. Pujol found the tapes unmarked at a flea market here; he paid around $3 for each of the seven reels and also paid the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation an $8,000 fee. The set has been profitable for him. 
Mr. Pujol said he had not made any profit from his New Talent discs. "It's not my main goal," he explained. "The main point is to let these people make more records and keep working with the same musicians."
The Barcelona scene is far from perfect. For all the fierce pride in Catalonian culture here, there's little official support for the region's own accomplished jazz musicians and composers. For example, the Barcelona Jazz Festival, which lasts from the end of October to the end of November, has been handsomely financed by the city government, but it isn't particularly concerned with booking local artists or the rising stars from New York who have fans here. Ownership of the main clubs is heavily centralized, and a single booking agent does most of the work for the festival.
There is a sense of potential in the region, though. Barcelona changed a great deal in 1992 as it prepared for the Olympics; it is preparing to change again for Forum Barcelona 2004, an international arts festival for which the City Council will renovate a poor neighborhood, Besos, for plays, concerts, exhibitions and workshops. It remains to be seen if the city recognizes what it has in its own jazz scene.
Mr. Escue, the pianist, said: "If you're a cook, some day you start to say, 'I think I could try to put two flavors together,' and you make something different. That's what happens in New York. There's not so much of that in Barcelona, but there is the possibility of it. If Barcelona was a color it would be white, or if it was a sound, it would be silence. In New York, there's activity -- it's red, or something. What I try to do is, I try to cook like this in Barcelona. Because I live better here."

HEADLINE: China Plans To Maintain Existing Rate For Currency 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Despite mounting pressure from the United States and Asian neighbors, Chinese officials say they plan to maintain a fixed exchange rate for the country's principal currency because it has helped China achieve strong economic growth even as wealthy countries falter.
 Prime Minister Zhu Rongji said the policy of pegging the currency, called the yuan or renminbi, to the United States dollar at a fixed rate had raised record foreign exchange reserves, increased exports and improved China's "national strength." 
 "To stick to the policy is in the interests of our country," Mr. Zhu said in a speech to officials who run China's state administration of foreign exchange, reported by state-run news media on Sunday. "It has effectively safeguarded the country's economic growth and financial stability." 
China's willingness to allow its currency to fluctuate according to market forces is seen by some as a test of its economic maturity and its commitment to participate as a full partner in the global trading system.
As the country's weight in the global economy increases, it has come under pressure to allow the yuan to float just as the dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and almost all other major currencies do. Both the United States and Japan expected China to move steadily toward free currency trading after joining the World Trade Organization last year.
By controlling the yuan's value rather than allowing it to adjust to supply and demand, China is trying to maintain a price advantage for its exports of manufactured goods, with the effect of depressing prices around Asia and the world, some American and Japanese economists have said.
China makes garments and shoes, household tools and appliances, even semiconductors, mobile phones and laptop computers at prices that most Japanese, American and European manufacturers cannot easily match. China benefits from its huge low-cost labor force, but also from a currency that because of intervention and controls by China's central bank has hardly budged from a rate of 8.2 yuan to the dollar since China's streak of rapid economic growth began in 1994.
Bush administration officials have also argued that China should move toward a free floating currency, but for a different reason: to head off domestic economic problems.
John Taylor, the United States Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said in a speech last week that a floating currency was a crucial ingredient in stable economic growth for large economies. He told reporters after his address that China needed to relax controls on the yuan. "Over time, they will move toward more flexibility," Mr. Taylor said. "As there is more foreign investment, direct investment and more trade, there will be more reasons to move toward greater flexibility to prevent other imbalances that can occur."
China's export strategy has been hugely successful. Its trade surplus with the United States has already surpassed Japan's, and grew to $83.1 billion through the first 10 months of 2002, compared with $70.4 billion in the period a year earlier.
Many economists say they believe that the yuan would rise quickly against the dollar if allowed to float, making Chinese exports more expensive and imports less so. Given China's growing economic strength, Goldman Sachs estimated in a recent report that the yuan was undervalued by about 15 percent.
Recent data do suggest that China's relative economic strength is not being reflected in its currency value. Output grew 8 percent last year, faster than in any other major economy, powered in part by surging exports and a huge inflow of $55 billion in foreign direct investment. The central bank's reserves of foreign currency swelled by 35 percent in 2002, to $286.4 billion, Mr. Zhu told state-run news media last week.
At least in part because the exchange rate is fixed, prices within China -- including Hong Kong, which retained its own separate currency, the Hong Kong dollar, after it was returned to Chinese control in 1999 -- have been falling for several years, sapping the profits of major companies even though their sales are growing quickly.
Still, Chinese officials are concerned about keeping the country's present economic vibrancy going through a delicate period of political transition, as a new generation of leaders takes control of China's economic management, beginning in March.
Leading Chinese economists also point out that five years ago, during the Asian financial crises, China also came under heavy international pressure -- to maintain its currency peg, not to break it. The worry in Washington and Tokyo then was that to stay competitive with Asian neighbors that had delinked their currencies from the rising dollar, China might devalue the yuan, potentially destabilizing international markets further.
Mr. Zhu has told foreign guests in the past that China should move toward a more flexible currency regime and allow the yuan to float, but he has taken no steps in that direction recently.
When he retires in March, he is expected to be succeeded as prime minister by his deputy, Wen Jiabao. In the meantime, Mr. Zhu signaled in his speech to the monetary officials that he saw no need to change policy now.
"The stability of the renminbi and the sustained increase in foreign exchange are major signs of the country's improving national strength and healthy economic development," he said.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
AT&T to Cut About 5% of Work Force

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
AT&T said yesterday that it would cut about 3,500 jobs as it tries to cope with the continuing price wars in the long-distance communications industry.
 The company said that it would take a charge of about $240 million against fourth-quarter earnings to cover the cost of the cuts. While the layoffs were not announced until yesterday, an AT&T spokeswoman said that the company was allowed to apply the charge to the fourth quarter because thousands of AT&T employees were notified in December that layoffs could come soon. 
 In total, AT&T plans to take more than $1.5 billion in charges when the company, the No. 1 in long distance, announces its quarterly results later this month. In addition to the $240 million charge for the job reductions, AT&T said yesterday that it would take an additional $200 million charge to write down the value of high-speed Internet systems that it acquired in 2001. 
Over the last few months of 2002, AT&T hinted in news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would write down the value of a big Latin American investment by about $1.1 billion. The company confirmed yesterday that it intended to also apply that charge to its fourth-quarter results.
The announcements prompted little reaction from investors. Shares of AT&T were little changed yesterday, closing at $27.48, down 18 cents. 
"I'm not surprised by a couple of things in there," said Richard Klugman, a telecommunications analyst for Jefferies & Company. "As for the Latin America write-off, it was pretty obvious that they were going to do something there. As for the employees, just about everyone in the industry has been doing the same thing. The Bells have been doing it about every quarter."
AT&T said yesterday that most of the job cuts would be in its unit that sells communications services to business customers and that more than half of the cuts would come from management ranks. After selling its cable television business to Comcast late last year, AT&T began 2003 with about 75,000 employees, meaning that the cuts would involve slightly fewer than 5 percent of its workers.
Many of those workers are in New Jersey, where AT&T's operational headquarters are, but an AT&T spokeswoman would not say yesterday where the cuts would be concentrated geographically. The spokeswoman said that most of the 3,500 jobs would be eliminated by the middle of the year.
The layoffs are just the latest human cost of the long-raging price wars in long distance. While demand for communications services increased in recent years, even in a recession, prices in almost every communications sector fell sharply as carriers battled to recover the billions of dollars they invested in their networks in the late 1990's.
Telecommunications executives say that prices have started to stabilize in some sectors. Nonetheless, many of the nation's biggest communications companies still have cost structures and employee rosters that appear out of sync with the lower prices.
That is why AT&T had announced 10,000 layoffs over the last two years, even before yesterday's announcement. It is also why the regional Bell phone companies and other communications carriers have laid off thousands of workers in recent years.
While the announcement of job cuts seemed to surprise few in the industry, the $200 million charge to write off one of AT&T's Internet investments raised more eyebrows.
In May 2001, AT&T spent $135 million to buy many of the assets of a company called Northpoint Communications, which had filed for bankruptcy protection. Northpoint had offered high-speed Internet access over phone wires using digital subscriber line, or D.S.L., technology. AT&T said that it would use those systems to offer D.S.L. service.
AT&T subsequently invested tens of millions of dollars to upgrade Northpoint's systems. But with yesterday's write-off announcement, AT&T essentially gave up on the Northpoint experiment.
Instead, AT&T is using the systems of another small company, Covad Communications, to offer D.S.L. service in limited areas of California, New York and Texas.
It was unclear yesterday whether Northpoint's systems were irredeemably obsolete or whether Covad simply offered AT&T a price too low to resist. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 10, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about plans by AT&T to eliminate 3,500 jobs referred incorrectly to the company's plans to use systems from Covad Communications Group Inc. to provide high-speed Internet access. Limited areas of California, New York and Texas are the sole places where the systems will not be used -- not where they will be.

HEADLINE: Columbia's Internet Concern Will Soon Go Out of Business 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
After three years and more than $25 million in investments, Columbia University will fold Fathom.com, the commercial company it created to provide courses and other material over the Internet, the university announced yesterday. 
 Columbia said that beginning April 1, its efforts to reach alumni and other off-campus groups through the Internet will be housed within the university and done under a nonprofit umbrella, Digital Knowledge Ventures. 
 Other universities, like Cornell and New York University, have already closed the commercial online ventures they started in a more financially promising era in hopes of broadening their own franchises and capitalizing on the Internet boom. 
Fathom.com, unveiled in April 2000, was one of the most ambitious academic Internet ventures.
Columbia put up much of the money, but worked with 13 partners, including the New York Public Library, the British Library, the London School of Economics and Political Science and Cambridge University Press. Fathom also marketed programs and courses for 22 other institutions.
Ann Kirschner, Fathom's chief executive, will work as a consultant to Columbia, probably for a couple of months, and then apply what she has learned at Fathom in working for others. 
She said that the Fathom platform had set a "gold standard for online learning." Another lesson, she said, was how difficult it is to induce people to pay hundreds of dollars for courses over the Internet. 
"One of the greatest barriers to online learning was people's unfamiliarity with the process," she said. "They know what a book is. They know what a course is. But what exactly is an online course? That they don't know." 
Dr. Kirschner said that Fathom hoped that people would grow more accustomed to the process by signing up for short, free seminars. 
More than 65,000 people signed up for more than 2,000 courses offered through Fathom, ranging from noncredit seminars to courses and degree programs for credit. 
Several of Fathom's partners said yesterday that the collaboration had allowed them to reach larger audiences and to learn more about innovative ways of using digital technologies. 
Paul N. Courant, provost at the University of Michigan, said that Fathom had "helped our faculty get better at using digital media for our own teaching." 
"We think we know how to do this now," he added, "and will probably concentrate more on our own internal audience and our alumni."
Michael Zavelle, senior vice president for administration at the New York Public Library, said that working with Fathom had allowed the library to present seminars with some of its exhibitions and to experiment with "a lot of different approaches in ways that we didn't have the resources to do on our own and with the help of innovative partners." 
"We admire Columbia greatly for carrying it on as long as they have in very difficult economic times," he said, "even as similar enterprises fell by the boards." 
Robert Kasdin, senior executive vice president at Columbia, said the university is not abandoning efforts to combine technology and learning: "We want to see if we can really make a contribution doing a few more selective efforts. It's unclear what the market is."

HEADLINE: An Irrelevant Proposal 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Here's how it works. Faced with a real problem -- terrorism, the economy, nukes in North Korea -- the Bush administration's response has nothing to do with solving that problem. Instead it exploits the issue to advance its political agenda. 
 Nonetheless, the faithful laud our glorious leader's wisdom. For a variety of reasons, including the desire to avoid charges of liberal bias, most reporting is carefully hedged. And the public, reading only praise or he-said-she-said discussions, never grasps the fundamental disconnect between problem and policy. 
 And so it goes with the administration's "stimulus" plan.
Boosting a stumbling economy ("It's Clinton's fault!" shouted the claque) isn't rocket science. All a sensible plan must do is focus on the present, not the distant future; on those who are suffering, not on those doing well; and on those who are most likely to spend additional money. 
Right now a sensible plan would rush help to the long-term unemployed, whose benefits -- in an act of incredible callousness -- were allowed to lapse last month. It would provide immediate, large-scale aid to beleaguered state governments, which have been burdened with expensive homeland security mandates even as their revenues have plunged. Given our long-run budget problems, any tax relief would be temporary, and go largely to low- and middle-income families.
Yesterday House Democrats released a plan right out of the textbook: aid to states and the jobless, rebates to everyone. But the centerpiece of the administration's proposal is, of all things, the permanent elimination of taxes on dividends.
So instead of a temporary measure, we get a permanent tax cut. The price tag of the overall plan is a whopping $600 billion, yet less than $100 billion will arrive in the first year. The Democratic plan, with an overall price tag of only $136 billion, actually provides more short-run stimulus. 
And instead of helping the needy, the Bush plan is almost ludicrously tilted toward the very, very well off. If you have stocks in a 401(k), your dividends are already tax-sheltered; this proposal gives big breaks only to people who have lots of stock outside their retirement accounts. More than half the benefits would go to people making more than $200,000 per year, a quarter to people making more than $1 million per year. ("Class warfare!" shouted the claque.) 
Even the administration's economists barely pretend that this proposal has anything to do with short-run stimulus. Instead they sell it as the answer to various other problems. (It slices! It dices! It purees!) Above all, it's supposed to end the evil of "double taxation."
Now lots of income faces double taxation, in the sense that the same dollar gets taxed more than once along the way. For example, most of us pay income and payroll taxes when we earn our salary, then pay sales taxes when we spend it. So why has it suddenly become urgent to ensure that dividends, in particular, never be taxed more than once? 
That is, if they're taxed at all. In practice, the Bush plan would exempt a lot of income -- rich people's income -- from all taxes. Thanks to the efforts of lobbyists, today's corporate tax code has as many holes in it as a piece of Swiss cheese, and today's corporations take full advantage. Case in point: Between 1998 and 2001 CSX Corporation, the company run by the incoming Treasury secretary, John Snow, made $900 million in profits, but paid no net taxes -- in fact, it received $164 million in rebates. This wasn't exceptional; the average tax rate on profits has fallen to a nearly 60-year low.
Anyway, even to debate the pros and cons of dividend taxation is to play the administration's game, which is to change the subject. Weren't we supposed to be talking about emergency economic stimulus? 
No doubt the final version of the "stimulus" plan will contain a few genuine recession-fighting measures -- a child credit here, an unemployment benefit there, a few crumbs for the states -- for which the administration will expect immense gratitude. But the man in charge -- that is, Karl Rove -- is clearly betting that the economy will recover on its own, and intends to use the pretense of stimulus mainly as an opportunity to get more tax cuts for the rich.
Ideology aside, will these guys ever decide that their job includes solving problems, not just using them?

HEADLINE: Services Sector Expands, But Growth Rate Slackens 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The services sector grew for an 11th consecutive month in December but more modestly than in November, according to a survey released yesterday by a private industry group, the latest in a series of reports that point to a modest recovery.
 The group, the Institute for Supply Management, said its index of nonmanufacturing business activity slipped to 54.7 in December 2002 after a reading of 57.4 in November. The December reading was slightly lower than forecasts of 55.9. A number above 50 denotes expansion; a reading below 50 shows contraction. 
 The services sector includes a large swath of businesses, from entertainment to banking, and makes up the bulk of the economy.
The organization, which is based in Tempe, Ariz., said its nonmanufacturing new-orders index, an indicator of future growth in services, eased a bit, to 56.3 in December, after increasing to 58.0 in November.
According to the report, service businesses shed jobs for the 22nd consecutive month, leaving the employment index at 46.9 in December, up a bit from 45.9 in November but still below the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion.
"As in manufacturing, growth still isn't strong enough to create jobs," said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial.
The report said that nonmanufacturing prices, which have been subdued for several months, eased in December. The services prices index fell to 51.5 in December, from 54 in November.
Ralph G. Kauffman, director of the survey, said the drop in prices probably stemmed from companies' discounting of prices to attract customers.
Mr. Kauffman also said a rise in new orders over the last couple of months offered some hope that business investment, which is critical to shoring up growth, is improving.
A separate report released yesterday said that job-cut announcements at American companies fell for the second consecutive month in December, but there were few signs the country's slow labor market was on the verge of a sustained rebound.
In the report, the employment research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said that companies said they intended to cut 92,917 jobs from their payrolls last month, a 41 percent drop from the 157,508 planned layoffs announced in November.

HEADLINE: With Party Convention in Hand, City Scrambles for Big Spenders 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
This is really all about the parties. Big parties. 
 And the money. Big money. 
 New York has made its case for the former, enticing the Republican National Convention here on Aug. 30, 2004, and it is dangling its assets -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Rainbow Room, Vanderbilt Hall at Grand Central Terminal -- to attract the latter. 
"I don't know if it is myth or not, but there is a sense that Republicans have more money," said David Adler, the chief executive of BiZBash .com, an online magazine covering the event-planning industry. "They have bigger parties. They appreciate parties and events, and like mingling and networking."
At any convention, the parties, social rather than political, tend to command as much attention, if not more, than the business of nominating candidates, which is usually a foregone conclusion.
But securing a ticket to the "in" soiree is another matter entirely.
Event planners say any restaurant in New York that has some theme vaguely connected to the other 49 states will probably get snapped up by state political organizations. And for those who are not invited, forget reservations at high-end restaurants for convention week. 
The parties, the dinners, the entertainment choices that are all part of convention week, bring in the jobs, money and taxes that a city like New York covets. Philadelphia, which was home to the Republican convention in 2000, calculated a direct economic benefit of $170 million.
A report released by Philadelphia 2000, the host comittee for the event, said that of that money, in excess of $40 million was spent on the more than 1,000 receptions, parties and other events.
Philadelphia also got something else out of playing host that it had been desperately trying to attain. The Philadelphia 2000 report conceded that it was trying to put "the region on the map once and for all as one of the premier hospitality destinations in America."
New York already ranks among the nation's top three tourist destinations (No. 1 for foreign travelers, No. 3 for domestic, behind Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas) and, according to Tradeshow Week, it is second behind Las Vegas in big conventions.
Still, Cristyne L. Nicholas, president and chief executive of NYC & Company, the city's tourism and convention promoter, said that in light of 9/11, New York needed to boost its image as a safe place to visit, as well as one that can pull off big events without a hitch.
In 2000, many of the parties were underwritten by corporations and big donors, alarming government watchdogs who see such events as an opportunity to buy access.
A new campaign finance law prohibits the political parties from raising and spending the unregulated contributions from corporations known as soft money, but the Federal Election Commission has not yet put out a full set of rules on how the law applies to convention financing. 
Few predict that any rules, short of banning sponsorships outright, will cut down on big corporate-sponsored events, especially in this town.
Expect a rush to book locations.
"It will start tomorrow," Mr. Adler said, "if it hasn't started already."

HEADLINE: Growing Rowdier, TV Reality Shows Are Attracting Suits 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
James and Laurie Ann Ryan's Las Vegas vacation last January was more exciting than they would have liked. Soon after they checked into the Hard Rock Hotel, they found a body in the bathtub. When they tried to leave, hotel security guards and a paramedic detained them.
 Philip Zelnick was surprised, too, when he went to catch a plane at an Arizona airport. A security guard made him lie down on a conveyor belt and pass through the X-ray machine. It left him, he said, humiliated and "bleeding all over the place." 
 Both incidents were practical jokes, manufactured by television shows. But the Ryans and Mr. Zelnick were not amused, and they have sued the producers. 
Lawsuits against the unscripted entertainment shows known as reality television used to be filed by people who got hurt imitating stunts on shows like "Jackass" or believed that the rules on shows like "Survivor" were applied unfairly.
Now, media lawyers and insurance executives say a new sort of lawsuit, involving claims of serious physical and emotional injury to the participants themselves, is on the rise.
These suits raise the question, as one filed last month put it, of how the law should address "the public's apparent craving to witness real-life physical and emotional turmoil." That suit was filed by Jill Mouser, who said she was badly hurt in a device called "the harness of pain" on a pilot for a CBS show called "Culture Shock."
Unlike the Ryans and Mr. Zelnick, Ms. Mouser had signed a release. But she says it should be disregarded because it failed to warn her about all of the show's hazards.
In addition to posing difficult legal questions, the suits are changing the economics of this famously cheap form of programming.
"The extraordinary growth of reality programs could only inevitably lead to an equally extraordinary growth in claims," said Sandra Baron, the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center, which collects information about lawsuits against news organizations and entertainment companies. 
"Insurance is going to soar," Ms. Baron said, "and litigation costs are going to go through the roof."
Bob Banner, who produced "Candid Camera" in the 1960's, said he could not recall a lawsuit against that show.
"We never tried to embarrass people or put them in a precarious situation," Mr. Banner said. "We did much gentler things."
Times have changed, said Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles lawyer who has represents plaintiffs in two other suits pending against reality shows. The reasons, Ms. Allred said, are cultural and economic.
"Humiliation TV sells," she said.
A new version of "Candid Camera," which appears on the Pax network, was responsible for injuring Mr. Zelnick at an airport in Bullhead City, Ariz., in the summer of 2001.
Mr. Zelnick, 35, a personal fitness trainer from Palm Springs, Calif., said he felt coerced into lying on the conveyor belt.
"My first reaction was that it had to be a joke," he said. "I asked if it was 'Candid Camera.' "
Peter Funt, the show's host, was wearing the uniform of an airport security guard. He assured Mr. Zelnick that the request was serious.
"You can't joke about these things in an airport," said Mr. Funt, whose father, Allen Funt, created the original show. 
Mr. Funt did not let Mr. Zelnick in on the joke until he emerged bruised, bloody and screaming in pain.
The segment was not broadcast, but similar ones have been popular as "a parody of security in airports," Mr. Funt said in an interview. 
Mr. Funt said the idea was not representative of the show's usual approach. "It breaks my heart to find myself within the cesspool of reality TV shows," he said. 
But he conceded that he felt pressure from newer approaches.
"It becomes harder and harder," he said, "to hold to standards you believe in when your competitors are fast and furious and footloose and are seeming to have at least some temporary success."
Mr. Funt, however, did not express particular sympathy for Mr. Zelnick.
"We accidentally hurt somebody," he said. "I was relieved that it wasn't worse and upset that it happened at all. We turned it over to our insurance company. He was offered a token amount, a few thousand dollars, and he turned it down."
The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial this year. 
Reality shows that do not involve hidden cameras can try to protect themselves from suits by insisting on releases from participants.
Jill Mouser and Marcus Russell, a Los Angeles couple, signed such releases before being flown, blindfolded, to what turned out to be the Arizona-New Mexico border for the pilot of a CBS show called "Culture Shock" in October.
Ms. Mouser, a 29-year-old saleswoman, said she suffered severe pain and lasting injury after being hung for 40 minutes with her back bent unnaturally in a harness. 
She and another woman were competing for $100,000 in the final event of the pilot, held at an Indian reservation. The woman who lasted longest was to win the money.
The show added an element of emotional tension, too. Mr. Russell, a 33-year-old film director, held the line that kept Ms. Mouser suspended, making him responsible for her agony. 
When she was eventually lowered, screaming, she was injected with morphine, placed on a backboard and driven to a hospital more than an hour away.
"When does it stop?" Mr. Russell asked. "When someone is going to die?"
Ms. Mouser and Mr. Russell said they had been pressured to sign a second release four days into the competition and immediately before she was placed in the harness. They said they were told they would forfeit their shot at the prize if they did not sign. 
Lawyers for CBS and Rocket Science Laboratories, which is producing "Culture Shock," did not respond to requests for comment. The future of the show is uncertain.
James and Laurie Ann Ryan, whose Las Vegas vacation was ruined, have sued the Hard Rock Hotel and MTV, which is producing "Harassment," the show that arranged the stunt.
The host of "Harassment," the actor Ashton Kutcher, has described the show as "guerrilla 'Candid Camera.' " The show will have its debut later this winter, but the segment involving the Ryans will not be used, an MTV spokeswoman said. She would not discuss the lawsuit.
Jonathan H. Anschell, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents the defendants in the suit -- MTV, the Hard Rock Hotel and Mr. Kutcher -- declined to comment, citing the pending litigation and a confidentiality agreement.
Barry B. Langberg, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents the Ryans, said that only lawsuits could moderate the conduct of the producers of such shows.
"Something like this is done for no other reason than to embarrass people or humiliate them or scare them," Mr. Langberg said. "The producers don't care about human feelings. They don't care about being decent. They only care about money."
Television executives love reality programming because it is cheap. But the recent spate of lawsuits may prove costly, and insurance companies have already raised the rates for reality shows significantly.
"Premiums have nearly doubled," said Chad Milton, a senior vice president of the insurance brokerage firm Marsh and an expert in media insurance, referring to insurance programs for large companies, "and deductibles have gone up in quantum jumps." 
Mr. Milton emphasized that these increases had many causes and that insurance prices in general had recently spiked. But, he continued, individual reality shows not covered by a large company's policy can find it hard to obtain insurance at all.
Brian Grossman, who represents Ms. Mouser and Mr. Russell, said the producers of such shows were mistaken if they thought lawsuits were simply a cost of doing business.
"That's why God invented punitive damages," Mr. Grossman said.
Clay Calvert, an associate professor of communications and law at Pennsylvania State University and the author of "Voyeur Nation" (Westview Press, 2000), said other economic pressures must be considered.
"It's low-cost programming," Professor Calvert said. "Now the question is whether the costs imposed by litigation will start to make it less financially attractive. But it's still going to be cheaper than paying the cast of 'Friends.' "

HEADLINE: The Charles Schwab Tax Cut 

 BODY:
The Bush administration never met a domestic problem that tax cuts couldn't cure, and today in Chicago the president is planning to call for more of the same. The centerpiece of Mr. Bush's new economic plan is to eliminate the tax on dividends that will cost the Treasury about $300 billion over the next decade. In a theoretical world, ending the dividend tax might make sense. Unfortunately we live in the real one, where it's the wrong move at the wrong time for the benefit of the wrong people. 
 Ending the dividend tax will not provide the economy with a short-term stimulus -- the ostensible goal of the plan. Investors won't be seeing their savings until 2004. While nobody can predict what the economy will look like then, we'd be willing to lay odds that there will still be a large and growing deficit, made continually worse by the administration's insistence on reducing revenues. Mr. Bush has made it obvious that he expects to go to war against Iraq this year. The nation learned in the past that it cannot afford the luxury of guns and butter. The same goes for guns and tax cuts, particularly when they're directed at the most well-heeled Americans. 
 Eliminating the dividend tax, admittedly, has more to commend it than does blindly cutting income taxes on the wealthiest Americans -- something the president is also recommending in the form of an acceleration of the cuts Congress passed in 2001. As became all too apparent in the financial bubble of the late 1990's, the tax code currently contains some perverse incentives for companies to become overly indebted and to manipulate their short-term stock price, instead of paying dividends as a form of prudent profit sharing. However, we find it hard to believe that that's the problem this administration had in mind, given the reluctance with which it pursued other reforms in the stock market. 
If Mr. Bush's mind had been on the long-term economy rather than on politics, he might have listened to the advice of his former Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, and dropped the idea of further tax cuts altogether. But Mr. O'Neill is a former Treasury secretary for a reason. The president cannot afford to look indifferent to the problems of average Americans in a sluggish economy. These days average Americans own stock -- although most of it is in tax-sheltered retirement funds.
The dividend tax might seem like a more inclusive target than the estate tax. But it is a cynical and dangerous proposal. All around the country, states that cut taxes during the boom years are reeling from the impact on their budgets, and finding it impossible to keep promises to improve education and health care. The president has wisely proposed giving them some aid, but with his deficit-ballooning tax-cut proposals he is giving them a very bad example at the same time.
Ending the dividend tax is something almost nobody has been crying out for -- except the mega-broker Charles Schwab, who made a pitch for it at the economic summit meeting at Waco last summer. The president happened to drop in on the panel on which Mr. Schwab was speaking and pronounced it a good idea. It may turn out to have been one of the most expensive courtesy calls in modern history.

HEADLINE: TUNNEL VISION; 
Rhyme and Rail, and a Subway Rat's Tail

BYLINE:  By Randy Kennedy 

 BODY:
In the rush of news about fare increases and potential transit strikes, an interesting piece of news was overlooked in this space last year: the announcement of the winners of the Poetry in Motion contest, in which all New York City residents with poems in their hearts were invited to submit them last spring, for a chance at having their verses displayed in thousands of buses and subway cars. 
 Winners in three categories -- adult, young adult and children -- have now been chosen, and the first poems will begin appearing in the system this October. (For more details, visit www.poetrysociety.org.) 
 Sadly, the Tunnel Vision column has learned that it was not among the contest's winners -- in large part, apparently, because of a failure to mail in its entries. And so, in the spirit of what might have been, here they are in their entirety, unexpurgated. Judge for yourself. (Any resemblance to previously published poems is of course completely incidental.)
TO HIS COY F TRAIN
Had we but world enough, and time,
This coyness, F train, were no crime.
I would sit and wait for you
Till my fingertips turned icy blue,
And thou wouldst remain 
Behind a stalled work train
Somewhere near Ditmas Ave.,
So late the conductor fain would laugh.
But at my back I always hear
The office punch-clock's whirring gears;
And yonder all before me lie
So many stations, so many cries
Of, "Where's the train? We're very tired.
If it comes not soon we'll all be fired!"
(The unemployment office is a warmer wait,
But none I think desire that fate.)
Now therefore, while a youthful hue
Is upon my face like the frozen dew,
Please roll my way with newfound haste
Before another morn goes all to waste.
Though I dare not dream you fast
Won't you come, oh F train, come at last?
THE BUSKER
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I was riding, weak and weary,
To my home in a borough far,
While I nodded, soundly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
As of someone loudly rapping -- rapping on a bongo drum in my car!
"Tis not right," I muttered, "Tis the dead of night."
"Please, kind sir, accept this dime and play your drum some other time."
And the coin I dropped into his hat that sat upon the subway floor.
"That's it?" quoth he.
Quoth I, "Only this and nothing more."
Then to my nap returning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, way louder than before
"Surely," said I, "this man's a loon.
And he's got to stop that racket soon.
Or I will throw him out the door.
It unnerves me to my core."
"Will you cease, sir?" quoth I.
Quoth he, grinning: "Never. Nevermore."
And so the busker, never flitting, still is sitting,
Still is sitting inside my subway train
Causing mental anguish and eardrum pain
Each song is followed by five encores
And the busker yelling:
'Never! Never! Nevermore!'
ODE TO A SUBWAY SEAT
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the width that my rear end will fit into
And the depth that I can scoot back, wedged tight
Between the sleepy guy on my left and the sweaty guy on my right.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most pressing need to take a load off between
Grand Army Plaza and Times Square
I love thee dearly, as men strive to get thee before I can.
I love thee purely, as I see them smugly sitting there.
I love thee with the weariness in my weary legs
And the ache in my aching feet! -- and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after I get a seat.
SONG OF MYSELF
(From the perspective of a veteran subway rodent)
I sing the third rail electric,
I am the poet of the track and of the tunnel,
And of the small dark place to hide
And especially of the god from above
Who just cast a fresh half-eaten Danish my way.
I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk
Of expresses and locals,
But I do not talk of expresses or locals.
Eat and eat and eat
Always the hungry urge of my world.
Straphanger, you have given me food -- therefore I give to you . . .
. . . Well, the willies.
O unspeakable passionate love!
I am not the poet of Danish only, but of bagel, of Twinkie and
Ho Ho and of heavenly piece of hot dog.
I am not contained between my teeth and tail.
Filthy I am and make filthy whatever I touch or
Am touch'd from.
At home behind the big trash can at Canal Street.
At home next to the token booth at Tremont Avenue.
At home under the platform at Parsons Boulevard.
I know I am deathless,
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a track cleaner.
I am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless and cannot be scared away.

HEADLINE: Budgets and Taxes: The Bush Formula 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, says the stock market may rise 20 percent if taxes on corporate dividends are eliminated (front page, Jan. 6). 
 Yet this may be true only for large-value investments, while other equity styles would show declines, as well as bond prices. The tax-free municipal bond market and the annuity industry would be devastated. Tax-deferred retirement accounts would be much less attractive. Has the Bush administration considered these unintended consequences?

HEADLINE: Catholic Hierarchy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul E. Dinter ("A Catholic Crisis, Bestowed From Above," Op-Ed, Jan. 1) misses the forest for the trees. 
The authoritarian structure he blames for the slow and inadequate response of the Roman Catholic Church to the crisis of pedophile priests has been the backbone of the same church in a number of important, albeit unpopular battles for the preservation of basic human rights, in particular the sacredness of human life in all its forms. 
 In poor countries this included promotion of economic development, justice and basic health care; in developed countries, the refusal to make of human life a commodity subjected to the market law. 
I agree with Mr. Dinter that authority is the highest form of service, and service cannot be provided without listening to those who are served. Disgracefully, this authority has been abused in the examples reported by Mr. Dinter, but the correction of these tragic abuses should not involve the dismantlement of the very structure that has served the world and the church so well.

HEADLINE: At Auto Show, All-Frills Cars Are Out in Force 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Times are lean and the economy shaky, but the auto industry is growing increasingly intent on coming up with offerings for the ultrarich.
 The latest among a bumper crop of new models aimed at the chauffeured class is a 1,000-horsepower prototype from the Cadillac division of General Motors, the Sixteen. It was shown Sunday night at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. As presented, the car looks like a cross between the Batmobile and a Rolls-Royce, and G.M. said it would be the first 16-cylinder engine produced since the 1940's. 
 If, that is, G.M. decides to produce it. In its favor, the car is a pet project of Robert A. Lutz, the charismatic former Chrysler president who now serves as G.M.'s vice chairman of product development and who says he believes that the Cadillac brand has been undermined in the past by blandness. Among Sixteen's amenities: silk carpets, walnut inlays and a two-piece hood that opens up like a Faberge egg, with wings unfolding to reveal a jewel-like engine.
"It seems to trigger powerful emotions," Mr. Lutz said. "It's all about re-establishing Cadillac as the standard of the world and providing a tangible vision to the outside world and ourselves of what we want Cadillac to become, so it becomes almost a religious symbol of our belief in Cadillac and what we want it to be."
Mr. Lutz, 70, certainly puts on a good show. A Swiss-born former United States marine with a penchant for cigars and driving at high speeds, he was probably the only auto executive hounded by autograph seekers at the auto show.
But will cars that cost several hundred thousand dollars be worth the effort for a company that has a hard time competing against the Honda Civic? And how many cars can wealthy automobile aficionados like P. Diddy and Donald Trump afford?
The industry seems intent on finding out. At the auto show, which opens to the public on Saturday, the all-frills cars were out in force. They included the Phantom, the first Rolls-Royce produced by the company's new owner, BMW; a new inexpensive Bentley from Volkswagen, the Continental GT, which will cost about $160,000 when it goes on sale this year; and the Maybach, DaimlerChrysler's first foray into the segment. The Aston Martin unit of the Ford Motor Company also sells cars in the same price range.
"There has been a market there, but the more you glut it, the harder it becomes," said Efraim Levy, auto analyst for Standard & Poor's. "Right now, that market can't keep up with the stock market."
Scott Hill, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said "the overall importance of these luxury high-end vehicles is massively overstated."
"It makes sense to have something from a halo perspective to burnish your brand," he said, "but I think you can do it at a level below superluxury."
If nothing else, the cars get people talking. Daimler and BMW have each said they want to sell about 1,000 of their new top-end cars worldwide. They are menageries of extravagance. The Maybach, which has a mere 12-cylinder engine, can be ordered starting next month in two yachtlike lengths -- 18 feet (or about as long as an Excursion, Ford's biggest sport utility vehicle) and a little more than 20 feet.
What is expected in the ultraluxury segment? A Maybach's seats are like first-class airline chairs, including folding trays. A small refrigerator is placed between the rear seats. The more than 100 different wood panels can be ordered in a choice of cherry, walnut or amboyna -- the latter being defined by Merriam-Webster's dictionary as a "motley, curly grained wood" from Southeast Asia. The Maybach's upholstery comes in six colors, including Labrador anthracite. (Also known as "charcoal," according to a cheat sheet in DaimlerChrysler's press kit.)
Potential buyers need to pay $50,000 just to order a Maybach; the rest of the sticker price -- as much as $350,000 -- is due in about four months, after the car is custom built and delivered.
Among the features of the new Rolls-Royce Phantom is a Logic7 sound system, which includes nine amplifiers, six tweeters, seven midrange speakers and two large bass speakers. The company's largely inscrutable press kit said the system uses a special algorithm to recreate the acoustics of a sound stage.
As for the Sixteen, Mr. Lutz conceded that if such a car is produced, its engine would probably be somewhat scaled back and that the company could use the design direction to produce about 2,000 copies of a car costing $125,000 to $150,000, or perhaps 10,000 copies of a version that costs $85,000 to $90,000.
Many analysts say that what G.M. needs most is the opposite of the Sixteen -- a decent car to compete against Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys. And Mr. Hill of Sanford C. Bernstein noted that the Asian automakers, far more profitable than the Big Three, had ignored the competition among European and American carmakers to build ultraluxury automobiles. Despite not having a prestige model, Toyota's Lexus line is the best-selling luxury brand in the United States.
"That should tell us something right there," Mr. Hill said, adding that Lexus used a more affordable car, like its SC 430 convertible roadster, as a prestige offering. Superluxury cars, he added, "are so far detached from the rest of the industry they won't have an impact."
Mr. Lutz said profit is not the object. It's marketing.
"It's priceless advertising," he said of what Sixteen could bring to Cadillac. "That's an umbrella image for the brand. But I don't think you'd ever want to go there just to say, 'Boy there's a ton of money to be made in the $250,000 car.' "

HEADLINE: Hartford Moves to Curb Gambling and Stop a Casino 

BYLINE:  By PAUL von ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
On Monday, the Connecticut State Legislature voted to repeal a once-obscure law, known by its catchy title, Las Vegas Nights, the first step in what will most likely become a legal fight that scholars say could end up being decided by the United States Supreme Court.
 Originally, the Las Vegas Nights law was meant only to provide legal protection for limited gambling: bingo in church halls, for instance, or charity raffles. But it eventually became the foundation for a court decision that forced Connecticut to allow blackjack, roulette, poker and slot machines. 
 By repealing the Las Vegas Nights law, lawmakers are hoping to block plans to build a third Indian casino in the state. The efforts to kill the law now highlight two competing and often incompatible segments of Connecticut society: state lawmakers and their relatively affluent suburban constituents who oppose any expansion of casino gambling, and the state's three federally recognized Indian tribes, for whom casino gambling has meant tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue and an abrupt end to generations of poverty. 
After the House voted tonight to repeal the Las Vegas Nights law, the State Senate immediately took up the bill and passed the measure. Gov. John G. Rowland has said he will eagerly sign the repeal into law, which will almost certainly result in a federal lawsuit by at least one Connecticut Indian tribe intent on opening the state's third casino within five years. 
After years of watching the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Indian tribes turn their casinos into billion-dollar operations -- a part of the revenue goes to the state -- lawmakers and Governor Rowland now say Connecticut has no room for a third casino. Which is why, after the Eastern Pequots of North Stonington won federal recognition last June, the decades-old Las Vegas Nights law has suddenly become a political priority for Mr. Rowland and lawmakers from both parties.
Federal law allows Indian tribes recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to open casinos in states that permit card games, slot machines and similar types of gambling. By eliminating the state gambling law, lawmakers hope to take away the Eastern Pequots' ability to open a third casino, which they have said is their intention.
"We've been compelled by federal law to allow these federally recognized tribes to open casinos because we allowed Las Vegas Nights to exist," Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, said in an interview Friday. "A change in state law would mean that federal law would no longer require that rights for gambling be accorded to any newly recognized tribe."
But Eastern Pequot officials, as well as some experts on the complex blend of federal and state laws that regulate Indian gaming, believe that Connecticut, after allowing two tribal casinos already, cannot unilaterally force a third tribe to stay out of the business by repealing Las Vegas Nights, which allows what is known as Class 3 gaming.
"If the state allows any form of Class 3 gaming," said Joseph M. Kelly, a professor of business law and a gambling law expert at Buffalo State College, "that opens the door to any tribe saying, 'We want to open our own Class 3 gaming.' "
Mr. Blumenthal and Eastern Pequot officials have each said they expect the limits of the state's gambling law, an area of law that no other state has tested as Connecticut is now poised to, will be decided by a federal court, potentially the Supreme Court, given the precedent such a case would represent.
The tribe's most persuasive legal argument, legal experts said, is that Connecticut, by exclusively denying them a gambling license but allowing other tribes to continue casino operations, is contravening the United States Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.
The tribe may also argue that state officials are arbitrarily preventing them from opening a casino while allowing the Mashantucket Pequots and Mohegans to continue making hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat, said he thought a court would reject both arguments. "Casinos are a highly regulated activity," he said. "State law does not guarantee the right to gamble." He compared the state's wish to limit expansion of casino gambling to a town's right to decide how many liquor stores it will allow on Main Street.
"No one has a constitutional right to open a liquor store," he said.
Many House Democrats, especially those from large cities whose residents would stand to gain jobs and higher pay from more casino gambling operations, bitterly opposed efforts to end Las Vegas Nights. Representative Christopher L. Caruso, a Democrat of Bridgeport, called the repeal a "truly discriminatory piece of legislation."
"This is, once again in the state of Connecticut, the haves taking from the have-nots," he said. 
If the law's opponents succeed in abolishing it, Eastern Pequot officials said that they would respond aggressively.
"The Historic Eastern Pequot Tribe will take whatever action is necessary to preserve its rights, including seeking assistance from a federal judge or the Department of the Interior, as the Mashantucket Pequots were forced to do," Nancy Tyler, a spokeswoman for the tribe, wrote in an e-mail message.
The Interior Department administers the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
But the tribe is already in a legal fix of its own. Connecticut has appealed the bureau's decision to recognize the Eastern Pequots with the Interior Department administrative court, leaving the tribe's federal status in limbo until the court decision, and certain appeals thereafter, are finished.
That process could take years, legal experts said, and as a result, may leave the tribe unable to file a suit challenging Connecticut's abolition of its Las Vegas Nights law.
Some casino-gambling industry experts say Connecticut's rejection of Indian casinos would be curious, considering that the state invented the art of profiting from them.
Nearly $370 million of the state's $13.2 billion budget in 2001 came from casino slot receipts, making gambling one of Connecticut's largest sources of revenue.
"Nobody really has the same kind of revenue share that the state of Connecticut has," said Bill Eadington, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada at Reno.

Fallon's President In New York Quits

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
The president of the New York office of Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, is resigning, the agency said yesterday.
 Alison Burns, who has headed Fallon New York since 1998, will leave at the end of the month to start a consulting company. 
Under Ms. Burns, 39, the fortunes of the Fallon New York office waxed and waned; rapid growth, from dot-coms and traditional clients, swelled billings and staffing until the dot-com bubble burst and the slowing economy led to account losses and several rounds of layoffs. 
 Ms. Burns will be succeeded by Anne Bologna, 46, director for planning at the Minneapolis headquarters of Fallon. The planning duties she had overseen in Minneapolis will be assumed by the four group planning directors there.

HEADLINE: United Sharply Reduces Many of Its Unrestricted Fares 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
United Airlines said yesterday that it had cut unrestricted fares on direct flights out of Chicago and Denver and on thousands of connecting flights in smaller markets.
 The move by the airline, a unit of the UAL Corporation, signaled a willingness to experiment with lower fares for business travelers. Many walk-up fares with no restrictions, the kind often paid by business travelers, have been reduced by 40 percent, with some cuts as much as 60 percent. As an example, the one-way walk-up fare between Chicago and New York will now be $359, half of what it had been. 
 Industry experts said the move by United represented the first widespread effort by a big network airline to simplify parts of its fare structure by bringing unrestricted fares closer to those commonly paid by leisure travelers. American Airlines, an AMR unit, and Delta Air Lines have both experimented with their fare structures, but their moves affected fares in a handful of markets.
By contrast, United said it was reducing full fares in 12,500 markets. For now, it is concentrating the cuts around Chicago and Denver, two hubs where it faces some of its strongest competition. United, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 9, is fending off American and several low-cost carriers in Chicago, while it is losing market share to Frontier Airlines in Denver.
A United spokesman, Joe Hopkins, said the airline had been testing its cheaper unrestricted fares for the last year in a few markets and had decided to expand the experiment.
"We think it generates additional business for us," Mr. Hopkins said. "We tried this on a limited number of markets out of Chicago. We've been pleased with what we've seen, and we've been tweaking it along the way."
United also said it would make further cutbacks in its food service on many flights starting today. The airline had already eliminated hot food in economy class on many routes after the terrorist attacks in September 2001, but the latest cutbacks will affect travelers in business and first class. For example, on all North American flights except transcontinental routes, hot lunches in those classes of service will be replaced with a deli and salad plate.
Mr. Hopkins said that the changes would affect 210 flights daily and that this scaling down of food service was expected to help United reach monthly cash-flow figures required by its lenders.
As for the fare reduction, industry experts said it was not a true simplification of United's complex fare structure because the changes had not been made systemwide. In fact, some argued that the reduction added another type of fare. But in the markets where the reduced fares have been introduced, United has compressed the gap between walk-up prices and those paid with an advance purchase.
Joe Brancatelli, an advocate for business travelers, who writes an online newsletter, offered a mixed reaction. "I think fare cuts are good," he said. "I want to encourage this. United has admitted they've done something wrong."
But because the cuts did not simplify the overall fare structure, "this won't fix the problem," Mr. Brancatelli said, adding: "This is a bandage on a gigantic sucking chest wound. They have to get to a situation where they have four or five tiers of fares."
Jamie Baker, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Chase, said the revenue of carriers operating in the markets where United is cutting fares represents 32 percent of total domestic sales. In the short term, he said, United's fare-cutting will have "negative revenue and earnings implications for the industry."
American and Continental Airlines have already moved to match United's lower fares, Mr. Baker said, while Delta has matched them in a handful of markets.
"By no means have we arrived at a simplified, value-enhanced fare structure, at least not yet," Mr. Baker said. "But with United's action today, we've moved substantially towards that goal."
Hal Rosenbluth, chief executive of Rosenbluth International, a corporate travel-management company, said United's fare cuts should stimulate business travel somewhat, but not too greatly. Businesses that already have deep corporate discounts with United will probably not be swayed very much by the cuts, he said, while smaller companies without discounts will find the cuts more appealing.
As for the elimination of some hot meals, many analysts said travelers would probably not miss this service as long as United lowered its fares to meet those of the low-cost carriers, which do not offer food. But if fares remain considerably higher than those of Southwest or other discount airlines, then people might ask why they are not receiving food and other perks for the higher fare.
Still, "I just think meals are a thing of the past," said Raymond L. Neidl, an analyst at Blaylock & Partners. "People can buy their own food. What's common now are the sacks you can bring on board."

HEADLINE: Power to the Privileged 

BYLINE:  By Amy Chua; Amy Chua, professor of law at Yale, is author of "World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
A general strike in Venezuela, the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States, has contributed to a rise in oil prices in the last month. But the strike, which began on Dec. 2 and has resulted in a drastic decline in the country's oil production, was not initiated by left-wing labor unions, as many Americans may think. In fact, it was instigated by Venezuela's wealthy business elite.
 Underlying this crisis lies a central paradox of globalization, and of United States foreign policy: the combination of laissez-faire capitalism and free elections can create political and economic instability. 
 Venezuela is only the most recent illustration. President Hugo Chavez was democratically elected in 1998 in a landslide victory, a result reconfirmed in a vote in 2000. Since taking office, however, Mr. Chavez has presided over an increasingly chaotic economy -- a chaos not always, though sometimes, of his own making. The strikes currently crippling Venezuela's economy, for example, are largely the work of business interests that are intensely opposed to Mr. Chavez because of his threats of nationalization and his attempts to seize control of the oil sector.
There is also an ethnic dimension to Venezuela's crisis. Along with roughly 80 percent of Venezuela's population, Mr. Chavez is a "pardo" -- a term with both class and ethnic overtones that refers loosely to brown-skinned people of Amerindian or African ancestry. But Venezuela's economy has always been controlled by a tiny minority of cosmopolitan whites, or "mantuanos," the Venezuelan term for persons with European features and pretensions. Not surprisingly, foreign investors deal almost exclusively with members of the well-educated, English-speaking mantuano class.
Venezuela's problems are part of a much larger global phenomenon -- pervasive outside the West yet almost never acknowledged -- of market-dominant minorities: ethnic minorities who, for widely varying reasons, tend under market conditions to dominate economically the indigenous majorities around them. (Chinese in Indonesia, whites in Zimbabwe and Indians in Kenya are other examples.)
Market-dominant minorities are the Achilles' heel of free-market democracy. In countries with a market-dominant minority, markets and democracy favor not just different people, or different classes, but different ethnic groups. Markets -- even if marginally lifting all boats -- concentrate wealth in the hands of the market-dominant minority, while democracy increases the political power of the impoverished majority. Under such circumstances, the pursuit of free-market democracy often becomes an engine of ethnic nationalism, pitting a frustrated indigenous majority, easily aroused by demagogic politicians, against a resented, wealthy ethnic minority.
This confrontation is playing out in Venezuela today. In 1998, Mr. Chavez swept to electoral victory by attacking Venezuela's "rotten" white elites, calling himself "the Indian from Barinas" and arousing into impassioned political consciousness Venezuela's impoverished pardos.
After taking power, Mr. Chavez disbanded the "worm-eaten" mantuano-dominated Congress and Supreme Court. He suspended privatization, vowed to dismantle Venezuela's plantation system, and decreed scores of laws intended to soften what he called "savage capitalism." Predictably, all this had a devastating effect on Venezuela's economy.
The coup against Mr. Chavez last April was a classic effort by a market-dominant minority to retaliate against a democratically elected (if also blundering) government threatening its wealth and power. The interim president, Pedro Carmona Estanga, was a wealthy white businessman. Union representatives were excluded from positions of authority. To the dismay of the United States government, which initially hailed the coup as a victory for democracy, the high-handed actions of the Carmona regime, combined with Mr. Chavez's still-strong support among Venezuela's poor majority, returned Mr. Chavez to power with stunning speed.
What should the United States do now about Venezuela? Candor would be a good start. If we genuinely support democracy in developing countries, we cannot endorse coups, even pro-capitalist ones, against democratically elected presidents. Moreover, if global markets are to be sustainable, ways must be found to spread their benefits beyond a handful of market-dominant minorities and their foreign investor partners. Otherwise, markets and democracy will continue to clash, destabilizing economies and exacerbating ethnic conflict throughout the world.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BAGHDAD; 
Hardening His Tone, Hussein Challenges Inspectors and Talks of War Readiness

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein today accused the United Nations weapons inspectors of spying against Iraq in a belligerent speech in which he also declared the Iraqi people ready for any sacrifices required by another war. 
 Gone was the leader whose remarks broadcast a month ago cautioned patience with the renewed inspections. Back was a more bellicose, more familiar figure who used the occasion of his annual Army Day address to serve notice that Iraq is primed to fight. 
 "As we watch the hissing of snakes and barking of dogs accompanied by continued aggression in the north and south of the country," Mr. Hussein said, referring to the no-flight zones imposed after the Persian Gulf war, "we act with the confidence of the assured whose actions are not hasty or confused." 
"We are prepared for anything, for any eventuality," he said in the 20-minute recorded speech that was broadcast repeatedly on Iraqi television, starting at 11 a.m. local time. 
Mr. Hussein accused Washington of pressuring the weapons inspectors to overreach the goals of the Security Council resolution that set down the rules governing their return. 
In their effort to substantiate Washington's lies about Iraq, the president said, the inspectors are not content with simply looking for the "so-called weapons of mass destruction." No, he said, the inspection teams are collecting lists of Iraqi scientists, questioning employees, paying special attention to military camps and permitted military production, "all or most of which constitute purely intelligence work."
Hoping to avoid an expected attack by the United States, Iraq had agreed to accept the renewed and more intrusive weapons inspections required under Security Council Resolution 1441. 
Baghdad says it has disbanded its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs, and while it is still cooperating with the inspectors, Mr. Hussein's harsh remarks underscore a growing annoyance among Baath Party leaders that the process has not been the quick confirmation they had sought. Increasingly barbed comments by Iraqi officials indicate that they are cooperating through gritted teeth, wondering why they are stomaching the indignity of such inspections while the buildup of United States forces goes on, making war seem inevitable. 
Since starting their work on Nov. 27, the inspectors have visited about 250 sites. Until now, Iraqi officials dealing with the inspectors have refrained from criticism because Washington has made it clear that even the slightest resistance could constitute the "material breach" of the resolution that could set off a war. 
The hostile language that Mr. Hussein unleashed today was reminiscent of the Iraqi attitude during the inspections from 1991 to 1998, when confrontations periodically led to American bombing raids on Iraq. 
On Tuesday, the inspectors are scheduled to make their first use of the six helicopters -- three American and three Russian -- that have been delivered to the country. The helicopters are supposed to add an element of speed and surprise to distant inspections. The first sites likely to be visited will be in the western reaches of the country, Iraqi officials said, noting that their own helicopters would follow right behind. 
In Vienna, Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the chief of nuclear weapons inspections, said the inspections had not produced anything suspicious, no "smoking gun" indicating that Iraq still possessed chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. He cautioned, however, that at five weeks the process was still in its early stages. 
Hans Blix, the chief inspector for biological and chemical weapons, and Dr. ElBaradei are due to brief to the Security Council on Thursday about the 12,000-page declaration that Iraq submitted a month ago. That meeting is likely to include some assessment of the inspections to date, but a more thorough presentation is scheduled for Jan. 27. 
In the speech today, instead of rambling, extemporaneous remarks, the 65-year-old Iraqi president read from a prepared text as he laid out his vision of the crisis. 
The United States wants to dominate the region's resources and redraw its borders, he said, growling that the enemy was trying to hide its true goals behind its "hysterical hubbub and clamor."
"Iraq is not the only target in this confusion," Mr. Hussein said, echoing the prevailing Arab view that Washington wants to seize the region's oil. "The objective is rather to subject the Arab gulf area to a full, complete and physical occupation through which to achieve many goals."
It would allow Washington to control all military and oil shipping through the Arabian and Red Seas, he said, and suggested that talk of war helped the Bush administration distract Americans from what he called the near collapse of their economy in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
He said American actions were taken mainly at the behest of Israel, including distracting the world's attention from its treatment of the Palestinians. 
Mr. Hussein has championed the Palestinian cause in the past, even saying that the road to Jerusalem ran through Kuwait after he occupied that country in 1990. Such remarks reverberate less in the wider Arab world today, although Arabs generally believe that the United States wants to defang Iraq because it is the one nation capable of challenging Israel. 
In his speech, Mr. Hussein made repeated references to the sacrifices being made by the Palestinians in their fight, and suggested that Iraqis follow their example. The Iraqi leader has pledged $25,000 to the families of each suicide bomber. 
Mr. Hussein said he hoped war could still be avoided, that nothing would make the Iraqi people happier, but said that because they were defending their homeland they could be assured victory. The government has been issuing supplemental food rations to help assuage concerns about any coming war. 
"If anyone attempts to intimidate you, the people of Iraq, repel him and tell him that he is a small midget while we belong to a nation of glorious faith," said Mr. Hussein, wearing a dark suit and patterned tie and seated behind a bank of white flowers. 
Mr. Hussein, despite the the Baath Party's avowed secularism, adopted a more pious tone after the Persian Gulf war, and the speech today brimmed with religious references. It started with a quote from the Koran in which God calls on the faithful to cut off the heads and hands of the infidels, and suggests that anyone who retreats from the enemy will end up in hell. 
Mr. Hussein appealed to God to take on Iraq's enemies: "Smite them with your wrath and smash them with your destructive blows, for they are a group of criminals."
He also suggested the Lord would stand in judgment of Iraq's actions. "Allah does not like weaklings," Mr. Hussein said.
