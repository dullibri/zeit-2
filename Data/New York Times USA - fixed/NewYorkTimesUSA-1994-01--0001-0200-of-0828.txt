HEADLINE: THE WHITE HOUSE IS MOVING TO EASE EMBARGO ON HANOI

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Citing progress on Vietnam's efforts to determine the fate of missing Americans, the Clinton Administration is moving toward easing the economic embargo against Hanoi and plans to consult Congress about it early in the new year, Administration officials said today.
A senior Administration official said that President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers would meet "very soon" to decide whether to recommend the lifting of the embargo, which was imposed after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the advisers were "clearly moving toward an easing of the embargo." 
 The advisers last week discussed a range of options, from partial abandonment of the embargo -- including allowing some American companies to enter into contracts with the Vietnamese for a trial period -- to a total lifting of the ban.
 
A 'Reciprocal Gesture'
 The advisers met after Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, returned from a trip to Southeast Asia in mid-December with an upbeat assessment.
Mr. Lord argued in favor of taking some immediate action to ease the embargo to reward Hanoi for its help in finding out what happened to the more than 2,000 American servicemen who did not return from the Vietnam War.
"Lord felt there had been significant progress made and had argued that the Vietnamese were now expecting to see some kind of reciprocal gesture that would be aimed at easing the embargo," one official said. He added that the Vietnamese were not expecting full normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi at this time.
Mr. Lord is on a skiing vacation and could not be reached for comment.
 
A Nettlesome Issue
 The trade sanctions against Hanoi have been a nettlesome issue for the Clinton Administration. As a candidate, Mr. Clinton pledged there would be no easing of the embargo until Hanoi made a "full accounting" of missing Americans. Yet that position is at odds with the Administration's emphasis on expanding overseas trade to improve the American economy.
With its well-educated, highly disciplined and motivated people and its natural resources, including offshore deposits of oil and natural gas, Vietnam is considered to have great economic potential. American businesses and a number of members of Congress, both Democratic and Republican, have been pressing for an end to the trade embargo lest American companies lose out to European and Japanese competitors in exploiting the growing Vietnamese market.
Some veterans groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars have also supported the idea of closer ties with Vietnam so long as progress is made on the prisoner of war issue.
But vocal opposition by organizations representing families of missing Americans and by other veterans groups, including the American Legion, has placed a political roadblock in the way of better relations between Hanoi and Washington.
 
The Pace Quickens
 Because Mr. Clinton's avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War has been a hot political potato, he has tried not to offend opponents of liberalized relations. There are a few members of Congress who are fiercely opposed to widened ties, but their numbers are dropping and in any event the President does not need the approval of Congress to widen diplomatic or trade relations with Vietnam.
While the officials said that no decision has been made on whether to lift the embargo, the pace towards normalization appears to be quickening.
Last week's meeting of foreign policy advisers, reported in The Washington Post today, was the first time they had gathered to consider the next steps to take since Mr. Clinton eased the trade embargo in September. At that time, Mr. Clinton permitted American companies to bid for projects in Vietnam financed by international lending institutions.
The decision in September followed a policy shift in July, when President Clinton said the United States would no longer try to block loans to Vietnam from institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. At that time, Mr. Clinton's advisers said that the lifting of the economic embargo would be conditioned on solid progress in learning the fate of the servicemen.
Mr. Clinton specifically said he would require tangible progress by Vietnam is four areas: repatriating the remains of Americans known to have died in Southeast Asia; supplying documents that could help in the search; assisting in cases in which downed American airmen were suspected of being alive but were not returned in the large-scale prisoner release in 1973, and working with the Government of Laos to determine what happened to American airmen who were downed in that country.
Virtually all those listed as missing are presumed dead, but the failure to find remains has fueled speculation over the years that some might be alive and held captive by the Vietnamese. For its part, Hanoi lists more than 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers, sailors and airmen as missing from the Indochina war.
 
Search Team Meets
 During his three-day trip, Mr. Lord received the remains of what the Vietnamese said were eight dead Americans at a ceremony in Hanoi. The repatriation brings to 67 the number of remains the Vietnamese have returned this year. Mr. Lord also traveled to Lao Bao, a village on the Vietnam-Laos border, for the first meeting of the United States-Vietnam-Lao search team.
Mr. Lord, whose trip to Vietnam was his second in five months, praised the Vietnamese cooperation on the issue of missing Americans as "absolutely superb." At another point during his trip he told reporters, "If you look over the whole year, we've made very good progress, indeed, tangible progress."
For his part, Mr. Lord gave the Vietnamese three million microfiche pages of captured wartime documents to aid Hanoi in the search for its missing troops. And he announced that Washington was giving Hanoi $2 million help it reintegrate returning Vietnamese boat people.
In their meetings with Mr. Lord, Vietnamese officials told the American envoy that Hanoi wanted to "proceed toward normalization as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: Tariffs Drop as Trade Agreement Kicks In With New Year's Arrival

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Trade barriers to thousands of products shipped between Mexico, the United States and Canada drop or disappear with the arrival of the New Year, as the North American Free Trade Agreement takes effect.
In the first hours of 1994, the Mexican beer that Canadians drink, the Mexican garlic that Americans eat, the American computers on which Mexicans type and the Canadian Christmas trees that strike Mexicans as remarkably sturdy and green could all become slightly cheaper as tariffs on most goods come down by at least half. 
 Under the terms of the accord, nearly all tariffs on goods produced and sold in North America will be eliminated over 15 years. American and Canadian banks will be allowed to establish subsidiaries in Mexico, Mexico will open more of its Government purchases to foreign bidders, and sales of imported cars here should shoot up quickly from the current level of a few thousand a year.
 
 
Arbitration Panels
 New Mexican rules will encourage foreign investment, and new arbitration panels will be set up to resolve trade disputes among the three countries. Prodded by the threat of international sanctions, Mexico will take a series of new steps to insure that it does not become a haven for polluting industries by lax enforcement of its environmental standards.
But for all the apocalyptic visions offered by both opponents and supporters of the agreement in the United States, economists say its most important benefits -- more jobs and higher wages for Mexican workers, hungry new markets for American goods, a waning of illegal Mexican immigration and the like -- will probably not be felt for years.
Indeed, in Canada and the United States, the short-term impact on businesses and jobs may well be negligible. Mexico will feel the accord more and more quickly because its likely effects will range from greater American influence on Mexican politics and culture to billions of dollars in new foreign investment.
Yet along with more Wal-Marts, Pizza Huts and True Value Hardware stores from Tijuana to Cancun, the trade accord will place sharp new competitive pressures on Mexico's sluggish economy just as the country turns toward a presidential election in August that is likely to focus on economic issues.
After a decade's painful adjustment as Mexico suffered through the Latin American debt crisis and then began opening its borders to foreign imports, political and economic analysts believe the trade deal on which President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has staked Mexico's economic future may even disappoint some of his countrymen in the months ahead.
"I think 1994 is going to be a very difficult year," said Soledad Loaeza, a political scientist at the Colegio de Mexico, a leading research institution here.
"The Government won't be able to show people the real benefits of Nafta next year, and it has raised expectations so high," Dr. Loaeza noted. "Do you ask people to be patient in an election year? People have been patient for 10 years now. They are tired."
Weeks before the accord was approved on Nov. 17, Mr. Salinas began a concerted effort to deflate the promises he used to convince Mexicans to join their more powerful northern neighbors. The trade pact would not be "a panacea," he began telling Mexicans, repeating again and again that only hard work would assure them a more prosperous future.
 
 
Little Preparation
 The Government has taken few steps, however, to prepare smaller and medium-sized companies, poor farmers and inefficient industries for the new competition.
Even after a wave of industrial restructuring that cost half a million Mexican jobs, worker re-training programs are almost nonexistent. A new subsidy program has been established to entice peasant farmers away from less competitive crops like corn, but most of them still have little notion of how they might grow and sell grains or vegetables that might find markets across the border.
And manufacturers, who must re-equip their plants to compete with larger, more efficient producers abroad, still have trouble finding commercial bank loans at interest rates below 25 percent.
"We haven't really realized what's coming," said Sergio Jinich, the president of Mexico's National Chamber of the Construction Industry.
 
 
'Always Painful'
 "Businessmen know that in the long run, the treaty will have positive effects, but we don't know how we are going to get there," he added. "This is going to cause a revolution, and revolutions can be good, but they are always painful."
Mexican economic officials generally dismiss such concerns as overblown.
"This economy has been passing through this sort of shock since '86," one official said, referring to the year that Mexico joined the broader worldwide trade pact, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "And compared to what we have suffered, the opening now will not even be so great."
While customs duties on about half of the American goods that Mexico imports will vanish on Saturday, the average tariff on those goods is now no more than 10.7 percent. Mexico's highest tariffs are already down to 20 percent.
In the other direction, the effect will be even more modest. Because more than a third of Mexican goods benefit from duty reductions under the United States' General System of Preferences, the average tariffs on Mexican products now is actually below the American average of 3.8 percent, American trade officials note.
 
 
Four Phases
 For the most part, tariff and other barriers among the three countries will be brought down in four phases: as of Saturday, five years later, then 10 years after the agreement's implementation and, finally, 15 years from now.
To many Mexican businessmen, the fact that the agreement fixes trade regulations in perpetuity is itself more important than the rate at which the duties fall. In a country where the Government regulated the economy more or less arbitrarily for decades, they invariably hail this change as the advent of "clear rules of the game."
The United States Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, said putting the agreement into effect would itself be a significant challenge.
"It's an election year, and a lot of people who might implement Nafta are going to be tied up in the P.R.I. candidate's election campaign," he said in an interview, referring to Mexico's governing party by its Spanish-language initials. "And any time you have change of this magnitude, there are going to be bureaucrats who will resist it."
Hauling a load of Spanish wines, Russian vodka and Pepperidge Farm cookies out of Mexico City's sprawling new Wal-Mart store this afternoon, Victor Brenes, a 38-year-old grocer, said he believed that the life-or-death struggle would be that of merchants like himself.
"The big fish always eats the little fish, and little shops are going to disappear," he said. "But if the medium-sized ones get smart, they'll be able to get by."

Trade barriers on thousands of products shipped among Mexico, the United States and Canada fell or disappeared at midnight as the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect. But economists say the pact's most important benefits -- more jobs and higher wages for Mexican workers, hungry new markets for American goods and a waning of illegal Mexican immigration -- are not likely to be felt for years. [Page 1.]
Promises that Nafta would create thousands of jobs for American auto workers have not been forgotten by the United Automobile Workers union, which was defeated in its attempt to block approval of the accord by Congress. [43.]
Argentina's securities regulators are gaining respect for beginning to root out fraud and market manipulation, aware that such activities deter foreign investment. Yet companies, especially those that are family-owned, have been slow in learning that lesson. [43.]
Lloyd's of London said it had raised about $1.3 billion from 21 corporate investors to back insurance policies. The move, forced by high losses, was a departure from a 305-year-old policy of relying on individuals alone for financing. [45.]
 
Companies
Thomas J. Watson Jr., who led I.B.M. and America into the computer age, died at 79. Mr. Watson took over the company from his father and transformed it from a medium-size concern making punch-card tabulating machinery to a worldwide giant respected for management excellence and technological prowess. He retired as chairman in 1971, before I.B.M.'s troubles with losses and layoffs caused by the decline in mainframe computer sales. [1.]
America West Airlines ousted its president and chief executive, Michael J. Conway, ending a long-simmering conflict with the chairman, William A. Franke. A. Maurice Myers, president and chief executive of Aloha Airlines, was named president and chief operating officer. Tensions heightened recently as the airline sought investors to help it emerge from bankruptcy. [43.]
One Denny's restaurant successfully wooed black customers with a change of menu: it served soul food. Now the entire Denny's chain has decided to use a regionalized menu concept at its 1,504 restaurants as a way of increasing sagging sales. [43.]
Disney's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, told a French news magazine that Euro Disneyland, the struggling theme park outside Paris, could shut down if he was unable to reach an agreement with creditor banks on a financial rescue. [43.]
Zeos International's president and chief operating officer, Martyn Ratcliffe, stepped down. The troubled mail-order computer maker said he was joining another company it did not identify. [45.]
 
Markets
Blue-chip stocks plunged in the last half-hour of trading, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average sharply lower and bringing an indecisive end to a solid year on Wall Street. [44.]
Treasury securities prices closed narrowly mixed, with long-term interest rates mostly unchanged. For the year, the 30-year Treasury bond yield fell more than one percentage point. [52.]
The dollar finished mixed against other currencies in quiet New Year's Eve trading that lasted only a few hours. [51.]
Cattle futures prices rose on expectations of heightened demand for beef after the holidays. Some markets were closed. [51.]
 
Your Money
Finding the right discount broker can be complicated and is likely to become more so as others enter the business. There are three types of discounters, and commissions vary widely. [40.]
Americans considering homes abroad should be aware of high sales taxes and a sluggish resale market in many countries. [40.]
In January, small stocks usually outgain the rest of the market by five to seven percentage points. [40.]
Conflicts can arise between parents and children over control of savings accounts established to pay for college tuition. [41.]

HEADLINE: Giving Denny's a Menu for Change

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The Rev. John Shepherd wouldn't have been caught dead in a Denny's restaurant a few months ago. The mundane menu wasn't exactly drawing him in, and charges that Denny's around the country either refused to serve blacks or required them to pay in advance made him too angry to even walk through the door.
But the Denny's restaurant in the predominantly black Watts-Willowbrook section here has wooed back Mr. Shepherd and many other blacks with something as simple as a change of menu: it serves soul food. 
 Listed on the menu with the Grand Slam breakfast, hot roast beef dinner, and spaghetti and meatballs are chitterlings, oxtails, hot wings, collard greens and candied yams.
"This place is different," Mr. Shepherd, 61, of the Sunset Missionary Baptist Church here, said. "The food and atmosphere make you feel welcome, like they are glad to have you here."
Donald J. Bohana is the brains behind the black-eyed peas and collard greens at the corner of Wilmington Avenue and Imperial Highway. And his restaurant's soul food line has been so popular in the last year that for practical as well as public relations purposes, it is now serving as a model for the entire Denny's chain.
"Now we are selling less and less of the standard Denny's fare and more and more soul food," said Mr. Bohana, a former insurance executive who was raised here. "We even get a lot of white customers who exit the freeway near the restaurant and come in just for our soul food."
Though Mr. Bohana did not tell Denny's that he had made a radical change in the menu until after the fact -- a no-no in most franchise systems -- Denny's nevertheless has decided to use the regionalized menu concept at its 1,504 restaurants beginning in 1994 as a way to increase the chain's sagging sales.
Giving franchisees greater control over their menus seems to be a trend in the restaurant industry. "People are tired of eating the same old bland food when they go out to dinner," said Michael G. Mueller, a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "Consumer tastes are more sophisticated today, and restaurants are starting to respond to that by offering more ethnic and diverse foods."
For example, the Applebee's restaurant chain, which has 350 outlets in the South and Midwest, now allows local managers to determine 40 percent of the items on their menus.
For years, Denny's has allowed restaurant managers and franchisees to offer periodic "manager's specials" to supplement the basic menu. But the company's new strategy will give franchisees like Mr. Bohana even greater freedom to offer items that will bring in more business.
"In order to compete in this tough business environment, we have to start catering to regional tastes in addition to providing some standard fare," a spokesman for Denny's, Coleman Sullivan, said. "We welcome what is being done in the Willowbrook community, and we believe we can learn from their very good ideas."
In fact, the chain could take some lessons in image building from the Watts outlet. In the last year, Denny's has been besieged with dozens of discrimination lawsuits. One filed by six black Secret Service agents, for example, contends that a Denny's in Maryland failed to serve them breakfast in April while their white colleagues received prompt service. Similar charges have come from a group of 32 blacks in California.
Open for more than a year now, Mr. Bohana's Denny's is the only full-service restaurant to open in the neighborhood since the 1965 Watts riots. And the fact that it is a Denny's has not been lost on the people of Watts-Willowbrook.
"This Denny's is something of a godsend for our community," said Gloria Quary, executive director of the Willowbrook Project Area Committee, an economic and community development group. "A lot of local people who were looking for work have found it at Denny's, which as you know doesn't have the best reputation in our community.
"It's also more convenient to have a nice restaurant right around the corner instead of having to drive miles away just to get a decent meal."
 
Kimchi and Burritos
 But Mr. Bohana's restaurant is not the only Denny's that needs extra space in its menus. The Denny's in the Japantown section of San Francisco serves dishes popular among Asians, including fried rice with chicken, pork or sausage; loko moko, a meat patty with steamed rice, gravy and eggs that is common in Hawaii, Korea and Japan, and dakine, a breakfast combination of Maui's Portuguese sausage, eggs, rice, and kimchi. Ahdi Nashashibi, the owner, said Asian dishes account for about 20 percent of his sales.
Also, several Denny's restaurants in the Southwest serve Mexican items like burritos, huevos rancheros and green chilies.
Denny's, a subsidiary of the Flagstar Companies, based in Spartanburg, S.C., said it was also testing Southern vegetables like fried okra and specially prepared green beans at several restaurants in the South and was seeking ideas for other new menu items from its franchisees.
Franchisees will continue to pay Denny's a 4 percent royalty on all restaurant revenues, even if the sales come from items other than those found on the basic Denny's menu. A new Denny's franchise costs about $35,000.
Denny's operating income declined 37.5 percent, to $24.5 million, in the third quarter, compared with $39.3 million in the comparable period a year earlier. The results were hurt by higher food costs and the expenses from advertising efforts to address the discrimination lawsuits. Mr. Sullivan said the company has spent about $6 million on such advertising and several million dollars on legal fees relating to the suits.
Denny's said the recent decline in traffic at its restaurants is due partly to the lawsuits, but that the recession has also played a big role. Denny's does not have a racial breakdown of who eats at its restaurants, but Mr. Sullivan said that of Flagstar's restaurant chains -- including Hardee's, El Pollo Loco and Quincy Family Steakhouses -- Denny's has the lowest number of minority customers.
"It's difficult to isolate the direct impact of the lawsuits, but we suspect that a lot of people stopped coming to Denny's as the result of them," Mr. Sullivan said.
In July, Denny's announced an agreement with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to give blacks a larger role in the company's management and to increase minority ownership of its franchises.
 
$300,000 Investment
 The Watts-Willowbrook Denny's, however, is not part of the N.A.C.C.P. agreement. It is the brainchild of Mr. Brohana, who sought to put his business skills to work in the inner city.
Mr. Brohana, who is black, said he had invested $300,000 of his own money in the restaurant. He called it "Denny's N the Hood," a reference to "Boyz N the Hood," the John Singleton film about life in inner-city Los Angeles.
That's where Mr. Bohana gets some of his supplies, where he found the man to cook the soul food and where most of his employees live. Many were on public assistance before they came to work for him.
"I get my pies from a local bakery," he said. "One of my waitresses makes the cakes. And some women from the community make the potato salad."
The operating costs of a restaurant in the inner city, including security and insurance, are considerably higher than those in other areas, Mr. Brohana said, but so are the rewards.
When the restaurant opened in September 1992, several local patrons were surprised that they did not have to pay for their meals before being served, Mr. Brohana said. "They were so accustomed to eating in fast-food joints that they would say: 'You mean you trust me to sit here and eat all this food and then pay you when I'm done?' "
Mr. Brohana often encounters situations that are not covered in the Denny's manager's manual. He recently noticed that the soft music the restaurant played was not doing its job of relaxing people as they waited for their food. His customers were fidgety. So he now plays a black radio station.
Neither Denny's nor Mr. Bohana would release sales numbers for his restaurant. He said that he expected to post a profit in 1994 and would have had one in 1993, but his sales were hurt by the negative publicity of the discrimination suits.
"Most people have a dim view of the Watts-Willowbrook area, but there is money to be made in the inner city," he said. "You just have to be willing to be an entrepreneur, a risk taker. I feel fortunate that I have been able to come home and serve my people."

HEADLINE: Rights in China Improve, Envoy Says

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Despite what he calls continuing abuses of human rights in China, the United States Ambassador here argues that Beijing has made "dramatic" progress in improving the lives of its citizens and that this record should be taken into account when policy toward China is reviewed early in the new year.
In an interview this week, Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy said that the setbacks in human rights represented by the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the wave of repression that followed were being steadily reversed, and that the Communist Party had loosened its control over many aspects of Chinese life. 
 His comments came before a Congressional review in January of China's record on human rights. Before July, President Clinton must decide whether China has made "overall, significant progress" in human rights and thus deserves to have its beneficial trade status renewed.
 
Question of Progress on Rights
 Mr. Roy, 58, a career diplomat who is to complete his tour in Beijing next summer, said he could not predict whether China would satisfy the standard of "overall, significant progress."
"I can't answer those questions, because the Administration is going to have to define what it views as significant progress," he said.
He acknowledged that there had been important human rights "setbacks" in 1993, including arrests and harsh treatment of political and religious dissidents. But he said the economic and technological revolution promoted by Deng Xiaoping since 1978 had stripped away much of the ideological prison in which the Chinese had lived for three decades.
In an executive order in May, President Clinton said there were seven key areas in which China had to make "overall, significant progress" before he could renew its trade privileges in July 1994. Among the areas are "releasing and providing an acceptable accounting for Chinese citizens imprisoned or detained for the nonviolent expression of their political and religious beliefs."
 
Role of Security Forces
 Mr. Roy said that human rights abuses were likely to persist for the foreseeable future under the Communist Party and the security apparatus that keeps it in power.
But in nearly two hours of discussion this week, the American Ambassador argued that the overall economic and social transformation under way in China should not be ignored.
China now trades with the United States under what is known as "most favored nation" status, which means that its exports face the lowest trade barriers in force when they enter the United States. China has angrily denounced those in Congress who favor revoking this status to punish Beijing for its human rights record.
The Clinton Administration has had to balance its approach to China between those who call for punitive action over rights violations and those who argue that China must be accommodated because of its importance as a growing market for American goods and investment and as a potential security partner.
In addition, the Administration has tried to engage China in trying to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, and many argue that a confrontational approach with Beijing does not work.
In his remarks, Mr. Roy took care to reserve for the White House a full range of policy options should China fail to make further progress in human rights.
 
Opposition to Linkage
 But he was far more explicit than his superiors have been in showing a preference for abandoning the practice of linking of China's trading status to its human rights record, calling the linkage abnormal.
"At the core of our approach," Mr. Roy said, "is not the idea that we can somehow get beyond the human rights factor in our relationship with China.
"Rather, it is a question of what is the most effective way" to press human rights concerns, he said, while conducting normal diplomacy on crucial Asian security issues.
"If you look at the 150 years of modern China's history since the Opium Wars, then you can't avoid the conclusion that the last 15 years are the best 15 years in China's modern history," Mr. Roy said. "And of those 15 years, the last 2 years are the best in terms of prosperity, individual choice, access to outside sources of information, freedom of movement within the country and stable domestic conditions."
Mr. Roy was referring to social and economic forces that have effectively curtailed monolithic Communist Party control over where people live, work and go to school and whether they can be admitted to universities or get married.
He argued that a new "diversity" had taken root in Chinese society, reflected in a willingness to express individual views, an information revolution wrought by satellite television and fax machines and a new Government "tolerance" for many forms of criticism. He also cited the beginnings of a legal foundation that might help Chinese citizens seek redress and compensation for abuses.
 
Advocates Further Dialogue
 Mr. Roy made clear that in his view, the most effective way to resolve disputes with China was through the intensified diplomatic dialogue that began last fall after a review of China policy at the White House and the State Department.
If Secretary of State Warren Christopher "were to recommend next May that we should extend" China's trading privileges "without conditions, that would not remove human rights from our foreign policy agenda with China," Mr. Roy said.
"We would expect to still continue an active human rights dialogue with the Chinese," he said, "and we would continue to expect to see significant progress on human rights issues."
Ambassador Roy said China's top leaders had taken Mr. Clinton's seriously when he had warned that China's favorable trade access to the American market would be on the line in 1994.
"We see progress in some areas, and, yes, we do see continuing negative factors in other areas," he said. "And so our purpose is to try to encourage the further progress in the areas that will be taken into account next May."
Mr. Roy said China had released the "vast bulk" of political prisoners seized in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and, with the release of Wei Jingsheng in September, the major figures from the Democracy Wall period of 1978-79.
 
Dissidents Still in Prison
 But a number of democracy campaigners from the Tiananmen Square uprising remain in prison, some of them with severe medical problems, he added. He said Beijing should release them on medical grounds, granting them a form of parole.
With Mr. Clinton having met with President Jiang Zemin in November in Seattle, Mr. Roy said, the two countries are carrying on their most extensive dialogue in five years.
Mr. Roy suggested that with further progress from China in coming months, this dialogue could supplant the contentious annual debate in Congress over whether to extend China's trading privileges, and remove the constant threat of disruption to the increasingly interconnected trade channels between China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States.
The Ambassador, who was born in China to a missionary family in Nanjing and witnessed the Communist takeover in 1949 from Shanghai, said that any new wave of Government repression against Chinese citizens would certainly bring an immediate response from Washington.
"It is impossible for a country like the United States to have normal relations with a country that resorts to overt suppression against its own people," he said. There "will be an impact on the U.S. relationship with China when such repression occurs."
Mr. Roy added that while the widening of individual freedoms represented a "radical transformation" of Chinese society, American policy makers could not forget that China relied fundamentally on "repression as its normal means of maintaining control," mainly through the state security forces.

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Wants Trade Payoff in Jobs

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Looming over the Edsel Ford Freeway near the General Motors Corporation headquarters here, a billboard recently proclaimed one of the many benefits vaunted by supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement: 15,000 new auto-related jobs in the United States in the first year.
The billboard is gone now, but the promise is far from forgotten by one group defeated in the free-trade battle: the United Automobile Workers union. 
 "We're going to be waiting and looking with bated breath for those 15,000 good-paying jobs," said Owen F. Bieber, president of the U.A.W.
Union leaders were not impressed recently when the Ford Motor Company announced that it would shift production of some vehicles among its American, Canadian and Mexican plants as a result of the trade agreement, recalling 300 workers in Mexico and creating 550 new jobs north of the border.
All told, Ford said, the move could lead to 6,000 new auto-related jobs. But those jobs, Ford said, would be created in the United States and Canada. And some of them, Ford said, would not be new jobs, but "job equivalents" -- that is, overtime worked by already employed workers.
Such fuzziness, the U.A.W. claims, has overtaken other once-clear benchmarks set by the North American Free Trade Agreement's proponents before the agreement passed.
Before the passage, boosters including President Clinton asserted that in the first year of the agreement, the Big Three would export 60,000 cars to Mexico, compared with 7,700 currently. But recently, top executives of the Big Three -- like their critics before the trade accord passed -- have cast doubt on that number.
"The 60,000 number -- I have to tell you, I have not ever discussed that number, nor do I know the origin of it," Robert J. Eaton, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, told reporters.
"Well, they do know where it came from," Mr. Bieber retorted, pointing out that the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Big Three's trade association, pushed the number. "If it was false, then they had an obligation to say, wait a minute. We're for Nafta, but don't get us into a box where we're going to be expected to sell 60,000 cars."
Now that the auto makers are in that box, Mr. Bieber clearly relishes keeping them there, insisting that they sell all 60,000 and create all 15,000 new jobs. "By God, I'll tell you this, we're going to keep tabs of how many are sold there, and we're going to remind people of this," he said.
 
Parts Supplier Movements
 While he does not expect the auto makers to move assembly plants to Mexico overnight, Mr. Bieber said he thought they would begin pushing their parts suppliers to relocate there in pursuit of lower-cost labor.
In a recent interview at Solidarity House, the U.A.W.'s headquarters here, Mr. Bieber reflected both on his recent defeat on the trade agreement and on what most auto analysts regard as his recent victory over the Big Three in national labor contract negotiations. As he spoke about the future of labor and of his union -- whose diverse but declining membership includes not only auto workers but state employees and jai alai players -- he adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Mr. Clinton, whose support he acknowledged he needs to fulfill a broad legislative agenda.
"I have great respect," Mr. Bieber allowed with the faintest of grins, "for his ability to get people to vote his way."
Indeed, Mr. Bieber has not taken the big picture of him with Mr. Clinton off his office wall, despite the irony that the President's scribble has acquired since the trade agreement vote: "with thanks for all your help."
"We worked hard in 1992 to help elect Bill Clinton President of the United States," Mr. Bieber said. "I have no regrets."
 
Fourth and Final Term at U.A.W.
 At 65, Mr. Bieber, a hulking man and a tenacious bargainer, is serving his fourth and final term as U.A.W. president. He will retire in 1995, ending a career with the U.A.W. that began in 1949.
In contrast to the time Mr. Bieber started negotiating for auto workers, the legal deck is now stacked heavily against labor, he said, which he contends is one reason union membership is declining. The U.A.W.'s membership has dropped from 1.5 million in 1979 to about 850,000 today.
To restore labor's bargaining power, Mr. Bieber said, Mr. Clinton needs to finish making his appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. Mr. Bieber contends that the board tilted drastically toward management during the Reagan-Bush years.
Mr. Bieber also said the President should lobby for the so-called striker-replacement bill. That proposal, which Mr. Clinton has said he strongly supports, would make it illegal for companies to replace striking workers permanently, a practice that became much more common in the last decade. The bill was held up by a Republican filibuster in the Senate.
"The President can help himself tremendously among the trade-union movement by going out and actively campaigning for the right of the Senate to vote" on the bill, Mr. Bieber said. "To say, 'permanently replace' -- you might as well say you don't have the right under law to strike, when you have a situation with a shortage of jobs and a large unemployment pool."
With the playing field leveled again, Mr. Bieber said, unions would begin to grow, which he argued is the best way to preserve the country's middle class.
"You can't just keep talking about good high-paying jobs," he said.
But Mr. Bieber acknowledged that his union had suffered because of inroads overseas competitors had made in the auto industry, seizing about a quarter of the domestic market for new cars and trucks.
To help stem the flow of industrial jobs overseas, Mr. Bieber said, the U.A.W. will continue fighting for Mr. Clinton's health-care plan. While the union favors a single-payer approach, Mr. Bieber said, Mr. Clinton's plan, as presented, offers the best hope for restraining health-care costs for large employers, which will help keep their labor costs competitive.

HEADLINE: Treasury Rates Largely Unchanged

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices closed narrowly mixed yesterday, with long-term interest rates mostly unchanged and short-term rates fractionally higher.
The trading session closed at 2 P.M., as dealers closed their books early for New Year's Eve. Over all, the market's tone was bearish, with some traders still cautious about the strength in recent economic data and its implications for inflation. 
 On Thursday, a sharp decline in prices came in extremely slow trading, which was prevalent all week, and opened the market to exaggerated movements. Analysts cautioned that volume was too low to draw many conclusions.
 
 
Yield Stuck at 6.34%
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday, with the yield stuck at 6.34 percent, the same as on Thursday but a five-week high. The bond's yield on the last day of trading was 1.05 percentage points lower than at the start of the year, during which interest rates fell to historic lows.
Rates on three-month bills gained 2 basis points, to 2.99 percent, and the six-month bill declined a basis point, to 3.19 percent. Traders said the one-year bill was unchanged at 3.44 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Peter McTeague, a fixed-income analyst with the Technical Data Division of Thomson Financial Services, described yesterday's bond market activity as indifferent, with some last-minute positioning. "There certainly aren't any buyers," he said.
Analysts at MMS International said economic data to be reported in the first few weeks of the new year would likely determine the market's intermediate-term direction. And while the Jan. 7 release of December's employment report will be important, "the more critical data will be those reflecting first-quarter activity," the analysts said.
They contend that the market will focus on whether the economic strength exhibited in the fourth quarter can be sustained in the new year. Thus, they say, the most important reports coming up will be those reflecting early January data, including initial jobless claims, retail sales and the consumer confidence indexes.
 
 
Livingston Survey
 In its twice-yearly survey of 61 economists, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said yesterday that United States economic growth would average around 3 percent in 1994.
It said real gross domestic product would reach a 4 percent growth rate for the fourth quarter of 1993. In the first half of 1994, G.D.P. growth will ease back to 2.8 percent, rising to 2.9 percent in the second half, it predicted.
The survey, known as the Livingston Survey, said consumer inflation would rise at an annual rate of 3.1 percent through June 1994 and 3.3 percent in the second half of the year.
The respondents expect the unemployment rate to fall to 6.2 percent by the end of 1994, and they see long-term interest rates creeping up to about 6.4 percent.
Traders said the report had little impact on the market.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mixed Results for the Dollar On a Curtailed Trading Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against other leading currencies yesterday in quiet New Year's Eve trading that lasted only a few hours.
With staffs already depleted by the holiday, and European markets mostly closed by the time New York traders arrived at work, few were willing to stake out new market positions. 
 Similarly, gold and silver trading was curtailed, since the Commodity Exchange in New York was closed.
The uneventful day was a sort of counterpoint to a year of tumult on world currency markets. As the Maastricht Treaty for European Union appeared in trouble this summer, many European currencies plunged in value.
Treasury and monetary officials were forced to change their exchange-rate rules to widen the range that currencies could fluctuate against one another. That allowed currencies to fall in line with the demands of foreign-exchange traders, but also made it harder for merchants to anticipate exchange rates when buying and selling in Europe.
Stable exchange rates have been regarded as one key to the success of European union, one of the goals of which has been a common European currency.
A sense that the United States economy is recovering more quickly than economies in Europe also helped the dollar to post strong annual gains against other leading currencies.
 
Tokyo Takes a Holiday
 Financial markets were closed yesterday in Tokyo, but in London the dollar finished at 111.76 yen, down from 112 yen late Thursday. In New York trading, the dollar settled at 111.85 yen, up slightly from 111.81 yen on Thursday.
For all of 1993, the dollar has fallen about 10 percent against the yen, although some analysts expect the dollar to find new strength in 1994 amid continued uncertainty over the Japanese economy.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4807 from $1.4768 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.4778 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.4765.
The pound has fallen 2 percent against the dollar in the last year, having finished 1992 at $1.5105.

HEADLINE: Eisner Says Euro Disney May Close

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 31

 BODY:
In the strongest indication yet that Euro Disney is in danger of closing, Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, has told a news magazine in France that the struggling French theme park could shut down if he failed to reach an agreement with its creditor banks on a financial rescue.
An article published today in the French news magazine Le Point quoted Mr. Eisner as saying that Euro Disney must reach an agreement by March 31 with its banks and investors on a solution to the park's financial crisis. 
 "If the engine of an airplane falls out in full flight, what are the options?" Mr. Eisner said in the article. "Anything is possible today, including closure."
The magazine said Mr. Eisner made the comments two weeks ago. Still, the article today was the second published report in a week in which Mr. Eisner had publicly criticized the performance of the company's unprofitable Euro Disney venture. In Walt Disney's 1993 annual report, released on Tuesday, Mr. Eisner said the French theme park was "our first real financial disappointment" since he took over the company more than a decade ago. Mr. Eisner blamed the dismal performance on Europe's recession and the strong French franc.
Walt Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., owns 49 percent of Euro Disney, which has been losing money since it opened in April 1992. Telephone calls to the offices and homes of Walt Disney officials were not returned.
On the Paris Bourse today, shares of Euro Disney tumbled 2.6 French francs, or 8 percent, to 30.4 francs in reaction to the report. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Disney fell $1.125, to $42.625.
Creditors, which include Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, Midland Bank, J. P. Morgan and Banque Indosuez, have begun negotiations with Euro Disney and the Walt Disney Company, but progress toward a solution has been slow.
Analysts have said Euro Disney would need a cash infusion of $1.5 billion to give it a chance of paying down its debt of $3.75 billion.
A possibility under review is that part of Euro Disney's debt could be converted into stock, of which Mr. Eisner would assume $750 million if the banks came up with the balance, the analysts said. But so far the banks are reluctant to accept such a plan until they have evidence that the performance of the theme park will improve.
An analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that he thought Mr. Eisner's comments in Le Point were intended to "paint a worst-case scenario to expedite an agreement between the bankers."

Attendance Declines
 ANAHEIM, Calif., Dec. 31 (AP) -- Attendance slipped at Disneyland in 1993, an industry publication reported. It also dropped at Knott's Berry Farm, but rose at two other big amusement parks in Southern California, Universal Studios Hollywood and Six Flags Magic Mountain.
Amusement Business magazine said the attendance figure of 11.4 million people for Disneyland in Anaheim this year was down slightly from the 1992 figure.
Amusement Business gets some of its information from the parks, but does not disclose its methods for obtaining figures from parks like Disneyland, which usually does not make its attendance numbers public.
The region's lingering recession was blamed for the reported drop in attendance at Disneyland and Knott's. Southern California has yet to enjoy many of the economic improvements felt elsewhere in the country.

HEADLINE: What New York City Has Done to Attract Biotechnology Labs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
An article on the biotechnology industry in New York City (Dec. 15) leaves the impression that the city's efforts to nurture this growing sector of the economy have sprung into being overnight. This is not the case. For example, in 1990, during the first six months of the Dinkins administration, we moved the long-delayed Audubon Biotechnology Research Center through the public approval process. Construction on this 100,000 square-foot biotechnology facility began last winter. 
 In the last year, a task force led by Deputy Mayor Barry Sullivan developed a biotechnology strategic plan, with three components: financing, real estate and technical assistance. Financing, by the $60 million Advanced Technology Fund, will provide venture capital to early- and middle-stage New York-based companies in advanced technology, including biotechnology. The city is reviewing proposals from private venture firms to manage this fund. The city has committed $10 million of seed capital and will work with the fund manager to secure private investments and Federal support.
A second part of the strategy will also soon bear fruit. The Economic Development Corporation has issued a request-for-proposal seeking a developer for a 200,000 square-foot biotechnology facility for new and established biotechnology companies. The city has been working over the last year with private developers to create a biotechnology center in an existing building. We expect a developer will be selected by late February.
Given the complexity involved in the development of the biotechnology industry, we believe the city has taken active steps for more than three years to support and nurture this area of potential economic growth. The city government, working with research institutions, teaching hospitals, financial institutions and industry representatives has now reached a crucial point where all concerned are engaged in a serious joint effort to create a climate favorable for this industry.

HEADLINE: On Washington;
Up Close and Personal

BYLINE: By Maureen Dowd

 BODY:
We had settled what we were. Now we were simply haggling over the price.
It was one of those moments of cozy debasement that Washington specializes in, only this time the quid pro quo was more naked than usual. 
 The scene was a holiday party for reporters at the White House, which might conjure up sugarplum visions of scarfing down clam dip with Hillary and trading hair-styling tips with Bill.
Not at all. The party was, in essence, a queue.
As we came into the residence -- which was fairy-tale lovely, with a forest of snowy trees, a gingerbread White House and madrigal singers -- we were given little blue slips. There was a time jotted on each; mine was 6:20 P.M.
The time indicated when we were supposed to go down to a room on the floor below and have our picture taken with the President and First Lady. There was a long line, including some reporters who had viciously attacked Clinton in print and others who had mocked the way White House aides trip over each other to get into the shot with the President.
Most of the reporters insisted that they only wanted the pictures to send to their mothers. But the Clintons and their chroniclers know that access is the coin of their realm.
With such Serious Personal Face Time, as the Clinton crowd calls it, we could see that the President's nose was only a little red from his allergy to evergreens and that Hillary was wearing heavier makeup than usual.
"You got your hair cut," she beamed at me. (Later, I learned she had mistaken me for someone else.)
But if it was debasing for us to line up for party favors -- we also got leather bookmarks with a Presidential seal -- imagine the evening from the Clintons' point of view: You are the most important man in the world. Your wife is the most important woman in the world. (At least, that's what George Stephanopoulos tells you.) And this is how you spend your evenings. Standing still for hours before a fireplace and a picture of George Washington, shaking hands and grinning for the camera, with the very people you most disdain, who are kind enough to bring to the world's attention all your little flaws.
And, the worst of it is, while reporters can be seduced, it rarely works in the long run. Ask George Bush. When he moved into the White House, Bush loved to give the press tours of the family quarters. ("Does anybody want to see the bathroom?" he would ask brightly.)
Wooing the press, as Bush found out, is an exercise roughly akin to picknicking with a tiger. You might enjoy the meal, but the tiger always eats last.
PRESIDENTS WILL ALWAYS try, though. For influential pundits, they dangle even more glamorous dinner-and-movie evenings. I don't get invited to those, but on a recent evening I crashed a screening of "The Pelican Brief" as the last-minute date of an invited guest, a Washington columnist. The Clintons, to their credit, didn't call for the guards to haul me out. They were, in fact, charming. (But then, being charming was the point of the whole exercise.)
As we were coming up on New Year's, I had been worried that we might find the President in his Renaissance Weekend mode, holding forth on the fine points of GATT and Nafta, or NATT and Gafta, or whatever. But I was lucky. It was a few days before the words "Arkansas," "trooper" and "Whitewater" became verboten and the President was in a country boy state of mind. His conversation over cocktails focused on his prowess in cow-chip-tossing and frog-jumping contests. Crouching to show how you kept the frog in its own lane, Clinton explained that Arkansas politicians were expected to show their leadership skills at a festival, held in a place known as (for reasons presumably better left unexplained) Toad Suck.
The President also talked about how much he loved helping Chelsea with her math homework, even though it was often hard. He was asked why he couldn't simply make the Administration's numbers crunchers do it. Laughing, he confessed that once, after he and Chelsea had labored fruitlessly to devise a mathematical calculation explaining "the wave," the synchronized movement of sports fans, he sheepishly asked the advice of Alan Blinder, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
He spoke fondly about Camp David and its old-fashioned entertainments, including pinball.
I asked why he hadn't gotten the high-tech Vice President to install some virtual reality games.
"He's virtual reality," Clinton drawled. "I'm reality."
He showed off a Christmas tree decorated with crafts from around the country, stopping when he spotted a needlepoint portrait of him that looked like a horrifying cross between Jimmy Carter and Jackie Mason. And Hillary Clinton held up her favorite ornament: a cookie baking mold of a Christmas tree topped by a feminist symbol.
John Grisham, who wrote the book "The Pelican Brief," told Clinton that they were distantly related. "Well," the President said, "if I'm going to have relatives falling from the sky, I may as well have one rich one."
Dinner was rockfish, but the snack-food President came through during the movie, with bags of popcorn twice as big as the ones in the Bush era. After watching the Washington thriller, Hillary Clinton kidded about the scenes showing closed-circuit cameras spying on the Oval Office. (The idea seemed to amuse the First Lady more than her husband; over the next few days, one aide said, Clinton made uneasy jokes about the hidden cameras, about how that could never happen in real life, could it?)
IT WAS, ALL IN ALL, A very pleasant evening. I got some material for this column, fully aware that propinquity brings its own corruption. Once a reporter has met someone and liked him, it is hard to treat him with the same clinical dispassion.
From afar, Bill Clinton can still seem slick and Hillary Clinton cold; but that night, they came across as warm and likable.
But what is real in this hall of mirrors? Do you see more of the genuine President and First Lady when you go behind the scenes, or are they simply better able to modulate their behavior to win you over? Gaining access to each concentric circle of Presidential access is an exercise in onion peeling. Who is to say which layer of Presidential skin is the real one? In Washington, the first impression is often as valid as the last.
As I write this column, the glossy picture of me and the Clintons, taken at the press party, arrives from the White House. We're all smiling broadly, like we're friends, which we're not, and like we're having a good time, which we weren't. I won't frame it; that would make me feel like a sycophant. I'll stick it in a drawer. Or I'll send it to my mom. That's the only reason I did it, anyway.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
Cities Are So Much More Orderly Than People

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg

 BODY:
For various reasons, starting with long exposures, 19th-century photographers of cities tended to concentrate on the well-ordered majesty of vista and facade while scanting the decidedly irregular appeal of human beings. Yet all through the century, people were racing and pouring into urban centers. In 1800, not one city in the western world had a million inhabitants, but by 1850, Paris did, and London had more than two million. By 1900, 11 cities, including New York, Berlin, Tokyo and Calcutta, had expanded beyond a million. Photographers, like all city dwellers, resorted to strategies to avoid the crowds: Eugene Atget, for one, would get up very early to find Paris pure.
Between about 1890 and 1915, photographers made three discoveries about cities that still influence urban imagery. One: that urban areas were dangerous and destructive to their inhabitants. (Jacob Riis's photographs of tenement life came out around 1890.) Two: that the undistinguished corners of metropolis and the life of its streets were piquant subject matter. Three: that urban geometries were the perfect modernist subject, and that rather than documenting the city's splendors the camera could cull abstractions and personal artistic statements from its surfaces. 
 All three notions are currently on exhibit in two shows that make good browsing: "Urban Visions: The City in the 20th Century" at the Houk Friedman gallery on Madison Avenue, and "Points of View: New York in the 1930's" at Howard Greenberg Gallery in Soho (both through Jan. 15).
"Urban Visions" cuts a wider swath, running lightly across many photographers, from Paul Strand in 1915 to Michael O'Neill in 1986. Most of the pictures combine the grand 19th-century tradition with the more recent dictum that modern design lurks on every corner. These images focus on architecture and engineering, which are much more fastidiously arranged and predictable than human beings. "New York in the 1930's" presents just three photographers in some depth: Berenice Abbott, who took her architecture straight; Alexander Alland, intrigued by the city's economic and political undercurrents; and Arnold Eagle, with a foot in both camps.
What lingers from the 19th century, playing at the edges of "Urban Visions," is a sense of the city as a powerful force that makes visible the socializing, tranquilizing forces of reason and order. Thus Henry Robertson Jr.'s two pictures of the San Francisco World's Fair in 1938 show a mighty structure and a carefully designed walkway, both dwarfing passers-by and reducing the world to pattern. Alfred Cheney Johnson puts one of New York's twin-towered buildings into the mathematical center of his photograph to emphasize the durable satisfactions of symmetry.
Romancing the city also reveals a trust in the promise of urban organization. Soft focus and blur or dramatic light and steam make pictorialist concessions to beauty but also display tenderness for the brick-and-stone fortresses where most of life is passed. Jaromir Funke's 1924 "Staircase of Old Prague" is as soft as if stone were melting, and Kenneth Dudley Smith's 1925 interior of Grand Central with the sun streaming down like hosannas ought to be set to Beethoven.
The most resolutely modernist photographers recorded the 20th-century city as a new form with a claim on times to come. They relished bird's-eye angles overlooking a world transformed by the view into mathematics, mechanics and patterns. Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, ever trying to revise vision itself, saw the people below as decorative shapes; Gordon Coster shot the Chrysler Building on a diagonal that gave it a thrust and force it never quite had under the normal rules of gravity. And Eugene Dallen found a perfect abstraction of circles and half cylinders that gives not a clue to its original function.
Such images actually owe as much to reverence for the camera and for the power of the photographer's own eye as to the city itself. The urban center, like most of the world once modernism arrived and photographers decided they were artists, became a treasure trove the camera could convert to private purposes, presumably the higher ones of art and personal expression.
Except for pictures of lovers glimpsed in the streets and images of fragmentary people -- legs hurrying by, headless silhouettes -- most of these paeans to the girders, metallic gleam and reflections of the city sideline the populace. Human beings tend to be distant, blurred or merely a sort of esthetic grace note. Technology still rules. The Brooklyn Bridge looms large in both shows. Possibly the bridge is more meticulously engineered than a human being, and certainly it has lasted longer, but its beauty may well symbolize a promise it did not quite fulfill even in the 30's. Try crossing it today at 8:30 A.M.
Downtown at Howard Greenberg, Berenice Abbott too finds the city more powerful when not inconveniently cluttered with people. Abbott had personally saved Atget's negatives from destruction at the end of the 20's, and her love affair with New York was a kind of American response to his homage to Paris.
Where Atget dwelt on the past in full knowledge that old Paris was fast disappearing, she looked to the future in a city raised skyward on the foundations of industrial engineering. If Manhattan did not have a Place de la Concorde, it had its sweeping spaces and rather more perfunctory signs of majesty at the Hoboken Ferry station on 23d Street. Everywhere it had skyscrapers, and over and over they cut the sky up into intricate shapes as if to rearrange the forms of nature to suit a modern civilization.
Alexander Alland changes the discourse of these two shows by focusing often on people and indicating that their lives were more agitated than the facades of their buildings. Until Jacob Riis altered the terms of city photography, photographers had refused to take any significant note of the troubles that occurred in and were largely caused by cities, even though writers like Dickens had made the problems unmistakable 50 years earlier. Those problems must have seemed safer to read about than look at. After Riis, photographers bore witness to the shifting effects of urban life. By then, cities contained most of the population -- in 1920, the Census Bureau officially declared America an urban nation.
Alland, intrigued by the ethnic mix of Manhattan, made extensive rec ords. His pictures of gypsies are both good and informative, though perhaps a trifle too pleased with the subjects' exotic flavor, a pleasure not particularly frowned on at the time. Alland's most interesting pictures at Howard Greenberg are a few of political and economic ferment, including a robustly stylized one of a picket line, a deliberately off-kilter photograph of an anti-F.D.R. cartoon and a forlorn image of a doll hung by the neck in a storefront as a plea for the Child Labor Amendment.
Arnold Eagle was a film maker and photographer who also looked long at particular populations. ("One Third of a Nation," his document of poverty, is on view at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum; "At Home Only With God," about orthodox Jews, was published by Aperture last year.) At Greenberg there is a mix of his steady observation and sometimes dramatic lighting -- eat your heart out over the late, great interior of Penn Station -- and a few images of properly dressed lower-class children with slipping socks and untied shoes, or of tenements where sheets hang out to dry in the sooty air.
It is fascinating how much photographers (and the rest of us too) admired and still love the cities where so much misery lodges. The photographers in these two exhibitions had a stake in the urban environment, which was their own, and they partly imagined and partly invented a way to look at it. Lewis Mumford said the city was "the most precious collective invention of civilization . . . second only to language itself in the transmission of culture," though he feared that the destructive elements built into urban life would take over and the world itself would fail.
Here, as so often when cynicism or heavy irony is in order, Weegee has the last word. In "Accident," at Houk Friedman, the city's dangers strike. Cars scoot blithely down the road past a dead man sprawled beneath a sheet, his hand still clutching a torn-off steering wheel. The drivers hurry by without a glance, but we are forced to look at the soles of the victim's shoes, which are wonderfully fresh, and aimed directly at us.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL VIEW;
WNCN Met The Enemy. Guess Who?

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
"We play the music you don't mind hearing" is the slogan Peter Schickele (a k a P. D. Q. Bach) dreamed up for his imaginary classical radio station, WTWP (Wall to Wall Pachelbel). No selection could be more than 11 minutes long. No vocal music during office hours. No music composed after 1912 except for works like "Bolero." And every composition played before 11 P.M. had to be in a major key.
Unfortunately, Mr. Schickele's manifesto was pretty close to the policy of WNCN in New York before the plug was pulled on its "classical" format two weeks ago. Mario Mazza, the former director of programming and operations, made his approach very clear when he began tampering with the once stable station in 1987: he wanted to make classical radio "mainstream" by "appealing to a much wider variety of people." He programmed "lighter, peppier" music and set up what he called a "power rotation" of the most "well-known, listenable, hummable pieces from classical literature." He was intent on "eliminating organ music, avant-garde, atonal, aleatoric music, waltzes, virtually all vocal music, all monaural and historical recordings." 
 Announcers never let a moment of silence pass at the beginning or end of a piece; disk jockeys imitated pop radio's chummy, insinuating patter; works were fragmented, and the music was all of a kind no one would mind hearing. WNCN called itself the "young classical-music station." In response, WQXR, the only other commercial classical station in New York, which is owned by The New York Times Company, also applied Grecian Formula to its graying broadcasts; it has managed to retain part of its identity but has just dropped flagship shows like "The Listening Room" and "First Hearing," because the management felt they had been around too long.
Variations on the WNCN prescription are still being offered to classical stations around the country by consultants brought in to increase audiences and profits. But here is a case history that should put to rest the widespread delusion that one can reach large, hip new audiences through condescension. In 1990, Arbitron ratings put WNCN's listenership at 755,000; most recently, the estimate was 650,000. Listeners' loyalty to the Wall to Wall Pachelbel format was evidently not strong. So last month, in search of new conquests and new mainstreams, WNCN became WAXQ, and exchanged Boccherini for heavy metal.
Many people are upset. But I doubt that there will be a fraction of the uproar there was in 1974, when WNCN was replaced by WQIV, also a rock station. The classical format was resurrected after extensive protests, political maneuvering, and purchase of the station by GAF, whose president had an interest in classical music. Now the company couldn't care less. "We were in a market that was limited," Randy Bongarten, the current president and general manager of GAF, sagely explained. "It was a saturated situation."
But the station had abdicated long ago. WNCN was actually killed by the now common attitude that high culture must lower its standards and tastes to reach the greatest number of people. The reasons given are either economic or political; the effect is disastrous. Of a variety of magazines concerned with classical music in the 1980's, like High Fidelity, Classical, Ovation, Keynote, Musical America and Opus, most are now extinct because their owners were not content with modest success and jettisoned them or fatally diluted their focus in a quest for larger circulation. The prescription given by the American Symphony Orchestra League is similar: dumb down the concert to bring in new audiences. The result, if the advice is followed, will be the same. A few new listeners may come; many old ones will leave.
The problem is that now, even among those with an investment in the future of the art form, a low-grade anxiety is spreading. Faced with a crisis in arts education and concerns about a tradition that seems increasingly marginal in the context of mass culture, many leaders in the arts desperately grasp at numbers and demographics. As Mr. Mazza once put it: "Trying to make classical music hip, accessible, interesting, or marketable to new audiences is impossible if you try to do it through the music alone." So the music suffers, and the emphasis is on packaging.
Of course, radio faces serious challenges. In the 1930's and 40's, it was not uncommon for dinner parties to be scheduled around unusual classical-music broadcasts. Such forms of attention have gone the way of "Fireside Chats." Classical radio seems relegated to a background role, providing sonic wallpaper. But we know from the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts, from shows like "First Hearing" and from other programs on WQXR and WNYC that different roles are possible.
The market may be limited, but it is passionate and dedicated. And perhaps -- on the radio, as elsewhere in the music business -- success may come by treating the musical tradition with seriousness and imagination. Committed new audiences will be created only if programmers take the art on its own terms, recognize that this music is not simply for entertainment and insist that listeners maintain an active relationship with broadcasts. Instead, WNCN had planned to further limit its repertory to 600 pieces, to be endlessly repeated. Its death came just in time. In classical radio, nothing should be wall-to-wall.

HEADLINE: The B. Altman Building Goes Bookish

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
"IT was to be a store of infinite resources," declared a commemorative booklet published 80 years ago, when B. Altman & Company expanded its Fifth Avenue dry-goods palace all the way to Madison Avenue, to cover a whole city block.
Substitute "library" for "store" and you get the idea behind the Science, Business and Industry Library, now being built by the New York Public Library within the vast limestone-clad shell that was Altman's flagship until it went out of business in 1989. 
 "It will be one-stop shopping for someone looking for resources in those areas," said William D. Walker, associate director of the Public Library, which bought an eight-floor, 213,000-square-foot condominium unit in the Altman building last year. "Someone remarked the other day, 'How appropriate for a former department store.' "
Furthering that all-under-one-roof sense, the Oxford University Press expects to close tomorrow on its portion of the Altman building: a 110,000-square-foot condominium unit including five floors in the small tower that runs along the Madison Avenue side and a ground-floor lobby at 35th Street, adjacent to the library entrance.
"One of the big attractions of this building was that we'd have a symbiotic relationship with the New York Public Library," said Gerald Sussman, senior vice president at the Oxford University Press.
The executive vice president of the Public Library, John H. Masten, said: "I don't want to overstate it, but we both see each other as compatible co-residents. It has the potential for the whole site to be dedicated to the intellectual life of the city."
The $100 million Science, Industry and Business Library, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates of Manhattan, is to open in 1995, as are the new offices of the Oxford University Press, a $30 million project designed by the New York office of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum.
With these institutions in place, the general partners in the Altman project -- Morton L. Olshan, a real estate developer and owner who heads Mall Properties, and Peter L. Malkin, a lawyer who is a leading figure in mid-Manhattan real estate and business circles -- can now turn their attention to filling the remaining 600,000 square feet on the Fifth Avenue side of the building with complementary occupants.
"We're talking with other tax-exempt organizations," Mr. Malkin said, "particularly a major educational institution, for the balance of that space." He said the building would probably be divided into at least two more condominiums: one for retail on the ground floor and one or more upstairs.
"This building has uniquely high ceilings," Mr. Malkin said (22 feet on the ground floor, 18 feet on the second and third floors). "For museums that have large works of art -- which you can probably guess are contemporary museums -- this is a unique place to be able to display the works."
Richard P. Steinberg, executive vice president of Mall Properties and a longtime partner of Mr. Olshan, said that three "significant" museums had been attracted to the Altman building, as had two educational institutions, but that "we're not close to anything in terms of our next deal."
"There's a sense among institutions, which like to own, that this might be the time to buy," Mr. Steinberg said. As owners, rather than renters, nonprofit organizations can avoid paying real estate taxes (which are passed through by their landlords as part of the rent) and commercial rent taxes. That was one of the key reasons that the nonprofit Oxford University Press decided to buy, rather than lease.
"It was a big step for Mr. Olshan to sell," said an associate, Jeffrey N. Gordon. "That's not his ordinary way of doing business. But there's no rental market out there."
AS it turned out, there was no market either for a mart to serve the office furnishing industry, which is what Mr. Olshan and Mr. Malkin originally envisioned for the Fifth Avenue side of the building.
It was to be called the New York Resource Center and would have had showrooms, a theater and conference rooms.
But since office construction is at a standstill, the contract furnishing industry is "in hibernation," Mr. Malkin said. "Although they have not been happy at the International Design Center in Long Island City, they have not been in the financial position to undertake major investments or long-term commitments to move anywhere else."
Meanwhile, executives of the Oxford University Press were staring the Altman building in the face. Their office is currently in the Putnam Berkley Building, 200 Madison Avenue, which is directly across 35th Street from the old department store.
"We were running out of space and we weren't getting fair value for our money," said Mr. Sussman, of the Oxford Press.
"We decided we wanted to own our own space," he said. "We wanted finally to put stakes down in New York."
A mere 98 years ago -- quite recently, given the fact that it can trace its origins to the year 1478 -- the Oxford University Press opened a New York office. It moved to 200 Madison Avenue in 1968.
Like other Manhattan buildings acquired in the early 1980's by President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines and his wife, Imelda, 200 Madison Avenue went through a difficult period during the legal battle over the Marcos properties. The 26-story tower is now owned by George Comfort and the Loeb Realty and Development Corporation. The land is owned by Alex DiLorenzo 3d.
"For a moment in time," Mr. Sussman recalled, "we were thinking of leaving the city and moving all of our operations to North Carolina" -- where Oxford already has a warehouse, distribution center and offices, in the town of Cary, near Raleigh.
However, the publisher grew convinced that if it could avoid real estate and commerical rent taxes, it could afford to stay. The city's Economic Development Corporation offered assistance, Mr. Sussman said, although financing ultimately came from the New York State Dormitory Authority.
Searching for space, Mr. Sussman said, Oxford looked at several places:
* 420 Fifth Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, a 30-story office tower built by the Hammerson Property Investment and Development Corporation. It is a mixture of rental space and condominium units.
* 120 Wall Street, at South Street, a 34-story tower owned by Larry A. Silverstein. Under an arrangement with the city, 20 floors have been set aside as the Association Center, where certain nonprofit organizations are exempt from real estate taxes.
* 10 Union Square East, between 14th and 15th Streets, the five-story commercial base of the Zeckendorf Towers apartment complex. The Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company is a tenant.
The Altman structure won out. "We loved the idea of this landmark building, with all of its character, exactly in the area where we enjoy being," Mr. Sussman said.
"Perhaps one of the most exciting things was having a building within a building," he said, referring to the fact that Oxford will occupy what amounts to its own five-story structure, with 20,000-square-foot floors and views in every direction, perched atop the massive Altman block. Oxford will also have its own entrance on Madison Avenue and a private bank of elevators that will link the lobby to the offices upstairs.
The publisher will exploit its unusual ground-floor space almost as a showroom. It will create a multipurpose room along 35th Street, parallel to the lobby, where the public can attend lectures, seminars and symposia. On the south side of the lobby, a two-level space will be created. The mezzanine will be a library for all Oxford books that are currently in print. Below that will be a waiting room and exhibition area.
"IT is going to establish our presence in the community," said Susan Rotermund, Oxford's publicity manager.
The $30 million Dormitory Authority financing for Oxford was authorized earlier this year in legislation sponsored by State Senator Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan. Despite its name, which reflects its original mission, the Dormitory Authority finances a variety of projects by private and public universities and colleges, as well as certain nonprofit organizations. It also finances schools, private hospitals, courthouses and homes for the aged.
"The thought of keeping 250 jobs in New York City while advancing a worthwhile beacon of intellectual life struck me as meritorious," Senator Goodman said.
The authority is also providing $25.5 million in long-term financing for the Science, Industry and Business Library, which is to raise $24.5 million from other government sources and $50 million in private gifts.
The largest donation so far, $7.5 million, came from Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman. The 80,000-volume circulating library on the ground floor will be named for them.
Most of the public space will be in the basement, reached through a dramatic, two-story atrium that is to be opened up in the southeast corner of the Altman building.
On the lower level will be the main reference desk, as many as 130 computer terminals available for public use, open shelves with 60,000 volumes and more than 450 seats with power and data outlets. Also on this floor will be the area in which readers order and pick up materials from the closed stacks.
The stack core will have five levels, each 10 feet high, running from the second through fourth stories of the Altman building. Some 2 million volumes will be placed there, using compact shelving that almost doubles the capacity. New steel will be required to reinforce the structure and carry this extraordinary weight over the public areas below.
Much of the activity in the circulating library will be visible from the street. "When you look through those wonderful showroom windows, you're going to see people using a library with printed and electronic material," said Mr. Walker, the associate director.
"We expect to draw about 3,000 users daily," said Mr. Masten, the executive vice president of the Public Library. "We see ourselves as an active and visible institutional player on Madison Avenue. We're happy to bring that block back to life."
Mr. Malkin sees the rehabilitation of the Altman building, which he refers to as 361 Fifth Avenue, as part of an overall improvement in the area. He has a keen interest in saying so, as chairman of both the 34th Street Partnership and Grand Central Partnership and as the general partner in Empire State Building Associates, which holds a 114-year master lease on that skyscraper.
He said that a bill before the City Council would expand the Grand Central business improvement district down Fifth Avenue from 38th Street, at Lord & Taylor, to 35th Street, where it would adjoin the 34th Street business improvement district.
That stretch of Fifth Avenue in the mid-30's, which looks somewhat run down, will be "radically changed," Mr. Malkin said, with street cleaning and security patrols furnished by the Grand Central Partnership.
The area also stands to benefit from the revitalization of the Altman building, which has already been cleaned and is now getting enormous replacement windows.
"Not only in terms of real estate but in terms of the general character of the area, it is obviously a wonderful thing," said Charles E. Pierce Jr., director of the Pierpont Morgan Library, at Madison Avenue and 36th Street. "It's hard to imagine two better neighbors than the New York Public Library and Oxford University Press.
"It will undoubtedly improve the overall quality of the neighborhood," he said, "and may even provide us additional customers for our cafe, which opened recently."
EVEN the man who runs 200 Madison Avenue, Peter S. Duncan, executive vice president of George Comfort & Sons, said he was "very happy" with the Altman project -- although it means Oxford is moving out of his building.
"We're sorry to lose a tenant, of course, but that does happen," Mr. Duncan said. "We think, overall, that the improvements they're doing to the property will improve the neighborhood. And our property will get the benefits of it. The business and science library provides a very strong resource."
But he said the greatest impact would be people and lights filling the Altman building for the first time in six years. "That's a very large structure to be dark," Mr. Duncan said. "That's been a big problem."
Although the Manhattan flagship is the largest of the Altman properties that were acquired by Mr. Olshan, Mr. Malkin and their limited partner, Earle W. Kazis, it is not the only one. And the owners, who do business under the corporate name of KMO-361, have been busy rejuvenating the rest, with considerable success. If Altman's did one thing well,Mr. Steinberg said, it placed its branch stores impeccably.
The three-level, 170,000-square-foot store on Route 17 in Paramus, N.J., has been divided in thirds. The first floor is a Bed, Bath & Beyond store and the second is a T. J. Maxx clothing store. The third floor is not leased.
The two-level, 120,000-square-foot store on the Miracle Mile section of Northern Boulevard in Manhasset, L.I., has largely been stripped to structural steel. The owners plan to break it up into five or six stores, but the project has been delayed by legal battles.
The two-level, 170,000-square-foot store in the town of St. David's, Pa., on the Main Line west of Philadelphia, has been divided into four units: a supermarket, a drug store and two clothing stores. Two new buildings have also been added on the 24-acre site.
In White Plains, N.Y., the Altman store was razed to make way for a Nordstrom store, as part of a new mall called the Westchester, being developed by the O'Connor Group, in which KMO-361 keeps an interest.
"The other properties have moved along extremely well," Mr. Malkin said. "The key to conclude everything is the remaining 600,000 square feet in 361 Fifth Avenue."

HEADLINE: State Leads New England in Farming Production

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT has become the leading agricultural state in New England, the New England Agricultural Statistics Service reported recently.
"Agriculture is flourishing in Connecticut," the director of the Bureau of Marketing and Technology of the State Department of Agriculture in Hartford, Robert R. Pellegrino, said. 
 The professor of agricultural economics at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Robert Leonard, said the reason is diversification.
As traditional dairy farming declined in Connecticut, as it did almost everywhere in the Northeast, farmers turned to other crops like plants in nurseries and greenhouses, Christmas trees, fruits and vegetables and shellfish.
 
'Growing Nicely'
 "The encouraging thing is that on the basis of year-to-year figures, we are growing nicely," the State Commissioner of Agriculture, John R. H. Blum, said.
The state's 4,000 farmers reported total cash receipts in 1992 of $488.7 million, 3 percent higher than the $472.2 million total in 1991. Their 1992 receipts were higher than in any other New England state, according to the Agricultural Statistics Service. Massachusetts's 6,900 farms produced receipts of $483 million; Maine's 7,100 farms, $474 million; Vermont's 6,900 farms, $452 million; New Hampshire's 2,900 farms, $143 million; and Rhode Island's 700 farms, $72 million.
In Maine, the major crop remained potatoes, which furnished 23.9 percent of the farm receipts. In Vermont, dairy farming is still the major agricultural enterprise in the state, providing 76 percent of the farm income. In Massachusetts, as in Connecticut, greenhouse and nursery crops are the big items, amounting to 33 percent of the farm receipts.
 
Higher Value of Products
 The numbers were compiled by the New England Agricultural Statistics Service, an arm of the United States Department of Agriculture, based in Concord, N.H. It defines a farm as "any establishment from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were sold or normally would be sold during the year."
Even more encouraging in Connecticut's agriculture picture was a different measure -- the value of its farm products, compiled by the State Department of Agriculture. It is higher than the cash receipts figure because it includes an inventory of crops such as Christmas trees and nursery plants, which continued to grow and were not sold during the year.
In 1992, that total value was $710 million, up 15 percent from $619 million the year before, Mr. Blum said.
A tabulation showed Connecticut's leading agricultural products: Nurseries and greenhouses, $185 million; Eggs and poultry, $105 million; Dairy, $76 million; Livestock, $70 million; Shellfish, $54 million; Tobacco, $47 million; Fruits and vegetables, $47 million; Field crops (hay and silage), $38 million; Forestry, $40 million; Mushrooms, $35 million; Christmas trees, $10 million; Other, $3 million.
The biggest percentage increase of all Connecticut's crops was in shellfish, largely oysters grown in Long Island Sound off Norwalk and Bridgeport, the director of the State Department of Agriculture's aquaculture division, John H. Volk, said.
In 1990, shellfish operators cultivated oyster beds on 44,493 acres under water offshore, producing a crop of 380,000 bushels. Two years later, about the same number of acres produced more than twice as many oysters, 893,964 bushels.
 
'Oyster Crop Looking Good'
 The income from oysters more than doubled, too, to $46 million, up from $22.6 million in 1990, Mr. Volk said.
Although the 1993 figures are not in yet, Mr. Volk said the oyster crop was "looking good" this year.
The biggest decrease in farm income, 33 percent, was reported by tobacco farmers, who for many years were major producers in the Connecticut River valley. Their receipts were $32.9 million in 1992, down from $49.3 million the year before.
Despite that drop, Mr. Blum, a farmer who raises Angus cattle on his farm in Sharon, is optimistic about the future of agriculture in Connecticut.
"We see our agriculture as diversified and increasing," he said. "It's healthier than it has ever been."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Housing for Low-Income Elderly;
. . . 130 on 8.5 Acres in Westfield, N.J.

 BODY:
Construction began last month on a 130-unit housing project for the elderly in Westfield, N.J., on a site adjacent to an existing home, Westfield Senior Citizen Housing.
Forest City Ratner Companies is the developer of the project. The architect is Swanke Hayden Connell Ltd. of Manhattan. 
 The building, which will be owned by the Westfield Senior Citizen Urban Renewal Partnership, will be on an 8.5-acre parcel in the Manor Park neighborhood. The land is owned by the town of Westfield and leased for 33 years to the partnership.
Preliminary site-clearing work began in mid-November and foundation work is currently under way. The building is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year.
The project's design includes 130 one-bedroom apartments, two community rooms for residents, and administrative offices. The construction costs are estimated at about $10 million.
Financing will be provided by Chemical Bank of New Jersey, Transamerica Occidential Life Insurance Corporation of San Francisco and the Westfield Senior Citizens Housing Corporation.
A key part of the project was the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. Westfield received an allocation for tax credits, which are being sold to Transamerica Occidential Life Insurance Corporation for about $4.5 million.
"Even though nobody had any idea whether the tax bill containing the tax credits would pass Congress, this team pushed ahead with the planning and the paperwork," said Westfield's Mayor, Garland "Bud" Boothe.

HEADLINE: Giving Gifts Of Talent And Time

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
PAT TATE, stately and steady as a ship, is a marketing specialist at a midtown Manhattan corporate giant; Nicole Gaffney is a top-knotted sixth-grader who bounces back and forth and up and down like a Super Ball, from chair to table to floor and back again. Once a week their orbits cross over Nicole's homework in the lunchroom of Public School 198 on the Upper East Side.
Richard Milewski, a son of middle-class Queens who lost his home to heroin, toils six or seven hours a day, serving lunch and washing dishes at a soup kitchen in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. 
 Paul Freely, an expatriate Briton who works as a hairdresser in salons around Manhattan, donates 10 hours of his 70-hour workweek, cutting, coloring and combing the hair of people with AIDS.
They are part of what experts say is a growing movement here and all over America, just three of the broadly estimated one million New Yorkers, of every social and economic stripe, who volunteer their time and their talents, smoothing the city's rough edges in ways large and small.
"You go on each day and the person you're mostly thinking about is yourself," Ms. Tate said. "You get yourself up, you feed yourself, you get yourself to work. And the opportunity to volunteer, even if it's only two hours a week, gives you a chance to think about somebody other than yourself."
At the Mayor's Voluntary Action Center, the executive director, Winifred L. Brown, says inquiries about volunteering have risen 30 percent in the last year. That mirrors a nationwide surge in volunteering that many experts say is a direct result of the recession. Those who have lost jobs find purpose, new skills, simply something to do. Those who have jobs volunteer out of gratitude, heightened social awareness and, yes, guilt.
In New York, the desire to volunteer often springs from a sense of civic helplessness and anger, a feeling in many quarters that government alone cannot keep the city afloat.
"People are frustrated with 'quality of life' issues and the city's overwhelming social and environmental problems," said Kenneth Adams, executive director of New York Cares, which assigns 2,000 volunteers a month to various projects. "We have to rise up and fill that gap."
Many people, too, say that volunteering provides a sense of community in an often cold and lonely city.
"Two-thirds of the people who come in here are between the ages of 18 and 35, and most of them see this as a way to meet other people," said Nancy D. Carr, president of the Volunteer Referral Center in Manhattan, which places 2,000 volunteers every year with nonprofit agencies.
Of course, volunteering has trends. There is rarely a shortage of people who want to work with children or AIDS patients; it's much harder to get people to work with the elderly, experts say. Over all, volunteering has become more convenient. Some corporations encourage their employees to do it on company time. Many agencies keep more flexible hours than the 9-to-5 that once prevailed. Family volunteering, in which parents and children work together, is a recent innovation that balances the desire to add to the common good with the need for family time.
Most volunteers say they will commit for three months, Miss Brown said. "But if you get them for three months," she added, "you'll probably have them for three years."
Here are five of their stories.
 
Teaching on Company Time
 Gloria Buckery is the principal of Public School 198 at Third Avenue and 95th Street, where the Upper East Side overlaps East Harlem. P.S. 198, like most New York City public schools, is a place where making do on the margins has become a way of life. Which is why she is so fond of talking about how her school got its new piano.
For the last two years, the school has been linked in a partnership with Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, one of a growing number of companies that are sponsoring volunteer programs for their employees. Last year, Seagram executives attended a musical assembly featuring the old piano. "They saw a piano in five pieces and the teacher trying to play it," Ms. Buckery said. Hence the new one.
"They stand back and look," she explained, "and frankly, I think they can't believe what goes on in the public schools."
The school and the company joined forces after the Seagram chairman, Edgar Bronfman Jr., gave a speech at another public school and decided to make the experience available -- on company time -- to his employees, said Patsy Glazer, a Seagram spokeswoman.
"He almost saw it as a perk," she said. P.S. 198 was chosen based on its proximity to midtown offices and the principal's willingness to work with Seagram.
This year, about 200 Seagram employees, or a third of the Manhattan work force, are volunteering at the school. The company-time component encourages many to volunteer. The company takes no tax deduction for its contributions to the school, said Nancy Morgan, the program's coordinator.
P.S. 198 had no art program when the partnership started; now there is a weekly after-school studio, run by two Seagram volunteers. There was no music teacher; now a teacher is scheduled one day a week, her salary paid by Seagram.
"The only cry we hear is 'More,' " Ms. Buckery said. Twenty-five children are now being tutored, but hundreds more, she added, could be helped if there were more volunteers.
"Any public school is grateful for money," Ms. Buckery said. "But it's not as lasting in its effect as volunteers' coming in on a regular basis. It's like the divorced parent who gives you a very nice Christmas present, and you think, 'Where are you the other 364 days of the year?' "
Companies become involved for a mix of reasons.
"A lot of them act out of a sense of civic responsibility," said Kenneth Adams, director of New York Cares, which works on volunteer activities with 74 companies. "Others are self-serving. They want the publicity. And others look at it as a good way to boost employee morale."
For Pat Tate and Nicole Gaffney, 11 years old, tutoring is a stop-and-start session on Tuesday afternoons. It concentrates on the sixth grader's math and English homework, with interruptions to talk about current events, Nicole's boyfriend ("I know his phone number by heart," she confided), approaching holidays and other topics.
At the beginning of the year, Ms. Tate bought Nicole a desk diary that lists every tutoring session they will have.
"She's very concerned about what days we'll be together," Ms. Tate explained. Once, last year, when another volunteer showed up to substitute, Nicole burst into tears.
To Ms. Tate, tutoring is "an opportunity to share knowledge with a child, when I wouldn't normally have that opportunity, being single with no children. When I'm with her, I'm thinking about her: how can I make school make sense in those two hours?"
 
'Tired of Asking and Asking'
 Two months ago Richard Milewski was just one of the faces in the food line. Today he can be found in the kitchen at St. John's Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn, lifting heavy pans of chicken, scrubbing soiled trays and generally enjoying the view from the other side of the counter.
Mr. Milewski is one of the 20 volunteers who are the main reason why the St. John's Bread and Life soup kitchen can feed breakfast and lunch to as many as many as 1,000 people every weekday. Those who eat at the church on Lewis Avenue in a battered quarter of Bedford-Stuyvesant are among the poorest of the city's poor; most of those who cook and clean and serve are poor, too.
Volunteering, they say, they feel rich.
"They get tired of asking and asking," Hossein Saadat, executive director of the Bread and Life program, said of volunteers like Mr. Milewski.
"I lay back and I'm exhausted from being part of the solution, not the problem," Mr. Milewski said, his hands soft and pink from swishing through soapy water all morning. "I feel like I accomplish something throughout the day."
A recovering cocaine and heroin addict whose jaw was shattered in a recent mugging, Mr. Milewski tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, nearly four years ago. So far, "knock on wood," he says, he remains healthy. He reports to the soup kitchen at 8 every morning, after his daily visit to a nearby methadone clinic, his long brown hair reined in beneath a baseball cap.
Mr. Milewski, who is 31 years old, grew up "middle class," he says, in Ridgewood, Queens, the fourth of five brothers. At 18 he joined the Transit Authority as an electrician, trudging through tunnels to repair signal lights and switches. He married his childhood sweetheart, and together they began using drugs. In 1986 he was suspended from his job for refusing to submit to a drug screening test, he says, but he was too high to care: "I figured drugs were a better life," he said.
He drifted across central Queens for the next six years, sleeping in parking lots and sharing needles with fellow junkies in abandoned buildings. He shoplifted from Macy's to make ends meet, and was caught and jailed twice. Last spring, no longer homeless but still addicted, he heard that there was a free lunch at St. John's.
"After six months, Sister asked me to help out," Mr. Milewski said, referring to Sister Mary Bernadette Scymczak, the nun who directs the soup kitchen. "By working, it keeps my mind occupied. And I never knew anything about a kitchen until now. I didn't know that picking up a lot of leftovers, you can make a whole meal."
He is something of a celebrity among the homeless whom he now serves, one of their own who is slowly pulling his life together. He shares a room with another formerly homeless man, and thinks he may someday look for a paying job again.
"They come up to me and say, 'How you doing, Richie?' " Mr. Milewski said. And he added, with more than a trace of pride: "I was here last Thanksgiving as a client. This year, I worked."
 
People 1, Medicare Bureaucrats 0
 Four years ago the people at Medicare picked a fight with Bella Schoenholtz of Flushing, Queens. And they had to pay. Some might say they're still paying.
It all began with Medicare's rejection of a bill that Mrs. Schoenholtz submitted after a visit to her doctor. As she recalls, Medicare refused to reimburse her, saying she had been to the doctor too many times. Mrs. Schoenholtz saw red, picked up a pen and wrote a pithy letter that she sent to her Congressman and other public officials.
She succeeded in wringing her $50 out of the bureaucracy. But along the way, a crusade was born. Mrs. Schoenholtz started "Medicare 101," based at Flushing Hospital, where she had been volunteering as an office helper for a friend who worked there. Solo most of the time, the sandy-haired, jolly Mrs. Schoenholtz advises people who are baffled by the maze of regulations governing who is paid back, when and for what under Medicare's system of health insurance for the elderly and the disabled.
She works two days a week, 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. Her clients -- about 500 a year -- hear about her service through newspaper advertisements and notices at centers for the elderly. Doctors and nurses stop in, as mystified by the regulations as everybody else.
"The elderly are confused beyond words," said the 68-year-old Mrs. Schoenholtz, whose back ailments forced her to quit her job as a bookkeeper nine years ago. "A lot of them have their spouses doing all the paperwork. Then the spouse dies, and they don't even know how to write out a check."
Others have just switched to Medicare and feel humiliated by not being able to conquer the forms. And still others are reluctant to file claims at all, embarrassed at taking what they see as a handout from the Government.
"Even though we do extensive outreach, people just don't understand," said Michael Jacoby, director of community relations for G.H.I. Medicare, which covers Queens County. Mrs. Schoenholtz calls him as many as four times a week. "Often they need someone who's familiar with the system to sit down and explain it."
Enter Mrs. Schoenholtz to set the record straight. Medicare "is not a charitable organization," she says, her voice rising and her arms waving for emphasis. "It's a form of insurance you've been paying for all your life, or your spouse has."
She has collected a folder full of letters from appreciative clients. Typical is the one from Cosmo Cavaluzzo, an elderly man from Flushing, thanking the hospital for her work "in behalf of seniors who find the complexity of Medicare benefits puzzling and beyond comprehension."
The rules may be Byzantine, but Mrs. Schoenholtz's view of her job is straightforward: "They all come here because they're not getting their money. And I am going to try to find out why they're not getting it."
 
Learning the Union Language
 Monday mornings it sounds like a really good party is going on upstairs in the light-filled town house on East 69th Street that is the headquarters of the English Speaking Union. But there is no tea or crumpets. Instead, the buzz is English in Action, 40 or so volunteers and their students, immigrants who have come to this place of flowered armchairs and fox-hunting prints to improve their English.
Most speak a little English, but have no one to talk to or answer their questions about the baffling American dialect. There is Yoneko Sawamoto, who labors hard to read the union's newsletter but can speak volumes about her 2-year-old grandson Manabu's recent visit to New York and has invited her teachers over for sushi.
There is Marian Drozdza, a maintenance man from Poland who carries an electronic Polish-English dictionary to class in its battered Styrofoam packing shell.
And there is Gilda Zapata, who left her young daughter with her mother in Paraguay to take a job as a housekeeper on Park Avenue.
The volunteers range from retired executives to office workers. Some are working to ease their boredom, others to ease their pain.
Pearle Rosenblatt, a silver-haired resident of the Upper East Side, got involved after her husband died.
"My husband several years ago discovered that they served afternoon tea here," she said, "and he thought this would be a nice thing for me. And after he died, I had to have something to do. I had kept the telephone number all that time, but I had never used it."
Call she did. Now, for two hours every Monday, she volunteers with people like Gilda Zapata.
"Gilda is naughty," Mrs. Rosenblatt teased, as her student smiled. "She doesn't speak as much as she ought to, except when we're discussing recipes."
For Miss Zapata, improving her English is essential to doing a good job and getting around New York.
"It's very important to learn English in here," she said, meaning the United States.
Since arriving two years ago, she has struggled with the language even as she mastered cooking turkey with shiitake-mushroom dressing at Thanksgiving. Her employers sent her to the English Speaking Union, and now, she and Mrs. Rosenblatt sit beneath a window, the Union Jack flapping on a staff outside, and discuss everything from the climate in Caraguatay, the town where Miss Zapata lived, to Mrs. Rosenblatt's past problems with noisy upstairs neighbors.
"I walk along the sidewalk smiling after class because Gilda makes me happy," Mrs. Rosenblatt said. "She is a lovely young girl, and she's trying so hard to perfect her English."
"I like this," said Miss Zapata, adding that she hopes, within a few years, to return to Paraguay, marry her boyfriend and open a grocery store.
 
With AIDS, and With Hope
 More than a decade into the AIDS epidemic, there is no cure; there is much despair and desperation. But as the disease reaches ever deeper into the life of the city, more and more New Yorkers are volunteering to stem its spread and to improve the lives of people with AIDS.
Some have AIDS themselves. Others have lost friends, lovers, relatives. Some work in parts of the city where, they say, they still struggle to bring the basics of prevention to the people around them.
"I have a big problem with the amount of people out here who still do not know even the little simple things, like what do the letters H.I.V. stand for," said Dennis Merrill, a 43-year-old former intravenous drug user who has AIDS and lectures at detoxification centers, schools and churches through Bronx AIDS Services, a South Bronx nonprofit agency that serves about 10,000 people a year and has about 115 volunteers, nearly all from the neighborhood.
Yolanda Emanuel, a mother of four grown children from the South Bronx, found out she had the virus five years ago and is now wheelchair-bound with peripheral neuropathy, an AIDS-related condition that has paralyzed her legs. Still, she volunteers four days a week at Bronx AIDS Services as a buddy, comforting people over the phone, and as a baby sitter for other clients.
"We were all born to die, and I just know when," said Ms. Emanuel, who is 40 years old. Volunteering helps distract her and helps others as well, she said.
"You get to meet a lot of different people from all walks of life. If I just sit down and cry, that does not accomplish anything. Let me let everybody know I was here. I can do that by touching other people and letting other people touch me."
As a mother facing death, she often counsels other fearful parents who are trying to plan for their children's care after they are gone.
"A lot of times while making a living will they realize, 'I am going to die,' " she said. As someone who has been through the same trauma, she is an especially empathetic listener. "You share your experiences with them," she said, "and let them know they are not alone."
Comfort can take many forms. Inside a storefront salon in the West Village the other day, Christopher Gerard, a former actor, was having his hair daubed with bleach, wrapped in aluminum foil and secured with bobby pins. In the end, he looked perfectly coiffed and just a little bit blonder, thanks to Paul Freely, a hairdresser who donates his craft to people like Mr. Gerard, who has had AIDS for seven years.
"I can't overemphasize how good he makes you feel," said Mr. Gerard, 47. "This is definitely not the dentist." He counts 105 close friends cut down by the disease and signs his letters, "I'm still here," after five bouts of pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma. If his hair is right, he believes, it helps people accept him and not think, "This is someone who's just checked out."
Mr. Freely, who is 27, never knew anyone with AIDS until he arrived in New York four years ago from England, he said. A colleague at his first job had AIDS, and out of that experience, Mr. Freely approached the Actors Fund, which runs a series of volunteer programs for theater people with AIDS.
Now Mr. Freely, who does not have H.I.V., ministers to AIDS patients at the Village storefront. He refuses to insult them, he says, by wearing gloves or a mask when he cuts their hair. Of the 50 or so people with AIDS he has served, "a good two-thirds of them have died."
"But I continue to do my work with their spirits," he added, "which helps me not to feel so sad. It's also the greatest motivational force to continue with the work."
He ran a comb through Mr. Gerard's hair and unclipped his smock. "So now you look like a California boy," he said. "The sun has kissed your hair, Christopher Gerard."
"Thank you, God," breathed Mr. Gerard. "Thank you, Paul."

A Rare Measure Of the Benefits Of Bureaucracy

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine the benefits generated from the daily crush of humanity that for years descended on the Department of Motor Vehicles office in downtown Jamaica. The jostling was unnerving. The long lines were infuriating. And the waits seemed eternal.
But the office at 165th Street evolved into a neighborhood bulwark, drawing hundreds of people from throughout the borough into local restaurants and shops each day on their way to or from renewing their driver's licenses or registering their cars. 
 The benefits are clear to business leaders and merchants, who are now facing their loss, as the state agency begins scaling down the office in Jamaica and adding two offices in Springfield Gardens and College Point. The two new offices, which will offer the normal motor vehicles services, will hold hearings on traffic summonses and be equipped to warn clients how long a wait to expect.
Reverberations from the agency's simple shift, which is meant to reduce aggravation for New York's motorists by minimizing waits, reveal the delicate economic ecology of New York City urban centers like downtown Jamaica, which have long relied on the bustle and traffic generated by public agencies.
"The decision makes a great deal of sense for their customers," said Bob Richards, the president of the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce. "But it's not going to affect this area in a positive way. It's little decisions like this that have the longest range impact on an area's economic development."
But if merchants fear the loss of customers, they understand the department's drive to keep its clients satisfied. So no one in the area is actively protesting the reduction.
But the office has been such a vital institution in the area that business leaders have in recent months been pressing officials at the state agency to maintain a "significant presence" in Jamaica.
"To completely lose an institution that has such countywide reach would certainly diminish Jamaica's role," said Carlisle Towery, the president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, which has for years lobbied city, state and Federal agencies to support downtown Jamaica's economic interests with public projects. "We just don't want that to happen," he added.
For years, Jamaica had the only Department of Motor Vehicles office in the borough, handling as many as 1,500 transactions a day. Officials at the agency expect that the office in Jamaica will be handling about 500 transactions a day once the two other offices are operating fully.

Fiscal Weapon To Fight Decay

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
White Plains Road in Pelham Parkway has changed very little in a generation, a modest cluster of pizza parlors, boutiques, a kosher deli and newsstands that has retained its neighborly character even as other sections of the borough have declined.
In an effort to retain that flavor, a group of landlords and merchants are seeking to establish a business improvement district -- one of those tools of self-reliance that neighborhoods throughout New York City have used to insure, among other things, safer and cleaner streets. 
 Last month, Community Board 11 approved the application by the local group, called Community Merchants of Pelham Parkway, to establish the district -- the neighborhood's first and the borough's second.
The district, financed by assessments levied on business owners within its boundaries, would be responsible for maintaining the five-block stretch along White Plains Road from Brady Avenue to Pelham Parkway South, which includes more than a hundred small shops and businesses.
The application is still awaiting review from the office of Borough President Fernando Ferrer and the Department of City Planning. If approved, the organization could begin operating as early as next summer, with a $65,000 budget in its first year.
Under state law, landlords are required to pay the improvement district an annual tax, based on the value of their property, for services that range from sanitation and security to promotion and holiday decorations.
In an area that in recent years has faced quality-of-life problems like graffiti, vandalism and illegal street vending, the proposal for establishing the new district provoked virtually no opposition.
"The merchants and property owners on White Plains Road are committed to this area," said Thomas Lucania, the district manager for Community Board 11. "There are people who have worked and made their entire lives there."
The group's major goals include luring more shoppers into the area with newspaper advertising as well as increasing sanitation along the strip with additional trash bins and private collection service.
Members have also discussed the possibility of taking over the operation and maintenance of a municipal parking lot on White Plains Road near Lydig Avenue that often goes unused because of poor security.
"We've been able to maintain a high quality of merchants and merchandise here," Mr. Lucania added. "And that's what we hope to continue to do."

Ruling May Keep Incinerator Cold

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
An administrative law judge reviewing the city's application to upgrade and reopen the Shore Road incinerator has ruled that hearings on its potential emissions must be held before any permits are granted.
The city's Corporation Counsel has appealed the ruling, which could delay the reopening for years. 
 With the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island near capacity, New York City is desperately hunting for ways to deal with the 10,931 tons of garbage it generates on an average day. The city's only operating incinerator is in Greenpoint, but another, after a long battle, is planned for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, in Williamsburg. And recycling so far only copes with a fraction of the city's garbage.
The 20-page ruling, by Judge Daniel O'Connell for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, determined that the city failed to consider the environmental impact of the proposed incinerator and ordered hearings on the incinerator's safety levels to be held in 1995.
The lengthy process of applying for operating permits cannot begin until after those hearings, and only after the permits are granted can work begin on upgrading the incinerator.
The incinerator, at 26th Avenue and Shore Parkway, closed three years ago and was scheduled to reopen with new equipment in 1996, to burn 750 tons of trash daily.
Residents have opposed the reopening of the incinerator, which burned up to 1,000 tons of waste a day for 31 years, saying it caused abnormally high rates of cancer and respiratory illness in the area.
"This is definitely a win on our part," said Carmine Santa Maria, chairman of the Citizens Opposing Unhealthy Gas Hazards -- known by its acronym, Cough -- which had been asking the city to conduct an environmental impact study for months.
And in a move to keep the incinerator closed, lawyers for the New York Public Interest Research Group appealed Judge O'Connell's ruling last week, saying that the economic analysis of the $75 million project was flawed.

To Lure Regular Patrons, Brewery Offers an M.B.A.
 Manhattan Brewing Company is offering an M.B.A. degree, a Master of Beer Appreciation, and 400 people have signed up for the program. The microbrewery-cum-restaurant in SoHo charges registrants $20, and they must take three of four classes, covering the history of beer and how it is brewed. One class is a tasting of 15 varieties of the company's beers; it brews and sells 25 to 28 barrels of beer a week. 
 Garrett Oliver, the brew master, said he started the M.B.A. program in November because a growing number of patrons, including many women (73 percent of those taking the course are female), were showing an interest in beer beyond drinking it. He also sees the program, he said, as a way to attract more regular patrons.

A Newcomer Takes Over At Red Hook Terminal
Since 1981, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has leased the Red Hook Container Terminal in Brooklyn from the City of New York, and then leased the site to the Universal Maritime Service Corporation to handle the day-to-day operations of the docks. Last week a new company, American Stevedoring of Elizabeth, N.J., took on that task, signing a seven-year lease with the Port Authority.
The Red Hook terminal generally serves smaller steamship lines, mainly from the Middle East, Europe and Asia. In 1992 the terminal's seven berths handled 53,000 containers.
 
At This Women's Group, Bring 2 Business Leads
Women on the Fast Track, a networking group founded in 1990, starts another year of monthly meetings on Tuesday with just under 100 members and plans to set up chapters in Dallas, Albuquerque, N.M., and Jacksonville, Fla.
Fast Track is not a support group and does not offer lectures, said Lucy Rosen, its founder and the owner of the Business Development Group, a Manhattan-based marketing and consulting firm. It is intended to meet the practical needs of women in businesses like accounting, advertising and banking. At meetings, the members discuss their particular business needs -- a company to do inexpensive binding, for example, or a new site for their organization's operations. Members are required to bring at least two tips to each session -- an answer to an earlier query, say, or the name and number of a good environmental lawyer.
The group's networking also leads to assignments for members, Ms. Rosen said, adding, "There isn't a client I have who isn't using a member." Membership costs $100 a year, and an introductory meeting is scheduled for 6 P.M. Tuesday. For information, (718) 832-0140.

Free Classes for Women In Nontraditional Fields
 Many of the first graduates of a free program that teaches women to be electronics technicians are now working as cable television installers and electricians. Applications are currently be taken for this year's classes. The program, first offered by New York City Technical College in September 1992, includes 600 hours of classroom and laboratory work as well as courses in preparing for job interviews.
The classes are underwritten by city and state grants as part of economic development programs for low-income workers or those who have been laid off. Participants must have eighth-grade reading and math skills.

Save the Neighborhood. Fix the Pudding.

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
THE day was not going well for Seymour Siegel, a food manufacturer who produces, among other things, 1 million pounds of coleslaw and 1.5 million pounds of potato salad every day.
First, the shrimp was not fresh. His son Richard, the company's chief executive, had just rejected 9,000 pounds of it, delaying by a day the preparation of thousands of shrimp salads.
Then at noon he learned that his noodle pudding, based on a heavenly recipe from his mother, Jean, was too thick, and ordered about 30 pounds of it thrown away. 
 While such problems are not uncommon in food manufacturing, Mr. Siegel, the 64-year-old head of Blue Ridge Farms, a multimillion-dollar company based in East New York, Brooklyn, takes an intense interest. Every day, he and his employees taste-test dozens of their products.
"I told the chef I wanted it to be firm," said Mr. Siegel, pushing away a plate of the yellow pudding as he sat in the company cafeteria. "Now it's too firm. If he keeps playing with my mother's recipe I'm going to have to hurt him."
Then, with a big laugh, he added, "It's so thick you can cut it with an ax."
Mr. Siegel, head of the 40-year-old, family-run operation, is known as a feisty character who gets things done with a rough-and-tumble sense of humor, a sharp business edge and a strong commitment to his 200-plus products.
But he has also been described by parents at a nearby intermediate school as a selfish mogul who will stop at nothing to earn a dollar, because he fought for years to acquire a piece of land for expansion where a new school was to be built.
Blue Ridge Farms is the third largest manufacturer in Brooklyn, home to 2,698 such companies. It is also one of the more than 12,000 manufacturers that remain in New York City even as thousands of others have either failed or moved to cities offering large plots of land, inexpensive utility rates and low taxes. The company's success is due in part to its ability to swiftly fill gaps left by food manufacturers that have disappeared.
Over the years, the company has seen revenues grow, grossing $10 million in 1980 and $70 million in 1993. Mr. Siegel's creamy potato, macaroni, shrimp and potato salads, chopped liver and knishes are sold largely to distributors; they fill the deli counters of major supermarkets and delicatessens throughout New York City, 37 states, the Caribbean, Mexico, Canada and France. Because many local supermarkets sell his products under their own labels, Mr. Siegel would not name them. But his food can be found under the Blue Ridge Farms label at Costco and other food clubs, he said.
With an annual payroll of $18 million for 600 workers -- 80 percent of whom come from the community -- Blue Ridge Farms has become a vital component in the neighborhood, which has one of the city's highest unemployment rates. The company is a certified business within the state-designated East New York enterprise zone, one of 19 such areas across the state set up to lure businesses and jobs through tax credits and other incentives.
It was not long ago, though, that Mr. Siegel was threatening to leave East New York, the very place he and his business came of age. He wanted to expand his business into the lot next door, but the site had been earmarked by the Board of Education for a replacement school.
For years, the board would not budge, even though Mr. Siegel offered in a trade a slightly larger plot of land that he uses for truck parking. Community and education leaders resisted because they thought the move would delay construction of a replacement for Intermediate School 171, which has been operating at 150 percent of capacity, with more than 1,400 students.
But the swap was approved on Oct. 29 by School Board 19 and announced by Mayor Dinkins in a flurry of last-minute campaign stops. The agreement was reached only after intervention by Mr. Dinkins, the state Urban Development Corporation and the city Economic Development Corporation, whose officers said the city could not afford to lose more major employers. Accompanying the swap was $2 million in tax credits and other incentives from the city and state for Blue Ridge Farms. The replacement school is to be built at the parking site that Mr. Siegel had offered earlier.
WHILE Mr. Siegel's image may have been marred by the land dispute, there is no question about what his business has done for the portion of East New York surrounding his business, at 3301 Atlantic Avenue. Besides bringing in badly needed jobs, Blue Ridge Farms has breathed new life into the community, with bodegas, beauty parlors, small clothing stores and restaurants springing up on once-barren landscapes. During lunch hour, neighborhood avenues are dotted with workers wearing the trademark Blue Ridge Farms uniform -- a blue doctor's jacket -- as they eat and shop.
But crime is a major problem for Mr. Siegel, who spends a total of $400,000 on security every year, $250,000 of it for guards, in this the 75th Precinct, which has had a record-setting number of homicides this year.
"This company can do well anywhere, so it's not important that I stay here for that reason," Mr. Siegel said. "My reason for wanting to stay here is because I grew up in this section of Brooklyn. This is home."
A high school dropout, Mr. Siegel sold dentures door-to-door in East New York at a time when the sidewalks were lined with neat Dutch and English row houses inhabited by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Then he landed a job in a poultry store and soon opened his own shops.
"I was up to my arms in chicken livers," said Mr. Siegel, who moved to Nassau County, L.I., soon after his business took off. "My mother chopped some up, put it on a cracker and offered it to customers to taste. It went over well."
To broaden business, Mr. Siegel incorporated many more of his mother's recipes, which had been handed down for generations and perfected as she fed a husband, who worked as a plumber, and three sons. Before long, he was making enough food and money to expand. He borrowed $1,800 from his younger brother, Martin, a doctor, and $3,200 from his father to buy a 25,000-square-foot factory on Astoria Boulevard. After operating there for a few years, he moved to his current address.
The business is run mostly by family. In addition to his son Richard, Mr. Siegel's eldest child, Jeffrey, also works for the company, as president. Martin Siegel is the company doctor.
Back in the cafeteria, Mr. Siegel was grappling with the problem of the noodle pudding, his taste buds working for him. In walked Franco Vitellozzi, the chief chef. Mr. Siegel motioned for him to come over. They hugged before sitting down.
"Franco, when it was too soft, we had to take some of the oil out and add eggs," Mr. Siegel said as the two sat there like teacher and student. "Now it's too firm and we've got to get all those eggs out of there, and start over again."
Mr. Vitellozzi nodded.

HEADLINE: Among the Dying Species Are Lost Tribes of Mankind

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
NINETEEN NINETY-THREE was supposed to be the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. But as it drew to a close, the vulnerabilities of aboriginal people remained as serious as ever. They hold on desperately to ancestral lands now coveted by others. They do not fit in, as the dominant others would say, and see no reason why they should, for which they are paying a dreadful price. Some are being massacred and terrorized. Many are being forced off their lands, scattered into cities and to economically and culturally impoverished lives for which they have little taste and no preparation.
These people are the endangered of the human species, survivors whose continued survival is very much in doubt. 
 Their exact number is not known, except that it must be fewer with each passing year -- now an estimated 300 million indigenous people in 70 countries. Amnesty International says they are among the "most defenseless of all the victims of human rights violations." Their plight is worldwide and becoming especially acute in places where the march of economic development and resource exploitation tramples on their once-isolated domains, leading to disease, bloodshed and despair.
Racism in the spirit of the 19th-century slogan "the only good Indian is a dead Indian" inflames the conflict. "If you can persuade yourself that people who stand in your way are savages, you can rationalize gunning them down and forcing them to adapt to your purposes," said Dr. David Maybury-Lewis, a Harvard anthropologist and founder of Cultural Survival, an advocacy group in Cambridge, Mass.
More widespread and respectable is the economic argument that a few people should not be allowed to hold up development. And it worries governments to have so many ethnic groups potentially unsettling the body politic.
The conflict is reaching crisis proportions in Brazil, which has been steadily pushing back its frontier in the vast Amazon basin. It is like watching a rerun of how the American West was won, at the expense of the Indians. Ranchers and settlers have invaded Indian lands, followed by landless rural workers. Most settlers are armed, the ranchers have hired gunmen and in many places they outnumber the Indians.
A gold rush into the remote territory of the Yanomami Indians near the Venezuelan border has brought in thousands of miners, introducing deadly malaria, destroying the rainforest, polluting streams and provoking confrontation. The Yanomami population, 10,000 in 1986, is rapidly declining, and anthropologists predict the people could be annihilated in the next 10 years. In August, miners massacred 70 Yanomami men, women and children.
A new onslaught has begun on the lands of the Awa-Guaja Indians and the supposedly protected Alto Turiacu and Caru reserves in Northern Maranhao. The human rights commission of the American Anthropological Association says the Awa-Guaja, the last forest nomads in Amazonia, face extinction from the invasion of ranchers and settlers. Their lands have just been set aside as a preserve, but often this has not stopped the invasion.
Although Brazil's Constitution guarantees Indians' rights to their traditional lands, Amnesty International says the authorities "have consistently failed to prevent the abuses or to investigate them effectively." In this century, 90 of the country's 270 Indian tribes have completely disappeared.
Elsewhere, the picture is also bleak. In Guatemala, the army's counter-insurgency campaign has claimed the lives of thousands of non-combatant Indians. In north Borneo, loggers have destroyed the forests and game of the Penan, a tribe of hunter-gatherers. In the mountains of Myanmar, formerly Burma, the Karen, Mon, Shan and Kayah are victims of relentless violence by the army, which sweeps into villages and seizes people for forced labor.
For the Tuareg, the blue-painted nomads of the Sahara who had many a fight with the French, the end of colonial rule, paradoxically, brought them less independence. When the desert was divided into several independent states, the Tuareg found themselves boxed in by new borders and hostile military regimes. Without the freedom to move their herds to faraway water holes, as many as 125,000 of the one million Tuareg starved to death in the drought of the 1970's. Out of frustration, Tuareg insurgents have attacked government forces of Niger and Mali and taken hostages, provoking the armies into bloody reprisals on hundreds of Tuareg civilians.
To many indigenous people the threat is not so much physical destruction as cultural extinction. Governments are putting increasing pressure on them to assimilate by resettling them away from lands where they were self-sufficient, teaching them in a language not their own and converting them to the dominant religion. A campaign to convert to Islam was initiated last year against the beleaguered hunter-gatherers of the Malay Peninsula, known collectively as the Orang Asli, or original people.
An unhappy fate awaits such people. "Take away their land, their trees, the Orang Asli will no longer be able to support themselves or maintain their distinctive culture," said Dr. Robert K. Dentan , an anthropologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo. "They will become either dependents of the state or a kind of landless proletariat, low-wage laborers at the very bottom of society."
Because of civil war, encroachment by ranchers and prospectors and murderous oppression, the Bushmen of southern Africa are already as close to cultural extinction as any indigenous people. Traditionally nomads of the arid plains, the Bushmen have all but lost their skills to live as hunter-gatherers and also their self-esteem.
"They are a tattered remnant clinging to the edges of the industrialized world," wrote Laurens Van der Post, a scholar who has lived among the Bushmen. "We have failed to recognize that in their own context their values have as much validity as our own. We have also failed to recognize that until we came to southern Africa they had a way of life that worked. We did not. Now neither they nor we have a way of life that truly works."
Would it matter to the world at large if some of these cultures vanished?
One argument for preserving human diversity, said Dr. Terence Turner, a University of Chicago anthropologist, is utilitarian. Many of these remote tribes possess irreplaceable knowledge of their ecosystems, including the medicinal uses of plants and the practical aspects of surviving in a difficult environment. Modern people have met disaster attempting to develop these areas, and could learn from these survivors.
On a more humanitarian level, Dr. Turner said, "People simply have a right to determine the meaning of their own lives and should not be forced to 'fit in.' "
In a few cases, indigenous people have reached satisfactory accommodations with their more powerful neighbors. The Kuna Indians of Panama, for example, are doing well controlling their own land and economy, and in Ecuador, the Shuar Federation is serving as a model for Amazonian tribes seeking greater autonomy.
Slowly, anthropologists say, public attitudes toward humans rights are changing, and with this in mind, organizations like the World Bank are setting conditions on loans for development to preserve the environment and indigenous people. "In the 20th century, you just can't ride in and shoot 'em up," Dr. Maybury-Lewis said. "If you do, the information gets around in the world quickly, and the shock and outrage can put pressure on countries to come to the defense of their people who are fighting hard to defend their traditions."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
For Cities in Middle Age, Growing Pains Are Real

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY assumed its current shape 96 years ago in a joyous consolidation of Manhattan and the Bronx with the City of Brooklyn, Staten Island and the area now called Queens. Around much of the country, cities still routinely annex neighboring areas. But for New York, such expansion is now unthinkable, and in fact city government may go the way of Yugoslavia. In November, Staten Island residents voted to secede, and Queens has a small secessionist movement too.
Why are some voices in the nation's biggest city saying, "Smaller is better"? And why is this happening even as younger places, particularly in the Sunbelt, are successfully using the grow-your-own-city technique that New York employed at the last turn of the century? 
 The short answer: New York is old and aging. For a city still growing into virgin territory, there are advantages, for the psyche and the tax rolls, in expanding its borders. But if growth stops and the municipal budget turns sour, some residents try to bail out.
Cities, it appears, can have life cycles no less dramatic than those of caterpillars or frogs, changing form as they age. If Marx had focused on the economies and politics of municipal governments rather than national ones, he might have discerned a pattern of money and politics driving each other at the local level, from expansion to stasis to, in extreme cases, breakup.
In the same month as the Staten Island referendum, Houston annexed three areas and Manchester, a small suburb west of St. Louis, moved toward doubling its size through annexation. And Everett, near Seattle, said it wanted to annex an area called Murphy's Corner. Outside the Northeast, annexations around the country are scarcely news.
But not only New York is showing strains. New Haven has a separatist movement, and Toronto's 30-year-old metropolitan government, long held up as a model of rational consolidation, is under fire.
When it was young, New York pursued growth, a popular trend around the turn of the century, in parallel with a growing economy. It worked until the city butted up against municipalities that did not want to be absorbed.
"Back when New York was doing it, some other places like Philadelphia and New Orleans and San Francisco were doing it; it was sort of the popular thing to do in the late 1800's," said Bruce D. McDowell, head of government policy research at the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.
 
'A Tower of Strength'
 In those days, size itself was valued. "The name of a great city is a tower of strength," said a report on municipal consolidation prepared as a lobbying tool for Manhattan in the mid-1890's. "There is no good reason why this community and the country should not have the benefit of such prestige," the report went on. "Magnitude is not a thing of vapory dimensions, but a solid, substantial and determining factor, of which it would be folly to deny ourselves the advantage in important issues."
Annexation captured the increase in value that came to property where there had been improvements -- in those days, bridges. A larger city could collect taxes on both sides of the river, raising revenues from newly-valuable land. "The tax benefits of building those bridges were mostly enjoyed by the governments of Brooklyn and Queens, because land values would go up immensely once those bridges were built," said Roger Starr of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.
Those days are long gone. Since the early 1900's, according to Mr. McDowell, there have been fewer than 20 consolidations. And when cities lost the ability to expand, they lost the ability to rope in all the growth in their regions.
Now the older cities are in a different phase. Growth stops, and municipal budget pressures intensify, and residents look around to see if they would do better in a smaller unit, perhaps with fewer of the poor. In New Haven, residents of the prosperous East Shore section have organized under the slogan, "Secede to Survive."
 
When Needs Change
 "When economies are great, every municipality wants to build itself up, and there is very little competition because everyone is happy," said Robert M. Wright, a professor at the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of Toronto. When money is tight, he said, "there is a notion of the need to fragment."
That is the case in Toronto, where the metropolitan government handles roads, transit and other region-wide issues, but suburbanites say they carry too much of the tax load.
Sunbelt cities still use public works to add value. New subdivisions tie into central water and sewer systems, making development feasible -- and making sure that development happens inside the city, not outside.
David P. Rusk, an author and former mayor of Albuquerque, said New Mexico had given his city a veto over construction of water and sewer systems within five miles of its borders, preventing development without the city's acquiescence. Albuquerque, founded early in the 18th century, had a long infancy. Mr. Rush said it has grown to 150 square miles today from three square miles in 1940. Ah, to be young again, municipally speaking.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Now, Home Is Where the Job Is

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF the image of our past, whether based on myth or reality, is that the United States welcomed immigrants, we're losing our remaining illusions. Data compiled by the Federal Census Bureau and other demographers indicate that for immigrants, the welcome wagon is often flanked by a "For Sale" sign."
The figures show that, with a few notable exceptions, states that are magnets to immigrants are becoming less attractive to native-born citizens and are either losing population or not growing as fast as they once were. 
 California, as it so often is, appears to be the trendsetter.
Figures out last week from the Census Bureau (and counting only legal immigrants) show that for the year that ended July 1, 1993, California grew more slowly than the nation as a whole for the first time in 20 years. Indeed, if it were not for immigrants, the state would have had virtually no growth.
But California is not alone. According to a study by University of Michigan's Population Studies Center, New York, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois and Massachusetts, which led the nation in the numbers of immigrants in the late 1980's, have seen significant exodus, primarily of whites.
Of course, the idea of people bailing out in the face of a wave of newcomers who look and talk differently is not new. Over the years, the flavors of countless neighborhoods in old Eastern cities have shifted, say, from German to Irish to Italian to Eastern European Jews to black to Latino. But recent studies suggest that the flight is no longer merely from city to suburb, but from one state to another.
"There seems to be something about those states that attracts immigrants from abroad but does not attract people from within the United States," said Edwin Byerly, an analyst with the Census Bureau.
But the question arises whether the exodus of blue-collar whites from places like California, New York or Illinois is a reaction to immigrants or to anemic economies.
A study on internal migration patterns among whites and minorities during the late 1980's by William H. Frey, a University of Michigan researcher, indicates that states like Ohio, Oklahoma, Michigan and Louisiana, which have not drawn many immigrants, still have experienced a kind of white flight. In these cases, whites could just as easily been leaving because of the continued problems in the automobile or energy industries.
"I think the economic factors tend to be the most important," said Jeffrey Passel, director of the Program for Research on Immigration Policy at the Urban Institute. "Whether the people moving out are responding to better opportunities at the destination, or increased competition at the point of origin, I don't know. And it's tough to separate the two."
Larry Long, a demographer with the Census Bureau, also emphasized the importance of job opportunities in patterns of migration. "In the early decades of the 20th century, you had massive numbers of immigrants flowing into New York, New Jersey and other parts of the East Coast," he said. "But you had minimum numbers of outmigration from these areas, and the reason was the economy in the region was growing."
While the public perception of the current exodus is that of yuppie flight from the fast lanes of Manhattan or Century City heading for the easier pace and fresh air of the Rockies or the desert Southwest, further sifting of the data suggests that those pulling up stakes are, for the most part, working-class and middle-income whites and minorities.
But their incomes have often been achieved with with minimal education or skills -- in other words, they are among those groups that most often compete with immigrants for low-skill, low-wage jobs. The vast majority of departing whites hold no more than a high school diploma.
"The lower middle class, people making less than $35,000 a year, are squeezed out of the jobs at the lower end of the spectrum," said Mr. Frey.
 
Boom or Blip?
 For now, the number of whites moving out of these states is still small relative to the population as a whole, indicating that what is occurring may be the beginning of a trend or nothing more than a statistical blip, rather than a full-blown movement akin to America's westward expansion in the 19th century or the northward trek of Southern blacks in the 20th.
But some people, especially those pressing for immigration limits, believe that if the trend continues it portends a new kind of national segregation, one in which minorities and immigrants, who more often than not are also nonwhite, would be concentrated in a few states while places like Oregon, Washington, Utah, Arizona and Nevada become even more white.
"Places like California and New York will become even more different from the rest of the country than they already have been," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that has argued for greatly reducing the numbers of immigrants.
The migration could also produce a group of sullen whites, and some blacks, who perceive that they have been forced out of a job market and compelled to uproot themselves as a result of competition by immigrants from Latin America and Asia.
In his study, Mr. Frey said a "negative reaction" of whites "to an increasingly diverse population" is a prime factor for the movement away from states with large numbers of immigrants.
As it grows such a group could become a political force that would not only be against further immigration but any Federal initiative, from foreign aid to the North American Free Trade Agreement, that smacks of helping people from beyond America's borders. And would that change what America is and how it thinks of itself?

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Add Gun Buybacks To the Public Wish List

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
IT may have started as a holiday exercise in wishful thinking. But last week, as a "toys for guns" exchange in Manhattan's embattled Washington Heights continued to draw in scores of weapons each day, grizzled police veterans were becoming believers and even the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had joined in, laying plans to sponsor similar programs in other cities.
Before Christmas, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelley had compared the new program to chicken soup: can't do any harm. But his tone changed as the guns poured in in response to a local businessman's offer of a $100 Toys-R-Us gift certificate for each surrendered weapon, on top of $75 in cash offered from an existing city gun-purchase program. "I'm converted," the Police Commissioner told reporters. "Sometimes chicken soup works." 
 The N.A.A.C.P. saw the buoyant response as a glimmer of sanity in a culture of urban violence that is especially devastating to blacks. Other private sponsers have gotten on board, with makers and sellers of athletic shoes and even Dial-A-Mattress pledging gift certificates for their products. And there was talk in Congress of tax breaks for corporations that contribute.
Gun-purchase programs have been tried over the years in many cities, with varied results. In New York City, the standing cash-for-guns program had yielded modest numbers of guns; somehow, this new combination of toys, Christmas, private leadership, tabloid frenzy and a general desperation about gunfire has worked magic, drawing in some 550 guns in the first eight days of the program, which began Dec. 22.
In Dallas, too, an offer of coveted goods -- tickets to Cowboys games -- seemed to pull in more weapons than cash alone. Still, probably the most spectacular response yet to any gun buying program involved cash only. In St. Louis in the fall of 1991, the police over a one-month period collected 7,547 guns by offering $50 for handguns and $25 for rifles. But the program was not continued, a St. Louis police official said last week, for one reason: money. The cost had been $351,000, and no police department can sustain that level of spending for long.
Corporate donations may help support the new programs, but the question of costs and benefits remains. It is easy to be skeptical. After all, what difference does it make to melt down a few thousand guns in a country owning 200 million of them? And nobody thinks criminals are selling off the tools of their trade.
Buyback proponents point instead to more modest possible benefits. Fewer guns in dresser drawers, they say, may mean fewer accidental shootings, fewer crimes of passion, fewer guns stolen for later use in crime and reduced chances of teenagers grabbing household weapons to settle scores. "Taking guns out of circulation is a good thing in itself," said Jeffrey Y. Muchnick, legislative director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
But some criminologists are unenthusiastic about gun purchase programs, arguing that resources could be better spent and warning about possible unintended consequences.
Lawrence W. Sherman, a professor at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute, said gun buybacks would have to be coupled with a national ban on new sales of handguns, or at least of the semiautomatic pistols wreaking the most havoc, to do any good over the long term. "Otherwise," he said, "taking guns out of circulation in the face of constant market demand unwittingly subsidizes the gun industry."
Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke University, studies the economics of street guns and warns that the entry of a major new gun buyer, albeit the police department, can have unforseen effects.
"You can't see this as exempt from normal market processes," he said. Between vouchers and cash, a person could get $175 for a gun last week in New York, well above the retail price of many new handguns. Dr. Cook says buyback programs may encourage gun thefts, with government serving, in effect, as a reliable fence. Such programs also give offenders a profitable way to dispose of weapons used in crimes, he said.
On the positive side, Dr. Cook said that if a sustained gun-purchase program were to succeed in raising the floor price for privately traded guns in a community, some teenagers seeking illegal guns could be priced out of the market. But this would be achieved at enormous expense, he added, raising questions about the best use of resources. In New York City, at least, where restrictive laws have already prompted black market prices of $250 to $300 for pistols retailing in the South for $39, and prices of $500 or more for higher-quality weapons, that floor would have to be quite high to seriously alter the market.
At best, a gun-purchase program nibbles at the edges of gun violence. "The central problem of criminal justice is not just to get the guns off the street, but to get the gunmen off the street," said Thomas Reppetto, a former police officer and head of the private Citizen's Crime Commission in New York. He calls for more aggressive enforcement of the gun laws, using specially trained gun squads to identify and arrest gun carriers, drawing on knowledge gleaned by community police officers.
Still, whatever their weak points, buybacks are here and happening. Even skeptics have to appreciate their symbolic value in dispirited neighborhoods; responses like the one elicited in Washington Heights suggest that people have had it with senseless killings. "You work on many fronts at once," Mr. Repetto said. "What's most impressive about Washington Heights is the outpouring of community sentiment against guns. That's even more impressive than the numbers of guns turned in."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Dynamic New China Still Races Against Time

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
THERE is not an adjective that soars high enough or detonates with enough force to describe China's economic explosion or the promise of its future. One-fifth of humanity, for decades locked in the dungeon of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolution, where they were whipped and exhausted by meaningless mass movements, are now fully unleashed in an epic pursuit of material wealth.
Coming off two years of 13 percent economic growth, China's is the fastest-growing economy in the world. And in the last 12 months, capitalists from more than 40 countries have signed contracts worth $100 billion to build new industries and open new markets . 
 The Chinese are buying, building and consuming as if there were no tomorrow. Their cheap labor is the magnet of their profit-making capacity and the income from this dynamic laboring class and its entrepreneurial leaders is creating a mammoth market for the world's industrial powers. Textile and shoe manufacturing, consumer electronics and toy factories -- all are coming here because, as one industrialist said recently, the cost of labor in China, compared to other costs of production, is effectively zero on an industrial balance sheet.
The ignition of this great economic engine has conferred upon China new importance as the regional superpower, a potential ally or adversary to Japan, to a united Korea or to the rim countries of Southeast Asia. But how steady is China's historic rise and how long can its economic engine roar? That is the question some of China's leading scientists and economists are beginning to utter in public.
China at the end of the century is in a race against time, a race against the rapid depletion of the country's natural resources and the demands of its own population explosion. As Professor Zhou Guangzhao, the head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in a recent interview, "China as a whole is weak in ecological stability and society has not realized the seriousness of this problem."
Add to this the pent-up political frustration of China's growing entrepreneurial class, whose wealth has yet to buy participation in decision-making by the Communist Party leadership, and the outline of China's challenge begins to take shape.
Whether in politics or economics, China's future could be far more turbulent than the current get-rich investment climate suggests. Last fall, after his third visit to China, the American economist Milton Friedman confessed to "very mixed feelings" about China's prospects. "Never in the history of the world has a totalitarian state successfully converted itself into a free market economy," he said during a talk with Hong Kong business leaders after leaving the mainland.
He wasn't dismissing China's chances for success; he was only pointing out that China remains hobbled by bureaucracy and bankrupt state-owned industries that dominate the economy. China's economic revolution, taking place largely in its coastal provinces, is occurring in very controlled circumstances. Foreign investors who enjoy favorable tax incentives are exploiting China's labor market while contributing little in return.
In many cases, the foreigners have fouled critical water sources and rivers, filled in rice paddies, paved over wheat fields or otherwise scarred the landscape. "There really is no free lunch," Mr. Friedman said. "Somebody has to pay for this." And, he added, "the true political revolution in China is yet to come."
If 1994 is the year that China's 89-year-old economic tinkerer, Deng Xiaoping, chooses to go to meet Marx, as he once referred to death, how long after the funeral will China's pro-democracy generation wait before it decides to challenge the Communist Party order? And if they do, will a democratic republic emerge that is unified enough to cope with China's still formidable problems? Or will it devolve into civil war, as Mr. Deng always warned whenever anyone mentioned democracy to him.
 
A Big 'If'
 Whatever China's future, its sheer mass, its economic power, its status as Asia's only declared nuclear weapons state and its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council insure that it will be a dominant force in the region -- if, that is, it can manage its growth without a catastrophic breakdown under the weight of its burdens.
Consider these daunting realities:
A population of 1.18 billion increases by the number of people in Texas every year. China will add the equivalent of the population of Japan (about 120 million) by the end of the decade. Its economy must grow fast just to stay even.
In 1993, China produced a bumper crop of wheat, rice and other grains, about 440 million tons. But its soil is rapidly deteriorating in quality, eroding or turning to desert. Chemical fertilizers have let its farmers defer their problems while extracting higher yields. A leading scientist said recently that China will have to double its grain output in 20 years and still will not be able to feed each Chinese as well as he or she eats today.
Water supplies are drying up under the relentless demands of new industries, population and agriculture. Of China's 500 cities, 300 are short of water and 100 are seriously short. More than 80 million people have to walk more than a mile for drinking water.
By some estimates, millions of "environmental refugees" may already be among a "floating" population that is migrating toward the cities and coastal provinces.
No country in history has undertaken an economic and industrial revolution on an ecological foundation in such a degraded state, scientists have observed.
But the high level of stress on the environment will greatly intensify as China's population swells to 1.5 or 1.6 billion in the second or third decade of the next century. Thus China is approaching its limits. Instead of conserving its resources, it is exhausting them with a vengeance. The dilemma for China's leaders is how to exhort the masses "to get rich," as Deng Xiaoping has often said, and still get them to consume less.
And it is not China's problem alone. Professor Zhou at the Academy of Sciences pointed out the relentless mathematics. . If China fails to double its food production, and instead continues to squander farmland and water resources in the quest to catch up with consumption levels in the West, "then China will have to import 400 million tons of grain from the world market and I am afraid in that case that all of the grain output of the United States could not meet China's needs." China's needs, in turn, are the world's worry. Its weight in the world makes its success, or failure, everybody's business.

HEADLINE: Camden's Renaissance Is Hailed, and Doubted

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Dec. 30

 BODY:
In his 37 years living here, Samuel Benson has seen the best and worst of Camden: its lively, industrial past, its bleak, abandoned present; the countless, unfulfilled promises of renewal and rebirth.
While government officials hail the two-year-old New Jersey State Aquarium as proof of Camden's sputtering recovery, and wait in hope for an agreement that could bring the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team to this city of 85,000, Mr. Benson and others in his North Camden neighborhood remain skeptical. If the Sixers really come to Camden this time, if the aquarium does spur growth along the waterfront, Mr. Benson asked, what does that mean for him? 
 "It will not help the residents of Camden," Mr. Benson said. "I don't see tourists from other parts of the country coming in to spend big bucks here, like they say. I don't see it."
Is Camden recovering? Some people here believe so. Others say they see no proof, and worry that any turnaround will resemble the experience of Atlantic City, and be limited to a strip of land along the waterfront. The question of Camden's fate is an important one, because for years the city has stood out as a pocket of poverty in one of the nation's most prosperous states.
 
Staggering Unemployment
 The bleak statistics are easy to find. More than half the children in Camden live below the Federal poverty level. Unemployment is a staggering 22 percent.
Camden has no movie theaters and few supermarkets, but it does have the county sewage plant and an imposing brown-brick prison near the library downtown. On some blocks half the houses have crumbled or collapsed. Lot after vacant lot holds charred debris, much of it left from deliberately set fires.
A depleted tax base has left Camden painfully dependent upon state aid. Each year the city carries a deficit -- $14 million this year -- and each year city officials go hat in hand to Trenton seeking relief, said Gary Warden, the city's senior budget examiner.
"We say we're going to give them the keys to the city or something until they finally say okay and give us the money," he said. At least that is what has happened for the last four years under Gov. Jim Florio, a product of the Camden Democratic machine. The election of Gov.-Elect Christine Todd Whitman has left city officials anxious.
"It's a very tenuous situation," Mr. Warden said.
 
Hope Goes On
 But hope exists in Camden, spurred by movement after years of stagnation and decay. If nothing else, the aquarium proved a point many doubted: visitors will come to Camden, if only to its waterfront. The aquarium drew 1.2 million visitors in its first year, which ended in February 1993. Attendance has fallen significantly this year, but aquarium officials say the drop was expected after a better-than-hoped-for beginning. They also say a new coral reef tank will lure tourists back.
There are other signs of resurgence. Ferry service between Philadelphia and Camden has returned after a 40-year absence. And at the end of Market Street overlooking the Delaware River stands a sprightly new $65 million office complex for Martin Marietta, the company that purchased G.E. Aerospace. The project added no new jobs to the area, but maintained momentum on the waterfront and, more important, kept the company from leaving Camden, said John T. Shannon, executive vice president of the Coopers Ferry Development Association, the agency overseeing waterfront development.
And, as always in Camden, optimistic plans for other projects abound: a $20 million waterfront headquarters for the Delaware River Port Authority, an expanded medical center, a Sony/PACE Music amphitheater along the river.
Not even the apparent faltering of another long-planned office building for a new Campbell Soup Company headquarters can dampen spirits, especially since Campbell officials say they remain committed to the city with or without this particular building.
 
Opportunity Seen
 "Despite all the bleak statistics, which cannot be denied, there exists a real opportunity in this city," said Mr. Shannon, who actually lives in Camden, unlike many police officers, firefighters, city department heads and others planning the city's revival.
"In my mind, the city has already bottomed out and is on its way back."
Camden officials said that Harold Katz, the 76ers' owner, may be serious about this offer to move the team -- he has publicly discussed the idea in the past -- in part because of the aquarium's early success.
Under the deal offered by Governor Florio, the Sixers would occupy an $80 million, 18,000-seat arena on a site near the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Governor Florio, who negotiated the deal, has said the arena would be financed by bond sales, with the debt paid with revenues from ticket sales, parking and concessions. But Mrs. Whitman said that before she would approve any deal she wants assurances that taxpayers would not be required to foot the bill if revenues fall short of projections.
Jeffrey Nash, a member of the County Board of Freeholders, said the arena would create 900 construction jobs and between 500 and 900 other permanent jobs. The Spectrum, the team's current home in Philadelphia, employs fewer than 150 people full-time, a spokesman for the Philadelphia arena said.
 
Nonbinding Payments
 The arena would be exempt from property taxes, and would likely contribute about $1 million to the $101 million city budget, said Mr. Warden, the budget examiner. Such payments in lieu of taxes are nonbinding and can be reduced or eliminated. The aquarium promised to pay the city $2.2 million in fiscal year 1993, but paid only $1.5 million.
"It's very subjective," Mr. Warden said.
Proponents say the arena, like the aquarium and the waterfront in general, would contribute to something more important and less tangible than the city budget -- the perception that Camden is a safe and desirable place to do business. Without that, businesses will not move to Camden. And without businesses to create jobs and expand the tax base, Camden will not recover, Mr. Nash said.
"The waterfront is a great marketing tool, if nothing else," he said.
But many of those who live and work in North Camden are not buying that argument.
 
'Not for Us'
 "You mean the circus on the waterfront?" said Ernest Boyd of the North Camden Land Trust, a nonprofit organization rehabilitating homes in that section of the city. "It's not for us."
Getting to the aquarium from Philadelphia is almost easier than getting there from North Camden, a neighborhood severed from the rest of the city by the highway feeding the Ben Franklin Bridge. Most visitors glimpse North Camden only from high above the bridge.
"One of the ways it's been sold, and the way the Sixers will be sold, is, 'Don't worry -- you can get there without having to touch Camden,' " Mr. Boyd said.
Still, Mr. Boyd said he would not object to a Sixers arena.
"It's fine as long as it doesn't divert money from the neighborhoods."
But the perception among many Camden residents is that projects like the aquarium, which was paid for with state funds, do divert resources away from the neighborhoods. Lillian Ubarry, a community organizer with Concerned Citizens of North Camden, said Camden needs to have its crumbling homes rebuilt, its tattered streets fixed, its sewer system replaced, its schools improved and its police department expanded. An ambitious, 15-year, $100 million North Camden development plan by the group addresses these problems and has been approved by the City Council. Now it needs financing, Ms. Ubarry said.
 
Other Uses Stressed
 "We always felt the aquarium was just a big spending of money that could have been used for other things," she said.
In North Camden, the median annual income is $11,000 and more than 57 percent of the residents live in poverty. Two-thirds receive some type of public assistance. More than anything, the people of North Camden need jobs, said Mangaliso Davis, one of Camden's most vocal advocates.
"We don't need a Sony amphitheater with seats at $25 a pop," he said. "If Sony wants to do something, let them put a factory in here."
Floyd T. Caston, the city's outspoken affirmative action director, estimated that only 25 percent of construction jobs for the aquarium project were held by minorities, even though the city is 81 percent black and Hispanic. About half the aquarium's 279 full and part-time jobs are held by Camden residents, aquarium officials said. Mr. Caston said most of those are low-level jobs, and most were handed out as political patronage.
"To get something, you had to be connected," he said. "If this arena gets off the ground, it will be the same thing."
 
Revitalization Plan
 To that complaint, state and county officials offer the Camden Initiative, a multi-faceted revitalization plan that state and county officials say will create three industrial parks and lure businesses to Camden.
The Delaware River Port Authority has approved a $3 million grant for land acquisition for a new industrial park in South Camden, and the county has committed to pay for much of a second, Mr. Nash said. But much of the money for the third park, and other parts of the initiative, will fall to the state. And a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman said that while the Governor-elect supports the plan, she is concerned about finding money for it.
Mr. Benson, who moved to Camden in 1957 to work at a food store, said he has seen too many other plans come and go -- from the City Within a City program in the 1960's to the promised Veterans Administration hospital that was killed by the Reagan administration -- to get excited about this one.
"A political gimmick," he said. "I don't see it in my lifetime, Camden coming around. Maybe in my grandkids' lifetime, hopefully. But I think I'll be long gone if it happens."

HEADLINE: CUOMO TO PROPOSE PACKAGE OF CUTS IN NEW YORK TAXES

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 1

 BODY:
Moving into an election year in which he may seek a fourth term, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo will propose a package of tax reductions in his State of the State address on Wednesday, including a credit for low-income working families, administration officials said today. The package is also expected to include cuts in the corporate tax surcharge and the state hotel tax.
Mr. Cuomo plans to announce whether he will seek a fourth four-year term by the end of this week, but not until after delivering Wednseday's speech, said Anne W. Crowley, his press secretary. [Page 24.] 
 Still, the tax proposals his aides talked about, all of which are subject to approval by the Legislature, could be an attractive component in a fall campaign. The so-called earned-income tax credit, which exists in six other states, would give an estimated 820,000 families in New York a credit on their state income taxes just like credits they now receive on their Federal income taxes, according to estimates by lobbyists for the poor. By 1995, the proposal could reduce state taxes for a family with two children by a maximum of about $300.
 
A Central Theme
 In recent interviews, Mr. Cuomo and his top social services advisers have depicted the tax credit as a central component of the Governor's efforts to reshape New York's welfare system so that it provides greater incentives for work. The tax credit would cost the state between $110 million and $120 million a year, according to Cuomo aides, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
Hoping to stimulate the state's economy, Mr. Cuomo is also expected to propose a reduction in the state's surcharge on the corporate income tax, to 12.5 percent from 15 percent, probably taking effect in October, aides said.
 
Tax Repeatedly Extended
 The surcharge, which costs businesses $800 million each year, was enacted in 1990 to help balance the state's budget and was supposed to drop to 10 percent in 1992 and then be eliminated in 1993. Instead, Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature extended it each year.
The Governor will also propose reducing the $50 fee paid once every three years by New York companies when they refile incorporation papers. And he will ask for a reduction in the state's 5 percent tax on hotel rooms that cost more than $100.
Both Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have made reducing the hotel taxes a top priority because studies have shown the combined 19.25 percent tax is causing New York City to lose convention bookings.
Companies have complained that the hotel tax, corporate tax surcharge and incorporation fee have been major nuisances during New York's prolonged economic slide. The state has lost 524,000 jobs since 1989, and Republicans have made that statistic the foundation of their case for ousting the Democratic Governor.
Some business leaders have predicted that Mr. Cuomo's tax cuts may be more significant for their symbolism than for their impact on corporate profits, at least next year.
But because many of the tax cuts will not bear a large cost for the state until the 1995-96 fiscal year, the proposals will allow the Governor to take credit for them in an election year without putting a large burden on the budget.
Mr. Cuomo's budget division predicted last fall that the state would run a $38 million surplus in its $59.3 billion budget for the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, and would have to close a $1.5 billion gap in the budget for 1994-95. But reports by the State Comptroller show that revenues have outpaced projections in recent months.
The Governor's proposed tax credit would use the same eligibility standards as the Federal earned-income tax credit. Most recipients would be working parents with low incomes and dependent children. President Clinton and Congress expanded the program last year to include childless workers with extremely low wages, but they receive only a small credit.
For the 1994 tax year, when the Cuomo proposal would take effect, the income eligibility limit would be $23,760 for families with one child and $25,300 for families with two or more children. The limit for families with two or more children would increase to $26,000 in 1995 and to $27,000 in 1996.
Mr. Cuomo is likely to propose that eligible families receive a credit in 1994 that would be equivalent to 5 percent of their Federal earned-income tax credit, his aides said. It would increase to 10 percent in 1995.
In the first year, the Cuomo proposal would provide a maximum reduction of up to $126 for a family with two children. In 1995, the same family could save up to $303. The credit, which would vary according to income, would either reduce recipients' owed taxes or be refunded as a direct payment to those who do not owe taxes.
Anti-poverty groups had lobbied for a 20 percent tax credit. "The wage supplementation effect has to be meaningful," said Russell Sykes, deputy director of State Communities Aid Association, a human services advocacy group. "Less than 10 percent is not very credible," he said. "It won't make a difference about employment decisions."
Both houses of the Legislature have introduced bills to enact an earned-income tax credit, but the legislation has made little progress. But legislative leaders in both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-led Senate have said they would give the proposal strong consideration because of its election-year appeal and its usefulness as a tool to give people a financial incentive to work.
Mr. Cuomo's State of the State speech will include other welfare proposals, according to his aides. But the Governor will not propose increasing the rent subsidy for welfare recipients, which is so low -- $286 a month for a family of three in New York City -- that it is being challenged in court. Mr. Cuomo said in a year-end interview on Friday that the cost of increasing the subsidy, estimated at more than $100 million, makes it "very difficult" under current budget conditions.
Mr. Cuomo will propose a plan devised by his social services Commissioner, Michael J. Dowling, to require welfare applicants to try to find work before receiving permanent benefits. Emergency welfare payments might be provided for housing and food.
The Governor is also expected to propose reducing welfare benefits for families with children who drop out of school and increasing them for those with children who stay in school.
But he will not propose more punitive measures, like the New Jersey law that denies additional welfare benefits for mothers who have additional children or the White House plan to limit welfare payments to two years. The Senate Republicans have muted their previous calls for such initiatives, suggesting that there may be new room for compromise on welfare revision.

HEADLINE: THE NEW MAYOR;
The Philadelphia Story: Inspiring for New Mayor

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY

 BODY:
Like Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Mayor of Philadelphia, Edward G. Rendell, is a former prosecutor with a penchant for the limelight, a white politician in his late 40's who succeeded his city's first black Mayor.
But it is their cities' common problems, not personal similarities, that attracted the new Mayor to Mr. Rendell. Mr. Giuliani often has cited Mr. Rendell's fiscal reforms in the nation's fifth-largest city as a possible guide for New York City. 
 Philadelphia was nearly insolvent when Mr. Rendell took office two years ago. Since then, he has won national attention for rescuing the city's finances through tough bargaining with municipal unions and the use of private firms to perform city services.
Although Mr. Rendell is a Democrat, he has been hailed by conservative groups, including the Manhattan Institute, an organization that advises Mr. Giuliani, and invited Mr. Rendell to speak at a recent institute dinner.
"Here was someone facing the same kinds of problems and seemed to be doing something about them," said William Hammett, the institute's president.
 
A New York Meeting
 At Mr. Giuliani's request, Mr. Rendell met with him for several hours in early December to discuss privatization of services and union negotiations, among other topics, said David L. Cohen, Mr. Rendell's chief of staff.
Considering the terrain confronting Mr. Giuliani, it is no surprise he would seek Mr. Rendell's counsel. When Mr. Rendell was sworn in as Mayor in January 1992, Philadelphia's government faced a deficit of $250 million, more than one-10th its annual budget. (New York's budget is about $31 billion.) Eighteen months later, and without any tax increases, Philadelphia posted its first budget surplus in seven years.
A state authority borrowed money on the city's behalf in June 1992 to plug Philadelphia's long-term deficit, but it was up to Mr. Rendell to bridge the city's $200 million annual operating shortfall.
 
Strike Brings Break
 The expiration of contracts with all city employee unions within six months of Mr. Rendell's taking office proved essential to his strategy. He stared down the once-powerful unions, endured a 16-hour strike and won dramatic concessions, including a reduction of nearly 25 percent in the city's contribution to worker health funds, a 30-month pay freeze and a reduction in paid holidays from 14 to 10.
Mr. Rendell has hired private companies to take over 16 city functions, from guarding the Philadelphia Art Museum to staffing trash transfer stations. The moves saved $17 million annually and cut 450 employees, or approximately 2 percent of the payroll, city officials say. Philadelphia has about 23,000 city employees; New York about 214,000.
City union leaders criticize Mr. Rendell, saying he has not reformed government as much as he has taken money from city employees.
Philadelphia's bureaucracy still has some basic problems. For instance, the city only recently determined how many police cars it owns and has yet to design regular routes for trash trucks, Mr. Cohen said.
It is unclear how worthy a guide Mr. Rendell is for Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Rendell, a former District Attorney, was elected easily with a clear mandate to save a government that was in near-collapse, and the desperation forged a peace between contentious factions at City Hall. As a measure of this peace, both of Mr. Rendell's budget proposals passed the Democrat-controlled City Council unanimously.
"He arrived at a time of political planetary alignment," said Ronald G. Henry, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, the agency overseeing Philadelphia's finances. "He didn't have to go through the Jim Florio-Bill Clinton 'I'm shocked to find out there's a deficit' routine."
Despite Mr. Rendell's successes, problems remain. Philadelphia, with 1.6 million residents, is losing private sector jobs at a rate of about 2 percent a year. While Mr. Rendell pursues a strategy of economic development based on tourism, his critics say he has yet to address the central problems of poverty afflicting the city.
"I do not believe businesses will return to a city that is overrun by poverty, illiteracy and drugs," said Edward Schwartz, a former City Councilman who heads a group that advises neighborhood organizations. He said Mr. Rendell deserves credit for balancing the city's budget, but the loss of jobs and of the middle class could prove fatal even so. "The fact of the matter is," Mr. Schwartz said, "we're in a race against time."

HEADLINE: CLINTON OUTLINES DOMESTIC AGENDA

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HILTON HEAD, S.C., Jan. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton today outlined an ambitious agenda for the new near, saying he and his Administration were determined to take new steps to make Americans more secure.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton spoke of his commitment to guaranteed health care, safer streets and a stronger economy. His list of resolutions was notable for making no mention of foreign policy. 
 "In 1994, we must resolve to do even more to help the middle class with more jobs and with income growth, to help the poor who are trapped in whole neighborhoods where there's no work, few stable families and where violence is the norm," the President said. "There is still a great deal to do."
In describing his goals, Mr. Clinton also mentioned his intention to win measures to improve American schools, teach workers new skills and reward work over welfare. "Let us all make New Year's resolutions today," he said, adding that he still intended "to rebuild the economy and with it the American dream."
 
Support for Energy Secretary
 As he continued a five-day visit here, the President also expressed strong support for the actions of Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary in making documents on radiation experiments conducted by the Government in the 1940's and 1950's available to the public.
Mr. Clinton said that he was "very, very interested" in the disclosures and that he would stay informed about themeeting at the White House on Monday in which officials from several Federal agencies are to discuss their departments' previously secret tests.
"We've got to meet now and assess where we are with the information and where to go next," he said.
Although Mr. Clinton's address today mentioned only one international development and no particular foreign policy goals, the President is scheduled to leave next Saturday for a nine-day trip to Europe. He did say that his week ahead would probably be consumed with preparation for that trip.
 
Preparing for Trip to Europe
 Among the events on his schedule are a meeting on Monday with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a visit on Wednesday with workers from the Central Intelligence Agency and a speech on Thursday in Milwaukee that the White House has described as a major foreign policy address.
Mr. Clinton, who observed the New Year until shortly after midnight with hundreds of other participants in the annual Renaissance Weekend, was up early this morning for a leisurely walk on the beach. He later played golf for the third straight day but was obviously sore from a touch football game on Friday in which youthful rivals twice piled atop him.
"Too much," Mr. Clinton said this morning of the previous day's romp. He described himself as "pretty stiff" and "so sore," and on the fourth tee, he was heard calling for aspirin.

HEADLINE: Campaign in Bahamas Forces Haitians to Flee for the U.S.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARSH HARBOUR, the Bahamas, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Afraid the country will be overwhelmed by a growing population of Haitian immigrants and refugees, the Government of the Bahamas has instituted tough new policies that have led many Haitians to abandon this nation and flee to the United States.
As part of the campaign, the Bahamian military and police have arrested Haitians in raids on their homes, workplaces and churches. And local governments have demolished homes in some Haitian settlements. At the same time, the Bahamian Government has made it harder for Haitians to obtain the work permits or permanent residency papers that make their presence here legal, raising fees for the documents to levels few Haitians can afford and thereby making them vulnerable to deportation. 
 "The world don't know the tragedy going on in these little islands," said Robinson Weatherford, a Protestant minister who works with the long-established Haitian community here on Great Abaco Island, where the campaign has been especially intense.
 
'Where Can We Go?'
 At a Haitian squatter settlement in the capital of Nassau, Daniel Prophete, a day laborer who arrived in the Bahamas in 1963, said he had never had any immigration problems until 1993, when the Government began its campaign.
"The Bahamas don't want us here, but where can we go?" Mr. Prophete asked. "Haiti is too dangerous. By taking away the work permits here, they have made it impossible for us to work, to live here. We can do nothing, go nowhere. That's why people are taking boats to the United States."
The impact of the new Bahamian policy is felt most strongly in South Florida, which is only a 50-mile sail from Bimini, the westernmost island in the Bahamas archipelago. Since late October, after the collapse of the agreement that was to have restored Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian president, boats carrying Haitians fleeing the Bahamas have been arriving regularly in Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, in some cases making landfall in broad daylight at popular beaches under the startled gaze of sun bathers.
"Many people are leaving, and 90 percent of them are going to Florida," Joseph Etienne, the Haitian Ambassador to the Bahamas and a supporter of Father Aristide, said in an interview in Nassau. "The majority were waiting for Aristide to return to power in October, hoping they could then return to Haiti, but when that failed to materialize, they decided to leave for Florida rather than remain here."
 
Limits of American Policy
 Earlier this month, for instance, a group of 10 Haitians and 7 Cubans, who had left their countries separately and met in the Bahamas, jointly obtained a boat and sailed to Florida. The Cubans were quickly released by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and allowed to apply for permanent residency under a special law that treats Cubans as political refugees, but the Haitians were detained and remain subject to deportation.
In another case just before Christmas, one group of Haitians that included several women and infants left the Bahamas bound for Florida. When one baby died in the arms of its mother, the woman committed suicide by jumping overboard, according to statements by her fellow passengers to the American authorities when the boat eventually reached Miami.
Under American law, Haitians fleeing the turmoil in their country and arriving directly in the United States are considered economic, rather than political, refugees unless they prove otherwise. Their situation is more complicated when they stop first in another country, especially one like the Bahamas, which the State Department regards as friendly and democratic.
The Haitian presence in the Bahamas has built up over three decades, as Haitians left their country for the northern islands of New Providence, Grand Bahama and Great Abaco, where jobs in hotels and construction, on farms and as tailors, gardeners or day laborers were available. But as tourism, the most important industry in the country, has flattened in recent years, sending the economy into recession, resentment toward the Creole-speaking foreigners has increased.
In parliamentary elections in August 1992, the opposition Free National Movement took power for the first time since the Bahamas achieved independence in 1973, capitalizing on voters' unhappiness with the economy and official corruption. In its manifesto, the party said "illegal immigration is a serious economic, social and cultural problem" in a country of only 265,000 people, and it promised a "strengthening of the Bahamianization process."
Saying the flow of immigrants "cannot forever go unchecked and uncorrected," the party also vowed "to institute a program of detention and early repatriation of all illegal immigrants." That effort began when the party took office and it accelerated in 1993.
 
Numbers Are Unclear
 Government officials and human rights groups agree there is little reliable data about the number of Haitians in the Bahamas. Published figures range from 20,000 to 70,000, though Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, who is from Great Abacos, and members of his Cabinet have offered estimates of 40,000.
For that reason, it is difficult to determine how many Haitians have left for the United States or returned to Haiti since the Government began cracking down. But Stan Kolasa, an American priest here, said the Haitian membership in his church, the only one for Roman Catholics on this island of less than 10,000 people, has fallen by three-quarters in the last six months. Until then, he estimated, there were about 2,000 Haitians on the island.
"You can't even tell it's the same church or community," said Father Kolasa, who began working with Haitians in 1970. "Families have been divided, our population of children has been depleted and scattered, and the Haitian people who are still here are living with the constant fear of being arbitrarily removed at whim."
The catalyst for the exodus was a nighttime raid on homes and churches here and on the neighboring island of Eleuthera in late May, during which about 400 Haitians, many of them women or young children, were arrested and jailed. Mr. Etienne estimated that 40 percent of those detained in that raid have been sent back to Haiti, some at their own expense, and he said more than 60 of the group were still being detained in Nassau.
 
Sending a Message
 Another diplomat in Nassau who insisted that his name not be used said: "It appears the Government intended to send a message, and it appears that the message has been received and understood. The Abacos raid was a scare factor to encourage people to leave, to tell them not to settle in the Bahamas and to move on to greener pastures."
But the news from those forced to go back to Haiti has been discouraging to Haitians here. "Some have died, or their babies have died, or they cannot go home and have gone into the bush because they are so scared of the repression," said Jean-Claude Julmisse, a Haitian community leader here. "Go to Haiti, you have problems. Stay here, you also have problems."
Among those taken into custody in the roundup in Great Abaco was a 40-year-old truck driver, who said he had lived in the Bahamas since he was 5 years old and would identify himself only as Lucien. Though living in the country legally and possessing a work permit, he said he was sent in May to Fox Hill prison in Nassau, where he spent a month before being released.
As a result, he said, he lost his job and has been unable to renew his work permit, since he no longer has regular employment, and there has been no response to papers he filed seeking Bahamian citizenship. Alarmed that his family might suffer further, he has now, through a risky series of boat trips, sent his wife and six children, ages 2 to 16, to join relatives in Miami.
"That prison was a dirty, dangerous, stinking place," he said. "I don't want my children to be sent there. This is not a good country to be a Haitian. They treat us like dogs here, not like human beings. The Americans treat us like dogs, too, but there you at least have a chance to defend yourself."
 
Government Response
 Bahamian Government officials, though, defend the new policy. Harcourt Turnquest, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview in Nassau, "This new government is enforcing the law, which we ought to have been doing all along." Official actions against Haitians, especially raids and roundups, are intended, he said, to "give the strong message they ought to regularize their status or get moving."
Charles Turnquest, deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Immigration and a distant relative of the Foreign Ministry official, said, "The Government makes every effort possible to be as fair as possible" to Haitians in the Bahamas. But, he added, they "cannot come into this country illegally and expect to be regularized after they are here."
But human rights and religious groups complain that the policy is being applied to Haitians who have long lived and worked legally in this country. Several thousand children and adolescents born in the Bahamas to Haitian parents, but not entitled to Bahamian citizenship until they reach the age of 18, are also affected, they say, adding that some of those people have been arrested or even deported to a "homeland" they have never seen.
"I have written numerous letters to the Prime Minister and Minister of Immigration seeking a meeting to discuss the Haitians and the indignities and harassment they have suffered, but to date there has never been any response," said T. D'Arcy Ryan, executive director of the Grand Bahama Human Rights Association in Freeport. Speaking of the youths whose nationality is in limbo, he added, "If someone is entitled to citizenship at 18, it seems ludicrous to say they are not always Bahamian, having been born here."
At the Haitian squatter settlement in Nassau, residents said it was now virtually impossible to obtain work permits or permanent residency, no matter how long they have been in the country. Jean-Gilles Pierre, a gardener, said that even though he had lived and worked in the Bahamas since 1973, he was now having difficulty with his papers and was convinced that the Government wanted him to leave.
"I cannot change Bahamas law, and I do not want to give a problem to the American people," he said. "But if I go to Haiti, I will be killed. I would like to stay here, but I cannot work. That leaves only the boats and Miami."

HEADLINE: Poor Lands' Success In Cutting Birth Rate Upsets Old Theories

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
It used to be assumed that economic development was the best way for a poor country to reduce its population growth. But new studies suggest that a country like Bangladesh can cut its birth rate significantly if it aggressively promotes the adoption of modern contraceptive methods -- without waiting for the reduction that traditionally comes with higher living standards.
In what some experts are calling a reproductive revolution, birth rates are falling in countries presumably too poor for economic development that would stabilize rapid population growth, as it did in Europe and North America early this century. 
 "Contraceptives are the best contraceptive," write three demographic researchers who are challenging the con-ventional theory of modern human population growth and decline.
The theory, predicated on the experience of the industrialized world before modern contraceptives, says that in a pre-industrial economy people tend to have many children but that high death rates hold the population down. As a country industrializes, living conditions improve, the practice of medicine advances and life spans increase, but the birth rate remains high and the population soars.
Birth rates drop only when education spreads and people find that too many children are an economic liability, according to the theory. Thus begins an era of low mortality, low fertility and stable but not runaway population growth -- the condition of the industrialized world today.
This "demographic transition," as some social scientists call it, would also be the surest and most likely path to stable populations for developing countries.
Bangladesh is cited by the authors of the study as a "perfect example" of how the concept linking the fertility rate to developing economies has been disproved. The South Asian country, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated, has a traditional agrarian economy in which most families still depend on children for economic security. Yet fertility rates in Bangladesh declined by 21 percent between 1970 and 1991, to 5.5 children per woman from 7, according to Government figures. In the same period, the use of contraception among married women of reproductive age rose to 40 percent from 3 percent.
 
A Lesson Is Drawn
 To Bryant Robey of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and editor of American Demographics magazine, the lesson is clear: "If fertility rates are to fall, don't wait around for the forces of modernization to slowly work their way. Make family planning available, and you might be surprised by the number of couples that use them." Bangladash, for one, "has a very effective family planning program," he said.
Population experts have considered Bangladesh's acceptance of family planning especially noteworthy and surprising because it is a predominantly Muslim country.
One reason for the spread of contraception in the third world is that demand is rising, Mr. Robey said. And a major factor behind increased demand, he believes, is the ease with which new ideas now spread into rural areas, changing people's attitudes about birth control.
"I think this was a big factor in Thailand." he said. "Even though the country is largely rural, communications are good and people are linked so that new ideas can travel fast."
The birth rate in Thailand dropped to 2.3 children per woman in 1987 from 4.6 in 1975. Condom use in Thailand has been vigorously promoted both as a contraceptive and an AIDS preventive.
 
A Notion Is Disputed
 "Fertility rates in developing countries have fallen much more rapidly than they did during the European demographic transition," Mr. Robey and two other population analysts wrote in Scientific American. These findings, they wrote, "dispute the notion that 'development is the best contraceptive.' " rather, "contraceptives are the best contraceptive."
Mr. Robey's co-authors are Dr. Shea O. Rutstein of Macro International, a private research organization, and Dr. Leo Morris of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The relative effectiveness of economic development and family-planning programs in bringing down the birth rate is much more than an academic concern. Even if the worldwide rate were to drop to the replacement level of 2.1 children per couple, United Nations demographers say, the current global population of 5.6 billion could double by the middle of the next century before eventually stabilizing at nearly 12 billion. Should fertility remain even 5 percent greater than replacement level, according to a United Nations analysis, the population would reach 21 billion in the year 2150.
The impact of humans on the global environment is already serious, in the view of most students of the subject. And there are widespread fears among ecologists and environmentalists that even if a human population growing out of control were somehow able to support itself, the result eventually could still be an environmental catastrophe.
 
U.S. Policy Reversed
 The new findings have a bearing on United States policy. Under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Washington refused to finance international population programs that provided women with counseling on abortion. The Clinton Administration, arguing that population control is crucial to the world's future, has reversed that policy.
The new study gives some cause for optimism about population control, Mr. Robey says, because birth rates in developing countries have declined by about one-third, to an average of four children per woman, since the mid-1960's, when the average was six children per woman. This is about halfway to replacement level.
The plunge is still more evident in some cases, according to surveys of more than 300,000 women in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia during the last eight years. The studies, part of an international effort that began 20 years ago, were largely financed by the United States Agency for International Development.
Not included in the surveys were the world's two most populous countries, China and India, but data from independent national surveys for those countries were included in the study. In China, where mandatory controls on family size are in effect, the birth rate dropped to 2.3 in 1988 from 5.99 in 1965; in India, where participation in family-planning programs is voluntary, it dropped to 4.2 in 1989 from 5.69 in 1965.
 
Sharp Drop in Colombia
 Besides sharp drops in Thailand and Bangladesh, the study found that in Colombia the birth rate fell to 2.8 children in 1990 from 4.7 in 1975. In Indonesia, fertility declined by 46 percent between 1971 and 1991; in Morocco, by 31 percent between 1980 and 1991.
Family-planning programs have already reduced the world population by more than 400 million from what it would otherwise be, according to a 1990 study by Dr. John Bongaarts, W. Parker Mauldin and Dr. James F. Phillips of the Population Council, an independent international organization based in New York that conducts research on population and development.
Their study calculated that in the absence of family-planning programs, the population of the developing world would reach 14.6 billion by the year 2100 rather than the 10 billion now projected. But they also found a relationship between economic development and family-planning programs that enhances fertility reduction.
"You need economic development almost as a precondition," Dr. Bongaarts said, "but once you have some development, family-planning programs help accelerate the decline of fertility."
Two consequences of development stand out as influences on declining fertility, he said: falling death rates and better education, especially for women. When more children survive, it puts pressure on the family's resources, encouraging people to have fewer offspring. And educated women tend to make better use of contraceptives, he said.
If a consensus is emerging that development and family-planning programs work synergistically, what is their potential for putting the brakes on world population growth?
The potential for development is difficult to gauge, governed as it is by complex factors of economics and politics, not to mention the chronically depressive effect of population growth itself. Similarly, it is difficult to assess how rapidly demand for contraceptives will grow. But Mr. Robey says it is clear that the potential for further decline in birth rates through expansion of family planning programs is substantial.
"The demand for family planning already far surpasses its supply," he and his colleagues wrote in Scientific American. "In the countries surveyed, between 20 and 30 percent of married women are not using contraception even though they want to avoid pregnancy."
If the demand were met, they calculated, the use of contraceptives in developing countries would rise to more than 60 percent from 51 percent. This, they wrote, would cause fertility to fall from the present average of four children per woman to about three, or one child more than replacement level.
Is that sufficient?
"We're certainly not saying that the population problem, so to speak, is solved," Mr. Robey said, "but certainly fertility has come down a lot faster than even experts thought a few decades ago. I guess we see reason for hope if money and effort can be found in the future to continue this process."

HEADLINE: THE NEW MAYOR;
Giuliani May Model Fiscal Plan On Innovations Tried Elsewhere

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
When Rudolph W. Giuliani raises his hand for his final, ceremonial swearing-in today, he will assume the helm of a municipal government that is vast in scale and ambition but is living chronically beyond its means and is facing a budget gap of more than $2 billion.
Mr. Giuliani, the first Republican Mayor of New York City since John V. Lindsay, has promised to change all that. Following the lead of fiscally conservative mayors in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Indianapolis, and citing innovations undertaken in Phoenix, Mr. Giuliani seems prepared to bring New York into a great urban experiment. 
 He wants to streamline and pare, privatize and rattle the bureaucracy until New York has a leaner, more entrepreneurial government. He has vowed to solve the fiscal shortfall without tax increases or layoffs, through deep budget cuts and attrition. Yet he insists that this can all be done without any decline in public service.
His mantra: better management. "New York City is really out of control," he said recently. "New York City hasn't had control in a while."
But New York is not Phoenix, and for Mr. Giuliani and his advisers, the next few months will provide a critical test: Can the city, with its long, proud tradition of providing more direct service delivery than any other city in the nation, duplicate the success of other municipalities in contracting out services to private companies and pushing the lumbering bureaucracy to compete with private enterprise and become more efficient?
 
Formidable Hurdles
 The potential obstacles are enormous. At 214,000, the municipal work force is the largest in the nation, far larger than those of some Sunbelt cities that have had the most success with what has been dubbed "reinventing government."
New York's unions are much stronger and the Civil Service protections more stringent than in many of those cities, and the City Council is still firmly in the hands of Democrats, many of whom have strong ties to labor.
How quickly and forcefully Mr. Giuliani moves to put into place his promised management revolution, and how successfully he cajoles others into supporting his views, could be just as crucial to his success as New York's 107th mayor as his companion promise to reduce crime.
"These are the kinds of issues that will make or break his mayoralty," said Raymond D. Horton, who served on one of Mr. Giuliani's transition panels and is president of the Citizens Budget Commission, which monitors the city budget.
The idea of asking the private sector to provide services that have long been the domain of government is not new to New York. After the infamous, mishandled snowstorm of 1969 that chilled Mayor Lindsay's relationship with Queens, a first deputy city administrator for Mr. Lindsay studied the operations of the Sanitation Department and found it would have been much more efficient to use private haulers.
The administrator, E. S. Savas, recommended that the city open several sanitation districts to private competition to shake up the Sanitation Department and make it more efficient. But Mr. Savas, now a management professor at Baruch College, recalls that his idea died as Mr. Lindsay became a Democrat with Presidential ambitions and sought labor's support.
In the Koch administration, the Sanitation Commissioner, Norman Steisel, used the threat of privatization to win productivity concessions: two-person crews for trucks.
 
Others Take Lead
 But other cities began to go much further. Spurred by Reagan-era reductions in Federal aid, a tax-revolt movement and a recession, municipalities across the country began rethinking their missions and their methods, bringing market forces into government.
In 1992 David Osborne and Ted Gaebler catalogued some of the innovations. Their book, "Reinventing Government," (Addison-Wesley Publishing Company Inc.) gave the movement a name. Its ideas have been seized upon by both President Clinton and Mr. Giuliani.
One municipality often cited as a pioneer is Sunnyvale, Calif., a Silicon Valley community of 120,000 whose government has been as creative as any, setting service objectives for its departments and offering bonuses of as much as 10 percent of salary as incentives for managers.
Sunnyvale's traffic enforcement division is judged on how many accidents occur, not on how many citations it issues. Surveys are used to make sure that the library system is serving its patrons well.
Then there is Phoenix, often used as an example by Mr. Giuliani. The city opens two of its five sanitation districts to competition at any one time, allowing the Public Works Department to bid against private companies for trash pickup. Initially, the city department bid unsuccessfully.
The competition spurred cost-saving experiments, with garbage-truck drivers changing their routes and the department giving bonuses to the employees for the best suggestions. The department began winning back routes. Since 1979 private haulers have won 30 garbage collection contracts and the city has won 20, according to Jim Flanagan, the City Auditor, who said the program had saved the city $25 million.
Still, political factors could make such programs harder to carry out in New York. In Sunnyvale, the City Council appoints the Mayor and the City Manager, so there is no clash between an executive and a legislature with different visions of government.
And in what would be anathema to New York's municipal unions, Phoenix has created a job category for temporary employees, who have no job security and know that layoffs are likely when the Public Works Department loses a garbage contract.
In fact, even incentive pay presents a problem in New York City. Carol O' Cleireacain, who served as both Finance Commissioner and Budget Director under Mayor David N. Dinkins, said: "You can't reward according to performance, because everything's set by contract and the hallmark of the contract is rate of pay for job and job title, not for individuals."
Perhaps a more apt analogy for New York is Philadelphia, where Mayor Edward G. Rendell brought the city back from the brink of insolvency by confronting strong municipal unions and by using private businesses to perform city services.
It took a hard-nosed political will for Mr. Rendell to carry out his program. He stood firm against the municipal unions and endured a 16-hour strike before winning major concessions.
Urban analysts say that Mr. Rendell, a Democrat, had some political advantages that Mr. Giuliani may lack. He was elected by a wider margin than New York's new Republican mayor and he was aided by a wide consensus that Philadelphia's fiscal situation was desperate.
 
Assessing the Problem
 Despite the city's $2 billion budget gap, New York's labor leaders insist that the city's fiscal situation is nowhere near so grave as in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. "Our people have indicated that its not the same situation as 1975, " said Stanley W. Hill, the executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union.
While Mr. Giuliani has few debts to the city's unions, the City Council's leadership is close to organized labor. Only the refusal of Mayor Dinkins prevented the Council from considering a measure in its last days that would have required the Mayor to conduct cost studies and the Council to hold hearings before any privatization proposal could move forward.
So far Mr. Giuliani has not tipped his hand about how sweeping his attempt to change the municipal culture will be, although he has put the Department of Investigation in charge of looking for productivity savings as well as corruption.
He said during the campaign that he wanted to experiment by putting three municipal hospitals under the control of voluntary, nonprofit boards. He has also signaled that he will sell O.T.B. and will consider contracting out sanitation services if the union does not agree to work an eight-hour shift instead of organizing shifts by route. Under the current route system, some sanitation workers have been able to finish their routes in as little as four hours.
Richard Schwartz, a policy adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said that one way to bring in productivity savings and creativity is to foster competition between different city agencies.
Mr. Savas, who had been advising the Giuliani campaign, estimates that a program of competitive bids for municipal services could save the city $2 billion annually within four years.
But Mr. Giuliani faces a shortfall of $2 billion or more in his first budget. On Friday, as he stood on the threshold of taking office, he acknowledged that hard times could lie ahead. "The Depression was worse than this," he added. "Going through a world war was worse than this. Even the fiscal crisis last time -- if it wasn't worse than this, at least we've been through an experience like this before. I want the people of the city to see how strong, how tough and how resilient and how wonderful the city really is."

HEADLINE: Hint of Progress, and Warning, From North Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 1

 BODY:
North Korea's paramount leader, Kim Il Sung, said today that his country had agreed to a "joint statement" with the United States, paving the way for the nuclear dispute between them to be "settled fairly," but warned that any effort to pressure his country into broader concessions "may invite catastrophe."
Mr. Kim's declaration came in a lengthy New Year's address that also laid out a radical new strategy for rescuing North Korea's crippled economy. It did not describe the agreement with the United States in any detail, but a later announcement by North Korea's Foreign Ministry suggested that international inspectors would only be permitted into the country's seven declared nuclear sites for one-time inspections. The announcement said that North Korea refused to allow the kind of regular visits by the International Atomic Energy Agency that are required under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 Both the United States and South Korea have said that nothing short of full compliance with the treaty would be sufficient if the North wants to go ahead with talks about normalizing diplomatic relations and opening the door to foreign investment and trade.
The White House said today that it would not comment on the statement by the North Korean leader. But Clinton Administration officials indicated that there had been no final breakthrough in the standoff.
In his speech, delivered to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, Mr. Kim made no direct connection between resolving the nuclear dispute and North Korea's other major objective: establishing trading links to economic powers it once scorned. But he suggested that North Korea would have to change dramatically in order to develop foreign markets.
The State Department said Thursday, without revealing details, that the two sides had "moved closer" to some kind of preliminary agreement on the nuclear inspection issue. But officials say that first, North Korea must come up with an inspection plan that satisfies the atomic energy agency.
Officials familiar with the talks say the "joint statement" referred to by Mr. Kim, who is 81 years old and has ruled North Korea for nearly five decades, would come after a team of atomic energy agency inspectors arrived at North Korea's nuclear installations in Yongbyon. The United States would then officially announce the cancellation of its annual military exercise with South Korea. American and South Korean officials say they have little desire to hold the exercises this year.
The statement would likely also include some agreement about the exchange of envoys between North and South Korea, a prelude to restarting talks that have essentially gone nowhere since the two countries signed a declaration of nonaggression in 1991.
If the inspections went ahead smoothly, probably in the next several weeks, the two countries would then meet in Geneva to discuss a "package deal" of economic incentives in return for broader inspection rights. For the United States, the most critical inspections involve two nuclear waste dumps that may reveal how much plutonium Mr. Kim's Government has produced.
 
Waste Dumps Not Covered
 But a "special inspection" of those sites, which the atomic energy agency has been demanding since early 1993, is not covered in the current talks. North Korea argues that the sites are military locations unrelated to its nuclear program, and that since it has only "suspended" its decision last March to pull out of the nonproliferation treaty, it is not bound by any treaty obligations.
Discussions about conducting a "special inspection," American officials have said, would be part of any talks in Geneva.
Any evidence that Washington was backing down from its initial stand that the North must agree to full regular inspections as well as the special inspections later could open the Clinton Administration to charges that it is giving in to nuclear blackmail. Critics of the Administration are already arguing that Mr. Clinton is reluctant to back up his declaration of a month ago that North Korea would never be allowed to possess nuclear weapons.
 
Believed to Have Bomb
 American intelligence agencies, in a conclusion disputed by the State Department, concluded recently that Mr. Kim's Government probably has already made at least one bomb. By insisting on regular inspections, the Administration is trying to assure that Mr. Kim does not acquire enough plutonium to build more, but officials concede they are unlikely to find completed weapons.
At times in his speech today, Mr. Kim sounded a militant note. While calling for an overhaul of the North Korean economy, Mr. Kim also said his country had to strengthen its "defense power to counter the enemy's moves to provoke war," an apparent reference to both the United States and South Korea.
But amid the usual denunciations of Washington and Seoul, Mr. Kim dealt at length with a new policy to save an economy that his Government admitted last month was in desperate shape. What Mr. Kim described was a new economic structure that sounded much like China's, with its mix of heavy political control and a new emphasis on exports and light industry.
After years of concentrating on heavy industry and forbidding foreign investment as part of a national philosophy of self-reliance, Mr. Kim endorsed a new agenda established last month at a meeting of the ruling party's Central Committee. Over the next three years, he said, the country must "implement to the letter the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign-trade policy."
He said the greatest emphasis would be placed on developing the coal industry, the power industry and rail transportation. The selection of those three areas is particularly telling. With the country's oil supplies dwindling -- Russia has cut off supplies to North Korea and China is reportedly demanding hard currency -- coal is the only domestically produced source of energy. Reporters visiting the country last year saw armed troops guarding the few piles of coal at major railroad junctions.
Cars are even scarcer than fuel in North Korea, and the roadbeds for the railroad system are in such poor condition that it takes days to move the length of the country. Much of the track, Japanese officials say, dates to Japan's colonization of Korea in the first half of the century.
In what may be an effort to placate a populace that by some accounts is growing increasingly restive over shortages of all kinds, Mr. Kim called for "a great upsurge in the production of consumer goods."
"In order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances and develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation," he said.

HEADLINE: THE NEW MAYOR;
With a 5-Borough Tour, Giuliani Starts His Term

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
On his first day in office Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani swept around New York City yesterday in a tour that seemed part victory lap and part opening of business, dropping in at Gracie Mansion, handing out cookies to civil servants and vowing to turn a candidate's promises into a mayor's actions.
Only hours after becoming the city's 107th mayor, Mr. Giuliani went to the 44th Precinct in the High Bridge section of the Bronx and announced that the police would set up the first of what he calls "safety zones" that he pledged to create around each of the city's schools. On Monday, he said, officers from the precinct will begin special patrols in the blocks around William H. Taft High School, one of the city's most violent schools. 
 Mr. Giuliani also sent a letter to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo calling for a repeal of the state's 5 percent tax on hotel rooms. The letter, signed by the Mayor and executives of Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester counties, argued that the reduction would "increase economic activity" by enticing conventions.
The announcements came as Mr. Giuliani, appearing fresh and even ebullient, stopped to visit city workers in each of the five boroughs -- from the police officers in the Bronx to nurses and supervisors at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens to drivers at the Jackie Gleason Bus Depot in Brooklyn.
 
New Mayor Feels 'Terrific'
 At the firehouse of Engine Company 160 on Staten Island, the company's cook, Gus Tripoli, greeted Mr. Giuliani with a hug and a kiss, and another firefighter, William Spade, gushed, "I wish him the best of luck in his next 4, 8, 12 years as Mayor."
For his part, Mr. Giuliani professed to feel "terrific" even though he had slept for only an hour or two before attending Mass yesterday morning at St. Monica's Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side. "I imagine a lot of New Yorkers had even less sleep than that," he said.
Mr. Giuliani's mayoralty began at 12:01 yesterday morning at the American Museum of Natural History, where he gave the oath of office to his four Deputy Mayors and most of his Commissioners. Soon, the less festive duties of being Mayor confronted Mr. Giuliani after two police officers were shot at 12:35 A.M. yesterday by someone on a rooftop in the Edenwald Houses in the Bronx.
Around 2:30 A.M., Mr. Giuliani went to the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center to visit the officers, who were only slightly injured. In the afternoon, he went to Staten Island University Hospital to visit a firefighter who broke his kneecap while fighting a fire yesterday morning.
"You are met immediately with the reality of many of the problems," Mr. Giuliani said. "But the spirit of New York has to be that none of these problems are bigger than us."
 
Campaign Promise
 Mr. Giuliani announced the creation of the safety zone around Taft High School as he appeared at the 44th Precinct station house with his appointee as Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton, who does not take office until Jan. 10.
It was Mr. Giuliani's first stop after Mass -- except for a brief diversion to his family's new home, Gracie Mansion at 88th Street and East End Avenue, to pick up his wife, Donna, and batches of cookies to pass out.
During the campaign, Mr. Giuliani promised to create the zones around each of the city's 1,069 schools to help protect students, residents and merchants from the encroachment of drugs, guns and violence into the schools.
Under the pilot plan announced yesterday, officers would patrol special beats on the Grand Concourse and 170th and 172d Streets and around the subway and bus stations near the high school, which was the most violent in the city last year, with 72 incidents. The officers would work with the transit and housing police forces, as well as with school security officials to coordinate strategies.
"The Mayor wanted going out the gate on his first day to be sure that his concerns expressed during the campaign were going to be met," Mr. Bratton said.
Aides to the Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, have already begun working with the police and the District Attorney's office in Queens to start a similar pilot program for five schools in Queens, including Far Rockaway High School.
Mr. Giuliani said that after Mr. Bratton takes over as Police Commissioner, he would review the plan at Taft and decide "how this concept or a varied form of this concept can help in other parts of the city."
 
Hotel Tax Cut Sought
 The call for a reduction of the hotel tax was another recurring promise of Mr. Giuliani's campaign. Mr. Giuliani has argued that the tax -- it totals 19.25 percent plus a $2 fee on hotel rooms in the city costing more than $100 -- had hurt tourism for an annual return of only $70 million.
Governor Cuomo unsuccessfully called for a repeal of the state's portion of the tax -- 5 percent -- last year and his aides said he would propose the cut again in his State of the State address on Wednesday. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Giuliani and the four county executives -- all Republicans -- can persuade the Legislature, where Republicans control the Senate, to agree to the repeal.
Mr. Giuliani said he was also "prepared to reduce some proportion" of the city's portion of the tax, which is now 6 percent. (The rest of the tax includes the 8.25 percent sales tax.)
It was dusk yesterday when Mr. Giuliani arrived at City Hall for the first time as Mayor. He swore in 15 criminal and civil court judges and then signed his first two executive orders, one reaffirming the existing orders to insure the continuity of government and the other outlining the responsibilities of the Deputy Mayors.
As he settled into the Mayor's office, the fulcrum of power he has sought for five years, he proclaimed, "It feels very good."

HEADLINE: GOLF;
The Mantra on the Pro Links Is Scores, Sponsors and Dollars

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN 

 BODY:
After a year in which scores were lower and stakes higher than any season in history, the major question for professional golf in 1994 is twofold: Can scores continue to drop and purses continue to rise?
The answer just might be yes, on both counts. 
 "Unless officials really start tricking up golf courses, the quality of the players today is so high that scores will keep going down, no question about it," said Greg Norman, arguably the top player in the world.
And, despite a still sluggish global economy, sponsors remain eager to throw wads of money at golfers. Purses are up on all three major United States golf tours. The PGA Tour has signed two new sponsors, Mercedes-Benz and Motorola, to long-term agreements. Last season, 23 players earned more than $1 million worldwide and that number is also expected to rise in 1994.
 
How Low Can You Go?
 Meanwhile, scoring in '93 was one giant limbo party -- how low can you go? In the four major championships, the winners were a combined 44 under par, the lowest total in history. Norman broke Tom Watson's 16-year-old scoring record at the British Open by shooting 267 at Royal St. George's; Lee Janzen shot 272 at Baltusrol in the United States Open to tie Jack Nicklaus's record set in 1980, and Paul Azinger was 1 stroke off the 72-hole record for the P.G.A. Championship with his 272, 12 under, at Inverness.
On the regular tour, Tom Kite shot 35 under par in the five rounds at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic and Nick Price, in his five worldwide victories, was 100 under par.
All told, a working title for 1993 from the American perspective could very well be "our cups runneth over." For the first time, the United States is in simultaneous possession of the Walker Cup, the Ryder Cup, the Dunhill Cup and the World Cup.
Whether this means that American golfers have regained their dominance over European counterparts is unclear. The Ryder Cup victory was close but convincing, and Corey Pavin's victory over Nick Faldo in the World Match Play Championship provided more fuel for the argument. But the most successful player on the PGA Tour last year was Price, the native of Zimbabwe, who won four United States events. And the best player on the world stage was Norman, the Australian native who won the British Open, came within two lipped-out putts of winning the P.G.A. Championship and won three other events.
What to do with John Daly, the best player who won't be playing, at least until March 31, remains problematic. Daly is under PGA Tour suspension and has been urged to undergo counseling for his admitted alcoholism. The debate about his future, and the effectiveness of the suspension, undoubtedly will continue through the year.
Also on the horizon in 1994 is a major power struggle between the PGA Tour and International Management Group over the staging of a year-end, Ryder Cup-style competition. The PGA Tour has, for the last year, been formulating plans for a biennial competition to begin this year. Tentatively called the President's Cup and tentatively scheduled for Congressional Golf Club in Washington in September, it would match members of a United States team against players from countries not eligible for Ryder Cup competition -- Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji, for example.
 
I.M.G. vs. PGA
 I.M.G. recently announced plans for a biennial year-end competition pitting the team currently in possession of the Ryder Cup against a team of players from countries in the southern hemisphere. The event would carry a purse of $2 million. Both groups say they have negotiated with various networks and cable companies for TV rights. Obviously, both events cannot take place.
The highlight of the year on the Ladies Professional Golf Association circuit is likely to be the Solheim Cup. This L.P.G.A. version of the Ryder Cup will be contested Oct. 21-23 at the Greenbrier, where the United States team will attempt to regain the Cup lost in 1992 to the Europeans at Dalmahoy in Scotland. Over all, L.P.G.A. Commissioner Charles Mechem has assembled a strong schedule, mitigated only by gaps in the third week in February and the fourth week in September.
Beth Daniel, without a victory since 1991, will be attempting to break out of her slump. Betsy King, who won player of the year honors in '93, can enter the L.P.G.A. Hall of Fame with one more victory. Brandie Burton, at the age of 21 the brightest star in women's golf and reminiscent of a young JoAnne Carner, has enough game to dominate. And Carner herself might yet become, at age 54, the oldest player, male or female, to win a professional golf tournament.
As for those truly elder belters on the Senior PGA Tour, stopping Dave Stockton will be the challenge of the year. Stockton collected five victories in his second senior season, a result of improved ball striking to go with his always deadly short game. Raymond Floyd will devote most of his time to the seniors, Lee Trevino plans to cut back, so look for a Floyd-Stockton duel for senior supremacy in '94.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Batting Cleanup Against the Owners for the 19th Time: Salary Arbitration

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Look out, here it comes again.
Even as the baseball owners were welcoming in the new year, the drinks in their hands were losing their taste and the owners themselves were losing their appetites. For how can they even think about having a happy new year when they know that a few days after the new year begins, players can begin filing for salary arbitration. 
 The scourge of the owners' economic existence is back for the 19th year, and those people who bear the brunt of the process desperately hope this will be the last time they are faced with it.
If negotiations for a new labor agreement ever begin -- the old one expired uneventfully at midnight Friday -- the owners will try to put salary arbitration in a time capsule and bury it deep underground, leaving it to be discovered by someone seeking the reason for the decline and fall of the business of baseball.
The players, of course, don't share the owners' view, either of the general status of baseball financially or the specific impact salary arbitration has had on baseball's fortunes. They are in no hurry to negotiate away the process, even if the owners offer to grant free agency earlier in a player's career.
Salary arbitration gave the players leverage in salary negotiations for the first time, and when the union gave away a year of eligibility in the 1985 collective bargaining agreement, the disenfranchised players raised their angry voices.
This year's eligible players may begin filing for arbitration Wednesday, but virtually all of them will wait until the last day, Jan. 14, so they don't have to exchange salary bids with their clubs until Jan. 18.
The players who filed a year ago had their salaries increase a collective 107 percent, the second highest percentage raise the procedure has spawned. Those who negotiated contracts after filing rather than have arbitration hearings enjoyed an all-time high 110 percent increase.
Clubs have adopted a two-pronged strategy to try to beat the game. In some cases, they let players become free agents rather than go to arbitration with them. In others, they already have negotiated contracts for the 1994 season. Their efforts have reduced the list of remaining eligibles to 112, which already is 4 fewer than the number of players who filed last year. And that number was the lowest since 104 filed in 1988.
Four clubs have eight players apiece on the arbitration-eligible list. Atlanta's group includes Ron Gant, David Justice and Steve Avery; Montreal has John Wetteland, Marquis Grissom and Larry Walker; St. Louis has Gregg Jefferies, Bob Tewksbury and Bernard Gilkey and Kansas City's list includes Kevin Appier and Brian McRae.
The Yankees have six players, including Jim Abbott and Xavier Hernandez, and the Mets are tied for the smallest list with one, Pete Smith.
The start of the salary-arbitration period comes against the backdrop of Richard Ravitch's last-ditch effort to forge a new revenue-sharing agreement among the owners. It has been the owners' inability to reach an agreement that has prevented Ravitch from initiating negotiations with the players union for a new collective bargaining agreement.
The latest information emanating from the revenue-sharing negotiations is that a large group of owners is not unhappy with the latest plan that has been proposed but that extreme groups at each end don't like it, the high-revenue extreme because they don't want any kind of an agreement and the low-revenue extreme because they think their needs would not be satisfied.
The players don't feel strongly either way. They just want their share of the owners' revenue.
 
A Gift for Hibbard
 Jim Bronner, Bob Gilhooley and their associates represent Greg Hibbard, but once the pitcher signs a contract with a new team, he should consider giving Larry Himes a 5 percent agent's fee.
Declaring "I really hate to do this, but I have no choice, we're out of money," Himes, the Chicago Cubs' executive vice president for player development, let Hibbard become a free agent by not tendering him a contract by the Dec. 20 deadline. The Cubs lost their No. 1 pitcher from last season, and Hibbard gained an opportunity he would not have had for two more years, when he would have first become eligible for free agency.
More than a half-dozen clubs instantly declared their interest in the 29-year-old left-hander. One, the Boston Red Sox, was said by the general manager of another club to have offered Hibbard $7.5 million for three years. Hibbard earned $1,425,000 last season while compiling a 15-11 record and becoming the first left-hander to lead the Cubs in victories since Ken Holtzman in 1966.
"My conditioning guys did a great job with him," Himes said of Hibbard. "He was in the best condition he's ever been in. It really helped him."
 
The Long Way Home
 Jesse Barfield finally has returned home, but to get there, he had to travel from New York to Houston by way of Japan. And before he could land safely, he had to wiggle out of a potential international incident.
Several years ago, Barfield was nearly traded to the hometown Astros. He wasn't, though, so it is only now, when the Astros have signed him as a free agent, that he can play right field for them -- if he wins the job.
"Houston was ideal for him," said Arthur Rosenberg, the outfielder's agent. "It makes it exciting for him. He enjoyed playing in Japan, but he missed his family and would like to play here."
According to another agent, though, Barfield accepted the Astros' offer several days after he accepted an offer from the Yakult Swallows of the Japanese league. Ray Negron, who secured a contract for Barfield with the Tokyo Giants for the 1993 season, said he negotiated an agreement with Yakult after the Giants released Barfield, and that the veteran accepted the deal.
"There was no signed contract,"' Negron said. "You don't need one. But in principle, he had accepted the deal. Then he called me and said, 'The Astros just gave me an offer I can't refuse.' "
Yakult officials were infuriated, Negron said, but the team's representative spoke with Barfield and concluded that his family didn't want him to go to Japan. Negron said the club's officials decided that they would relinquish their rights in exchange for a letter of apology.
The Swallows would have paid the 34-year-old Barfield a guaranteed $600,000 salary and provided the chance to earn an additional $400,000. The Astros will give Barfield $100,000 for coming to camp and a $250,000 salary if he makes the club. He also can earn $640,000 in bonuses based on number of games he starts or plays. With 2 points for a start and 1 point for an appearance, Barfield would make the maximum if he gets 250 points.
In Japan last season, Barfield batted .215, hit 26 home runs and drove in 55 runs. He was playing for the first time since a wrist injury that required two operations ended his 1992 season with the Yankees on June 17.
Every time an American player returns from Japan now, he is compared to Cecil Fielder, whose return four years ago brought the major leagues one of their most fearsome hitters.
"That would be too good to be true," Bob Watson, the Astros' general manager, said when a duplication of Fielder's return was mentioned. Instead, Watson cited another player who returned from Japan: Orestes Destrade, who batted .255, hit 20 home runs and drove in 87 runs last season for the Florida Marlins.
"If he does what Destrade did, I'll be pleased," Watson said. "First I want him to make our team. If he makes it, the rest will be easier."
 
A Violation Without a Grievance
 In baseball's recent labor history, any time a violation of the collective bargaining agreement has been alleged, the Players Association more often than not has been the side raising the charge. Here is an instance, however, where the union seems to be violating the agreement, but no one has filed a grievance over it.
Since 1979, the union has used a 9 percent rate in discounting parts of players' salaries that are deferred without interest. For the last several years, though, that rate has not been the one the labor contract says should be used.
Paragraph J of Article XV of the agreement stipulates that the discount rate be the prime interest rate in effect at Chemical Bank of New York the preceding Nov. 1 plus 1 percent, rounded to the nearest full percentage point. The current rate, then, should be 7 percent, which is the rate the Player Relations Committee has been using in computing the owners' version of salaries.
In discounting deferred money to determine present-day value, a 7 percent rate produces higher figures than 9 percent. Higher figures should be to the players' benefit, but the union explains it has continued to use 9 percent for consistency's sake. There is one other reason. The union also boosts signing bonuses by 9 percent for the period of advanced payments, and in this instance, 9 percent produces higher figures than 7 percent.
Because many more contracts have signing bonuses than deferred payments, the union benefits from its continued use of 9 percent. Nevertheless, the stipulated 7 percent produces higher present-day values for the new contracts of Will Clark with Texas and Rafael Palmeiro with Baltimore than the Players Association computations.
At a 7 percent discount, Clark's $30 million becomes $27,167,294, or $5,433,459 a year, and Palmeiro's $30.35 million becomes $28,096,940, or $5,619,388 a year.

HEADLINE: BOATING;
As the Boat Show Prepares to Open, the Forecast Calls for Blue Skies and Sunshine

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
It has been a hard sell the last few years persuading cash-strapped consumers to spend money on boats. But the recession that struck the marine industry in 1989 appears to be lifting, a long-awaited sign for exhibitors at the annual New York National Boat Show.
In its 84th year this season, the nine-day show is scheduled to begin Saturday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. This Friday, a preview is open to anyone willing to spend $20 rather than the usual $8 for a ticket. More than 850 boats will be on display, from 50-foot motor yachts to small sailing dinghies, as well as electronic gear and boating accessories. 
 "I think the feeling we are getting from dealers is optimistic," said Michael Duffy, the boat show manager. "Consumer confidence seems to be picking up a little."
The statistics appear to support his contention. Greg Proteau, spokesman for the National Marine Manufacturers Association, said last week that the boating industry is expected to grow by 6 to 10 percent in 1994. In 1993, 487,000 new boats were sold in the United States, an increase of 7 percent from 1992.
 
Some Jobs Are Coming Back
 Manufacturers are showing signs of the increasing vigor. For example, Wellcraft Marine, a major United States boat builder, has rehired about 300 of the 1,400 employees it laid off during the last four years.
Gordon Houser, director of marketing, said that large cruising yachts are selling again with the repeal last summer of a 10 percent Federal luxury tax on boats valued at more than $100,000. "New looks have a lot to do with it, too," Houser said. "And interest rates are down."
Wellcraft plans to show its new 3600 Martinique, a 36-foot powerboat designed with a large cockpit and three separate sleeping areas. A 3600 equipped with twin 310-horsepower Mercruiser engines sells for about $130,000.
About 20 percent of the New York show's boats are sailing craft. Among the largest will be yachts from Hunter Marine and Beneteau. Buyers interested in sailboats also have the opportunity to attend another New York area boat show, the Sail Expo exhibition, Feb. 5-13 in Atlantic City, N.J.
 
Fishing Finds a Bigger Niche
 Fishing boats and accessories are being given added emphasis this year at the New York show. A 35-foot, 3,500-gallon aquarium, the Hawg Trough, will be set up at the show to demonstrate game-fish catching techniques.
Besides offering fishing seminars, show organizers have lined up exhibitors that plan to introduce new models for 1994. Century Boat, of Panama City, Fla., is expected to reveal details about its 1860 Intracoastal, an 18-foot center console motorboat designed for both fresh and saltwater fishing.
Zodiac of North America, the French inflatable boat manufacturer, plans to show its new Fish n'Hunt boats, the FH 10.2 and FH 12.6. The olive-green inflatables come equipped with swivel seats, collapsible paddles, fishing-rod storage mounts and fittings for a hunting blind. The boats, which come with 9.9-horsepower Mercury engines, vary in price from about $2,500 to $3,500.
Zodiac is also introducing its new Fastroller line, a series of small inflatables that come with new high-pressure, inflatable floorboards instead of standard marine plywood boards.
A special section at the show will feature boats of the future, such as a scale model of the Nautilus 3, which looks more like a space ship than a powerboat. It is is being developed by the Swedish engine manufacturer, Volvo Penta.
 
Buyer, Beware
 Exhibitors often come to the boat show with package deals in which buyers can save money. But Boat/U.S., a national organization for recreational boaters, warns consumers to shop carefully.
Caroline Ajootian, consumer protection director for Boat/U.S., urges buyers to specify in the purchase contract that they want the right to test their new boat in sea trials. It is also important to specify a delivery date in the contract so that dealers can't delay the transaction. "If they're hungry enough, they shouldn't argue about it," Ajootian said. "Go about it as if this is your right."
For further information about the show, which ends Jan. 16, call (212) 459-4433. Hours are from noon to 8 P.M., Monday through Friday; 10 A.M. to 9 P.M., Saturdays; and from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M., Sundays.
 
 
 
MAKING WAVES
 The 14 international challengers for the America's Cup have until the end of the banking day tomorrow in San Diego to come up with a final performance bond of $250,000. The money will be refunded to each group that shows up at the starting line of the 1995 cup trial races.

HEADLINE: THE NEW MAYOR;
Assembling an Administration: Old Friends, Seasoned Hands

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took the reins of the city government yesterday with an administration composed of several seasoned hands joined by several old friends and recent political allies who have little or no experience in city government.
In the incoming administration are three former commissioners and four midlevel aides from the Koch administration, three commissioners from the Dinkins team and three experienced commissioners from other cities who will take over agencies much larger than those they leave. 
 But in the upper echelon of deputy mayors and senior advisers, only two, Paul A. Crotty and Richard J. Schwartz, know the inner workings of the city bureaucracy from their days as officials in the Koch administration. Acting on old friendship and loyalty, Mr. Giuliani has chosen Peter J. Powers, a lawyer, to head his City Hall staff.
Mr. Giuliani has also drawn on the United States Attorney's office, which he himself headed, for talent, bringing in former prosecutors like Dennison Young Jr. and Randy M. Mastro as top aides. His other senior appointments are people with vast experience in state government: John S. Dyson, the flamboyant former head of the State Power Authority, and Abraham M. Lackman, an experienced Republican budgetmaker from the State Senate staff.
The upper echelons of the administration are dotted with critical political supporters, like Ninfa Segarra, a member of the Board of Education, and Carlos M. Rivera, a former Fire Commissioner.
And although the administration is largely complete, Mr. Giuliani must make several important appointments, including commissioners of sanitation, corrections and consumer affairs.

HEADLINE: Japan Faces the Unthinkable: A Shortage of Engineers

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
SHUTARU SHIRAHATA is in the science and engineering school at Waseda University, but he is studying to be a manager.
"I don't want to be an engineer, actually, because that has a rather dark image," the 19-year-old freshman said. He said the physics geniuses and computer whizzes at school "look very strange to me. They look like nerds." 
 The ambitions of Mr. Shirahata and other young people like him are beginning to worry Japan's Government and industry leaders.
This nation has long honored engineers as the heroes of its rise to industrial supremacy. But now, the Government says, young people are losing interest in science and technology, and that could lead to a shortage of engineers and might dull the nation's competitiveness.
One reason for the trend, the Government says, is that youths in Japan are so accustomed to video games, computers and other gadgets they have lost their sense of wonder about technology. There is also the "black-box syndrome," meaning modern machines are so complex that people cannot figure out how they work -- and this denies opportunities for would-be tinkerers.
Another reason has to do with pay. Engineers earn less money than bankers in Japan. There is also the fact that science education is boring, stressing memorization instead of creative exploration. And, finally, Japan's affluent young people are becoming too lazy for the hard work that engineering and science demand.
"There is a tendency among high school students to view university science and engineering students as preoccupied with study," the Science and Technology Agency said in a lengthy report issued last month.
It is an article of faith here that one reason Japan's industry has become so strong is because the nation's brightest students become engineers, while many top American students pursue law or business degrees. With half the population of the United States, Japan has about the same number of engineers but just a small fraction of the number of lawyers.
So the signs that engineering is losing its allure are not taken lightly. The Prime Minister's science and technology council set up a special subcommittee that is scheduled to recommend solutions by this summer. And the Science and Technology Agency devoted its annual white paper last year to that theme.
According to the agency's report, the proportion of college students applying for engineering programs has dropped steadily, to 12.7 percent in 1992 from 17.2 percent in 1986.
The number of new students enrolling in engineering -- 82,213 in 1992 -- has not decreased, however, because in some universities there are still more applicants than positions. In other cases, students end up taking engineering because they cannot get into the department that is their first choice.
THE report also said that according to opinion polls, just 41 percent of people in their 20's said they were interested in science and technology news and topics in 1991, well below the 55 percent for the same age bracket 10 years earlier. For people aged 30 and above, interest in science stayed the same or rose during the decade.
Nikkei Business, a weekly magazine, followed with a cover story last month bemoaning the state of science education and questioning whether Japan could be a technological superpower. It quoted unnamed industrial engineers and professors as saying that young engineers and engineering students nowadays cannot even repair a simple circuit or turn a screwdriver.
All this might seem to be a bit much for a country in which a high school prepares students for math and science college entrance exams that are so tough they would make an American Ph. D. candidate blanch.
Indeed, some say, the worry about the technical workforce is somewhat overblown, and is just a sign of a country that is stuck in a severe economic slump, by its own standards of booming growth, and has a colossal case of anxiety about its future. Some say a decline in engineers is to be expected as Japan evolves from a manufacturing economy to a service economy.
Skeptics say the departure from science and technology has been just a temporary phenomenon caused by Japan's bubble economy of the late 1980's, a time of quick riches and rampant financial speculation. During the bubble, many students, even those with engineering or science degrees, chose to work for banks or securities companies, making it harder for manufacturing companies to hire good people.
But now that the bubble era is over and many financial companies are tainted with scandals, the trends are starting to reverse, they say. "After the collapse of the bubble, people are coming to again recognize the value of manufacturing things," said Mitsuo Shiraishi, professor and dean of academic affairs at Tokyo Denki University, a technical college.
Moreover, at least for the present, there is no shortage of engineers. With automobile, electronics and steel companies reducing their hiring to cut costs, even engineering graduates are having trouble finding jobs, though not as much trouble as liberal arts graduates are having.
BUT Yukihiro Hirano, director of the research division of the science agency's policy bureau, said that while the bubble "is one of the triggers" of a departure from engineering careers, the long-term trend of lower interest in science and technology will remain.
Such a waning interest in technology has also been seen in the United States and Europe, Mr. Hirano said. One difference is that Japan does not seem to have the strong anti-technology feeling that exists among some people in the United States and Europe, who blame technology for pollution, the arms race and other evils. In Japan, he said, the problem is more one of apathy toward science than antipathy toward it.
Some trace the purported decline in interest in science to deterioration in science education in Japan. Kiyoshi Fujii, principal of Yotsuya Elementary School No. 6 in Tokyo, said the number of hours devoted to science classes in grade schools has been declining, leaving less time for experiments. And while at one time there were many elementary school teachers who had majored in science in college, that is less true nowadays, especially because more women are becoming teachers.
"Teachers who in their childhood never touched an insect are teaching science now," he said.
COLLEGE science education also has its problems. In contrast to Japan's usually well-endowed industrial laboratories, university labs are famous for being ill equipped and decrepit because Government research funding is so skimpy.
To increase interest, the Science and Technology Agency's report recommends exposing people to laboratory work and trying to interest more women in science and engineering. In virtually all countries, fewer women than men pursue technical careers. But in Japan, where women are limited in career opportunities in general, the disparity is greater than in the United States, Mr. Hirano said.
The number of high school students taking the entrance examination for Tokyo Denki University declined to 17,000 in 1993, from about 25,000 in the late 1980's, a drop of about a third, even as the overall number of students entering colleges rose.
The school has tried to make its entrance exam less intimidating by adding questions to which students may draw cartoons for answers. It has also begun sponsoring more lectures and programs for high school students, such as summer personal computer lessons.

HEADLINE: For Drugstores, Pushing Pills Is Much Less Profitable

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
UNTIL you talk to them, Bert Drachtman and Alexander Grass do not seem to have much in common. Mr. Drachtman and his wife run the Seventh Avenue Pharmacy in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, while Mr. Grass runs the Rite Aid Corporation, a $4 billion-a-year drugstore chain that definitely is not a Mom and Pop operation.
But increasingly, Mr. Drachtman and Mr. Grass are talking the same language. 
 "In today's marketplace, it is difficult to stay alive," Mr. Drachtman said.
Mr. Grass knows where Mr. Drachtman is coming from. "We see this from the same viewpoint because we are both being disadvantaged," he said.
Pharmacy retailing has become a bruisingly competitive world, and drugstores are being hemmed in by health maintenance organizations, hospitals and mail-order houses, all of which the druggists claim have had big advantages handed to them by major drug manufacturers. With their profit margins narrowing, rafts of retailers have closed their doors in the last two years, and others are sure to follow as cheaper forms of drug distribution gain favor.
To survive, druggists are banding together to negotiate volume discounts from drug makers. Some have even taken their cases to Washington and to the courts.
MORE than 90 percent of prescriptions are still filled by independent and chain drugstores, but pushing pills is not nearly as profitable as it once was. Net profits per prescription have fallen by about 36 percent, in 1990 dollars, since 1970, according to the 1992 annual report on the pharmaceutical industry by Lily Digest, a publication put out by Eli Lilly & Company, and the Prime Institute at the University of Minnesota.
Mr. Drachtman said that when he started his business 23 years ago, gross profit margins on prescriptions averaged between 35 percent and 40 percent. "Now you are working on 5 percent to 18 percent, and going down," he said.
Why? For one, drugstores must compete with fast-growing competitors. H.M.O.'s, hospitals and mail-order houseshave been able to get deep discounts from drug manufacturers, and independent and chain stores say these discounts have not come their way even though they formed bargaining cooperatives.
"Nitro patches cost me about $40 for a box of 30," said Dan Phillips, a co-owner of the Adobe Pharmacy in Sonoma, Calif., referring to nitroglycerine medication used by heart patients. "I have a buddy who is a hospital pharmacist who pays $1 for a box of 100."
Retail pharmacists say these rivals get favorable treatment because they can guarantee drug makers much-prized market share. By limiting their menus to a single brand of every drug, H.M.O.'s and hospitals can offer drug manufacturers exclusivity -- and play them against each other to get the steepest discounts for those rights. But retailers must offer customers a choice of brands.
While pharmacists have lowered their prices, they are not the cheapest choice for such third-party health care payers as insurance companies and employers, which are estimated to account for about 60 percent of all prescription purchases. As a result, these payers are increasingly demanding further reductions from pharmacies or are mandating that plan participants go elsewhere for their drugs.
"A lot of people don't come in anymore," said Ken Epley, who has run the South Salem Pharmacy in Salem, Ore., for 18 years. "And a lot are embarrassed because they can't come in" because their plans do not allow it.
What is more, some customers are bypassing their local pharmacies for other over-the-counter products that are cheaper elsewhere. As aggressive price-cutting competitors like grocery chains and warehouse stores cram their shelves with everything from aspirin to foot powder, pharmacists have lost health and beauty business that accounts for the 40 percent to 50 percent of revenue not derived from prescription drugs.
"Consumers have found so many outlets for these products that chains and independents have to find an answer to the question of how they are going to add value to the front end of the store," said Rick Church, an analyst who follows chain drugstores for Smith Barney Shearson Inc.
As a result, a number of pharmacies have found themselves in no position to stay in business. "Our best guess is that we have probably lost about 1,000 pharmacies over the last two years," said Todd Dankmyer, a spokesman for the National Association of Retail Druggists, a trade group that represents about 40,000 independent pharmacies.
Fred Mayer, a pharmacist in Sausalito, Calif., claims that his state has lost 600 independents in the last 18 months.
Yet competitors and analysts say that the pharmacists are crying wolf and that much of the downsizing is not unlike what is going on in retailing generally. In today's cost-conscious health-care environment, they add, value is in. That means the convenience and personalized attention that pharmacists offer may have become unaffordable luxuries.
"In the late 1960's, the independents complained that the chains had a price advantage over them," said Del Konnor, executive vice president of the American Managed Care Pharmacy Association, which represents mail-order houses like Medco Containment Services Inc. "Now, 25 years later, they have a new scapegoat. Competition is probably the keenest it has ever been in the pharmaceutical practice, and the consumer is benefiting."
Robert C. Johnson, chairman and chief executive of PCS Health Systems, a subsidiary of the McKesson Corporation and the nation's largest prescription benefits management company, said: "The theory that has worked successfully, to a degree, is forcing larger volumes of patients through fewer numbers of providers. This effort began in the mid-1980's in hospitals, was successful there, then spread to the medical profession, where group practice became commonplace. That same philosophy has spread to the pharmacy."
Mr. Johnson said that in the last five years, reimbursements to pharmacists for professional fees for dispensing drugs and counseling patients have remained "fairly constant." But in the same period, reimbursements for drugs have been cut by 10 percent to 15 percent.
"It is that reduction that has really put the squeeze on the pharmacist," he said.
With their livelihoods on the line, pharmacists big and small have waged counterattacks on several fronts. Pharmacists have spent considerable time and effort lobbying the Clinton Administration and have endorsed the President's health care legislation, which proposes to eliminate, to some degree, variances in drug prices.
"The Clinton plan would help to level the playing field, which we think will generate competition," said Jerome Sager, executive director and general counsel of the Empire State Pharmaceutical Society, which represents around 1,000 stores in New York State.
The druggists have also banded together to form buying units in hopes of increasing their bargaining clout with drug manufacturers. Last month, McKesson, the nation's largest drug wholesaler, linked 4,000 Valu-Rite pharmacies to create the nation's largest pharmacy marketing cooperative network.
But to date, alliances among independent and chain drugstores have won only grudging concessions from the manufacturers.
"On the generic drug side of the industry, we get very good prices, probably as good as anyone, and that is what has kept the independent retailers in business," said Benji Wyatt, president and chief executive of Pace Alliance Inc., a retail-pharmacy buying group with more than 3,000 retail drugstores, mostly in the Midwest.
"But on the brand-name side, we have not had much success with the bigger companies, even though some of them are beginning to negotiate with us."
To force the issue, pharmacists have taken legal action.
"If we can get more competition for drug companies for our business, then prices to consumers are going to go down for brand-name prescription drugs," Mr. Wyatt said.
In August a group of California pharmacists represented by Joseph Alioto, the former mayor of San Francisco, filed a class action against a number of major drug manufacturers, accusing them of wide-ranging violations of Federal antitrust laws, including price discrimination and illegal price fixing. That suit was followed in October by a similar action in Pennsylvania, where 10 chains, including Rite Aid, joined 10 pharmacies against seven big drug companies.
And at a November hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Mark D. Whitener, acting deputy director of the bureau of competition at the Federal Trade Commission, said the agency is investigating charges of price discrimination in prescription drug distribution.
Because of the pending lawsuits, drug manufacturers were reluctant to comment on the pricing issue.
Through a spokesman, Merck, which is being sued in California, asserted that its "pricing practices are fair and legal."
MEANWHILE, pharmacists argue that they serve a serious purpose. They see more patients each year than practicing physicians, and their services are highly valued: for the fifth year in a row last year, pharmacists were the nation's most respected group of professionals in a survey conducted by the Gallup Organization. (In the 1993 survey, doctors ranked fourth.)
"The big thing pharmacists have to sell is their service, knowledge of their patients and the ability to deliver to their patients on a timely basis," Mr. Sager said.
Mr. Johnson of PCS, a former pharmacist, suggested that retailers are caught in a market shift driven by economic forces. "The pharmaceutical industry is finally coming to the realization that the physician is no longer the influencer of the drug product decision," he said.
"What we are seeing today is manufacturers who will have to start negotiating pricing with the individual at health maintenance organizations that are putting together approved drug lists. How much opportunity the retail pharmacy will have to participate in this is still up in the air."

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
That Was the Week That Wasn't
Let's be honest about it: Nothing much happened last week -- except figuring out where to put those presents, how to pay those bills. Yes, Government numbers came out, agencies made rulings, corporations issued press releases. But we know computers were spitting out that data to maintain the illusion that solemn, sober capitalism can cruise through the holidays with barely a hiccup. It brings to mind that futuristic classroom where the teacher's voice sputters out of a tape recorder, heard only by rows of students' tape recorders. Still, the economic news that got through -- especially the word of surprising strength in the housing market -- was enough to nudge the stock market to three straight records, as the Dow industrials got within a hair of 3,800 before turning tail at week's end. 

Health Bill Rising as Fast as Ever
Yes, we've heard that prices for medical products and services are rising more slowly. But here's the catch: medical technology keeps on growing, as do the ranks of the elderly. So health spending is rising as fast as ever -- even with the prospect of an overhaul of the whole mess. Last week, in fact, the Commerce Department said the nation's health care spending would pass $1 trillion for the first time this year, rising 12.5 percent. And health spending is taking an ever-bigger bite of the gross domestic product -- an estimated 15 percent this year.
 
Chance of Life: What's It Worth?
It's easy in the abstract to say health spending should be cut, but it's harder when a life -- a special, specific life -- might be saved. Desperate people want to try anything. But who pays? When H.M.O.'s cut costs, where do you draw the line? A jury drew a line in California last week, deciding that one H.M.O., Health Net, was too frugal when it balked at paying for a bone-marrow transplant for a woman who later died of breast cancer, awarding her family $89.3 million. So does this settle anything? Of course not. Lines must, and will, be drawn if health spending is to be tamed.
 
If Only People Paid Their Taxes
The I.R.S., no doubt inspired by a bit too much holiday cheer, has had a truly fanciful vision: a world in which every American reports all income, from daylight job or moonlight, and nobody gets imaginative in figuring deductions. And last week the I.R.S. Commissioner, Margaret Milner Richardson, put a price tag on this imperfect world. Tax cheating, she said, costs the nation $150 billion a year, enough to wipe out three-fifths of the budget deficit. And just as those nasty tax forms head for mailboxes, the I.R.S. declared war, saying greater compliance was its "first major goal." (In that form, by the way, you'll notice you can now assign $3, up from $1, to Presidential campaigns. If that means the 2000 campaign is three times normal length, it will start before the 1996 election.)
 
Out With the Old (House)
The air may have been cold as the year huffed its last, but the economy was undeniably hot. The hottest spot: home sales. First came a report that November's sales of existing homes hit a record pace, followed by word that new-home sales surged to the highest rate since 1986. And that signals more good economic news, because home buyers just keep on spending -- on carpets, paint, appliances, and, of course, lawyers. That's especially true of first-time buyers, who were out in force. But there's more: the Government's index of leading indicators rose 0.5 percent, the fourth straight monthly rise, and jobless claims plunged to 291,000, the lowest in nearly five years. So as the year ended, one economist said it clearly: "All's clear on the recession watch."
 
And They Still Call It January
Now that it's Super Bowl Month, let's get one thing clear: there is nothing to the rumor that the TV folks just keep showing the same game, year after year, and no one notices because they're too busy whooping and hollering. Absolutely nothing to it. A treasonous lie, no doubt dreamed up by one of those 14 Americans (some estimates put it as high as 17) who don't watch the game. Advertisers clearly don't believe it, for they're paying NBC a record $900,000 to pitch sneakers or colas or beers for 30 seconds. That's $30,000 a second, about what many people make in a year. How must they feel, having a year's sweat and toil valued the same as a fleeting televised moment amid a helmeted blur? "That," said one marketing official, "is a sobering way to dimensionalize it." And if you've got an extra million in your ad budget, better hurry: as of last week, most of the 56 half-minute spots had been sold.
 
COMPANIES
 
New Wings for an Old Name?
In the end, nothing was left of Pan Am but its name. Already bankrupt, it stopped flying two years ago, and its assets were sold. But what a name it is! It evokes a whole era of aviation history, back to 1927. So just that mighty trademark -- which couldn't get you on the subway, much less around the world -- sold recently for $1.325 million. And the buyer, Charles Cobb, now says he might even start an airline.
 
4-Letter Words, 8-Figure Profits
Today's topic, class, is the economics of obscenity. Let's see: Infinity Broadcasting, Howard Stern's employer, earned about $90 million last year, and Mr. Stern's very public parts had a lot to do with that. The F.C.C. has fined Infinity $1.2 million because of Mr. Stern's mouth, of which Infinity has paid nothing. The bottom line (as Mr. Stern might say): obscenity pays. Now the F.C.C., which has gotten thousands of complaints about Mr. Stern's radio show, wants to change that. Last week it raised the stakes, delaying deals worth $170 million in which Infinity planned to buy three radio stations, and that could cost Infinity millions. In the end, the Supreme Court will probably decide how free speech can be.
 
A Top Prudential Casualty
Scandal reaches ever higher at Prudential Securities. Last week Loren Schechter, the top current executive being investigated by Federal prosecutors, resigned as general counsel. He is said to have come under scrutiny for his failure to stop misrepresentations of the safety of limited partnerships sold in the 80's.
 
Brutes in Toyland
The world's really a simple place. Women dream of weddings, men of guns. Don't believe it? Look at today's dolls -- Barbies that chirp, "Let's go shopping!"; G.I. Joes that snarl, "Eat lead, Cobra!" A group of Manhattan performance artists decided that such toys "encourage negative behavior in children" -- and came up with a novel way to make its point. It simply swapped the voice boxes in some dolls so that a G.I. Joe will whimper, "Will we ever have enough clothes?" and Barbie snaps, "Attack!"
 
Death of an I.B.M. Pioneer
A generation ago, Thomas J. Watson Jr. guided a mighty I.B.M. into the computer age. On the last day of a year that I.B.M. would love to forget, Mr. Watson died at 79.
 
Sign of Strength for Railroads
You don't hear much about the railroad industry, but it's quietly building strength. The latest of many signs: last week CSX ordered 300 high-efficiency locomotives from G.E. And for CSX, it's proof of a return to basics.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
A Ford in Mazda's Present
Remember the days when it seemed that Japan was putting America in its shopping cart and wheeling it calmly away? Gone, long gone. American auto makers have roared back, while the Japanese have sputtered. Mazda has been especially hard hit, after expanding too fast when times were flush; last year, in fact, it may have lost $300 million. Last week, Mazda all but fell on its sword, suddenly ceding more control to Ford, which with a 25 percent stake was already its largest shareholder. And it's more than an investment for Ford: the American company will now have a lot to say about Mazda's future, and a Ford executive will become a top Mazda manager. So, what next? Will the cycle come round again, with Japan calling the shots at the Big Three a decade from now?
 
China Updates Its Currency
A big question mark as a new world order takes shape is the role the huge Chinese economy will play. Last week, China took a clear step toward becoming part of that world order, ending a two-tier exchange rate for its currency. This is not full convertibility -- something it has promised GATT within five years, and something it must have to truly join the outer world. But by ending a system that allowed a black market on which the yuan was worth far less than it was officially, it will ease the flow of exports and imports and help to establish a market economy.
 
Troubles in Spanish Banking
Spain's banking industry was in turmoil last week after central bankers took over the nation's third-largest bank, Banco Espanol de Credito, and replaced its chairman, Mario Conde. There were signs of trouble at the bank, known as Banesto, which had expanded aggressively under Mr. Conde, and regulators badly wanted to protect the credibility of the nation's banking system. But bank stocks quickly took a beating.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
After a Boring 1993, Let's Hope For a Repeat

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THIS bull market is the dullest in a generation. While major stock indexes were setting records as 1993 ended, the really amazing fact was just how little action there had been. Had you bought the Standard & Poor's 500 at its lowest close of last year, and sold it at the high reached last week, you would have made a profit of 9.8 percent.
Never in the previous six decades of the S.&P. had the swing from annual bottom to top been so flat. But that low volatility should not have come as a shock. The old record for smallest annual swing was set in 1992, at 11.9 percent. 
 And it isn't just big stock indexes that show a lack of vigor. The Nasdaq composite was more than twice as volatile as the S.&P. 500 last year, with a swing of 21.9 percent. But that is the third-smallest Nasdaq move in the past 20 years.
To be sure, there are owners of many stocks who found last year anything but dull. Philip Morris shares plunged along with cigarette prices and General Motors stock soared as the weak dollar forced Japanese car makers to raise their prices. "The volatility of individual stocks has not collapsed," says Philip Smyth, an analyst at Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn. "But when you look at the indices, it just keeps getting smoother."
It is possible to have violent swings within a narrow range, but that did not happen either. Last year saw just 17 occasions when the S.&P. ended the day up or down at least 1 percent from the prior session. That was down from 75 such days in 1990.
Why so quiet? Partly, it is the lack of surprises on the economic front. No doubt it also reflects the way Wall Street has adjusted to program trading, as it adjusted years ago to the trading of big blocks. At first, both produced heavy volatility. Now, notwithstanding Friday's late slip caused by some options expiring, complaints are rarely heard about either.
But mutual funds and low interest rates have also played a role. The prevailing sentiment among mutual fund managers is that they are paid to pick winning stocks, not to hold cash at these puny rates. So even when fund managers bail out of the latest disappointment, they tend to plow the money back into other stocks, and index moves are mild.
The time most comparable to the present, the only other one in which the S.&P. had two consecutive years with annual moves of less than 15 percent, was 1964-65. The following year saw the return of volatility, and share prices fell as both inflation and the Viet Cong proved stronger than Washington expected.
Peace and quiet is not everyone's idea of heaven. Those who crave action inevitably have begun to look elsewhere. It took the S.&P. 500 a whole year to move less than 10 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index managed more action than that in the last five trading days of the year. Investors chasing performance are buying funds that invest in emerging markets.
Let them. Our New Year's wish is for a 1994 market just as boring, and as profitable, as 1993's.

HEADLINE: Lawyers, Class Actions and Fees

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article understates the damage done to individual investors when a firm such as Beigel & Sandler files class actions on their behalf and then agrees to a pathetically small settlement. 
 If Herbert Beigel truly advised individuals that "No one should be in a class action who has a strong individual claim except for a person whose claim is of such small monetary value that it would be economically unfeasible to bring a claim any other way," his business would disappear.
In the recent JMB Realty/Merrill Lynch case, where his firm received more than $1 million for negotiating and recommending a settlement paying the investors less than two cents on the dollar, this advice did not appear in any press statements or in the mailing to investors. The reason this sort of settlement is accepted by the investors is that investors have to act to exclude themselves, and act within a short time. In the JMB/Merrill case, less than a month was available. If the investor doesn't receive notice, or needs an explanation of the complicated choices involved, he or she is out of luck.
Our firm represents individual investors with claims starting at $5,000 in securities arbitration, primarily on a contingency basis. We have not seen investors in arbitration, even after the payment of fees and costs, wind up with as little as they would have in class actions. If, as Mr. Beigel says, the cases he settles so cheaply are weak, why do investors recover so much more on an individual basis?

HEADLINE: Africa, Out in the Cold

 BODY:
In a burst of compassion and amid loud applause, the United States a year ago rushed to the rescue of the sick and starving in Somalia. But for Africans, this holiday season is even bleaker, and not just for Somalis. When the humanitarian mission in Somalia went sour, most of Africa below the Sahara also seemed to drop from sight. Every bit of bad news -- civil wars, military coups, drought and disease -- has sadly reinforced a mood of fatalism or still worse, callous unconcern.
Yet it is one thing to recognize Africa's economic and political ills, and quite another to let them become the pretext for doing little or nothing. Much that has gone wrong in Africa springs from causes beyond African control; that, too, needs to be recognized. First and most grievous is the steady drop over a decade in the world prices for African exports, which in turn has shrunk the private investment flow to sub-Saharan states from $10 billion in 1982 to $4.7 billion in 1990. 
 The dismaying results are underscored by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the first U.N. Secretary General from Africa. For countries below the Sahara, foreign debts, described by Mr. Boutros-Ghali as a "millstone around the neck," have risen to the equivalent of 106 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 37 percent for another debtor region, Latin America.
This has cruelly coincided with a decline in development loans from multilateral banks. New lending commitments to sub-Saharan Africa by the World Bank in its last financial year fell by $1.2 billion, or 30 percent. That in part reflects sharper competition for all foreign aid. The World Bank's commitments to Eastern Europe, for example, rose in the same year to $3.8 billion from $1.7 billion.
Doubtless, as the World Bank says, Africa's political volatility helps explain this contrast. But it is also true that sub-Saharan Africa has been the biggest loser as the cold war has ended. A decade ago, the Reagan Administration expatiated on Africa's vital maritime "choke-points," its wealth of natural resources and the presence of 37,000 Communist economic technicians below the Sahara. Now the technicians have disappeared, along with Soviet-bloc aid, and so has Africa's cold war leverage.
What this also implies was spelled out at a conference in Namibia by a British parliamentarian, Sir David Steel: "We in the West cheerfully supported appalling dictatorships because they were on the 'right' side in the cold war. Now that this shadow is lifted, we demand instant standards of good governance. This is not good enough."
So what is good enough? A little more aid and debt forgiveness in extreme cases would make a difference. So would incentives for political and market reforms. But what might achieve more, at negligible cost, would be a concerted diplomatic initiative to bring an end to wars that beggar and uproot so many peoples in Angola and Mozambique, in Liberia and the Sudan, in Somalia and Rwanda.
Remarkably, Africa has witnessed real gains in the past year. South Africa has repudiated apartheid. Peace, however tenuous, prevails in Ethiopia; Eritrea has won its right to independence. Armies have demobilized in Uganda, and its economy is percolating. In a broad swath of countries, from Kenya to Zambia, from Malawi to Gabon, ordinary people are clamoring for human and political rights. Gains like these merit a more generous -- and attentive -- response from richer nations.

HEADLINE: Clear Today; Tomorrow, Who Knows?;
Catch '94

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
IT'S a new year and therefore -- admit it and face it bravely -- time to look ahead. The good news (or maybe not) is that the future may not be quite the yawning void of which Marcus Aurelius wrote. That's only if the past is indeed prologue. But it may not be. It does, however, allow some educated guesses at what's coming. Herewith a handful: 
 Will you be better off in 1994 than in 1993?
That's the sort of question that got George Bush and Jimmy Carter into a peck of trouble. But there is a whole cottage industry of economic prognosticators out there who are happy to answer, provided you promise to forget which ones were dead wrong. And for better or worse, most are mildly bullish on America.
The forecasts of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are among the most cautious and, by no coincidence, the most copied. Its computer jockeys expect 3 percent growth in output next year, enough to clip half a percentage point off the unemployment rate by the end of '94 but not enough to kindle even a spark of inflation.
The catch, of course, is what the catch has long been: the American economy is so big and so diverse that the averages mask much of what you'd really like to know. As of November, for example, the national unemployment rate was 6.3 percent. But it was twice as high for blacks and three times as high for 16-to-19 year-olds unlucky enough to be out of school.
Nor do the averages have much to say about the diverging fortunes of regions and industries. While the heartland is chugging right along, the economies of Southern California and New England are still taking on water. And although DRI/McGraw-Hill is forecasting a zippy 9 percent increase in office equipment output next year, weapons makers are staring at a 5 percent fall.
Perhaps the most elusive part of the economic equation is also the most important: how the bounty of the recovery-in-progress will be divided. It's been tough -- much too tough -- being young, unskilled or a single parent heading a household for a very long time. From 1974 to 1991 the percentage of children in poverty rose from 15 percent to 22, while during the same period the percentage of elderly who were poor fell from 15 percent to 12.
Predicting what will happen to this and related measures of income distribution requires a suspension of disbelief, since the causes of the divergence are still a mystery. But there are straws in the wind suggesting that the later 1990's will not be as hard on the have-littles. PETER PASSELL

HEADLINE: Welfare and Social Work Both Need Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Welfare Recipients Are Victims, Not Criminals" (letter, Dec. 20) by Jennifer E. Baity, a graduate student at the Columbia University School of Social Work, states she is alarmed by the "frightening implications" of President Clinton's proposed welfare reform. 
 To illustrate, she describes a client she is working with "who speaks of nothing but getting a job and getting off welfare."
Her client is a single mother with three children younger than 6, who lives in subsidized housing and receives assistance from the aid to families with dependent children program, food stamps and Medicaid. She says her client had been working but lost her job because her day-care arrangements "fell apart" with the birth of her third child.
Why is it that Ms. Baity thinks that a client who talks of getting a job and getting off welfare is an indication of responsibility? She would be serving her client more effectively if she were to advocate family planning.
In my role as parent I see the choices my stepson and his wife have had to make. They have one child younger than 6 and know that their economic condition, and the expense and complications of child care, do not allow them to have more children now. They both work at full-time jobs so they can have a dependable income, decent housing, food, medical benefits and affordable child care.
What's alarming to me is that a respected university is producing social workers with Ms. Baity's hypothesis, which is that their clients are "victims" of society.
It's very simple why President Clinton needs to reform welfare -- our country can no longer afford to support single mothers who do not practice birth control.
Ms. Baity's concerns sound like a voice from the 1960's. With our country's economic climate what it is, it's frightening that our future social workers are stuck in a decades-old ideology. Our economy has changed, and social work education needs to be reformed. Otherwise, many needy clients are going to be left out in the cold because of inadequate human services.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in/Newtown;
Big Town With a Small-Town Ambiance

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
FROM its incorporation in 1711 until the 1930's, Newtown's population, mostly farmers and artisans, never went past 3,000. Cotton mill and Goodyear rubber factory workers swelled the ranks in the 19th century and a trickle of commuters and affluent professionals followed in the 1900's.
During the postwar exodus to the suburbs Newtown remained a quiet outpost on the northeastern border of Fairfield County, too remote for the hordes of city folk who settled into southern Fairfield's bountiful array of new subdivisions. But that was before the cost of living in lower Fairfield County zoomed and traveling a bit farther to work became less onerous if the right house could be found at the right price. 
 In Newtown it could, and in the last 20 years this archetypically New England community in Connecticut has been discovered, its population increasing not only in numbers but also in diversity.
Heavily oriented toward families, it has no condominiums, few rentals, residential zoning of 1 to 5 acres and a handful of restaurants. But there are some 60 arts, service and social organizations, including the Town Players, Friends of Music, Ballet Miniatures, Historical Society, garden clubs and animal welfare and conservation groups.
Newtown is geographically the largest community in the county, with three exits on Interstate 84. There is shopping at four local centers, along Route 25 and at the nearby Danbury Fair Mall.
Still, Main Street is little changed from the 18th century, its fine old churches, Meeting House and homesteads carefully preserved and in constant use. The flagpole, on the site of the first Meeting House, sits in the middle of the road, protected by state statute after it was declared a traffic hazard by the Connecticut Transportation Department. The town fought its removal and had it declared a National Landmark.
Up the street, the wooden floors of the 200-year-old General Store creak underfoot, and squeezed between counters is an upright piano, played by Donna Spanner, the proprietress, and many customers. On summer nights people stop by after the movies for sodas and homemade ice cream, and year round they come in from 5 A.M. to 11 P.M. for breakfast, lunch and snacks. Self-serve coffee patrons leave their money near the coffemaker.
"They always pay," said Ms. Spanner.
The movies, a block away at the Edmond Town Hall, cost $2 for adults, $1 at matinees and $1 for children. There is free parking in the rear.
In 1992 the recession gave Kim Danziger, a developer, an opportunity to buy 65 bargain-priced acres at Old Farm Hill Road from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He began selling lots and building four-bedroom homes on 2-plus acres for $319,000 to $359,000. Within a year he sold 22 houses of 8 to 10 rooms in 6 styles in a development called Lantern Ridge. Included in the base price are landscaping, most appliances, decks, a two- or three-car garage, cedar clapboard siding and screened thermopane windows. Six lots are left.
Some 300 houses of the 7,194 in town are for sale, and Irene Schwartz of Flagpole Realty said "indications are that the median price has tilted upward to around $209,000, but homes can still be found in the $128,000 to $138,000 range on 2- and 3-acre lots."
Elizabeth Myers of William Raveis Real Estate said that homes were selling "in 100 days instead of 6 months to a year" but that those priced above $500,000 still lingered.
"We're in a building boom here," said Jean St. Jean, Newtown's Building Department Administrator. Permits for 30 new houses priced from $250,000 to almost $1 million were issued in November. In the first week of December, 14 were issued, bringing the 1993 total to around 200.
That's about as many new houses as there were new elementary school pupils enrolled in 1993. In 1992 there were 100 new children and 164 new homes. Applications for 17 more subdivisions with a total of 84 lots covering an aggregate of 596 acres have been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
To accommodate the new students, two of the four elementary schools were expanded in 1992 and an addition to the high school is planned.
S.A.T. scores are higher by about 30 points than state averages, which are in turn higher than national averages, and 80 percent of the 3,711 public school children went on to higher education last June.
GIFTED students and those with special needs are placed in appropriately tailored programs, and advanced college credits may be earned in high school. An enrichment program in the middle school and high school brings together people in the arts and professions with small groups of students to explore mutual interests.
"We have assembled a professional staff that understands there is always a significant potential for improvement," said Dr. John Reed, Superintendent of Schools for 12 years. "We don't wait for lightning to strike with some new program or technique. It's a day-by-day effort, with no laurels to rest on. Education is a very complex undertaking, which may be why I prefer a system like this, of manageable size."
A private Montessori School enrolls 100 pupils from 3 years of age through Grade 6. Its preschool division operates five days a week, three hours a day. Tuition is $3,000 to $5,000. St. Rose parochial school has 193 students from kindergarten through 8th grade and charges $1,680 to $4,000.
THE town has more than 4,000 acres of parkland, including the two sections of the 1,874-acre Paugusset State Forest. In summer, Lake Lillinonah and Lake Zoar -- actually bellied-out stretches of the Housatonic River -- churn with boaters, swimmers and water-skiiers. A seasonal boat launch permit at Lake Lillinonah costs $25.
Residents get free permits for several parks and preserves, including Dickinson Park, where there is an ice-skating pond, annual fishing derbies and Halloween extravaganzas, and Treadwell Park, which has an 8-lane pool. Swimming permits there or at the high school's indoor pool cost $50.
Charges for a variety of other town-run programs range from $14 for four tennis lessons for a child to $149 for eight horseback-riding lessons.
"Our horse editor says there are close to 2,500 horses in town," said R. Scudder Smith, the third generation of Smiths to edit The Newtown Bee, a paper founded in 1877. He also edits the Bee's companion, Antiques and the Arts Weekly, and a new publication, "Horses of Connecticut."
The only regulation governing the keeping of horses is that they must be housed at least 100 feet from the owner's property line. Some 28 miles of trails are maintained by the private Bridle Lanes Association, open to bird-watchers, cross-country skiiers and hikers as well as equestrians. Membership costs $35 for a family.
The town also has a Fish and Game Club, the Newtown Country Club and Rock Ridge Country Club, all private.
At the center of town is the original community of Newtown, a square mile of land that was incorporated as a borough in 1824 so that it could preserve its identity as outlying areas grew. While it is part of Newtown, the borough has its own government, and its 800 taxpayers pay an additional $1.35 for each $1,000 of assessment to maintain their street lights, public landscaping and fire hydrants.
Through 20 years and four votes a contingent of Boroughites has sought to establish a portion of Main Street from Currituck Road to Glover Avenue as a Historic District, to preserve its pristine early-American elegance.
"We lost by one vote last time, but we will try again," said Joan Crick, Warden of The Borough and one of its nearly two dozen officials.
SOON the borough will have Newtown's first sewers, mandated by the state because of septic tank overflows. The $34 million sewer system and treatment plant, financed by state and local bonds, will extend into parts of the Sandy Hook section, and construction is expected to begin this year, said Elizabeth Stocker, Newtown's Community Development Director.
In Sandy Hook, Lou Bastos, owner of the 1857 Red Brick General Store, takes pride in the distinctive little business center and surrounding homes.
"We have descendants of 18th- and 19th-century mill workers still living in the original houses," he said.
The Pootatuck River runs through Sandy Hook and on its banks is a handsome office building converted from an old firehose factory. More offices and light industry are being sought to keep residential taxes down. Newtown's Business Park has about 20 companies, with six lots, totaling 13 acres, still available. There also are 400 acres of open land zoned for commerce.
Office and light industrial development is being considered now for part of the 900 acres at the state's Fairfield Hills Correctional Center by a task force headed by Julia R. Wasserman, Newtown's State Representative. More than 60 buildings, erected in the 1930's as a mental hospital, have been gradually emptied over several years. Some are now occupied by the Second Company Governor's Horse Guard, part of the state militia. And a new 400-bed state jail was built on the grounds in 1992, to the dismay of the town.
The Bridle Lanes Association wants to use 300 of the 900 acres for a major $35 million horse show facility that could be used for antiques shows and other events, drawing from the entire Northeast. "Now the shows have to go to other states," said Kim Connolly, association vice president.
"We will report on both plans to the legislature in April," said Representative Wasserman.

HEADLINE: Lawyers, Class Actions and Fees

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Kurt Eichenwald's article is a work of demonizing. The demon is attorney Herbert Beigel of Chicago. Herb, a former Justice Department prosecutor with the organized-crime task force, founded the firm Beigel & Sandler (which now bears the sesquipedalian moniker of Beigel Schy Lasky Rifkind & Hennessey). Herb Beigel is also, I should disclose, my law partner and friend. 
 If the whole truth could be told, the real harm done by Mr. Eichenwald's piece would be clear: the misdiagnosis of the problem. Investors in limited partnerships have been victimized, first by the sellers of securities and then by legislators and judges who have shaped and applied the law in ways that enable the wrongdoers to escape the consequences of their misconduct. As a result, investors have sometimes had to settle for less than they deserve.
Settlement of lawsuits is an area ripe for analysis, as under 10 percent of filed class actions go to trial. Mr. Eichenwald's article is misleading, however, in its generalization that lawyers representing investors in class actions "don't need their approval of a settlement." Indeed, the settlement of a class action (and the awarding of class counsel's fees) must be approved by the court after notice to all the investors and an open hearing. Investors dissatisfied with the proposed settlement can also opt out of the case by sticking a 29-cent stamp on an envelope, enclosing an informal one-sentence note, and dropping it in the mail. Neither settlements nor fee awards are ramrodded through and rubber-stamped by the courts.
Apparently without conscious irony, Mr. Eichenwald contends both that our firm recommends "low" settlements in some cases and aggressively prosecutes "frivolous" claims in others. But in the VMS Realty case, his prime example of a "low" settlement, all defendants moved to dismiss the case. Some (including Prudential Securities) settled before the motions were decided, paying $25 million in cash. But others (including Cigna Securities) refused to settle and the court granted their motions to dismiss. It is absurd for Mr. Eichenwald to criticize our firm for extracting a substantial sum to settle claims the judge would otherwise have thrown out.
There is no basis for Mr. Eichenwald's criticism of our firm's settlements in non-class actions. In such cases settlement recommendations are subject to the client's affirmative approval (as opposed to the "opt-out" or negative enrollment procedure of class actions). The key point is that the combination of a contingent fee with a modest upfront retainer, with no additional payments of either fees or expenses except out of a recovery, has enabled investors to pursue claims that they might not otherwise have been able economically to bring. Jane Bryant Quinn praised this very fee structure in Newsweek several years ago.
As for "frivolous" claims, it is simply a fact that when a law firm agrees to bring some of the most novel, risky and difficult cases on behalf of aggrieved investors, some claims will be rejected. In the Kushner v. D.B.G. case, the judge imposed a sanction of $25,000 on Beigel & Sandler. Yet these allegedly "frivolous" claims were settled by the defendants for a substantial sum. Would our clients have been better served by getting nothing?
In short, Mr. Eichenwald is wrong to blame the victim's lawyers for the problems caused by others. There is nothing we or other class-action/contingent-fee firms desire more than better recoveries for our clients.

Awards for Courage

BYLINE: By STANLEY CROUCH; Stanley Crouch, author of "Notes of a Hanging Judge," a collection of essays, and a forthcoming biography of Charlie Parker.

 BODY:
New Yorkers argue about everything. But as the campaign for City Hall showed, they don't disagree that the quality of life here has declined. With Rudolph W. Giuliani installed as Mayor, how can the social climate be improved? The Op-Ed page invited recommendations and proposals.
 What this city needs most is freedom from the idea that democracy is nothing more than special-interest groups moving toward positions of power. Morale is the real medicine -- the spiritual fuel that will enable us to take on challenges together. 
 So besides moving against crime, poverty, inadequate public education, unemployment and bureaucratic hanky-panky, Mayor Giuliani would do well to create a symbol that speaks to the perpetual expression of human empathy. He should establish a monthly award for citizens and public servants who reach across race and all other lines to express their courage and commitment to urban civilization. They do these sorts of things daily, in every borough. The Mayor should constantly remind us of that; and he should remind the hysterical press, which hucksters so much alienation.
Appropriate fanfare recognizing this sort of heroism could give New York a badly needed second wind of morale.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: G. Michael Brown;
Planning Ahead at the Foxwoods Casino

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
INDIAN gaming enterprises started 14 years ago with a bingo hall on a Florida reservation and have expanded to 68 casinos and 170 high-stakes bingo games in 24 states today, with more in the planning stages. About half of the nation's 318 federally recognized tribes are attempting to open gaming halls. The most successful Indian casino in the nation is Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo & Casino on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian reservation off Route 2 in Ledyard, with an estimated net operating profit of more than $20 million a month. G. Michael Brown, 51, is the chief executive officer of Foxwoods.
Mr. Brown, a graduate of Seton Hall Law School, was an assistant prosecutor in Essex County, N.J., worked in the New Jersey Attorney General's office and in 1979, when New Jersey legalized casinos, he was appointed the director of gaming enforcement. He started an Atlantic City law firm in 1982, Brown and Michael, which specializes in gambling regulation. 
 He was introduced to the Mashantuckets in 1990 when the tribe was considering entering the casino business. He advised the Mashantuckets on how to set up the casino and helped to obtain financing. When the casino opened in February 1992 he helped the tribe set up its own gaming commission, and served as its first chairman. He became chief executive of Foxwoods in January.
Although he presides over a luxurious casino with flourishes such as an indoor waterfall, his own office is in a construction trailer. In a recent interview, Mr. Brown talked about Foxwoods and the future of gambling in Connecticut. Here are some excerpts from that conversation:
Q. Foxwoods has captured the world's attention because of its incredibly fast growth. How long can it be sustained?
A. I think it will level off when we complete Phase 5 and Phase 6. Phase 5 is a new bingo hall that will be completed in May of 1994. It will seat 3,000 for bingo and 5,000 for events such as boxing, and we'll take the old bingo hall and put another 1,500 slot machines in there, which will put us close to 5,000 slot machines. Phase 6 will be a garage with 1,500 parking spaces. Beyond that, the Foxwoods development will probably level off for a while. With the opening of the new hotel this month we'll have 610 hotel rooms, and we'll be able to accommodate most of the people who want to stay with us. We'll have 139,000 square feet of gaming space, 233 table games, keno, bingo, 3,150 slot machines -- I think we have enough to keep the market active. The new parking garage will be designed to withstand construction of an eight-story hotel on top of it. That is not going to commence at this time, but it's there if and when the market demands it.
Q. How does Foxwoods manage a 50-percent profit margin, compared to 30 percent at most other casinos?
A. Atlantic City casinos, which I'm most familiar with, compete for customers. They spend exorbitant amounts of money on complimentary services and promotions and advertising, because there's 12 of them, and they're all looking for the same body coming off the bus. There's only one of us, so we can advertise the resort in a subdued way, and we are not involved in major giveaways. Secondly, we don't cater to real high-level play. The largest bet you can place here is $2,500 on a table game. Also, our cost of operation is less because we pay close attention to overhead.
Q. What is happening to all the money that the tribe is earning from the casino?
A. Most of it is being spent on the expansion now. But they also just broke ground for a Native American museum, the largest Native American museum ever built. The tribe has an educational fund so that any tribal member can go to any college in the world and they'll pay the costs, and pay them a salary while they go. They have a health care center that treats not only tribal members but any Native American. They're developing housing for tribal members and senior citizens. They have a community center that's going to open in a month or two.
Q. You are seeing larger crowds almost every month. Is your limiting factor going to be the market, or the capacity of the roads?
A. I don't think it's the roads. I think right now it's the lack of parking. We're having offsite parking for employees and turning employee lots into patron lots. I think we're just starting to scratch the market. We're up to about 40,000 people on the weekends, and our average day is probably 18,000 or 20,000 people. But we were strictly a day trip until July 2 when we opened the Two Trees Inn. Now we're getting into heavy marketing efforts in Boston, Toronto, New York City, northern New Jersey, and we'll start to draw people in from there now that they know they can come and stay overnight.
Q. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. blocked expanded casino gambling in Connecticut this year. Since he has decided not to seek a second term, do you expect a major push this year to legalize gambling?
A. I'm really not very politically astute. I'm sure there's going to be a push to legalize, and we will try to convince people that one casino is enough for the state, but it's a state political decision. If someone else comes into the market, if they change the law, hopefully we're going to be the better Connecticut casino.
Q. Gambling is described as the fastest growing industry in the United States. Why now?
A. Until 1978 gambling was illegal everyplace in the United States except Nevada. New Jersey legalized casinos, and we spent a lot of time trying to create not only a clean operation, but the appearance of integrity in casino investigation, regulation and operation. When people saw you could do it and you could regulate it and you could use it to draw visitors to your state, everyone started to jump on the bandwagon.
Q. There continue to be occasional problems with corruption, though. What do you do at Foxwoods to prevent that?
A. I have on our surveillance department staff some former F.B.I. guys and some former state police organized crime guys, whose job it is to make sure we don't do business with the wrong type of people. They do a review of every person we're going to do business with. If a guy comes in and wants to sell us tapes, he fills out a vendor application form. My in-house people do a background check. Every person we do business with has to get an vendor license from the state, so there's an independent background check done by the state. Every employee, including me, has to have a background check done by the Connecticut State Police before they can work here. We stay in touch with the local F.B.I. and the Secret Service out of Boston. We stay in touch with the other casino surveillance and security departments.
Q. Then why do you face so much opposition from residents of Ledyard, North Stonington and Preston?
A. Some people don't want to see change. Quite frankly, if I bought a farm on Route 2 10 years ago, and now I saw one of the major entertainment resorts in the world being built down the road, I probably wouldn't like it. There's a traffic increase, too, which is an inconvenience. But I think you also have to consider we're not going anywhere, and we're going to do what we can to ease the inconvenience and the pain for the surrounding community. We paid for all the traffic lights and road improvements that are being done in the area, all of it done voluntarily on the tribe's part to ease the impact of this major development.
Q. What do you do about compulsive gamblers?
A. We've sponsored one conference on the subject, and we give $100,000 a year to a compulsive gambling association to do program development and assistance. Our supervisors take courses in how to recognize compulsive gamblers, and if they spot one they're supposed to move them off the floor. Usually a floor person will go over, ask them to go have a cup of coffee in the grill, then talk to them and try to get them to go home. It probably happens once a day, or 10 times a week, when there's an incident where people appear to be over their head.
Q. What about the criticism that Indians have an unfair advantage over casinos on non-Indian land?
A. No casino in the United States guarantees the state in which it's located $113 million a year, which we do to Connecticut. Secondly, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed with the support of the Nevada Resort Association, to contain and set up some regulatory system over gaming on Indian land, and we're complying with that law. If you look at the impact that Indian tribes have had on the local economies, that we've had here and that the 13 tribes that run casinos in Minnesota have had on the Minnesota economy, there's an enormous contribution to the local economies.
Q. How long will the construction continue?
A. At least until next summer. We'll always be building new parking lots, and we have our own waste-water treatment plant that is being expanded continually, so we'll have construction going on through at least the year 2000. But I think the major, heavy construction -- once we get the Phase 5 bingo hall and the Phase 6 garage open -- will subside substantially.

HEADLINE: Hopes for '94: Faster Rebound Than in '93

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
REPORTS of renewed vigor in some sectors of Westchester's economy notwithstanding, bottom-line figures showed that the county during 1993 lagged behind other sections of the New York City area in rebounding from the recession.
The slowness in Westchester was due mainly to "the continuing saga of large corporations laying off workers in efforts to downsize," said Noreen L. Preston, an economist with the County Department of Commerce and Economic Development. The corporate restructurings -- by I.B.M., Nynex and Reader's Digest, among others -- counteracted job gains realized by other small and medium-size companies, she said.
Weaker Labor Force Participation 
 Although monthly figures for Westchester's jobless rate were lower this year than last -- 5.1 percent for October 1993 compared with 6.2 percent a year earlier, for example -- the figures did not reflect a job market that was growing stronger.
Rather, the jobless rates -- evaluated in context with other statistics -- indicated that fewer workers were looking for jobs, said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist for the State Department of Labor.
"The lower unemployment figures were not an indication of economic health," Mr. Surdey said. "What we saw was weaker labor force participation, more discouraged workers and on the whole 1993 was the softest year job-wise since 1982."
Mr. Surdey cited a 6 percent loss of manufacturing jobs in Westchester this year -- 45,600 in October compared to 48,300 for the same month a year ago. The wholesale and retail sector also saw job losses -- from 82,000 in October 1992 to 80,000 in October this year.
Construction Jobs Picking Up
And despite a late-year pickup in construction, overall 1993 was not a healthy one for the industry, Mr. Surdey said. Figures showed there were 15,800 construction jobs during October 1993, compared with 16,200 during the same month a year ago.
Nevertheless, some healthy indicators for the future are being seen for construction workers, said Ross J. Pepe, president of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley, a professional and trade group representing 500 businesses. Mr. Pepe called 1993 "something of a turnaround year for the industry."
He said that construction workers in the building sector, who were "devastated with a 40 to 50 percent unemployment rate in 1992," experienced relief late this year, mainly due to new shopping mall construction in White Plains, where the Westchester, an 830,000-square-foot mall, is under construction.
And although the unemployment rate for construction workers is still between 25 and 30 percent, Mr. Pepe said that "the outlook is that things will be getting better."
He said a new Federal courthouse in White Plains, a parking garage and new terminal at the Westchester County Airport and a $102 million, 489,000-square-foot processing and distribution center for the United States Postal Service in Harrison will generate yet more jobs for the construction industry this year.
But competition for construction jobs continues to be keen, and contractors from outside the area are bidding hard for the relatively few jobs that are available here. In response, local union leaders are softening demands in their efforts to win jobs for their rank and file, often granting no-strike clauses and other concessions.
 
High Commercial Vacancy Rates
 "Even though there are real signs for the short term, I can't make any projections for the long term," Mr. Pepe said. "A lot of that will depend on the Clinton Administration and whether Congress will find ways to stimulate the economy with infrastructure improvements."
Like other sectors of the economy, the commercial real estate market was also dogged by the slow local economy. Vacancy rates for commercial buildings soared to 26 percent, from 22 percent a year ago, and new building was nonexistent. Employment cutbacks by large corporations played a major role in the high vacancy rates, as some companies sought smaller quarters for their leaner work forces.
But John H. Rostenberg, a principal with the Rostenberg-Doern Company, a corporate real estate broker, said there were signs of life stirring in what until recently appeared to be a moribund sector of the economy.
"We are still putting more space on the market than we are renting," said Mr. Rostenberg, whose company has offices in Purchase and Stamford. "Yet we are hopeful things will be getting better soon. We don't have a crystal ball, but we believe that maybe the worst is finally over."
 
Portfolio Refinanced
 One indicator of a pickup is that owners of corporate properties have recently begun to upgrade industrial parks and the lobbies of major buildings, Mr. Rostenberg said.
"A year ago, these properties needed work," he said. "Now we are seeing the owners repositioning themselves for 1994. It's a sign of optimism."
Mr. Rostenberg also said that the Robert Martin Company, the largest owner of corporate properties in Westchester, was recently able to refinance its portfolio. "It's a bellwether," he said. "The lenders haven't given up on us."
But Kenneth H. Thorn, executive vice president of First Fidelity Bancorp, one of the largest banking operations in Westchester, said that although banks were once again more aggressive about lending, they remained cautious when it came to the commercial real estate market because of corporate restructurings.
Mr. Thorn said that early in the recession, banks "turned inward" to resolve problem loans, but last year they took a more optimistic attitude toward lending, reflecting a general feeling that the economy was rebounding.
Whereas banks were still "pretty cautious and saw real weaknesses in some sectors," they are now "actively courting" loans for multifamily housing, retail space and warehouses, Mr. Thorn said.
 
No Bank Failures in '93
 In 1992, Federal regulators seized three county-based banks; last year, no local lending institution failed, indicating a stronger economic climate. But First Fidelity, which is based in Lawrenceville, N.J., recently acquired the Hawthorne-based Peoples Westchester Savings Bank and Village Bank in Port Chester, and Mr. Thorn said the acquisitions "reflected national trends toward consolidation in banking."
Also, Mr. Thorn said that because of low interest rates, banks had become more interested in the sale of mutual funds and annuities.
The low interest rates, while not generating much activity in traditional passbook savings, did have a salutary effect on the real estate market. Looking back over economic trends in 1993, P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, reported that the real estate market fared very well.
"It was better than a good year for us," said Mr. Mercurio, who predicted that the final tally of single-family home sales for 1993 -- about 6,000 by year's end -- would be the highest since 1988. He added that although single-family home sales dominated the market, sales of condominiums also rebounded.
 
Decreased Inventories
 The uptick in the real estate market was fueled by interest rates that hovered around 7.125 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, Mr. Mercurio said. Interest rates for adjustable-rate mortgages were even lower.
The median price of a single-family home in Westchester during 1993 was between $275,000 and $300,000, compared with the "go-go years of the mid and late 80's when it was $325,000," he said, adding that the most difficult homes to sell were in the $700,000 to $900,000 range.
Another indicator of strength in the real estate market was that inventories decreased for the first time in four years although the average time that a home stayed on the market from its listing to closing remained at 200 days. In the 1980, that figure was about 150 days.
In another sign of better economic times to come, Westchester last year saw new discount chain stores moving to the county. Among the new discounters catering to budget-conscious shoppers were Pace Membership Warehouse in Elmsford, Bradlees Inc. in Yonkers, T. J. Maxx in Yorktown and Tops Appliance City in Hawthorne.
Also, 34 small- and medium-size companies set up shop in Westchester during 1993 -- among them telecommunications, advertising, marketing, consulting, accounting and service companies, said Ms. Preston of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development.
Despite the gains in some sectors, Ms. Preston described the county's economy as "still bouncing around the bottom."
She said, "We're not sinking any deeper, but we're not making tremendous headway either."

TENSION BETWEEN OPPOSITES
Reflections on the Practice
and Theory of Politics.
By Paul H. Nitze.
Illustrated. 212 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons.
$22. 
 YOU want Paul Nitze on your side. Inside the Government -- and he has worked for Presidents from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan -- he strives to implement the policies of the Administration he is serving, whether Democratic or Republican. Outside, he becomes a deadly critic, a no-holds-barred tough guy who can bring down the foreign policy of the party in power. That is what he did when he helped organize the hawkish Committee on the Present Danger during the Carter years. He warned one and all -- convincingly -- that the United States was entering "a dangerous period of strategic disadvantage vis-a-vis the Soviet Union." Although Mr. Nitze overstated the case, he persuaded enough people of its merits to cast doubts on Jimmy Carter's toughness. He was rewarded by being appointed chief negotiator in arms control talks with the Soviet Union, an important role in the Reagan Administration. Once back in office, he worked with characteristic vigor to help negotiate an agreement banning medium-range missiles.
Now in his 80's, Mr. Nitze, along with Clark Clifford and George F. Kennan, is one of the surviving members of the so-called Old Establishment of Washington insiders. Like so many of the other "Wise Men" who designed American foreign policy in the postwar period, Mr. Nitze came to Washington already a member of an establishment: educated at Hotchkiss and Harvard and married into wealth, he was a banker at the investment house of Dillon, Read & Company. He arrived in the capital in 1940 at the behest of his former boss at the firm, James V. Forrestal, later to become the first Secretary of Defense, to work with him for the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. George C. Marshall, on the draft of the Selective Service Act. "Be in Washington Monday morning. Forrestal," read Mr. Forrestal's telegram to Mr. Nitze. He obeyed, and is there still.
Mr. Nitze's positions in Government are too numerous to list, among the most notable being George F. Kennan's heir as head of the policy planning staff in 1950, when he drafted national security memorandum NSC-68. The call of NSC-68 for a military buildup "to check and roll back the Kremlin's drive for world domination" shaped the cold war world.
Mr. Nitze spent much of the rest of his public life urging this policy upon subsequent administrations, while showing himself willing to negotiate arms control agreements with the men in Moscow. Why, then, did he never attain the higher offices he so craved? In "Tension Between Opposites," an arresting meditation on power, he writes: "In government, I found it hard to be wholly loyal to the principles of either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. I, therefore, never achieved appointment to the highest political offices." But it was perhaps not so much his principles as his methods that prevented his achieving his goal. Clark Clifford, who headed the Pentagon in the late 60's when Mr. Nitze was Deputy Secretary, recalls that Mr. Nitze was denied the positions of Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State because his "ambition and impatient intellect often manifested themselves in irritable peevishness and flashes of unveiled contempt for people whom he felt did not deserve the high government positions they held."
Mr. Nitze may have permanently read himself out of such a job when he attacked Paul Warnke, his old colleague in the Defense Department in the Johnson years, at Senate confirmation hearings for Mr. Warnke's position as arms control negotiator in the Carter Administration. After characterizing Mr. Warnke's views of foreign policy as "asinine" and "screwball," he replied to a senator who asked him if he thought he was "a better American" than Mr. Warnke by saying, "I really do."
In his new book, Mr. Nitze pays homage by writing flattering and often revealing profiles of many of the men he worked with, almost all quintessential men of action: James V. Forrestal; Will Clayton, a key economic policy maker in the Truman Administration; General Marshall; and Secretaries of State Dean Acheson and George P. Shultz. All, he suggests, derived their energy and accomplishments from "striving for a harmony" in the tension between what needs to be done (theory) and how to do it (practice). He perfectly expresses who he is when he lays out the principles he says one should follow "to become a participant and molder of history -- not merely an object of history." "Strive for both the general and the concrete," he suggests, and have "pride in oneself, in one's background and in one's country."
For all his admiration for men of action, Mr. Nitze reserves his warmest words for George Kennan, with whom he disagreed mightily and publicly over the need to contain the Soviet Union with military power. When he was asked how he could remain Mr. Kennan's devoted friend, he replied that they never had any differences "except on matters of substance."
Like Mr. Kennan, Mr. Nitze would like to see "the creation of a council of state whose task would be confined to telling the country what ought to be done in the long-term interest of the United States. It would then be up to the politicians to see what would be politically possible." But what if the members of the council disagree? We are given no answer.

HEADLINE: Outlook '94;
A Policy Compass Points East and South

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
REMEMBER the G7, the group of major industrialized nations that gathers every year in circumstances of considerable pomp to dream up new inspiration for the world economy? It's now clear that the institution, and the view of the world that went with it, are fast going out of fashion.
The reasons are simple. The bulk of the G7 -- that is Western Europe and Japan -- is in an economic trough deep enough to preclude rapid recovery in 1994 or even 1995. Areas of growth and real economic opportunity increasingly lie in Latin America and Asia outside Japan. 
 The United States, the one major Western nation showing fairly robust growth, has already drawn its conclusions. The Clinton Administration shifted America's traditional foreign policy focus in 1993, southward to Mexico through the North American Free Trade Agreement and eastward to the Pacific through a summit meeting of the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
These trends will continue in 1994. They will offer businesses and investors who are not risk-averse, opportunities in Asia, particularly China, and in Latin America; and they will provide cynics with more evidence of the growing supremacy of trade interests in global diplomacy.
One in every six Boeings built is now bought by China: President Clinton will, therefore, probably find a way to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status in June, despite qualms about human rights. Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti do not buy many jets or semiconductors: They will be quietly forgotten if possible.
The policy is known as economic security -- that is harnessing America's diplomacy to the creation of jobs and turning a blind eye to certain wars. It's a significant shift, and the implications are just beginning to unfold.
One is already clear: No major economic or political initiatives are to be expected in Eastern Europe, where fudging will remain the order of the day, as wary eyes are fixed on Russia. That is bad news for Western Europe, still struggling to emerge from recession and desperately needing a spur from its under-developed eastern hinterland.
Growth of no more than 1 percent in Western Europe is to be expected in 1994, and that thanks only to Britain, where growth will reach 2.5 percent. Soaring unemployment and the growing cost of the welfare state seem likely to penalize the rest of Europe. "These are going to be the nasty nineties for Europe," said Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez. "From a European point of view, the United States looks like an economic paradise."
If Europe needs solace for its doldrums, it should look to Japan. The nation that had seemed unstoppable in the late 1980's now looks as vulnerable and unpredictable as its Nikkei stock market index. The price of wild over-confidence in stock market and property speculation is being paid.
Deep adjustments seem necessary. They include some modification of Japanese companies' traditional commitment to lifetime employment and tax cuts to spur consumer spending and perhaps demand for American goods. But these changes will take time. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts growth of 0.5 percent for Japan in 1994. The yen may have to depreciate to spur a recovery, but that will be resisted in Washington, where the view is that Japan should import more and use a strong yen to do so.
Alan Stoga, the managing director of Kissinger Associates said, "The big risk in the world economy in 1994 is Japan. The machine is no longer working, and its markets look increasingly fragile. A significant collapse cannot be ruled out."
The Asian mantle has been taken up by China, with 1.2 billion potential customers, a double-digit growth rate and a seemingly irrevocable embrace of a market economy that has business people from Detroit to Dusseldorf excited, despite the severe illness of Deng Xiaoping.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany went to Beijing in November and came back with contracts worth $4 billion. In the airline industry alone, China needs 40 aircraft a year for the next two decades: That is manna from heaven for Boeing, Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas.
David D. Glass, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores, foresees the day when Chinese people will feel as at home in Wal-Mart stores as Americans. To realize such ambitions foreign corporations will have to overcome the distrust of outsiders that is deep-rooted in a 4,000-year-old society and still fed by the rhetoric of a closed political system.
Outside China, growth and investment prospects still look strong in the rest of Asia, although after an 80 percent gain in these equity markets in 1993 in dollar terms, some correction may be due.
Similar forces will continue to push money into Latin America, where the economies of Chile, Argentina, Peru and Mexico are beginning to reap the benefits of market reform. Capital flowed out of Latin America in the 1980's, but is now returning. The North American Free Trade Agreement has tied not just Mexico, but by optimistic implication the whole area, to the United States.
"Even after gains of 45 percent in 1993 in dollar terms, the outlook is very attractive, and stocks in Latin America remain cheaper than in Asian markets," said Jay Pelosky, director of Latin American strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. There are risks, and elections in Brazil and Mexico in 1994, but Chile's elections suggest that market reform can, in the end, be popular.
If, however, Latin American and other emerging markets look too volatile, the United States' economy -- with a predicted 1994 growth rate of over 3 percent -- is worth pondering. Although Wall Street has had a long bull market, growth with low inflation is likely to mean continued low interest rates -- and that's good for shares. "The U.S. is the bright spot in the world economy," said Mr. Potts of Banque Indosuez.
So, President Clinton should be able to hold his head high when he arrives at the G7 summit in Naples in July. If he's ready to take account of economic reality, he might suggest an expansion to a G11 -- adding, say, Mexico, Brazil, China and, to keep President Boris Yeltsin happy, Russia.
What used to be called North-South trade, and might now be better termed inter-developmental symbiosis, has become the crucial issue for growth. The symbiosis is between the cheap labor and fast-growing markets of the "South" and the technology and new job-creating exports of the "North." Such an expansion of the G7 would take account of America's new doctrine of economic security, which entails directing foreign policy less to such traditional partners as NATO and more to the developing nations growing fast enough to create jobs and wealth in America.

HEADLINE: With More Flops Than Hits, No Wonder Hollywood Is Jittery

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
Forget comedy sequels. Worry about westerns. Focus on hiring A-list movie stars, but only if they play predictable roles: Robin Williams as a nanny, Julia Roberts as a woman on the run, Tom Cruise as a vacuous yuppie lawyer in danger.
With movie studios planning to release at least 150 films in 1994, the economic lessons of 1993 have made Hollywood jittery. The average cost of a film is about $25 million, there were more duds than hits, and some of the biggest studios endured financial flops in a generally bleak year. 
 The good news for Hollywood in 1994 is that on Wall Street, studios are generally deemed valuable properties. The bitter fight over Paramount Communications underlined the value of movie studios. With the advent of more cable television channels, the need for "product" from the studios and independent producers is expected to accelerate.
The bad news for Hollywood is that the films remain, by and large, financially costly and esthetically impoverished.
Even Universal Pictures, which is Japanese-owned and should be swimming in money, faced some disappointments. Universal produced Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park," the No. 1 movie of the year and the highest-grossing film in history. It has grossed $350 million in the United States.
Despite that success, Universal is expected to wind up third in market share after Warner Brothers and Buena Vista, the distributing arm of the Walt Disney studios. Details of the market share are incomplete for the entire year, but according to Daily Variety, an industry publication, the market share of Warner Brothers as of mid-December was 18.1 percent, compared with Buena Vista's 16.1 percent and Universal's 13.8 percent. Behind Universal was Columbia Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Paramount and Tristar.
The reason for Universal's third-place finish is a spate of generally dismal films like "Hard Target," "Heart and Souls," "The Real McCoy," and "Judgement Night." (The studio's newest releases, "Schindler's List," and "In the Name of the Father," are critical successes, but they have opened at relatively few theaters and it is too soon to gauge their national box office appeal.)
For 1994, Hollywood executives have come to a none-too-startling conclusion. "It'll be more of the same," said Joe Roth, the former chairman of 20th Century Fox. "There were seven movies in 1993 that did $100 million. Each of them could have been picked by a kid in the fourth grade. There were big stars doing exactly what the audience wanted them to do."
To be specific, there were Steven Spielberg playing with dinosaurs, Harrison Ford in "The Fugitive," Tom Cruise as a lawyer in "The Firm," Clint Eastwood as an aging Secret Service agent in "In the Line of Fire," Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in the romantic "Sleepless in Seattle," and, according to Mr. Roth and others, Robin Williams in "Mrs. Doubtfire," and Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington in "The Pelican Brief."
The predictions of big hits for 1994 are, well, perfectly predictable. These include two Warner Brothers films, "Maverick," starring Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster, opening in May, and "Wyatt Earp," an epic starring Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman and Dennis Quaid, opening in July.
Yet Warner Brothers and other studios are nervous about the westerns. These films were given the green light after the success in recent years of "Dances with Wolves," and "Unforgiven." This year, however, "Geronimo," produced by Columbia, fared poorly. And Warner Brothers' "A Perfect World" proved disappointing.
Comedy sequels in 1993, such as "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit," and "Addams Family Values," also did less business than expected. But several sequels have been completed, including Paramount's "Beverly Hills Cop 3," starring Eddie Murphy, Billy Crystal's "City Slickers 2," a Castle Rock-Columbia project opening on Memorial Day. Those two films and Universal's "Flintstones" are due to open around Memorial Day. Other high-profile films that Hollywood executives see as potentially hitting the $100 million mark are Walt Disney's animated "Lion King," opening in June, and a comedy with Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte, "I Love Trouble." Warner Brothers is also releasing "Interview With the Vampire," starring Tom Cruise, at Thanksgiving.
Paramount is making an adaptation of the Tom Clancy novel "Clear and Present Danger," starring Harrison Ford.
Columbia has its early hopes set on two expensive and risky films. The first is James L. Brooks's "I'll Do Anything," and "Wolf," a romantic thriller directed by Mike Nichols and starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer, which opens in the spring.
And 20th Century Fox is depending on, among others, an action film, "True Lies," starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, who returns to standard action fare, and directed by James Cameron.
For all the predictions, the most common piece of wisdom in Hollywood is the one expressed several years ago by the screenwriter and novelist William Goldman. It is repeated like a mantra this time of year: "No one knows anything."

HEADLINE: Patents

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Patent and Trademark Office will be the focus of a fundamental debate this year, as the Clinton Administration examines the patent system's role in the development of economically competitive technologies.
Right off the bat, the office will tackle a dispute over software patents sparked by the sweepingly broad patent awarded to Compton's New Media for multimedia search systems. So harsh has been the outcry that the Patent Commissioner, Bruce Lehman, has said the award will be re-examined. 
 Debate over "harmonization" of Federal patent law will intensify, too. That dispute centers on whether the United States should modify laws to conform with those in Europe and Japan. Last fall, the agency heard arguments over whether it should abandon its tradition of awarding patents to the first inventor and replace it with a system of issuing a patent to the first person to file a claim. Discussion will also focus on whether the 17-year exclusivity of United States patents should be lengthened and whether patent applications should be published.
This year will probably see a continued decline in the number of United States patents issued to foreign inventors, now that the Japanese seem to be filing fewer applications. Patent experts attribute the falloff to the downturn in Japan's economy.
For several years, foreign inventors were receiving nearly half of all patents issued by the Patent Office. In 1992, the most recent year for which data are available, Japanese inventors continued to lead the way among foreign applicants by receiving 23,000 of 109,000 patents issued. And yet, 54 percent of patents awarded in 1992 went to Americans -- the highest percentage in six years.
Meanwhile, most inventors still wait 18 months on average for a patent -- and no changes are seen to speed up the process. One consolation for the little guy: powerful corporations are forced to cool their heels as long as loners tinkering in their garages.
 
A Paddle-Wheel Airplane
For Travel to the Airport
 The headache of traveling from La Guardia or Kennedy airports into Manhattan might be alleviated someday by an inexpensive air shuttle. An engineer at the Northrop Corporation proposes just such a system for all big airports. His newly patented airplane uses paddle wheels in place of wings to take off and land vertically.
Travelers who live or work in big cities often must drive a half-hour or more to airports outside metropolitan areas. While many major airports have helicopter shuttles, the aircraft can carry so few people that the service is too expensive for the average person.
The "rotorcraft" designed by Heinz A. Gerhardt looks as if someone attached paddle wheels from a Mississippi riverboat to the sides of an airplane fuselage, right where the wings should protrude. But the paddles are actually blades, and a pilot can tilt each one independently to give the aircraft lift, thrust, roll and yaw.
"By the fact that the blades rotate, they develop lift," Mr. Gerhardt said. "By adjusting the pitch of the blades you can achieve lift or thrust or a combination thereof."
The plane has the passenger and cargo capacity of a fixed-wing aircraft with the lift of a helicopter. Mr. Gerhardt said it could travel up to 300 miles per hour, and might be as large as a Boeing 747 jet.
"In principle, there is no limit, but I was thinking in terms of carrying 10 passengers," he added.
Mr. Gerhardt won patent 5,265,827.
 
 
A New Way for Surgeons
To Keep Gloves Sterile
 Health professionals rely on rubber gloves to protect against the spread of disease. Nonsterile gloves are sufficient for most. But surgeons must use sterile gloves, and they often require help to put them on without touching anything. To get around that, an engineer in Medford, L.I., invented a cartridge that allows surgeons to stick a bare hand in and pull a gloved hand out.
Frederick Wood's cartridge is designed to hang on a wall or be mounted onto a cart. Inside the cartridge is another container shaped like a hand. Gloves, fitted one inside the other, are placed inside the hand-shaped container. Each glove has a tab interwoven around its cuff, and between it and the adjacent glove. All the air is removed from inside the hand-shaped container, causing the gloves to be sucked up against one wall.
When a user sticks his hand inside the container, he puts on the innermost glove. He then pulls the tab, breaking the vacuum around that glove and releasing it.
He said his patent also covers a condom applicator. He received patent 5,269,405.
 Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

HEADLINE: In America, an Economic Upswing Cheers the Forecasters

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
To Thomas H. O'Brien, chairman of the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, the proof that business was feeling more bullish about the economy and intended to spend more was unmistakable: a $5 billion surge in the credit lines his bank extended to companies the last three months.
The revival of business borrowing at PNC is just one of many signs the economy, now in its 34th month of stop-and-go expansion, has gotten back on a moderate growth track. Among the other indications: falling joblessness, consumers' improving mood, solid gains in spending on cars and other big-ticket items, rising industrial production and growing order backlogs. 
 "We now have an expansion that's broad and deep enough so that I think we'll now see a sustained period of growth," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's chief economist.
Growth will probably not stay as strong as the 4 percent to 5 percent rate forecasters expect for the final quarter of 1993. Economists, in an unusually tight consensus, predict growth will average about 3 percent this year.
They say there are too many negatives still facing the economy to make a boom probable: a hefty tax rise, more military cuts, a soggy world economy and a very low household savings rate. The plus is that most economists say they do not detect the kinds of imbalances -- creeping inflation, production bottlenecks or over leveraging -- that could short-circuit the recovery.
"It's the well-rested economy phenomenon," said Laurence H. Meyers, president of Laurence H. Meyers & Associates in St. Louis and winner of the Sterling award for best predictions in 1993. "We saved our strength, and some of it is coming out now."
Moderate growth has its virtues. Forecasters almost uniformly expect inflation to remain well behaved this year, citing an impressive array of forces -- from plenty of capacity to lively productivity growth to a vigilant Federal Reserve -- that are apt to keep it that way. Most see a repeat of last year's rise of about 3 percent in consumer prices. But some forecasters, including Larry Kimbell of the University of California at Los Angeles, think things will be even better than that.
Economists also expect long-term interest rates, which determine the cost of buying a house or investing in new plant and equipment, to remain low by historical standards.
Forecasters say a 3 percent growth rate is sufficiently solid to lift Americans' after-tax income in real terms and to whittle the unemployment rate. If the economy adds two million jobs, as the economists expect, the unemployment rate, now 6.4 percent, should edge down near 6 percent. In effect, that would mean full employment -- or something close to it -- in most states outside California and New York.
Forecasters are rarely right on the money, though the blue-chip consensus only missed by a tenth of a percentage point on growth last year. This year most economists predict that any surprises are likely to be on the upside.
"Since there was such weak economic growth from 1988 to 1992 and such limited job creation, Ms. Tyson said, "there may be a fair amount of pent-up demand," which combined with low rates could lift consumer spending.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "In America, an Economic Upswing Cheers the Forecasters"
 
FORECASTER: Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Chairwoman, Council of Economic Advisors, Washington, D.C.
 
GROWTH (Percentage growth in real gross domestic product for 1994): 3.0%
The economy is getting a solid push from consumers who are buying big ticket items like cars and furniture, executives who are investing in new equipment and, more recently, homebuyers.
 
EMPLOYMENT
(1994 net job growth): 2.0 million jobs
(Unemployment rate a year from now): 6.4%
It took a while for the job machine jto get back in gear, but now the economy is creating jobs at a more normal rate.
 
INFLATION (Percentage growth in consumer prices in 1994): 3.3%
Wages are going up modestly and production capacity is abundant the world over.
 
INTEREST RATES (Yield on 30-year Treasury bonds a year from now): 6.4%
Moderate growth plus steady inflation gives forecasters little reason to predict a significant rise in rates.
 
UNCERTAINTIES (Factors that could make 1994 turn out better, or worse, than forecast: A revised forecast due in February will probably shave a few tenths of a point off the predicted unemployment and inflation rates. Among the forces that could produce faster-than-expected growth are a surge of inventory rebuildings, a more robust rebound in housing, ans sassier consumers.
 
FORECASTER: Laurence H. Meyers, Laurence H. Meyers & Associates, St. Louis, 1993 Sterling Award for Best Forecaster.
 
GROWTH (Percentage growth in real gross domestic product for 1994): 3.1%
The economy is full of cross currents - "bunches of positives and negatives that are warring with each other."
 
EMPLOYMENT
(1994 net job growth): 2.0 million jobs
(Unemployment rate a year from now): 6.1%
Executives are still worried about the cost of health care reform, but they will hire enough workers to avoid losing sales.
 
INFLATION (Percentage growth in consumer prices in 1994): 2.7%
Lower oil prices will shave a little more from the inflation rate.
 
INTEREST RATES (Yield on 30-year Treasury bonds a year from now): 5.9%
As long as the low inflation, moderate growth environment continues, interest rates should stay low.
 
UNCERTAINTIES (Factors that could make 1994 turn out better, or worse, than forecast: The odds of stronger or slower growth are roughly equal. Potential sources of a negative surprise: Military cuts and recession abroad are the economy's ball and chain and could be more of a drag than he now anticipates.
 
FORECASTER: Robert J. Eggert Sr., Blue Chip Consensus, Sedona, Az.
 
GROWTH (Percentage growth in real gross domestic product for 1994): 2.9%
Imports willrise faster and exports will keep weakening, one reason that growth will stay moderate.
 
EMPLOYMENT: No forecast.
(1994 net job growth): 6.5%
(Unemployment rate a year from now): Last month's sharp drop in unemployment has prompted forecasters to raise their 1994 predictions.
 
INFLATION (Percentage growth in consumer prices in 1994): 2.9%
No signs of inflationary pressures.
 
INTEREST RATES (Yield on 30-year Treasury bonds a year from now): 6.5%
The consensus expectation of a 7.0% corporate bond implies a T-bond rate of around 6.5%
 
UNCERTAINTIES (Factors that could make 1994 turn out better, or worse, than forecast: The most likely source of an upside surprise: Even lower long-term interest rates could fuel stronger investment and homebuying. Most likely source of a downside surprise: Another wave of big corporate layoffs that puncture consumer confidence.
 
FORECASTER: Aldona Robbins, Fiscal Associates, Alexandria, Va.
 
GROWTH (Percentage growth in real gross domestic product for 1994): 2.8%
President Clinton's tax hike on the rich will knock half a percentage point from the economy's growth rate.
 
EMPLOYMENT
(1994 net job growth): 2.0 million jobs
(Unemployment rate a year from now): 6.1%
The economy will come up with 250 thousand fewer jobs than otherwise because of the tax hike, which will hold down investment.
 
INFLATION (Percentage growth in consumer prices in 1994): 3.1%
The Federsl Reserve is going to stay tight.
 
INTEREST RATES (Yield on 30-year Treasury bonds a year from now): 6.6%
Long term rates will stay low as long as the after-tax return to capital remains depressed.
 
UNCERTAINTIES (Factors that could make 1994 turn out better, or worse, than forecast: The wild card in the world economy is likely to be an international crisis that shakes the world's financial markets. "We've got the Middle East heating up, and the Korean thing is starting to look nasty."
 
FORECASTER: Larry Kimbell, UCLA Business Forecasting Project, Los Angeles
GROWTH (Percentage growth in real gross domestic product for 1994): 3.7%
Faster-than-expected growth will come thanks to lower oil prices and stronger consumer and business spending that other forecasters predict.
 
EMPLOYMENT
(1994 net job growth): 2.6 million jobs
(Unemployment rate a year from now): 6.0%
California will cast less of a shadow on the national job picture because, though still depressed, it will be adding jobs by mid-1994.
 
INFLATION (Percentage growth in consumer prices in 1994): 1.9%
Oil prices should average $1.50 less than in 1993 and more than $3.00 less than in 1992.
 
INTEREST RATES (Yield on 30-year Treasury bonds a year from now): 6.0%
Lower oil prices equal lower inflationary expectations, equal a more sanguine Federal Reserve and lower long term rates.
 
UNCERTAINTIES (Factors that could make 1994 turn out better, or worse, than forecast: The biggest risk is that the recession among America's trading partners turns out longer and deeper that he is expecting. Among the potential trouble spots: Russia, China and Japan, which is trying to adjust to lower real estate and stock prices.

HEADLINE: Federated Acquires Stake in Macy In Bold Move Toward Expansion

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Federated Department Stores, in a bold move to create the largest department store company in America, announced yesterday that it had bought a stake in a leading rival, R. H. Macy & Company.
If Federated should succeed in taking control of Macy, which some analysts said yesterday that they doubted, it would bring together some of the best-known department stores in the country: Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and Burdines of Federated, and Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin, owned by Macy. 
 Federated paid $449.3 million for half of a secured claim against Macy -- which is operating under bankruptcy protection -- held by the Prudential Insurance Company of America and has an option to buy the other half. The claim represents $832.5 million, plus interest, that Macy owes to Prudential. Federated, which operates nine department store chains, paid $109.3 million in cash for the stake, with the balance to be paid in three years at a floating interest rate.
 
 
'Very Shrewd Move'
 Should it exercise its option to buy the remainder of Prudential's stake, Federated would become Macy's largest creditor and would have a voice in the outcome of its bankruptcy reorganization. Even with the half it now owns, Federated, which emerged from bankruptcy itself in 1992, is likely to play a far more active role in Macy's bankruptcy proceedings than other creditors have so far.
"It was a very shrewd move on Federated's part," said David H. Ford, an analyst who follows distressed securities at the Delaware Bay Company. "Federated has beneficial ownership of all of the piece they bought, but they didn't have to pay for it all at once."
But Mr. Ford and other bankruptcy experts cautioned yesterday that becoming a creditor, even a large and powerful one, is a far riskier way for Federated to attempt a marriage with Macy than a more conventional merger agreement would be.
"Buying the debt does not guarantee them in any way that they will come out with control in the end," said Robert Miller, the lawyer who represents Macy bondholders. "This is a very curious move on the part of Federated, and I do not have any idea whether it portends favorably or unfavorably for the Macy's case."
 
 
'No Guarantee'
 Allen I. Questrom, the chairman and chief executive of Federated, said in a statement that the company was aware that the attempted merger was contingent upon what happens during Macy's bankruptcy proceedings.
"None know better than we that this will be a challenging process, with no guarantee that we will be successful in accomplishing anything more than having made a sound business investment for Federated and its shareholders," he said. "But if, as we get further into the process, we continue to believe that it will be in everyone's best interests, and if ultimately it can be accomplished, then the end result of a combined Federated and Macy's department store operation will be well worth whatever effort is required."
Federated did not tell Macy of its negotiations with Prudential, which transpired rapidly, until yesterday morning. But Mr. Questrom has told several people that he may be interested in acquiring all or part of Macy. Many in the retail industry said they thought he was particularly interested in Bullock's, which Macy owns and which Mr. Questrom built into one of the leading department store franchises when it was part of the Federated empire.
 
 
Surprise Over Timing
 Myron E. Ullman 3d, the chairman and chief executive of Macy, said Federated's new role as a Macy creditor would have little if any impact on the company. "We're a little surprised about the timing, although not about their interest," he said. "Obviously, the reorganization is going well, and there are reasons for people to be interested."
Analysts applauded Federated's acquisition for its sheer daring, although they were uncertain how it would ultimately shake out. For those who were on the scene in 1988, when Macy tried to buy Federated, the announcement brought an eerie wave of nostalgia. That purchase was thwarted by Robert Campeau, the Canadian real estate developer, who bought Federated and saddled it with the debt that ultimately led to its bankruptcy.
 
 
'Crowning Glory'
 "It's a very bold move on the part of Federated, which I applaud, and if it goes through will be the crowning glory of Allen Questrom's career," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm.
The combination of the two companies, which is contingent on a number of factors including the bankruptcy process, would create a department store behemoth with more than $13 billion in sales and operations in almost all areas of the country. The May Department Stores Company, with $10.5 billion in sales, is currently the largest.
 
 
Number of Ties
 The two retailers already have a number of ties, and a merger would create opportunities for more efficient operation and much greater buying power.
Mr. Ullman used to work for Federated and knows Mr. Questrom and James M. Zimmerman, Federated's president and chief operating officer, well. But those relationships soured over the summer, when Macy hired one of Federated's senior merchants to fill its No. 2 position. Federated already handles Macy's information management systems and data processing under contract.
Federated would benefit from Macy's expertise in product development and its extensive network of contractors overseas. And while there is some overlap between the two companies, the number of places where the two chains have stores in the same malls is not significant, a Federated spokeswoman said.
Macy would benefit from Federated's knowledge of the bankruptcy process and its access to capital.
"A lot of what Questrom is trying to push through at Federated is similar to what's happening at Macy's, too -- the effort to build business at moderate prices, the effort to be strong in home furnishings," said Isaac Lagnado, of Tactical Retail Solutions Inc., a retail consulting and research firm. "It could potentially be, unless egos get in the way, a win-win situation."
A combination of Federated and Macy would also prevent other companies from acquiring all or part of Macy.
"This pre-empts anyone else from buying a piece of Macy and presenting Federated with a different kind of competition," Mr. Loeb said.
But what is puzzling is how Federated expects to translate its stake into control. Macy has several ways to dispense with the claims against it in bankruptcy. Analysts have assumed that the Prudential debt, which is the most senior, would be paid in full, and that Macy could elect to simply pay it off.
 
 
Alliances Needed
 To gain control in the bankruptcy proceeding and insure the completion of the merger attempt it has embarked upon, Federated would have to gain the alliance of other creditors like Fidelity Investments and Trust Company of the West, two big holders of Macy's secured debt. Fidelity and Trust Company are known for buying big enough stakes in bankrupt companies' debt that in alliance they can control the outcome of a reorganization.
Fidelity has already begun taking a more vocal role in Macy's bankruptcy proceedings, and some say it has sought to attract Dillard Department Stores Inc. and other department store chains to take part in Macy.
Daniel Harmetz, who manages the Fidelity fund that owns a chunk of Macy's secured debt, could not be reached last night.
In many cases, Fidelity buys the debt of a company in bankruptcy proceedings in the hope of gaining an equity stake in the company when it emerges from bankruptcy. To receive equity in exchange for the debt it holds, however, it must push the company out of bankruptcy early in the proceedings, before the company has accumulated enough cash and value to pay it off outright. Should Federated ally itself with Fidelity and others to pursue such a strategy, it could win an equity stake in Macy that might help it in its quest to combine.
 
 
'Different Game'
 "Now it's totally a different game," Mr. Ford of Delaware Bay said. "No longer are you talking about people getting equity in Macy's, but instead they'd probably be getting equity in a combined company."
Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated, emphasized that the company had not acquired its stake with hostile intentions and said repeatedly that Federated would seek to work "cooperatively and constructively" with Macy to combine the companies.
But she also said Federated would seek to work with other creditors as well. "It definitely gives us a great deal of flexibility to work with other creditors, and it does in fact open up a number of possibilities in terms of coming up with a plan of reorganization," Ms. Sanger said. "We think the potential is there for an expedited emergence from Chapter 11 because its something that stands to benefit everyone."

HEADLINE: The Play Is Just Not the Thing

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
When Lynn Redgrave's one-woman show, "Shakespeare for My Father," closed last night at the Helen Hayes Theater, it left only three commercial plays running on Broadway: "Laughter on the 23d Floor," "The Sisters Rosensweig" and the two-part "Angels in America." This might seem a record dearth, but it isn't: last year at this time there were only two nonmusicals, "Conversations With My Father" and "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me." But since seven commercial plays started their runs this fall and only two opened in the fall of 1992, this season's void suggests a far sharper collapse.
Among the failures was Brian Friel's eagerly anticipated "Wonderful Tennessee," which lasted all of one week despite respectful reviews. Its early demise was all the more disappointing in light of Mr. Friel's considerable success with "Dancing at Lughnasa" two seasons ago. Also quick to close were the works of two Pulitzer Prize winners, "Any Given Day," by Frank Gilroy, and the two-part "Kentucky Cycle," by Robert Schenkkan, as well as "The Twilight of the Golds," by Jonathan Tolins, and "Mixed Emotions," by Harold Baer. 
 The straight play was once, of course, the foundation of Broadway. No fewer than 188 were produced during the 1927 season, and 36 opened in a single season as recently as 1980. Last season's tally was 18, though 10 of them were produced by Broadway's nonprofit institutional companies, among them Lincoln Center Theater, Circle in the Square, the National Actors Theater and the Roundabout Theater.
If it were not for these institutions, said the veteran producer Robert Whitehead, "the theater, as a force, would cease to exist."
"I felt a real sense of hope because the volume of commercial plays went up this fall," Mr. Whitehead said. "But the failures certainly have been disconcerting." Not disconcerting enough, though, to deter him from planning to bring Arthur Miller's next play to Broadway in April.
The most serious problem is cost. "The $600,000 play of five years ago now costs $1.2 million," said James B. Freydberg, the lead producer of last season's hit "Fool Moon." "The same production would cost $400,000 off Broadway."
 
'Making It Broadway'
 Even elaborate plays on the scale of "Angels in America" and "The Kentucky Cycle," both of which originated at regional theaters, cost less in the past because the major elements of the production -- actors, director and creative team -- came to Broadway as a package. The trend now, Mr. Freydburg said, "is to enhance them for Broadway: remounting them, recasting them and redoing them. They call it 'making it Broadway.' And that costs a lot of money."
Inflation and the costs of contracts with theatrical unions are frequently given as prime reasons for the escalation of production costs. But not everyone thinks they are the only reasons. "I don't blame the unions," Mr. Freydberg said. "I think it's mismanagement on the part of the producers. They pay everyone too much and don't design the shows specifically to make a weekly profit."
The number of successful plays will not increase, Mr. Freydberg said, until producers are better schooled in the intricacies of production to insure that plays can turn a weekly profit when a show is running at considerably less than capacity. "There are a lot of hobby producers out there, who don't need the money and produce plays as a sideline," he added.
In part, the scarcity of qualified play producers is the result of "a producers' brain drain, because there's no money in it," said Frederick Zollo, one of the producers of "Angels in America." "It's dangerous on Broadway. But in Hollywood, you get paid a producer's fee whether the movie runs or not. So why slave away in New York City for no money?"
In the view of many producers and theater managers, the traditional audience for Broadway plays is declining, although there are no hard statistics. At the same time, the audience for straight plays at institutional theaters has been increasing. George Wachtel, the director of research for the League of American Theaters and Producers, says the audience for straight plays is not declining so much as it is evolving. "They're looking for a more contemporary idiom, so they're finding their way to shows like 'Angels in America' on Broadway or 'Oleanna' off Broadway, plays that more closely reflect the society in which they exist," Mr. Wachtel said.
 
The Flight to Film
 Another factor in the decline of the Broadway play is the flight of talented, committed theater writers to film and television. Even though, as Mr. Zollo said: "In some ways, the talent pool among writers is vastly increased, because we now have women's voices, gay voices, black voices. But they're just not bringing their work to Broadway."
In fact, the trend is in the other direction. When David Mamet was looking for a theater for "Oleanna" last season, Mr. Zollo said, "He was slightly tempted to come to Broadway, but I warned him off it. 'Oleanna' was an intimate two-character play, much better suited for downtown than to a cavernous Broadway theater with a proscenium." The show became a long-running hit at the Orpheum Theater on Second Avenue and made money.
Mr. Freydberg said he never considered bringing David Rabe's new play, "Those the River Keeps," to Broadway because of the cost, and that it would open off Broadway at the Promenade this season. And although Paul Rudnick's "I Hate Hamlet" ran on Broadway in the 1991-92 season, he turned to Off Broadway this year with his successful comedy "Jeffrey."
The producer Arthur Cantor, who has shunned Broadway since 1986, thinks audiences rejected Mr. Tolins's "Twilight of the Golds" because of its troubling theme. The play posited the existence of genetic testing of the unborn for homosexuality and examined its impact on a pregnant wife and her family. "There used to be a niche on Broadway for the interesting topical play on a social issue that provoked debate," Mr. Cantor said. "No more. We'll probably lose writers like him, and themes like this, to Hollywood and to television."
Another inhibiting factor, Mr. Zollo said, is that fewer and fewer tourists want to see straight plays. "They all ask for the big musicals," he said. Indeed, most Broadway shows count on tourists to sustain them during summers and holiday periods.
 
'Special Event Status'
 "Perestroika," the long-awaited second half of "Angels in America," met one of the new requirements for the survival of dramas on Broadway: "You'd better have special-event status or pack your bags," was the way Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, put it.
"The Kentucky Cycle," with its Pulitzer pedigree, multi-generational sweep, double-play length, budget of $2.5 million and cast of 21, qualified on that score. But mixed reviews failed to ignite the kind of excitement that could overcome the daunting barriers of price (a $100 top) and playing time of six hours, which the show's producer, David G. Richenthal, acknowledged were problems from the start.
Reviews that focused on its darker, melancholic scenes may explain why "Any Given Day," Mr. Gilroy's 1993 prequel to his 1964 Pulitzer Prize-winning "Subject Was Roses," failed to attract as much of an audience.
Despite the pessimism of their comments, few theater people expect the straight play to completely disappear. "Broadway will increasingly become a marketing tool; not so much a creative environment, but rather a marketing environment," said Lewis Allen, who intended to bring Sam Shepard's latest play, "Simpatico," to Broadway until the financing dropped out.
Mr. Allen said that producers will still seek out the cachet of a Broadway run to make money from touring and subsidiary rights. Others look with hope to the Broadway Alliance, a coalition of Broadway producers, theater owners and unions that was formed in an effort to reduce theater costs and ticket prices. Hope persists even though the fall season's failures included two alliance productions, "Mixed Emotions" and "Any Given Day." "In lowering the cost of production, the alliance is still the best hope to increase the number of straight plays on Broadway," Mr. Whitehead said.
 
'Between Life and Death'
 Another hope is to increase subsidies for plays in the crucial phase of a theatrical run, before word of mouth attracts an audience. "For 'Fool Moon,' T.D.F. was the difference between life and death," Mr. Freydberg said, referring to the Theater Development Fund, the Manhattan-based nonprofit organization that subsidized the show before and after its opening. The fund doubled its budget to $360,000 this season to support new plays, buying tickets from producers and selling them at a $4 reduction to a mailing list of 90,000 theatergoers.
Other groups, including the American Theater Wing and Early Stages, provide low-cost tickets to schoolchildren, and theater owners participate in such programs as well. Nevertheless, Mr. Zollo said he and other producers believe that "we need a major national program to rebuild theater audiences from the ground up."
"If kids could see plays regularly, from the first grade on," he said, "we could create an entirely new audience, not just for Broadway, but for all theater."

HEADLINE: A Smart Buy, or Too Smart by Half?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The same kind of huge mistake, made years ago, sent Federated Department Stores and R. H. Macy plummeting toward bankruptcy. But Federated's blunder was much bigger. As a result, it now may be in a position to take control of Macy.
But in arranging the deal that was announced yesterday, in which Federated paid $449.3 million for half a secured claim against Macy, Federated's chairman and chief executive, Allen I. Questrom, may have purchased debt that is too good to enable such a bid to succeed. 
 If much of the above sounds nonsensical, welcome to the wonderful world of bankruptcy -- where it is unclear who owns a company, where the influence of management may be great or insignificant, and where the owner of low-level debt can be the one who winds up in the driver's seat.
 
Who Will Hold What?
 The deal leaves Macy owing Federated about $1 billion. In terms of power, Federated may have miscalculated this time by buying secured mortgage debt. If managers of Macy and lower-level creditors want to do so, they can probably come up with a plan of reorganization that would make the mortgage debt good, either by paying it off or by issuing new securities worth as much as is owed. That would leave Federated with no stock in the reorganized company. In such a case, Federated would show a profit, but have no influence on a post-bankruptcy Macy.
But by jumping into the reorganization with both feet, Federated has become a player, one that might be able to go around management and cut its own deals.
"It gives us the flexibility to work with other creditors and gives us a number of possibilities in formulating a plan of reorganization," said Carol Sanger, a Federated spokeswoman.
A big part of Macy's problems can be traced to the 1988 takeover battle for control of Federated, set off when Robert Campeau, the Canadian real estate speculator, put in a bid for Federated. Macy made its own bid, and the stock price rose and rose. In the end, Macy and the Campeau Corporation cut a deal, giving Federated's two California-based chains, Bullock's and I. Magnin, to Macy -- shortly before a recession started to take hold that was to prove especially bad in California.
The deal was a disaster for all involved. Mr. Campeau turned out to have grossly overpaid, and to not have much idea about how to operate department stores. Federated soon went broke. Macy managed to hang on for several years more before it entered Chapter 11.
Federated is out of bankruptcy now. Macy, having survived longer, is in it and thus potentially vulnerable to a would-be acquirer gaining control by purchasing debt.
In bankruptcy, the goal is to submit a plan to a bankruptcy judge that treats creditors fairly and allows the company to continue operating. If possible, senior and secured creditors are paid or receive new securities that are equal in value to what they were owed.
More junior creditors often end up with stock in a new company, and creditors who rank below them, not to mention existing stockholders, may get little if anything. Management normally submits the plan, but in some circumstances creditors can offer their own plan and get it approved.
Investors seeking to take control of a company that is in bankruptcy proceedings thus strive to buy the securities that will get the new stock. Which securities those are depend on how much the company being reorganized is really worth. Buy too good a security and you may wind up as a continuing creditor. Buy too bad a security and you may get virtually nothing.
An experienced speculator in such securities, who is not involved in Macy and who spoke on condition that he not be identified by name, expressed surprise at Federated's move to buy secured debt, the type most likely to be made whole, and thus not get stock.
"It mystifies me," he said yesterday. "I don't know why you would put that much money into that level, if your objective is to get control of the company." He added that "unless things at Macy are a lot worse than I think they are," the stock is likely to go to more junior creditors.
Of course, that assumes that Mr. Questrom is not able to cut a deal with the junior creditors. With his stake, he can try to block any management plan, although a judge could rule that the plan treats Federated fairly and override any objections. And Mr. Questrom may be able to push Macy to act sooner, a move that some think would benefit secured debt holders at the expense of junior creditors.
In any case, other kinds of debt might have been impossible to acquire in the quantity that would make Federated a player in the Macy transaction. Federated has taken effective control of about $1 billion in debt with a cash outlay of $109.3 million. Conceivably, it could still buy other Macy securities if it felt it needed to do so to put together a deal.
 
A Mortgage Deal
 Under Federated's deal with Prudential Insurance, which held mortgages on 70 of Macy's 110 department-store properties, it agreed to pay $449.3 million for 50 percent of the mortgage with $109.3 million down and the rest due in three years, plus interest. It also has an option to buy the remaining 50 percent of the mortgage for undisclosed terms.
Under that mortgage, Macy owes $832.5 million, plus accrued interest at 12 percent that brings the total to more than $1 billion.
It is possible, of course, that Federated's assertion that it wants to take over Macy is not completely accurate. Assuming that Macy management wants to avoid control by Federated, it becomes all the more important to come up with a plan that makes the debt good, simply because Federated, with stock, is more to be feared than an institutional investor like Prudential would have been.
If so, Federated will wind up with a handsome profit in what could become known as "bankruptcy greenmail."

HEADLINE: '93 Donations Increased For Most Area Charities

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
With some notable exceptions, charities report that they received more donations this holiday season than last, as changes in tax laws and a bullish stock market encouraged end-of-the-year giving.
A large number of organizations in the New York region estimate that contributions will be about 10 percent higher than a year ago. Charities largely credit the increase in donations to a revision in the tax law that allows donors to write off the current market price of a gift -- instead of a lower purchase price -- without increasing their tax liability under the alternative minimum tax law. That way, wealthy donors are not penalized for deducting the full value of assets that have appreciated over time. 
 "The new law should encourage donors to give art works to museums, land to conservation groups and stocks or securities to any number of organizations," said Ann E. Kaplan, a research analyst for the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.
At least 20 percent of all gifts come at year's end, estimates Brian O'Connell, an analyst of philanthropy trends and the president of the Independent Sector, a coalition of 850 of the nation's leading foundations, corporations and nonprofit associations.
"Contributors tend to be more generous at this season, which is why so many appeals are mailed in December, asking donors for a second or supplemental gift," he said. "People give for all the right reasons -- like wanting to support good causes -- but taxes are a critical consideration, and taxpayers tend to wait until year's end."
A bullish stock market is encouraging gifts of larger value, as people who have seen their stock appreciate are more willing to make donations, fund-raisers say.
"We're seeing more giving from the very wealthy, but also more gifts from those who make contributions under $5,000," said Patricia F. Lewis, president of the National Society of Fund Raising Executives, which represents 15,000 professionals working for charitable organizations.
The Salvation Army's headquarters in Manhattan received a surge of telephone calls from brokers in late December saying the charity was getting electronic transfers of stocks.
"We had about six such calls within 72 hours, and it was a little bright spot for us because donations to the Army's kettles and replies to its direct-mail appeals have been disappointing," said Patricia M. Foster, director of development for the greater New York area.
The campaign of United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York is running slightly ahead of the previous year's drive, said Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president, and gifts of appreciated stock have risen sharply. "We had 186 gifts of stock in 1992 and a hundred more this year. We've received 20 gifts of real estate since July 1, double the number given in 1992."
The Children's Aid Society anticipates that it will raise about $1 million in its current campaign in gifts from individual donors, an increase of 10 percent, said Philip Coltoff, the executive director. The 140-year-old society, which operates in the five boroughs, is one of the country's largest organizations serving children and families. While individual giving has increased, support from foundations and corporations has leveled off, he said.
Other charities have also noticed a decline in corporate support and attribute it to the lingering weakness of the region's economy.
United Ways of Tri-State, which includes 31 local United Ways in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, has been hit hard by corporate cutbacks because most of its money comes from employee payroll deductions.
"We have pledges of $81.8 million from the 164 companies we cover," $2.9 million less than 1992, said Betty Beene, Tri-State's president.
International Business Machines, which customarily accounts for 10 percent of all giving to Tri-State, reduced its work force by 13,000 employees, causing a loss of $3.8 million in donations from that source alone.
Ms. Beene said that the charges of lavish spending and financial mismanagement on the part of William Aramony, who was the national president then, were "past history" and said the losses were mainly a result of the weak economy.
Contributions this winter to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund reached $2.4 million yesterday, down from $2.5 million a year earlier, said Arthur Gelb, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund.
He said it was too early to estimate final results because the current campaign would continue until the end of February and the drive usually gained momentum in its final weeks. A year ago, more than $4.4 million was raised, the second largest total in the campaign's 82-year history but still 12 percent behind the $5 million collected during 1991-92, a record year.
 
Hospital Nears Record
 The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, on the other hand, is headed for its best year in its 109-year history, said Mortimer H. Chute Jr., a senior vice president. In 1993, it raised more than $73 million, a 24 percent increase compared with the previous year. The gifts included cash, stocks and securities, and some property.
"These gifts came from donors in the 50 states and 35 countries abroad," he said. "In general, charities are doing better for a variety of reasons. People feel better about the economy. Some charities are doing a better job getting out their message. For example, we're putting renewed emphasis on our advanced cancer research."
The Archdiocese of New York, which includes Catholic Charities, has raised its 1994 fund-raising goal to $10 million for the Cardinal's Appeal, up from $7 million last year, said Joseph G. Zwilling, the director of communication. The Archdiocese said it had exceeded its 1993 goal by more than $1 million.
"A raise to $10 million seems like a large increase, but our experience tells us people will respond more generously when we show them where their money is going," he said. "We are putting 25 percent of our funds into education, for example, and increasing our Inner-City Scholarship Fund."
Columbia University, in the middle of a five-year fund drive, anticipates a 10 percent increase in contributions over the previous year and is receiving many more gifts of appreciated stocks, said Emmett Watson, the director of gift-planning.

HEADLINE: Whether It's Bluejeans or Mini-Motors or Power Plants . . .: Levi Straus;
American Symbol With a Cause

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky

 BODY:
Think globally . . . Think globally . . . Think globally. This is the corporate executive's mantra for the new year. With the North American Free Trade Agreement in place and a new world trade agreement moving smartly forward, companies are aggressively expanding beyond national borders and innovating at every turn to snare new business. Caterpillar, for example, elbowed Japanese companies aside in China's coal fields by agreeing to establish a parts warehouse and fly in mechanics. In Silicon Valley, Applied Materials came from behind by spending 15 percent of sales each year on research and development. ABB Asea Brown Boveri is consolidating manufacturing and shifting production of components to take advantage of the free trade accord. In Latin America, Bunge & Born is betting that the region's rate of consumption will grow faster than its overall economies. Levi Strauss, long a global visionary, sounds a sobering note. It continues to turn its back on China's vast market for bluejeans because of human rights concerns. Here, then, six companies and their global strategies:
For all the companies that are marketing products globally, few sell items that better represent American culture than Levi Strauss Associates. Not only has the privately held company become the world's largest brand-name apparel manufacturer, its cornerstone product, Levi's, has virtually become the generic name for bluejeans. 
 In markets worldwide, a pair of Levi's has come to represent "freedom, originality, youthfulness and the spirit of America," said David Schmidt, the company's vice president for corporate marketing. That kind of cachet enabled the 140-year-old San Francisco company to generate an average of $2 billion in international sales in 1991 and 1992, the last years for which figures were tabulated. Those figures represent about 40 percent of total sales. Levi Strauss is now in more than 60 countries outside the United States.
But symbols sometimes carry additional responsibilities, and when they fall upon a company with an already strong social conscience, the results can be somewhat surprising for a progrowth business.
For example, in late 1992, amid its global expansion, Levi Strauss decided against establishing a widespread operation in China because of concerns about the lack of human rights in the country.
What that meant was simple: after a nine-month study by a company task force, Levi Strauss chose to forgo the chance to outfit more than a billion people in Levi's jeans in deference to its strong feeling that China had not progressed far enough in improving its record on human rights, never mind if the United States continued to grant China most-favored-nation trading status.
"There are wonderful commercial opportunities in China," Mr. Schmidt said. "But when ethical issues collide with commercial appeal, we try to insure ethics as the trump card. For us, ethical issues precede all others."
Levi Strauss's social conscience grew out of another task force that worked three years ago to develop what the company regards as standard practices for doing business abroad. In essence, they are guidelines that take into account issues like working conditions, the environment and human rights in the host nation. They are considered in all the company's business relationships, from company-owned stores in Europe to new operations in South Korea and Taiwan.
Based on those principles, Levi Strauss also chose not to expand into Myanmar, formerly Burma, in 1992.
"We look upon building and maintaining the brand as critically important," Mr. Schmidt said. "But the brand represents something. We try to make sure it represents something consistent, wherever we are. To do that, we have chosen not to participate in China for now. I can't say the book is closed forever. We would very much like to be in China. We'll just continue to monitor it and hope the human rights condition becomes more favorable." MICHAEL JANOFSKY

Over the River and Through the Woods
 Just think. The same $10 billion satellite technology the Defense Department uses to target missiles and navigate sea and sky is on its way to helping Buicks and Hondas launch pinpoint visits to in-laws and shopping malls. The global positioning system of 24 satellites allows anyone with a pocket-sized receiver to deterimine their best trajectory. What if there's a glitch? Well, Tomahawk missiles might level the Paramus Park Mall as hordes of shoppers converge on Iraq's Defense Ministry clamoring for Sega's latest Sonic the Hedgehog games.
 
 
For Your Business Card, An Internet Address
 Coming to a computer screen near you this year: more e-mail and e-papers. The hottest addition to a business card will be an Internet electronic mail address, right below your personal fax and mobile phone numbers. As for e-papers, some are already on-line, with more set for this year. Right now, say some news executives, e-news and advertising is only where television was in the 1940's. In the coming decades, they say, cryptic commands and abort, retry and fail messages will become forgotten insults to fully empowered couch potatoes.
 
 
 
Fortuneless Fats
 Maybe Calvin Trillin was right when he said that those Midwestern grain silos hold stockpiles of leftover Chicken a la King. If so, where will food and chemical processors stash all their leftover Simplesse and other Frankenstein diet compounds of the 1980's? These, remember, were to slice quivering chunks of fat from our meals and our physiques with no taste loss. Nutrasweet has already quit making Simple Pleasures, its Simplesse ice cream. Other fake fats win few nods from consumers or the F.D.A. Watch for more silos.
 
 
 
Bart Meets Madden
 Boom! Bam! Doink! That's either the sound of John Madden calling a football game with Pat Summerall or Rupert Murdoch buying N.F.C. broadcast rights, $1.6 billion worth, for his Fox Network. Summerall and Madden are a team built out of succinct subtlety and Rabelesian wit, a duo that seems to have been mated since the days of Amos Alonzo Stagg. Problem is, they work for CBS, which is left without football for the first time since the Eisenhower administration. Madden's agent has already heard from Fox, however, and Bart Simpson is still available.
 
 
 
Have Pen Spell Gibberish

Dadaist poets of the World War I era composed verses by pulling words on paper scraps out of hats. Proof, perhaps, that Apple's Newton is not ahead of its time, but seven decades behind. Meant to be the first hand-held computer to recognize written words, it instead became a babbling generator of gibberish, costing a hatful of big bills. EO, Momenta and Zoomer also proved to be less clever than their names. For now, the keyboard remains mightier than the pen.
 
 
In Advertising A New Bluff
 Don't touch that remote control. It may seem like the same old boring ad, but it's a new and improved boring ad. Such is the plea from advertisers who prepare several different commercials in the same campaign to hold viewers who can immediately banish spots they've already seen, and seen. Advertisers want different advertisements for different audiences and shows. Sometimes, however, attacking from all sides causes unintended casualties. The barrage of 80 different ads CBS made to introduce its new late-night host left even David Letterman sputtering.
 
 
He's Laughing All the Way to the Bank
 They call it free speech. But "The Miss Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant," costing $39.95 on pay-per-view, was expected to gross at least $6 million for the host. Mr. Stern has also multiplied his fortune by turning bawds, body parts and bigotry into books, books, books, plus the top-rated radio show in New York. He became a civil liberties test case once the F.C.C. fined his employer, Infinity Broadcasting, $1.2 million. Then, last week, the agency delayed the company's purchase of three large radio stations. By the time the case ends, Supreme Court Justices will probably be listening to his show. But hopefully, for safety's sake, not while they're driving.

The economic recovery will have to pick up steam for tax revenues to increase enough to help the Guiliani administration make ends meek. Real estate assessments have declined for three years running. Property tax revenues, which account for half of the city's tax receipts, are now projected to drop $250 million to $300 million in the 1995 fiscal year, which begins July 1. Revenues on taxes from financial services has jumped again after nose-diving in the late '80s. Sales tax receipts, which also fell early in the decade, should pick up if the economy continues to improve. Personal income tax receipts have increased each year, propelled by rate increases of 12 percent in fiscal 1991 and 14 percent in fiscal 1992.

Southwest, the Pace-Setting Puddle-Jumper
 They're puddle-jumpers, and they're proud. Now that Southwest Airlines has also bounded into the Northeast, the Midwest and the Far West, the hulking airlines that mocked this Dallas upstart are taking off in frill-less imitation. Continental started a short-hop, quick-turnaround service last year, with USAir, and possibly United and Delta, expected to follow this year. They finally figured out that planes make more money in the air than on the ground, and fares with two figures attract more travelers than fares with three. Attention passengers: For Elvis imitations on board by the C.E.O., stick with Southwest.
 
 
 
Washington's Minimalist Economists
 Minimalist musicians perform extended drones. Minimalist painters sell blank canvases. At the White House, minimalist economists also have turned monotony into an art -- even though George Bush's failure to whip up the economy put Bill Clinton in the White House. Mr. Clinton promised maximal stimulus, but he soon began scaling back. A yawning deficit and rebellious Congress left him with practically no stimulus at all. By year-end, the economy was humming again anyway, letting Clinton minimalists take credit for whatever they did, or didn't, do. Lots of luck finding a minimalist health care fix.
 
 
Driving Out of the Souk
 One of America's most dreaded rituals is headed in the same direction as 8-track tape decks. Detroit is granting car buyers deliverance from oily or pushy or plaintive salespeople. G.M. has been selling Saturns at fixed prices for years, but cut back on haggling for Oldsmobiles only in 1993. With sales up, G.M. expanded its program, and Ford experimented. What if you're so fearful of being cheated that you insist on bargaining? G.M. promises to keep salesmen around for you.
 
 
 
Flocking to Rotisserie Chicken
 First it was rotisserie baseball. Now everyone's betting on rotisserie chicken. Companies count on us to flock to broiled chicken stands at every mall, forsaking the buckets of chickens that had the misfortune to be fried. Boston Chicken and Clucker's Wood Roasted Chicken have had high-flying public offerings. Kentucky Fried Chicken, owned by Pepsico, has put even its name on a diet, nagging the public and press to call it KFC. Nutritionists and investment bankers praise slimmer chickens. Investors with weak stomachs should buy the birds, not the stocks.
 
 
 
Paris and Mickey Don't Mix
 Euro Disney's managers began by insisting that employees, mostly French, bathe regularly and wear "appropriate undergarments." Now, with debts of more than $3 billion and a $900 million-plus loss in the first full year, it's the balance sheet that needs dressing up. To keep from closing, the managers are begging creditor banks and the Walt Disney Company for firmer support. Disney has been looking elsewhere, including the home turf. But are well-scrubbed Californians ready for a second Disney theme park?
 
 
 
Cooking With Gas
 They're not about to rename Houston's football team the Gassers. But oilers are fewer as energy producers turn increasingly to natural gas. It's more abundant and cleaner burning, and its price has held fairly steady, even as oil prices have collapsed. Heating oil dealers are striking back by cranking up the temperature of their radio ads (Gas in my house? No way! One Chernobyl's enough.).
 
 
 
Lopez: Saint or Sinner?
In efficiency and profitability, Volkswagen and General Motors still finish at the rear of the class. Last year, they stayed there, shooting spitballs over the affections of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Mr. Lopez, a Spanish arrival given to bizarre pronouncements, cut billions from G.M.'s costs. Then he vanished, only to pop up in the No. 2 spot at VW. Furious about being left at the altar, G.M. complained to German prosecutors that Mr. Lopez had run off with trade secrets and other top managers. VW denies all. Time to stifle the lawyers and learn to build better cars?

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia to Slash Its Budget As Oil Prices Continue to Plunge

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 2

 BODY:
After two decades of economic growth driven by vast income from oil exports, Saudi Arabia has announced that it is slashing its budget by 20 percent this year because of the decline in world oil prices.
King Fahd announced the move, viewed as a major policy shift, in a speech at a special Cabinet session that was broadcast to the nation late Saturday night. The cuts were dictated by "changing world economic circumstances and a surplus of oil supplies that have brought a drop in prices," he said. 
 The King said that spending in 1994 had been set at $42.6 billion, down from $52.5 billion in 1993, but he did not specify where the cuts would be made.
That leaves open the possibility that the military budget will be cut, possibly affecting imports of weapons from the United States, or that subsidies will be reduced or eliminated for fuel, transportation and food.
The King did not mention any change in the tax system to help make up some of the lost revenue. Income tax is virtually nonexistent in Saudi Arabia.
A global recession and an increase in oil supplies elsewhere in the world, including the North Sea and Russia, have caused world oil prices to plummet by more than 20 percent this year. The average price of Saudi crude now stands at $12 a barrel, down from $16 a barrel in early 1993.
The kingdom's monthly revenue has plunged by $10 billion from levels of a year ago.
While all oil producers have suffered, Saudi Arabia was hit hardest because it had the lion's share of the world market, producing eight million barrels a day. The kingdom still depends on revenue from its crude oil and refined products for most of its income.
Though the King pledged to preserve the exchange rate of the Saudi riyal -- and thus keep the prices of imported goods somewhat stable -- there is little doubt that a 20 percent cut in the budget poses a fundamental threat to the country's social welfare system.
 
Several Benefits Threatened
 Depending on where they are applied, the cuts could threaten inexpensive medical care, exceedingly low energy prices and the modest prices of communication services, travel and food staples.
Saudis have come to depend on such benefits since the early 1970's, when a leap in oil prices brought an unparalleled rise in revenue that guaranteed hefty financial reserves through the early 1980's.
If the Government decides to focus on reducing the $35 billion defense budget, largely through cutting back on the purchase of weapons systems from the United States, its balance of payments would be sharply affected.
Bankers familiar with the Saudi economy said the decision to cut spending was widely anticipated, though it had been postponed for at least two years. Saudi budget deficits have been running at an average of $10 billion each year for the past few years.
The country's once huge financial reserves have dwindled to about $7 billion in liquid assets. Another $20 billion in reserves are committed to backing the Saudi currency, which the King said would be defended at its present exchange rate level of 3.7 riyals to the dollar. That decision leaves the Government little room to keep on financing deficits from reserves.
The Saudis have relied for years on internal borrowing, issuing treasury bonds to raise the money they need. In the last two years they have also borrowed from international banks.
 
An Expanding Population
 Another growing pressure on the economy is an exploding birth rate over the last decade. The Saudi population, variously estimated by international agencies at 13 million to 15 million, is expanding by about 3.8 percent a year, one of the highest growth rates in the world. At that rate, some doubt the country will be able to maintain the standard of living to which its citizens became accustomed when oil prices stood at twice their current levels in the 1970's and early 1980's.
The demand for electricity and telephone service threatens to outpace what the Government can provide. It may also be forced to rethink its policies on agricultural subsidies, like the cultivation of domestic wheat at a cost of $300 a ton -- three times the world market price. Farmers are using far too much of the country's limited underground water reserves to produce a commodity that can be purchased at significantly lower prices, some experts say.
"All the forecasts about infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in the 60's and 70's are proving now to be below needs," said an international banker who lives in Saudi Arabia, "Not because they were wrong when they were made, but because these subsidies have encouraged people to consume irrationally. Families have three, four, seven cars. They have two or three telephone lines."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Giuliani's No-Frills Speech Evokes an Earlier Era

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI pledged yesterday that "New York City is poised for dramatic change."
But what change? 
 He used his inaugural address to suggest that a major difference with his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, may be less his agenda of change than the perception he wants to foster that he will able to make good on it. In other words, the change he speaks of is not just new positions on policy, but a new level of effective government.
Still he carefully made no promises he may be unable to keep. He hardly made any at all, using his speech instead to buy time and good will until he hunkers down to governing.
His goals are broad, but not yet specific. Mr. Giuliani's own challenge is to make New Yorkers feel safer, reduce tax burdens, deliver services more efficiently, inspire the dispirited among every social and economic groups and give the impression that he and not durable bureaucrats, unelected power brokers or deviant hooligans is now in charge.
Yesterday Mr. Giuliani invoked the past to suggest the future more often than Mr. Dinkins had. And Mr. Giuliani's speech was less lofty than the inspiring remarks delivered in 1990 by Mr. Dinkins, who described his inauguration as the city's first black mayor and a descendant of slaves as "more than a transfer of power."
Mr. Giuliani touched many bases yesterday. But his make-it-like-it-was speech evoked an earlier era, as did the guest list, which, not surprisingly, did not include two of Mr. Dinkins's more prominent 1990 invitees, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Mr. Giuliani is the first mayor in decades to win election without winning Manhattan, and his remarks suggested the boroughs outside Manhattan are ascendant again.
Mr. Giuliani gave a no-frills address (quoting neither poets nor philosophers but invoking the "indomitable spirit" of Fiorello H. La Guardia and the "common-sense approach" of Edward I. Koch) and almost evangelical (intoning "it should be so and it will be so" after stating each goal).
His speech echoed Mr. Koch, who in 1977 was elected, too, by contrasting his spirit and pragmatism with the despair and failed policies associated, fairly or not, with the previous one-term incumbent. He exhorted New Yorkers to "dream with me of a city that can be better than it is now" and challenged them to "believe, plan and work" to achieve it.
There were moments when the 107th Mayor struck themes that sounded quite similar to those mentioned by the 106th, perhaps unsurprising in a city whose basic problems remain what they have been from the first Dinkins-Giuliani election through the second.
Mr. Dinkins promised to be the "toughest mayor on crime this city has ever seen." Mr. Giuiliani generally avoided superlatives and, as a former crime-fighting prosecutor, talked tough about gun control.
Mr. Dinkins promised to "renew the quest for social justice," suggesting that he would restore the compassion that his predecessor, Mr. Koch, was accused of lacking. Mr. Giuliani pledged to continue that quest but with a pivotal caveat: social justice will not be achieved if society refuses to acknowledge the failure of some good-intentioned programs and merely repeats their mistakes.
Mr. Dinkins recalled that his ancestors came to America in slave ships. Mr. Giuliani, in contrast, cited his immigrant grandfather's perseverence and, implying how far the city has slipped, insisted that New York "will again be the capital of the world."
Some themes were strikingly similar. Mr. Dinkins cautioned his core constituents that "our dreams are bigger than our budget," to which Mr. Giuliani stressed that "our problems can be reduced, not magically resolved." Mr. Dinkins said he would be judged by "how well we treat those who start out in life during my tenure at City Hall," to which Mr. Giuliani said of children, "they are our future." Mr. Dinkins promised to "demand discipline and respect for the law," to which Mr. Giuliani promised to "reverse the trend of ever increasing tolerance to crime."
Under Mr. Dinkins, reported crime dipped and the police force grew, but still New Yorkers apparently believed that the Mayor had insufficiently delivered on his promise to be the toughest mayor against crime.
Independent but inexperienced, Mr. Giuliani was elected without a mandate (though arguably more of one than Mr. Dinkins had). He inherits a vast recurring budget gap that, as the first white to succeed a black mayor of New York, he cannot afford to balance disproportionately on the backs of Mr. Dinkins's constituents. He may have raised the expectations of a disaffected middle class as he inherits a job in which he may only be able to marginally affect their lives.
And he assumes office with the potential to become a prisoner not so much of his own oratory but of his response to perceived political shortcomings -- as Mr. Koch did in devoting enormous resources to housing for the homeless and as Mr Dinkins did, at the expense of his social agenda, by expanding the police force.
Fully one year after Mr. Dinkins was inaugurated, he promised a "new beginning" -- implying that his first beginning had not been good enough. Yesterday, hailing a "city of new beginnings," Mr. Giuliani began in his own way to lay the groundwork for a legacy that, unlike Mr. Dinkins's, he hopes will get him re-elected.

HEADLINE: Experts Predict Financial Market Trends

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
What will be the most significant trend in financial markets in the new year? Several pundits of the business world were called upon to answer the question.Here are their responses.
 
Leo Melamed
Chairman emeritus, Chicago Mercantile Exchange
The spread of financial derivatives will continue to the point where they have taken center stage in the world of finance. That is good news and bad news. It's good news because derivatives add liquidity to markets. But there are risks involved. In the coming year, I think regulators will be wrestling with these issues.
 

Marshall Loeb
Editor, Fortune Magazine
I still think the stock market is the best market around, even though I think we will get a correction at some point in the year. Still, there will be a significant enough rebound that stocks will end 1994 higher than they did in 1993. At some point during the new year the Dow will crack 4,000.
 
James Grant
Editor, Grant's Interest Rate Observer
My favorite idea for the new year is a bull market in commodities: in silver, soybeans, nickel and cotton, among other highly tangible, deeply out-of-favor things. They will go up not because a new great inflation is imminent, (it isn't), but because demand will overwhelm supply.
 
Jeffrey Sachs
Professor of economics, Harvard University, and adviser to governments in a number of developing economies
In general, the incredible explosion of portfolio funds to the emerging markets, while it may not continue at as rapid a pace, is movement that is quite deeply founded. Equity holdings are going to be more broadly diversified. What impresses me is that a number of major countries have barely started the process. The United States has, but the Japanese are far behind. We will see further waves over the next few years.
 
Barton M. Biggs
Chairman, Morgan Stanley Asset Management
There is a 60 percent to 70 percent chance we could see a significant rise in short-term interest rates in the United States. If I am right, and short rates go up by more than half a percent to three-quarters of a percent, the world's liquidity pump will be turned off. That will not only affect American securities prices, but those elsewhere.
 
E. Gerald Corrigan
Chairman, international advisers, Goldman Sachs & Company, and former president, Federal Reserve Bank of New York
The trend toward corporate restructuring is going to continue. That process is quite far advanced in the United States, but in many other countries, including industrial countries, you will see a good deal of this. That will bring with it a great deal of emphasis on financial as well as other forms of restructuring.
It is possible we could see a rise in the demand for private capital this year, particularly in the industrial countries. That increase will not have worrisome consequences in 1994. But especially in the industrial countries, it graphically underscores efforts to get budget deficits down. Perhaps most important, development of capital markets and capital market instruments in many emerging markets will continue at a rapid pace.
 
Elaine Garzarelli
Stock market strategist, Lehman Brothers
I tend to think the economy will slow down and that the Fed will raise interest rates much later than most people think. Stock groups that will do best in the new year are in capital spending, steel, machinery technology and semiconductors. Appliance and auto stocks have another six months to twelve months worth of good performance. And regional banks are extremely inexpensive.
Stay away from nondurable stocks like drugs and tobacco, because earnings growth in those areas will be less than the Standard & Poor's average.
 
Nicholas Brady
Chairman of Darby Advisors, an investment firm, and former Secretary of the Treasury
The trend to global investing is not only the most significant trend for the next year but for the next five years. I think it is at least the equivalent of the industrial revolution.
Those financial markets that understand the enormous change that computers and technology have made and organized their societies to accommodate that change are going to be the winners.
 
Muriel Siebert
Chairman of Muriel Siebert & Company, municipal securities underwriters
We will have an education process begin on derivative securities and how they affect individual investors. Derivative markets are very creative. What they are able to do for individual companies is wonderful. But when you start to create products for Mr. and Mrs. Smith, I worry. If you get enough of this, there will be a necessity to explain these products closely to anyone who is investing.
 
Richard D. Parsons
Chairman, Dime Savings Bank of New York
I am not looking for a zippy rebound in the economy because ultimately you are going to need job creation and everybody is still laying off people. I suspect interest rates may trend up a bit in the first quarter, but if the recovery doesn't gather more steam, they will slump back down.
In the thrift industry, consolidation is going to be the major news. The reason we didn't see more of it in 1993 was that a lot of people were getting their act together financially. By late 1994, the Resolution Trust Corporation will be clearly a part of the past.

HEADLINE: Global Mutual Funds: Expectations Are High

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
International mutual funds, which set the pace among mutual funds last year, are expected to continue their strong performance in 1994. Fueling the trend is a growing awareness among Americans that some diversification overseas is desirable and that many foreign markets offer the potential for returns far higher than what the domestic markets promise.
The big decisions for investors are how much money to allocate overseas and where to put it. Many financial experts now recommend placing at least 25 percent in foreign investments, and investors appear to be moving in that direction. 
 Statistics from the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade association, show that the growth in international equity funds, which invest only abroad, has outpaced that of all other types of stock funds.
"It's been stupendous," said John Collins, a spokesman for the institute. "International funds grew twice as fast as all funds" in 1993.
Some $57.1 billion is now invested in international mutual funds, or 8.7 percent of all the dollars in stock funds. Assets of international stock funds grew by 149 percent in 1993 -- compared with 39 percent for all equity funds.
What is more, there are now 188 international stock funds, 50 more than a year ago. During 1993, a total of $20.95 billion in new money flowed into international funds, or 18.5 percent of the cash flowing into all equity funds.
The reason for all this investor interest is simple: International funds offered vastly superior returns in 1993. Lipper Analytical Services reports that international funds rose in value an average of 38 percent last year.
This compares with an 11 percent return for all general equity funds.
For 1994, international investment experts provide a consensus on where investors should put their international dollars.
The most promising areas are Mexico and the Pacific Rim countries. Most investment experts remain cautious about Japan, hesitant about China and lukewarm about Western Europe.
The emerging markets of Eastern Europe are attractive only on a case-by-case basis, they say, as those countries develop rules on corporate law and private property to protect investors.
Mexico is the shining light. Along with a large number of relatively inexpensive companies, the country has strong growth potential, the prospect of an investment grade rating and the expectation of a reduced inflation rate. In addition, the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement is expected to bring about a strong and steady improvement in the country's economic development.
"We really like Mexico," said Lincoln F. Anderson, director of global research at Fidelity Investments. "The Mexican stock market is moving ahead strongly, and there are a lot of investment opportunities even at current prices."
Investors looking for significant Mexican exposure will find it in the Fidelity Emerging Markets fund, which is 30 percent invested in Latin America.
Gerald Rothstein, a Latin American investment expert at Oppenheimer & Company, sees Mexico as far more attractive than any other country in that region. Not only are the price-earnings ratios of Mexican companies lower than those in other Latin markets, but Mexico also has a larger economy and far more political stability.
Mr. Rothstein cautions that Brazil, despite a strong stock performance in early 1993, has been slow in writing a new constitution and in moving to a stronger, centralized government. And Argentina and Chile, he says, have less political stability and higher-priced companies than Mexico.
Western Europe, with the exception of Britain, is widely seen as bouncing back nicely from a difficult recession and benefiting from falling interest rates. Still, caution seems to be the watchword.
"Western Europe looks fully priced against current corporate earnings," said M. David Testa, chairman of T. Rowe Price International Funds. "But those earnings have been very depressed."
"An upturn in corporate earnings is beginning and that could lead to an economic recovery," he said. "That, with a further decline in interest rates, means you will have another good year in these markets."
Mr. Testa views Britain as a "special case." The recession there has bottomed earlier than in the rest of Europe.
"This means the U.K. isn't as dramatic in its potential as the rest of Europe, but it will be O.K.," he said.
The International Discovery Fund, one of eight international funds at T. Rowe Price, is 34 percent invested in Europe. The European weighting of its International Stock fund is 50 percent and its European Stock Fund is devoted exclusively to the region.
Fidelity's Mr. Anderson suggests that investors interested in Europe consider European bonds.
"I like the European bond market a lot," said Mr. Anderson.
He finds that bond yields in Europe of six to seven percent are outpacing inflation by at least a percentage point or two.
"Some of these bonds have been on a tear," said Mr. Anderson. "There's potential for big returns and a lot of room for that."
Still attracting a lot of investor interest are the Pacific Rim markets of Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Indonesia -- the so-called Tigers.
In that region, the main area of concern is Japan, where no one recommends increasing any holdings.
And China remains questionnable pending further political developments.
"I'm bullish on the Asian markets," said Barton Biggs, a managing director at Morgan Stanley.
Like all the analysts interviewed, he emphasized that his comments referred only to the Pacific Rim and not to Japan and China.
"This is a region of tremendous economic growth," he added.
As for Japan, he said, "my view is just the opposite."
"It's still overpriced and not very attractive," he said.
Gunter Ecklebe, director of International Asset Consulting at Frank Russell Company, in Tacoma, Wash., said that among the Pacific Rim countries "there's hardly a market that we should not mention for its investment potential.
"Southeast Asia is just a great market," said Mr. Ecklebe. "It has low wages, a good educational background and great economic potential. It produces goods cheaply and of high quality, and that makes it a formidable competitor. And these markets are fairly priced."
Japan, conversely, is still suffering, and its financial markets may not have bottomed out.
While a diversified international portfolio cannot ignore Japan, most experts recommend holding -- not buying and not selling -- until the struggling Japanese market begins to find some direction.
China is seen as having tremendous investment potential, but there are serious concerns about its political stability. Until China displays a clear commitment to private property rights and a protection for foreign investors, investment analysts recommend steering clear.
"I won't be enthusiastic until we see further economic and political liberalization and until there is the development of serious contract law and property rights," Mr. Anderson of Fidelity said.
As for the former Soviet Union, investment analysts see little potential in Russia for American investors because its markets are still so primitive and the political situation is still so unstable. The markets in the former Soviet bloc countries of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are relatively small, mired in problems and offer only spotty opportunities.
"There are investment opportunities there," said Mr. Ecklebe of Frank Russell. "But it comes on a rifle-shot basis, and one still has to take into account the potential for further political instability."

HEADLINE: ...While a Sluggish Japan Sighs Amid Asia's Roaring Tigers: China;
Slower Growth, Still Spectacular

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
Through 5,000 years of history, the Chinese have believed that great catastrophes presage the passing of an emperor and the ushering in of a new dynasty.
So it was said in 1976 that the great Tongshan earthquake, which killed a quarter million Chinese with a single shrug of the earth on July 28 of that year, presaged the death of Mao Zedong on Sept. 10. 
 The current emperor, Deng Xiaoping, who succeeded Mao after a brief transition, is said to be terminally ill at 89. And though Mr. Deng has tried, as Mao did, to control the shape of the succession, almost no one in China believes the succession arrangements will hold.
For 1994, the business outlook in China cannot be separated from the political outlook. If 1993 was the year of "maximum bullish" on China, as one investment banker said last fall, 1994 will be the year of "maximum uncertain."
Although, China's economy is expected to continue its boom, driven by social forces and foreign investment that were unleashed more than a decade ago, great seismic shocks could be lurking just over the horizon.
Government economists say gross domestic product, after inflation, will slow to 10 percent from 13 percent last year, dragged down by bottlenecks in transportation and a shortage of credit. By any measure, that is a booming economy, and many economists are worried that another round of spiraling inflation -- exceeding 20 percent in urban areas -- is ahead, proving that the only truism about China's economy is its frightening fluctuations.
Also consider:
*The expected death of Mr. Deng would be likely to have wholly unpredictable consequences for 1.18 billion Chinese. Would students flood the streets to resume the quest for democratic reform they mounted unsuccessfully in 1989? Would the Government invoke martial law? Or would the conflicts that still exist in the Chinese leadership over style and substance simmer for months, even years, before they are resolved by palace intrigue, purges or a coup d'etat?
*Will the Clinton Administration and China collide in a spectacular "train wreck" in 1994? Winston Lord, an Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs,warned this month that if Washington could not convince Beijing that "significant, overall progress" must be made in human rights before June, Mr. Clinton would revoke China's most-favored-nation trade status. That would have a big impact on the economies of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
*Will the crisis over North Korea's nuclear program develop toward the least desired outcome: the Clinton Administration, acting with its allies, uses military force. Whether China could sit out a new Korean conflict is a question that even China's leaders may not be able to answer, but the pressure from China's military would be enormous.
The nature of risk analysis is that all things do not come to pass.
Thus, the only thing certain about China fever is that 1994 will witness even greater numbers of investors stampeding toward the Middle Kingdom, despite the uncertainty. PATRICK E. TYLER

HEADLINE: Russia and Europe Confront Challenges to Jobs and Growth . . . : Russia;
Economic Change At a Crossroad

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Europe, battered by recession, expects 1.5 percent growth in 1994. Japan is still mired in economic woes, though there is some talk of a rebound. China, whose growth in the last year has been in the mid-teens, could experience a slowdown -- to merely spectacular 10 percent growth. Then there is Russia, which must balance international calls for austerity with domestic politics and slow- or fast-paced privatization. From around the world, correspondents of The New York Times assess local economies.
After a clear look at the dark underside of Russian nationalism, manifested by the spectacular vote for Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky in last month's elections, Westerners must regard Russia as one of the world's great crap shoots. 
 The West and its fiduciary agent, the International Monetary Fund, had high hopes for a resounding victory by the Westernized economic reformers who dominated the Russia's Choice party, led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar.
A reformist majority in the new parliament, they thought, would provide the political mandate for a sweeping economic program. They were wrong.
There are many reasons that almost half of Russia's voters did not vote, as there are for the fury of those who voted for Mr. Zhirinovsky and the Communists. But there is no denying that a large majority voted against what they understood to be the kind of economic reform advocated by Russia's Choice and the West.
Such a vote will make an I.M.F. austerity program, which would result in large increases in unemployment, almost impossible politically.
So Russia enters the new year at a crossroad. To listen to the voters too avidly would mean gutting economic change and bring about even higher inflation and instability, further fertilizing the ground for fascism, Mr. Gaidar argues.
So he is relying on President Boris N. Yeltsin, who consciously remained above the fray, to ignore the voters and follow the usual Russian route to reform: from on high, by decree.
But it is likely that Mr. Yeltsin will continue to fudge, to steer a sloppy, compromising course between irreconcilable concepts of how the Russian economy should be managed. That might not insure disaster, but it could mean more of the same, only with higher inflation, as Russia muddles through.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the non-Government reform economist, suggests an alternative: faster privatization to break up monopolies and produce competition, combined with less worry about fighting inflation. Mr. Gaidar counters that "to talk about a softer anti-inflation policy when inflation remains at 15 percent a month is professionally senseless."
The economic reformers in the pre-election Government, led by Mr. Gaidar and Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, were never dominant. In fact, economic reform in Russia has little deserved the "shock therapy" label. Diplomats have started calling it "bulimic" instead, because sharp doses of reform are followed by long periods of chaos, inactivity and bureaucratic paralysis. Inflation ran at 20 percent a month, with a drop to 15 percent in November.
That drop, intended to encourage the I.M.F to pony up an additional $1.5 billion in special transition loans to cover the budget deficit, was created through a simple refusal to pay Government obligations, including salaries, to miners, farmers, soldiers and others. So Russia will begin the year with a sizable bill -- some 5 trillion rubles, or $4 billion, -- in deferred payments. That is nearly 10 percent of G.N.P., which will push inflation up again no matter what decisions any new Government makes. STEVEN ERLANGER

Transcript of Inaugural Speech: Giuliani Urges Change and Unity

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's inaugural speech at City Hall yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
Rabbi Sherer, Cardinal O'Connor, Rev. Charles Mixon, who are offering prayers today at this inauguration. Each of them reminds us not just with the prayers that they offer but with the example of their lives, of the centrality of God to our city. I thank them very much for being here. 
 I also thank them because I think this is the group of people to whom we should offer thanks for the wonderful weather. The rabbi, the Cardinal and Reverend, I think, are responsible for the beautiful weather that we have.
Mayor Dinkins, I salute your accomplishment for our city. Mayor Dinkins's special dignity and grace will also mark his governance of our city and it's something that we hope to call on in the future. And I know that we can and that we can count on it.
Governor Cuomo, I appreciate the help that you have already given us in putting together our administration and the spirit of cooperation which means so much not only to me but to the people of the city.
Speaker Peter Vallone, I congratulate you on having developed the City Council into such a respected and effective legislative body. And I look forward to our partnership and friendship with you and the other members of the City Council in working together for our city.
Senator Moynihan, I appreciate the advice and the help that you have also already given me and your very special perspective particularly on the problems that this city faces today. And I look forward to working with you.
 
More Hope and Optimism
 To Mark Green and to Alan Hevesi, I offer my congratulations to you and to your wonderful families. I look forward to working with you in government as partners, all three of us committed to working hard, to creating more hope and more optimism, a much better city for all of the people of the city. Congratulations.
Mayor Abe Beame, you honor us with your presence here today.
Mayor Koch, eight years ago when I came to your inauguration here, you had Peter Powers and I in the back row. And we've kind of moved up now. Peter's here, I'm here. Donna and I are very much in your debt for all of the advice and counsel that you've given us, including the personal advice. That at a difficult time like this when you're transitioning to a whole new way of life, you've been a very, very good friend. Not to mention the terrific commercial that you did.
Many of you here are responsible for electing me Mayor. All of you here will be responsible for the success of our city. So just one or two special acknowledgments. To my wife, Donna, my partner, my inspiration and my lover. Donna is one of three people I believe most responsible for my standing here along with my friends, Peter Powers and David Garth. And I welcome them here today.
To Andrew Giuliani, who's now taken the oath three times also, and Caroline Giuliani, thank you, for the perspective you give me and for showing me how much I can really love. To my mother, Helen, who is 84 years old, thank you for giving me the gifts of thirsting for knowledge and of values. And to my father, Harold, who isn't here -- and I wish he was -- but I believe that he is, for giving me the gift of vision that problems shouldn't get you down but that they should become challenges to do better and to work harder. And to Donna's parents, Bob and Gwen Kovanec. Thank you so much for all your love and all your caring.
 
Poised for Dramatic Change
 Distinguished public servants, members of the clergy, good friends, fellow New Yorkers one and all. Time brings all things to pass. And with the spirit of my administration, New York City is poised for dramatic change. The era of fear has had a long enough reign. The period of doubt has run its course. As of this moment, the expressions of cynicism -- New York is not governable, New York is not manageable, New York is not worth it -- all of these I declare politically incorrect. Let's not use them anymore.
On this day of new beginning, I give you my solemn pledge to summon our courage, to raise our hopes and to build our confidence. My grandfather, Rodolfo, came to New York almost 100 years ago. He came here with $20 in his pockets. Like so many of you and your ancestors, he knew fear -- fear of a strange land, fear of learning to speak a new language, fear of the unknown. But he didn't let that stop him. He dreamed that life could be better for him and his children in New York City and he lived that dream.
Now it's time for us to convince the cynics that the fear, the doubts and the cynicisms are over with. Dream with me of a city that can be better than the way it is now. Believe with me that our problems can be reduced, not magically resolved. Plan with me to make the realistic changes that will actually make people's lives better than they are right now, and work hard with me to apply these plans to improve our city. Dream, believe, plan and work. This is the foundation for the process of change.
I ask you to give me a chance to make change happen for us. Don't let those who are so fearful of transformation stop the process before it begins. Killing ideas by fear. We don't need to be fearful.
Despite the tough and difficult steps that I must take to remove our structural budget deficit, and be sure that I will take them, still we can dream about and believe in and plan and work for an improved economy built on New York City's magnets. Those magnets draw more people to this city than any city in the world and they'll be the basis for the renewal of our economy and the renewal of our city.
Look anew at our cultural institutions, artistic institutions, fashion institutions -- they're not only part of the heart and soul of this city but also they are important industries that will and must grow to create more jobs for us.
Look anew at Broadway, the opera, the ballet, the museums and the fashion industry as powerful magnets drawing people and commerce to our city. We must expand them all. We must build our future on institutions like this. And as they grow, more New Yorkers will go back to work and have jobs. It should be so and it will be so.
New York City has the very best health-care institutions in America. But we're not thought of and promoted as America's health-care capital. It should be so and it will be so.
We're the home of over 100 institutions of higher learning in every field. We have some of the greatest schools in the world here in New York City. People come here from all over the world to be educated in our schools. Yet we don't think of New York as a college and university town. It should be so and it will be so.
We've never effectively utilized our unique position as the home of the United Nations. The politics of the cold war and strong disagreements over past policies prevented it. But that's behind us now. That's the past. It's time to enhance our relationship with the United Nations and to build on it. Think of this: Albany, the capital of New York State. Washington, D.C., the capital of the nation. And New York City will again be the capital of the world.
Andrew had this right. It should be so and it will be so.
 
Source of Great Strength
 As Mayor of this city, I can reach out to every part of the world and my message is a clear one: If you come here to live, if you do business here, if you visit here, you can find people who speak your language, even your dialect. You can find people who share your religion. You can find people who care about and treasure your culture and tradition. This is the source of great strength for us, that we can utilize even more for this city to grow and to prosper. Today, we extend our hand in friendship to all. It's extended in friendship and in love, to New Yorkers of every race, religion, ethnic background, gender or sexual orientation.
I know your diversity. I respect it. I see it as the source of our strength. But mostly I see us as New Yorkers sharing common interests and common bonds. Each one of you has an equal claim on me to apply one standard of fairness -- to work hard and to persevere to reduce the city's problems.
Each of us also has a claim on each other to look beyond our perceived differences to see our more important similarities. All of us sharing in this time and in this place, our opportunity to build a better and a greater New York.
I'm confident today. I know something about you as New Yorkers that maybe you don't appreciate enough about yourselves. I know how strong, how daring, how intelligent and how hard working you, the people of New York City, really are. Nothing is beyond our grasp.
Your strength was demonstrated within sight of this place. Last year, at the World Trade Center, six lives were tragically lost in the bombing. But not one life lost because of the evacuation. It was a day in which 50,000 New Yorkers took charge of themselves and each other, showing on their own even before any city worker could help them that New Yorkers of the 1990's, all of you, have the same ingenuity, the same sensitivity, the same talent, the same courage that our ancestors had that built this great city. We have it. Let's use it.
And when the firefighters, the police officers, Emergency Service workers, the doctors, the nurses and others arrived to provide assistance, they carried on the evacuation begun by New Yorkers on their own, showing that those who work for our city are truly the best in the nation.
What we witnessed was a clear demonstration of the spirit that permeates New York City. When things are bad, when times are tough, New Yorkers prove they are better and tougher.
The New York spirit that brought us through the World Trade Center crisis, including putting it back in operation so quickly against all odds, was a demonstration of the courage and ingenuity that we must now apply to restoring public safety, saving our schools, creating jobs, controlling our budget deficit and, most importantly, improving the quality of our lives.
All of these things and more are priorities for my administration. But beyond the policies and the legislation and the budget readjustment and government redefining, it's to an even deeper spirit that we now call. It's a call to the innermost spirit of New York, which says: our problems may be big, but our people are bigger.
As my father taught me, problems are challenges to do better and we will do better.
In that spirit, New York City is once again beginning to set the agenda. Rather than having to look elsewhere for innovation, we now hopefully can look to New York City. And we've only just begun.
Our city has never had as bipartisan a government as we have put together. Democrats and Republicans are working as one at the highest levels of city government. As our people who voted for me and people who voted against me and people of all different backgrounds, they were chosen on a simple belief that they were the best people to carry out the jobs for which we selected them.
Our approach to gun licensing has already been cited approvingly by the President and the Attorney General. The Governor and I are in agreement on many measures that are needed to reduce violent crime. And consensus is developing around reducing the hotel-occupancy tax as a way to boost the economy and to create jobs.
What it's all about is New York City -- all five boroughs -- again becoming the center for innovation and change. We're in this together. That's why we need Staten Island to stay with us, Guy Molinari.
Give me a chance to show you how a city government interested in Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx as much as Manhattan can make a difference in your lives. Change in many forms is coming to our city. But it must be built around respect for the law and justice. American cities can't survive as we know them if they remain so violent. Our priority must be to reduce the violence.
I'll place a much greater emphasis on stricter enforcement of the law to reverse the growing trend of ever-increasing tolerance for lawless behavior. I'll work for changes in policing and in criminal justice that will redress the balance that I believe is now out of balance. Guns, the handguns, will be a particular source of our efforts.
If we have, in the words of Senator Moynihan, defined deviancy down, now we will instead raise standards and have greater expectations for the behavior of or people.
But just as much has to be done about the underlying causes of crime. This will be as important a part of my administration as respect for the law.
We must give the hopeless reason to hope again, particularly the children. Each child is important to us because they are our future.
Our school system and our social programs must be made more effective so that we can once again offer the realistic possibility of life improving for all of us. The greatest measure of our own decency is the help we give to those most in need. But the help we give must be realistic and we must have the courage to face our failures, not repeat our mistakes, because our mistakes are costing people their lives and their future.
As we step into the future, the indomitable spirit of La Guardia will infuse our city. The common sense approach of Ed Koch will echo again.
I ask of you -- I ask of you what I demand of myself -- greet tomorrow with a determined capacity to overcome any problem. Dream, believe, plan and work with me. In doing so, we'll remove the grip of unwelcome legacies and provide an administration of new beginnings. Our success is critical not only to ourselves but to the state and the nation. It is in our common interest to work together, to emerge successfully.
On the second day of January of 1994, I dedicate my administration to you, the people of New York City.
May God bless each one of us as we prepare to give our children a stronger and a healthier city. It should be so and it will be so.
Thank you.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Dares to Hope for More

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
It was Wall Street's first $1 trillion year. And the good times may keep on rolling in 1994.
As interest rates fell last year, businesses jumped to refinance their debts and to raise new equity capital on the surging stock market, issuing a record $1.06 trillion in stocks and bonds, up 21 percent from 1992. 
 Not surprisingly, combined profits for Wall Street firms increased to a record $9 billion, buoyed by underwriting fees, a surge in individuals' stock-market investing, and the rise in the bond market, which led to the record trading profits.
And Wall Street thought that business had reached a peak in 1992.
"Nineteen ninety-three was much better than was expected," said Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley & Company. "The surprising part of it was that some of the trends of 1992 that looked like they were running their course actually continued."
With interest rates expected to rise somewhat in 1994 and the increasing chance of a stock-market correction, the Street may not be as lucrative this year as in the last two years, slowing the retail brokerage and underwriting businesses.
But Wall Street is optimistic that as the economy picks up, corporations will need to borrow more to grow, keeping the underwriting business brisk. And having squeezed all the fat they can to prop up their bottom lines, corporations may now turn to acquisitions, rather than layoffs and cost-cutting, to spur growth -- meaning that investment-banking services may be in greater demand.
"The only worry is too much stability," Mr. Fisher said. "And with this world, that's not a problem."
Last year's erroneously gloomy predictions, in fact, helped profits by keeping brokerage firms from falling into the bull-market trap of hiring extra brokers and traders. "The retail firms have been bringing in brokers to fill up empty spaces, but they haven't been adding overhead," said Allison Deans, a brokerage-company analyst with Smith Barney Shearson.
The only sour note for Wall Street was the quiet revenge of the hapless American homeowner. Mortgage-backed securities traders had built computer models that assumed that many people would be too lazy to refinance their home mortgages as rates dropped. But as consumers last year got wise and refinanced in record numbers, the models went awry and many trading firms lost millions of dollars from early repayment of old, higher interest-rate mortgages. The usually savvy Salomon Brothers posted unusually large trading losses in two quarters, reportedly because of mortgage trading.
But other bond traders and currency traders had virtually ideal conditions as interest rates continued to fall in the United States and Europe. Financing was cheap.
"There is nothing like the combination of a bull market and a steep yield curve for making money in bond trading," Mr. Fisher said.
The latest financial fad -- derivatives -- became even more important to Wall Street last year, despite increasing scrutiny by Government regulators. Now, Mr. Fisher said, a third of the trading revenue at big firms like Morgan Stanley comes from derivative instruments, the value of which is linked to the prices of stocks, bonds or currencies, rather than from trading those underlying instruments themselves.
Some American companies last year set out on new merger and acquisition crusades, although their conquests were not so great as in the late 80's. The biggest deals were in the suddenly converging fields of entertainment, media, telecommunications and cable television. There were also more mergers in health care and banking, two spread-out industries in which companies are consolidating. Goldman, Sachs remained the No. 1 merger adviser, followed by Morgan Stanley. These trends are expected to accelerate this year.
Much of the most profitable business for American securities firms came overseas. Not only did they profit from the volatile European currency and bond markets, but firms took the lead in funneling capital from the United States and other mature economies into developing markets of Latin American and Asia. At the same time, Japanese and European financial firms have been slowed by problems at home.
"The cross-border flows of capital are increasing at an incredible rate," Mr. Fisher said, "and the U.S. firms are best positioned to take advantage of that."
Overseas, the favorable trends may well continue because rates in Europe are expected to fall further and developing countries are likely to privatize more of their state-owned companies.

The Triumph of the Bulls Continues

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
ON Wall Street, it has been the best of worlds. Inflation seems all but dead, and the public is pouring money into stocks and bonds -- mostly through mutual funds whose managers can hardly believe their good fortune. New securities are being sold almost as fast as the printing presses can run them off, and even corporate takeover activity is up.
As 1993 ended, records were set almost everywhere. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 each reached new highs last week, and so did stock markets in Mexico and Canada, virtually every major European country, and such other markets as Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and Brazil. With the singular exception of Japan, stock market bulls are triumphant almost everywhere, regardless of whether the local economy is strong or weak. 
 Can things possibly remain this good?
Probably not forever, but perhaps the least likely market catastrophe in 1994 is the one that has attracted the most speculative attention: A market meltdown as inexperienced mutual fund investors panic at the first signs of weakness and head for the exits all at once. A bear market no doubt will arrive someday, but the chances are that mutual fund money will run off slowly, not rapidly. Since the market recovered from the 1987 crash, mutual fund investors have tended to view price drops as buying opportunities.
The optimistic scenario for the American market this year runs as follows: Growth in the economy is picking up, and will continue to do so, but not enough to cause inflation concerns or make the Federal Reserve think about tightening credit. That will lift earnings of many companies that depend on American business, and earnings of exporters will rally later in the year as growth starts to accelerate in Europe. Higher taxes on upper-income Americans, which show up in withholding for the first time this week, will lower the deficit and help keep interest rates down, without damaging the economy. And investors will ignore indications of overvaluation, like the dividend yield on the S.&P. 500 of 2.7 percent, almost as low as it was at the 1987 peak.
It could come to pass.
If there is one part of the scenario that is most widely accepted -- and that contrarian investors therefore might want to question -- it is that inflation will stay quiescent. Final figures on last year's inflation will not be available until later this month, but they are expected to show that consumer prices rose barely 2 percent, while producer price inflation was well under 1 percent.
It is common to forecast a small increase from those figures, but not much. After all, as Richard Hoey, the chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation, pointed out, labor costs are not moving up. "There are not a lot of people seeing wage inflation," he said, "other than among the underwriters on Wall Street." And there are not enough of them to have much real impact on the system.
In the last big inflationary surge, during the 1970's, raw material prices skyrocketed amid talk of shortages. Now, the conventional wisdom is that such rises are all but impossible, because developing countries can step up production of almost any resource, if needed. Asked about a possible revival of inflation, the head of one of Wall Street's biggest firms dismissed the question with the same respect he might have given to a query about unidentified flying objects.
But there are signs that commodity inflation may be returning. A number of agricultural crops rose nicely last year, with corn prices up 41 percent. And gold, after topping $400 an ounce amid wide publicity in the summer, fell back and was largely ignored for the rest of the year. But it recovered, ending the year above $390. And while oil prices plunged, those of natural gas rose.
To be sure, one can explain such moves in other ways. The midwest floods affected agricultural harvests, and Morgan Stanley's Byron Wien, who forecasts higher gold prices, says that reflects demand from newly rich people, especially in China, not the fear of inflation in the developed countries. But the signs are there, nonetheless.
There are excesses in the American stock market, particularly in the new issue area, but they pale next to some foreign markets. Hong Kong, which more than doubled last year, has a chart that looks like "one side of the Eiffel Tower," said Greg Smith, the chief strategist for Prudential Securities. He is bearish on Hong Kong.
Fidelity Emerging Markets, a mutual fund that invests in developing countries, began the year with almost $15 million in assets. As the year ended, the figure was $1.8 billion. Those few investors with money in throughout the year had a gain of 79.5 percent.
As it happened, the foreign success stories may have hurt the performance of American stocks, especially small ones, late in 1993. With a heavy calendar of new initial public offerings, that area of the market needed a good inflow of money just to stay even. And it did not manage to do much better than that in the fourth quarter. The average aggressive growth mutual fund suffered a small loss in the quarter. The year's most heralded initial public offering, a fast-food chain called Boston Chicken, was offered in November at $20 and traded at $51 the first day. But that was it. It ended the year at $36, a nice profit if you got in on the offering, but probably a loss if you bought in the public market.
Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter some funds that invest mainly in Asian countries other than Japan were posting 40 percent gains. Those that invested in Japan, on the other hand, did poorly in the quarter, posting losses of up to 25 percent as the Japanese market faltered.
Overall, the story of mutual funds in 1993 was of dollars cascading through the doors, demanding to be invested. For the first 11 months, a net $221 million was invested in stock and bond funds, and their total assets, after adding in performance, were up 33 percent to $1.4 trillion. In general, stock funds grew faster than bond funds, and foreign stock funds did best of all. Funds that invest mainly in Treasury bonds, however, had a small drop in assets late in the year.

HEADLINE: In Year That Promises Difficulty, Usual Investing Rules Apply

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
One portfolio manager, no youngster himself, calls the bull market "long in the tooth." Another pro describes stocks as "somewhat expensive." Some others say flat-out that the unprecedented recent stability in the American stock market is likely to give way to a skid, albeit a short-lived one, in 1994.
Such distinctions aside, people who buy and sell equities for mutual funds -- including a few fearless bulls -- are in broad agreement: making money for investors will be more difficult this year. 
 "It's going to be a tough environment out there," contended John B. Neff, manager of the $10.5 billion Windsor Fund, which posted a gain of almost twice the 15 percent shown by the Standard & Poor's 500 for the 12 months that ended in October. In fact, the equity investor might fail, in the aggregate, to see any profit at all, Mr. Neff said.
It is well recognized that markets have a way of doing what is needed to prove the consensus wrong and that the much-predicted disaster rarely occurs. Lord Keynes, a speculator as well as a theorist and a policy maker, put it this way: "The inevitable never happens. It is the unexpected always."
Yet there are constants in the investment world. One is that an intelligent strategy, over an extended period, beats whim, luck and attempts to "time" market turns. Another is that stocks beat bonds over the long haul. And, third, that diversification pays.
Then the intelligent thing to do in 1994, as perhaps every year, may be to buy some mutual funds that invest in stocks, preferably committing a predetermined amount of money every month or quarter. This decision made, bring your best judgment -- and those of experts -- to bear.
One after another, portfolio managers consulted in late December pointed out that there had been no correction, or substantial decline, in American stock markets for more than three years, an extraordinary stretch. A correction is typically defined as a setback of at least 10 percent, though 7 percent qualifies in the view of some analysts. In fact, 1993 was the least volatile year on record for American stocks, and 1992 was second, said Robert C. Doll, director of equity investments at the Oppenheimer Management Corporation.
It's not hard to imagine a day when, in retrospect, it will seem obvious that the market was heading for a tumble. The Dow Jones industrial average has been bid up to 37 times earnings, while yields have been driven down to a paltry 2.7 percent -- before taxes and inflation.
"It's no time to be overly aggressive," said Thomas Medcalf, senior portfolio manager at IDS Mutual, a $3 billion fund based in Minneapolis that invests mainly in stocks. "Everybody is twitching and nervous nowadays," he said. "You want to be in a fund that has a kind of conservative approach."
To many people, conservative means stocks of established companies that sell at relatively low earnings multiples and pay above-average dividends as a cushion against market drops. These shares may well be in industries that have fallen out of favor or they may be cyclical stocks whose prices do not reflect a developing recovery.
Frank M. Felicelli, executive and portfolio manager for the Franklin-Templeton Group in San Mateo, Calif., is a prominent exponent of this approach, called value investing. He seeks to buy stocks of sizable companies that have fallen out of favor and have high yields. This "bottom up" approach is not unlike the mechanistic one used successfully by professionals who simply buy the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average at the end of the year.
In the last year, gains for "value" stocks averaged four times those for "growth" stocks, which tend to offer skimpy yields but long-term gains.
Not everyone falls in the value camp. One committed advocate of growth is Jeff Cardon of Wasatch Advisors Inc. in Salt Lake City. "If you're a little bit worried about the economy, buy earnings growth and grow with these companies," he suggested.
Whichever strategy one seeks in domestic equity funds, there is considerable agreement among fund managers -- though it is not unanimous -- about factors to keep in mind as 1994 unfolds.
UTILITIES If the Federal Reserve moves to raise interest rates, utility stocks will almost certainty suffer. Utilities are big borrowers, and their stocks have been bought heavily by savers fleeing low bank yields, who may panic to discover that stocks can go down.
 Although they dominate utility funds, these stocks frequently appear in income-oriented and asset-allocation funds as well. Among the specialty funds, the Pilgrim Corporate Utilities fund was clobbered in 1993 by illiquid preferred shares of a sick savings and loan. The fund was the poorest performer in an otherwise illustrious group.
BANKS Banks and other financial stocks could also suffer from higher rates. Their profits depend most heavily, however, on the spread between their cost of gathering money and the rate at which they lend. Mr. Neff, who made a $450 million commitment to regional banks in the autumn, predicted that any narrowing of that spread would be more than made up by increased fees, rising loan demand and cost containment. He particularly likes the Golden West Financial Corporation, of Oakland. Many others, however, see financial stocks as underperformers.
HEALTH CARE Investment in the health-care sector should be kept to a minimum, a majority of analysts say, at least until an outline of a legislative overhaul emerges. Yet this battered group of stocks could rebound smartly if legislators decide that swift election-year change is preferable to comprehensive action later.
ENERGY This is another murky area, particularly the prospects for oil. While economic activity, still the dominant influence on demand, has picked up markedly in the United States, much of Europe and Japan remain becalmed, and a return of Iraq to the world oil market could sink prices further.
TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS Many managers still look favorably on this wildly diverse group, which includes semiconductors (up 42 percent in 1993) and biotechnology (down 12 percent) despite an increasing number of stratospheric price-earnings ratios. M. David Testa, head of the equity division at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said telecommunications and semiconductors continued to enjoy strong demand. His Growth Stock Fund lists Intel and General Electric as two of its top three holdings. Other analysts remain enthusiastic about A.T.& T. and MCI Communications, expecting their profit margins to benefit from declining costs for access to regional carriers.
Finally, if you have broad horizons but suspect that many foreign markets have become dangerously frothy, a sensible way to anticipate economic growth overseas is to load up on funds with internationally oriented American issues. "I believe the funds that own companies with a lot of capability in worldwide distribution are going to do very well," declared Russell E. Thompson, an optimistic senior vice president and portfolio manager for Waddell & Reed, a fund company in Shawnee Mission, Kan.
Whatever the market climate in the year ahead, funds that invest in stocks are likely to keep proliferating and gaining in appeal.
A market break, of course, could dampen enthusiasm. The year after the October 1987 crash, investors redeemed more shares than they bought. Matthew P. Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, the industry's chief trade association, expressed little concern that holders of stock funds would panic after a decline and force portfolio managers to dump stocks.
Contending that the bulk of novice investors had bought bonds during their run-up in the last few years, he said he saw the possibility of panic selling as "more of a problem on the debt-fund side."

Contrarians Take Heart

 BODY:

The optimistic scenario is this: Growth in the economy is picking up, but not enough to cause inflation concerns or make the Federal Reserve think about tightening credit. That will boost earnings of many companies that depend on American business, and earnings of exporters will rally later in the year as growth starts to accelerate in Europe. With interest rates remaining low, investors will keep on chasing stocks, raising share prices. Sounds great. But, the contrarian asks, what if inflation isn't quiescent? By Floyd Norris. C25
 
 
Americans Gallop to the Bourses
 There was a time -- and not that long ago, really -- when the typical American investor gave little thought to investing abroad. No more, though. International mutual funds, which set the pace among funds last year, are expected to continue their torrid pace in 1994. Yield-hungry American investors have figured out that markets overseas are likely to outpace those at home. Some financial advisers are even suggesting that as much as 25 percent of an individual's portfolio should be in foreign investments. Favorite ports: Mexico, the Pacific Rim countries. But most investment experts remain cautious about Japan and its sluggish economy, hestitant about China because of uncertainty about political stability and property rights and lukewarm about Western Europe. The emerging markets of Eastern Europe are attractive only on a case-by-case basis as countries develop rules on corporate law and private property to protect investors. Russia is regarded as still too questionable to offer investment opportunities. By Leslie Wayne. C28
 
 
The Seers' Picks
 Time for Wall Street crystal ball gazing. Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley sees a 60 to 70 percent chance that short-term interest rates will rise in 1994. Elaine Garzarelli, right, of Lehman Brothers says regional bank stocks are a bargain. E. Gerald Corrigan, formerly New York Fed chairman and now with Goldman Sachs, predicts corporate restructuring will continue, particularly outside the United States. Nicholas Brady of Darby Advisors and former Treasury Secretary, believes the boom in foreign stocks is good for another five years. Richard Parsons of the Dime Savings Bank sees thrift consolidation accelerating, pushing the R.T.C. to the brink of history by yearend. C30

The New Strategy: Take Risks, Think Globally

 BODY:

Trade Is the New Global Diplomacy
The policy is known as economic security, defined as harnessing America's diplomacy to the creation of jobs and turning a blind eye to certain things, like wars. One in six Boeing airplanes is now bought by China. Bosnia and Somalia don't buy many semiconductors. So the Clinton Administration's focus is shifting southward to Mexico now that the North American Free Trade Agreement is in place and eastward to the Pacific, through a summit meeting of the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. This trend will continue in 1994, pushing the ascendency of trade interests in global diplomacy. What used to be called North-South trade, and might now be better termed inter-developmental symbiosis, has become the crucial issue for growth. The symbiosis is between the cheap labor and fast-growing markets of the "South" and the technology and new job-creating exports of the "North." In foreign policy terms, it means less attention for traditional partners like NATO and more for the developing nations that can create jobs and wealth in America. By Roger Cohen. C3
 
 
One World, One Consumer
 Alfred M. Zeien, Gilette's chairman, learned a seminal lesson during his years abroad for the company -- shoppers in Caracas or Bangkok want the same merchandise as those in Chicago or Boston. Acting on this insight after he landed Gillette's top job, Mr. Zeien has transformed the company from a multinational corporation into a global one. The difference: While multinationals spend millions to alter products to suit the tastes of different countries, global companies try to sell the same razor or coffee maker to everyone. Global marketing works often enough these days at Gilette and elsewhere to have come of age, changing the criteria for top executives. By Louis Uchitelle. C3
 
 
Business Be Nimble; Business Be Quick
 Forging a global business strategy isn't easy, as companies large and small are learning. The winners constantly adapt and innovate, both to change internally and to grab new customers. For example, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Zurich-based industrial giant that operates 1,300 companies in 140 countries, overcame recession in Western Europe by using its global reach to shift into Asia and Eastern Europe. For years Latin American companies hid behind tariff barriers and took consumers for granted. But economic growth and low inflation led Bunge & Born S.A., South America's largest consumer products company, to focus on consumers by selling businesses and concentrating on a handful of industries. The common thread? Be nimble and take nothing for granted. C4&5
 
 
At Home, Forecasters' Cheer
 Five economists daring enough to climb out on a 1994 limb have assessed the prospects for growth, employment, inflation and interest rates and find themselves huddled together for warmth. Their real gross domestic product forecasts range from 2.8 percent to 3.7 percent; unemployment by year's end from 6.0 percent to 6.5 percent; inflation from 1.9 percent to 3.3 percent; the yearend rate on the 30-year Treasury bond from 5.9 percent to 6.6 percent.

Strong Growth Draws Investors

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
In a sluggish world economy, Latin America is expected to maintain its position in 1994 as the fastest-growing region after Southeast Asia.
Building on three years of economic growth of more than 3 percent, Latin America is expected to grow by 3.5 percent this year. 
 The 1980's, Latin America's lost decade, is quickly fading into memory. Foreign debt payments have been rescheduled, easing a crisis. And government privatizations and budget austerity -- except in Brazil -- have reduced the region's inflation rate to 16 percent from 700 percent in 1990. Single-digit inflation is expected this year for several major economies: Argentina, Chile and Mexico.
All this is good news for United States investors and exporters.
So far this decade, 70 percent of all new United States foreign investment has gone to Latin American and the Caribbean, according to the World Bank. Of all international foreign investment in 1993, 60 percent went to China, Malaysia, Thailand, Mexico and Argentina, the bank reported in December.
Latin America has also emerged as the fastest-growing area in the world for American exports. Stock markets in the region were strong last year. Brazil's surged to a record. In Argentina share prices advanced in the last quarter but were still below the peak reached in May 1992.
The United States trade surplus with Latin America should continue in 1994 as many South American economies are expected to grow in the range of 4 percent to 5 percent: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Paraguay.
"My concerns are a slowdown of Latin exports and less competitive exchange rates," Sebastian Edwards, the World Bank's chief economist for Latin America, said. "Regional trade has increased dramatically, but demand for Latin products in the industrialized world is not very strong."
Venezuela, the region's nation most dependent on oil exports, is expected to experience low growth and high inflation if oil prices continue to fall, as predicted.
As usual, Latin America's wild card is Brazil, a huge nation that accounts for one-third of the region's economic activity.
Flying in the face of regional trends, Brazil's foundering Government presided over an inflation rate of 2,500 percent in 1993. Despite monthly inflation of 32 percent, Brazil's businesses managed to make the economy grow by about 4 percent in real terms.
But economists predict that growth will slow to 2 percent in 1994. Not only is inflation expected to remain high, but uncertainty over presidential elections in October are keeping investors skittish. In opinion polls, the strongest candidate, Luis Inacio (Lula) da Silva, is a socialist whose Workers' Party is hostile to privatization and cuts in government spending. JAMES BROOKE

HEADLINE: For the Nations of the Western Hemisphere, Renewed Growth: Mexico;
Despite Advances, A Nervous Market

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: Mexico City

 BODY:
Although Mexico's economy enters 1994 with three of the uncertainties of last year behind it, there still is likely to be a great deal of nervousness in the Mexican market next year.
In the space of a few weeks at the end of 1993, the United States approved the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico's legislature approved a new foreign investment law, and the ruling party selected as its 1994 presidential candidate -- and overwhelming favorite to win the August 1994 election -- Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, who immediately vowed to continue the economic policies of the current president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
 Foreign investors, especially those in the United States, rejoiced over the enormous impact the three acts would have on the stability and long-term growth of Mexico's economy.
But just beneath the euphoria lie distressing signs that 1994 could be a difficult economic year.
The Mexican economy, which has been dragging, has one foot in a classic recession. Government figures show that Mexico's gross domestic product fell by 1.2 percent during the third quarter of 1993, the biggest drop since President Salinas took office in 1988.
Economists consider two consecutive quarters of decline to be a recession, and there is little hope that the fourth quarter of 1993 will see much improvement.
The Government has plans to stimulate the economy in 1994, an election year. These include spending a $6 billion budget surplus, cutting corporate and individual tax rates, and holding prices on electricity, airport fees and other goods and services that are controlled by the Government.
Economic officials like Undersecretary for Foreign Investment Pedro Noyola, say Mexico would need to match the current $10 billion in foreign investment it received this year to maintain economic stability, but foreign investors are uncertain whether that level can be sustained.
There are some who say that many investments related to the new trade agreement have already been made and that there will not necessarily be a post-agreement boom.
The leading index of the Mexican stock exchange has surged by 40 percent this year, but many bargains that once attracted investors from the United States have disappeared.
During 1994, interest rates on Government treasury notes, called Cetes, are expected to drop, as are domestic interest rates for loans. The biggest question may be what happens to the Mexican peso, which some economists and analysts say is overvalued.
Mr. Colosio has not said how the peso should be handled. The finance minister, Pedro Aspe, is said to support a strong peso, and there is talk that he may be named to head the new independent central bank when the president retires.
Officially, the Government projects 5 percent inflation for 1994 and 3 percent growth in the economy. Inflation in 1993 could end at below 8 percent, and growth about 1 percent, depending on how the last quarter's figures come in. ANTHONY DePALMA

HEADLINE: For the Nations of the Western Hemisphere, Renewed Growth: Canada;
Strong Growth But Weak on Jobs

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Canada is struggling to get back on its feet economically after heavy-duty structural changes the last half-dozen years, including the painful redirection of resources in response to freer trade, disinflation, new technology and changes in the nation's tax laws.
The convalescence demonstrates how closely linked the patient is to its huge southern neighbor. The economy is growing again but not because of any quickening in the pace of domestic consumption. The engine is exports, chiefly to the United States, which are setting new monthly records. 
 Steel, lumber, automotive parts, lead and zinc and other industrial products are in demand to support the economic expansion in the United States, which takes 80 percent of Canada's exports. In turn, exports are a quarter of Canada's gross domestic product.
Cuts in inflation, now below 2 percent, and gains in productivity in most industries have sharpened competitiveness and led most forecasters to see steady improvement in growth over the next couple of years.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based agency that periodically rates industrialized countries' economic performance, predicts Canada will outpace every member but Turkey over the next two years, with a 3.7 percent expansion in 1994 and a 4.1 percent gain in 1995 -- up from 2.5 percent in 1993.
Yet because of continued corporate downsizing and increasing use of labor-saving technology, no significant drops are foreseen in unemployment, which has hovered around 11 percent over the past three years.
Many economists believe that growth must climb nearer 5 percent before unemployment starts falling; yet forecasts by the O.E.C.D. and others suggest there is not much chance of this any time soon.
So, while the economy strengthens, the mood here is still morose. "Company downsizing spooks consumer spending," said Ranga Chand, senior economist at Burns Fry Ltd., Canada's leading investment house.
Another problem is the huge Government deficit, forcing interest payments and debt ever higher. The new Liberal Government vows to do something about it, but people will not know what it has up its sleeve until the February budget.
Room for maneuver is relatively tight. The Federal deficit is 6 percent of the gross domestic product, double the 3 percent level in the United States. About 40 percent of Canada's debt is held abroad, meaning that unless a deficit-cutting program has credibility, foreigners are likely to dump Canadian securities and the Canadian dollar, which at around 75 cents to the United States dollar is already near its lowest levels in six years.
The question is whether the Government will cut spending or raise taxes. Either way will be a drag on economic growth, further postponing the end of double-digit joblessness.
On bright spot has been the stock market, which enjoyed a record 1993. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-share index surged 29 percent to 4321.40, and many analysts foresee further advances of 10 percent to 20 percent this year, given the strength in both the economy and corporate earnings.

HEADLINE: Whether It's Bluejeans or Mini-Motors or Power Plants . . .: Applied Materials;
A Big Comeback In Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Think globally . . . Think globally . . . Think globally. This is the corporate executive's mantra for the new year. With the North American Free Trade Agreement in place and a new world trade agreement moving smartly forward, companies are aggressively expanding beyond national borders and innovating at every turn to snare new business. Caterpillar, for example, elbowed Japanese companies aside in China's coal fields by agreeing to establish a parts warehouse and fly in mechanics. In Silicon Valley, Applied Materials came from behind by spending 15 percent of sales each year on research and development. ABB Asea Brown Boveri is consolidating manufacturing and shifting production of components to take advantage of the free trade accord. In Latin America, Bunge & Born is betting that the region's rate of consumption will grow faster than its overall economies. Levi Strauss, long a global visionary, sounds a sobering note. It continues to turn its back on China's vast market for bluejeans because of human rights concerns. Here, then, six companies and their global strategies:
A decade ago, Silicon Valley semiconductor chip equipment companies said they were being overrun by Japanese competitors. Now, with Japanese high-tech companies in a deep slump, some American manufacturers are again in good shape. Among American revival stories, Applied Materials Inc., since last year the world's largest maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, is the most compelling example of a company that has beaten its Japanese competition internationally by relying on traditional Silicon Valley principles. 
 It appears that underlying Applied Materials' remarkable rebound, from $174.5 million in revenue in 1985 to $1.08 billion this year, is a commitment to pushing entrepreneurial rewards deep into the organization.
Applied Materials, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has surpassed Japanese rivals Advantest, Canon, Tokyo Electron and Nikon to take the lead in the industry. The company makes a variety of machines used in manufacturing chips.
Its special expertise is in a class of exotic systems that deposit ultra-thin and ultra-pure materials on silicon wafers. Other machines that Applied Materials makes etch the tiny circuit lines of semiconductors.
Concern that the United States could lose the chip wars led to the creation in 1987 of Sematech, the Government and industry consortium that focused on revitalizing the country's manufacturing expertise.
According to G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, Applied Materials gained its position by focusing on customer satisfaction when the Japanese were becoming complacent and arrogant, by having higher reliability and by spending significantly on research, development and engineering, averaging 15 percent of sales annually.
But there may be a deeper reason for Applied Materials' success. "What's innovative about Applied Materials compared to others is the way in which the structure of the management was altered to drive the business in terms of incentives," Mr. Hutcheson said.
The best traditions of Silicon Valley are based on entrepreneurial engineers who struck out with venture capital to create new technologies and companies. But as companies grew, the incentive structure tended to reward managers, not engineers.
But James C. Morgan, Applied's chairman, created compensation plans that motivated rank-and-file engineers as well as top managers. "By not being greedy at the top, he enabled tremendous success in the organization," Mr. Hutcheson said.
Today, about 55 percent of Applied's sales are international -- mostly in Japan despite sales' recently dipping there because of recession. When the Japanese chip makers begin spending significantly to upgrade their equipment technology, it will only strengthen Applied Materials.
Mr. Morgan, author of the book "Cracking the Japanese Market," set up the company's first Japanese subsidiary in 1979, and in 1992, the Japanese market accounted for 35 percent of the company's sales, among the greatest percentages for any company in the Fortune 500. JOHN MARKOFF

Worldwide Watch For Opportunities

With the North American Free Trade Agreement in place and a new world trade agreement moving smartly forward, companies are aggressively expanding beyond national borders and innovating at every turn to snare new business.

In Latin America, Bunge & Born is betting that the region's rate of consumption will grow faster than its overall economies. Levi Strauss, long a global visionary, sounds a sobering note. It continues to turn its back on China's vast market for bluejeans because of human rights concerns. Here, then, six companies and their global strategies:
 To Siegfried R. Ramseyer, crossing borders is second nature. Growing up in Geneva, he never thought twice about choosing say, a French restaurant for dinner -- in France. "They were the best restaurants," said Mr. Ramseyer, who lived half an hour from the French border. 
 Caterpillar Inc., based in Peoria, Ill., is equally adept at going where opportunity beckons. "Wherever we're allowed to do business, we like to do business," said Mr. Ramseyer, vice president of Caterpillar's Asia-Pacific and Latin American division. That included South Africa when such investments were highly unpopular at home, and, Mr. Ramseyer hopes, Vietnam, as the United States eases limits on trading there.
As a result of such perseverance, the roster of competitors has changed markedly. In the 1960's and 1970's, the companies to beat were International Harvester, Euclid and Allis-Chalmers. Today, those American names have been displaced by Komatsu, Hitachi and Kobelco of Japan. "We survived because we always had an international approach," Mr. Ramseyer said.
Doing so much business overseas, means, of course, responding to the vicissitudes of foreign markets with a flexibility that many American managers cannot muster.
Mr. Ramseyer, for example, was expected to toast his new friendship with a Saudi sheik by eating the choicest part of a lamb-and-rice banquet: the sheep's eyes. "You just swallow hard and do it," he said.
The results seem worth the effort. In 1992, Caterpillar exported $3.3 billion -- one-third of its sales -- and imported only $1.4 billion of components and other materials. That trade surplus of $1.9 billion kept 17,000 Caterpillar employees and another 34,000 people who work for Caterpillar's suppliers employed, the company estimates.
These days, Caterpillar sees its biggest opportunities in the Pacific Rim. Growth in that part of the world is expected to increase 6 percent to 14 percent a year, compared with 2.5 percent in the United States, spurring investment in the types of construction equipment that Caterpillar sells.
Even without a dealer network acting as its emissary in China, Caterpillar recently won a $20 million contract to supply 18 190-ton trucks to China's coal fields. It elbowed aside Wabco, a unit of Komatsu, essentially by offering to open a parts warehouse near the coal fields and to fly in enough mechanics to keep the machines humming.
"When you have a new customer like this, they just don't buy the product, they buy the company," Mr. Ramseyer said.
The North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade mean that Caterpillar may reassess its strategy of locating plants all over to be near customers and to scale trade barriers. For instance, it still sells enough medium-size, D6 tractors to justify making them in the United States, France and Japan. But a drop in volume and the fall of trade barriers could lead the company to think harder about consolidating production in its two most efficient plants.
Until then, Mr. Ramseyer will urge policy makers to do more for free trade. And he will continue to carry two passports -- a trick he learned while heading Caterpillar's Middle East business -- just in case he finds himself shuttling between hostile countries. ALISON LEIGH COWAN

HEADLINE: ...Today's Corporate Game Plans Know No Boundaries: ABB Asea Brown Boveri;
Global Arms, Regional Muscle

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
A lot of companies like to call themselves global. Few can do so with as much justification as ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Zurich-based industrial giant, which operates 1,300 companies in 140 countries.
Operating worldwide is not a plus by definition. With most big markets in recession for the past two years, profits have stagnated at ABB after doubling from 1988 to 1992. Demand has shrunk in its core business of supplying the electric-power generation and distribution industries. 
 A global reach, however, gives the company a chance to take full advantage of the opportunities created by worldwide political and economic changes. And under its hyperkinetic chief executive, Percy Barnevik, ABB is moving to seize the advantage on on all fronts.
The company has become one of the most active investors in Eastern Europe, taking major stakes in companies in Poland and the Czech Republic and moving more slowly into Russia. It is investing heavily in Asia, which it sees as the fastest-growing market in coming years.
To take advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, ABB is consolidating manufacturing operations by moving production of some components from the United States to Canada and others from Canada to the United States, while stepping up efforts to sell them in Mexico.
And it anticipates using the same strategy on a bigger scale now that the protracted negotiations on liberalizing world trade have been completed.
"The more free trade, the better for us," Mr. Barnevik said. "We can optimize our production globally."
ABB already plays to its regional strengths. When it bids to build a power plant in Asia, for example, it may include components manufactured in Poland, where low labor costs allow the company to keep prices low, Mr. Barnevik said.
The trick for ABB as it continues to grow in size and ambition will be to maintain the company's famously strict cost control and ability to run each business unit locally while taking advantage of the economies inherent in its scale.
In August, Mr. Barnevik announced that the company would close 15 plants in Europe and North America at a cost of $500 million. He also reorganized the company's management to pay greater attention to the three main markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.
And Mr. Barnevik has consolidated industrial products segments to four from six, partly to encourage more cooperation among ABB's far-flung businesses in the growing market for turnkey power plants, which are plants purchased by customers as a complete package rather than component by component.
The biggest change for ABB for this year may be an increasing shift away from the growth through acquisition that characterized its activities in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
"In western Europe and America, we pretty much have the presence we want," Mr. Barnevik said.
"Now it's a matter of reaping the full benefits of what we have." RICHARD W. STEVENSON

HEADLINE: ...Today's Corporate Game Plans Know No Boundaries: Bunge & Born;
More Mindful Of Latin America

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
With low inflation and economic growth proving remarkably enduring in much of Latin America, there are new pressures for consumer manufacturers to pay more attention to their customers.
"Stability has made the consumer much more demanding and given him more time to shop around and make the spending decisions," said Ricardo Esteves, a director of Bunge & Born S.A., South America's largest consumer products company. 
 "During high inflation, the fear was simply to be able to get the products, and you didn't worry about quality or price," he said. "Now the shopper is comparing local goods with imported goods, with other brands. So we have to produce better products at more competitive prices."
Of all of the companies with a finger on the pulse of Latin American consumers, Bunge & Born should have as acute an awareness as any. Known in the United States principally as a grain trader, the privately held conglomerate, with worldwide sales of $20 billion, operates processed-foods, paint, textile and cement operations in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela.
After years of accumulating an array of businesses, experiencing deep losses and struggling with a disorderly management structure, the company has forced itself to modernize and become more competitive. Over the last two years, with the help of McKinsey & Company, it has sold a number of businesses and concentrated its expertise on a handful of industries that mainly answer local consumer demands in Latin America. For companies that can increase quality, there should be a payoff. Bunge & Born's research sees consumption growing faster than the overall economy.
That means different things for different parts of the company's business. Although Molinos Rio de la Plata S.A., Bunge & Born's food subsidiary, is the largest food marketer in Argentina, it is trying to improve the image of its cold cuts, mayonnaise and cooking oils and build strong, recognizable brands.
"Before, people would buy whatever pasta was on the shelves, even though they did not know what little company made it," Mr. Esteves said. "But people want to feed themselves better; they are looking for better taste, more purity, as well as a company that will stand behind the product."
With greater spending power, consumers are buying more prepared foods, instead of basic foods like oil and flour, he noted. So the company is moving more into prepared cake mixes to meet that demand.
Another business with great potential for Bunge & Born is paints. With stable prices, Argentina and other countries are beginning to develop long-term consumer credit industries, which should cause an explosion in home mortgages.
Bunge & Born expects that once mortgage credit is more widely available, its Alba S.A. paint subsidiary in Argentina, its Inca S.A. unit in Uruguay and its Pinturas Carol unit in Brazil will take off.
The company is also using advertising to promote more do-it-yourself home painting, which it hopes will increase paint sales even more, without undermining the traditional professional painter.
But Bunge & Born may have to wait longer for a boom in Brazil to develop because the country of 150 million still has high inflation -- more than 1,200 percent in 1993.
"Brazil inevitably will reduce inflation, and once it does, the market will be so explosive you won't be able to meet the demand," Mr. Esteves said. "So we are already preparing for that stage, working on quality." NATHANIEL C. NASH

HEADLINE: ...While a Sluggish Japan Sighs Amid Asia's Roaring Tigers: Southeast Asia;
Dynamic Markets But Growing Pains

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
Among the dazzling economies of Southeast Asia, what has gone up seems likely to keep going up in 1994.
Southeast Asia remains the most economically dynamic region on earth, and regional forecasts suggest that economic growth will continue to hum along at up to 7 percent next year, much more than double the pace expected in the United States. 
 Even laggards like the Philippines and long-time basket cases like Cambodia and Laos are poised for better growth.
Not only are Southeast Asian nations producing what the industrialized world buys in good times and bad -- shoes, clothes and small electronics -- but they are also creating vast consumer markets.
More than a third of all the goods exported in Southeast Asia finish up in other countries in the region, and the portion keeps growing. Street markets are being replaced by shopping malls.
The key problems of the past generation -- hunger and grinding poverty -- are being replaced in some countries with the problems that come with economic success: pollution and urban congestion. Some of the nations of Southeast Asia have so damaged their environments, in fact, that they risk driving away foreign investors and tourists.
Large multinational companies say that in the last two years it has become difficult to attract talented expatriate workers to Thailand and Indonesia, where boom times have created filthy air and water and round-the-clock traffic jams. Hotels in Bangkok, where tourism is the most important source of hard currency, are empty much of the year.
The most interesting economic news in the new year may come from the nations that have long been burdened with the most backward economies: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. To varying degrees, all are giving up central economic planning in favor of free markets.
Despite its atrocious record on human rights, Myanmar, with a population of nearly 60 million and vast natural resources, has suddenly begun to attract significant interest from savvy investors from Singapore, who have set up a new Myanmar airline. Despite growing corruption and a crumbling infrastructure, Vietnam continues to stir up so much enthusiasm among investors that the American trade embargo is increasingly seen as toothless.

HEADLINE: Mr. Giuliani's Dreams

 BODY:
Rudolph Giuliani took office on the steps of City Hall yesterday promising a return to New York City's halcyon days of hope, promise and achievement -- a time that may never have existed quite as he describes it, but has a place in the heart of New York's 107th Mayor, and in the dreams of millions of New Yorkers.
"The era of fear has had a long enough reign," Mr. Giuliani said, with his 7-year-old son, Andrew, standing happily at his side. "The period of doubt has run its course. As of this moment, the expressions of cynicism -- that New York is not governable, New York is not manageable, New York is not worth it -- all of these I declare politically incorrect." 
 Harking back nearly a century, to when his grandfather Rodolfo came to New York in pursuit of a better life, Mr. Giuliani urged New Yorkers to overcome their fears and doubts.
As he did during his campaign, the new Mayor described the New York of today in terms bleaker than reality -- as a city characterized by crime, guns, cynicism and fear. And he described the city of the future as a place of renewal and productivity, celebrated for what has long made New York distinctive, from the theater and great museums to the United Nations.
Mr. Giuliani was short on details, and made only passing reference to the city's looming budget deficit of at least $2.2 billion. Controlling the budget will be a priority, said the new Mayor, along with restoring public safety, improving education, creating jobs and enhancing the quality of life. He offered little insight into how he will address those matters.
But inaugural ceremonies are always long on symbolism and short on substance and the symbolic message of this inauguration was clear. Time and again Mr. Giuliani appealed to New Yorkers (especially secessionist Staten Islanders) to stick around, work hard and put their faith in a change-oriented leader who is the first Republican Mayor in a generation. "Problems are challenges to do better and we will do better," he told his audience.
The spectators at City Hall yesterday provided a marked contrast to the audience assembled four years ago to celebrate the inauguration of David Dinkins, the city's first black Mayor. That jubilant crowd was heavily black and yesterday's included just a smattering of African-Americans. Mr. Giuliani reiterated his commitment to diversity in his speech. But reaching out to blacks disappointed in Mr. Dinkins's defeat is, as a black Giuliani supporter said after the ceremony, something the new Mayor "will have to work on."
It is one of many difficult matters Mr. Giuliani will have to work on as he adjusts to the daunting job of running a complex, often troubled and economically fragile city. Mindful of the problems before him, the new Mayor nonetheless promised that change would bring improvement: "Dream with me," he said, "of a city that can be better than the way it is now."

HEADLINE: Olympic Park Will Give Downtown Atlanta Growth and Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Billy's Olympic Dream Park" (Op-Ed, Dec. 20) by John Huey, on the proposal by Billy Payne to build a $100 million Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta for the 1996 Olympics: It annoys me as an African-American when white people think they are speaking on my behalf. John Huey makes many of the classic mistakes of which so many pseudoliberals are often guilty, beginning with the presumption that the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games and Billy Payne are racially insensitive. 
 Mr. Huey obviously has no idea what the role of the Olympic Committee is and how it is trying to be responsive to the entire community.
Had he got in touch with our Committee for the Olympic Games, he might have learned that we take our civic responsibility seriously.
We have invested $50 million in building projects that will benefit the predominately African-American Atlanta University Center; initiated a partnership with Clark Atlanta University to train 1,200 Georgia students in broadcast and telecommunications technology; created in the stadium-impacted neighborhoods a jobs-training program that has already graduated and employed 24 residents; employed a diversified work force, which exceeds virtually any corporation of its size and scope in the country, and worked daily with more than a dozen community groups and civic leaders, black and white, to insure that the Olympic experience benefits as many people as possible.
Can the Olympic Committee cure hunger, poverty and homelessness? No. That is the duty and the mission of elected leaders. Our job is to stage the best Olympic Games in history. We believe that the Centennial Olympic Park will not only contribute to that effort, but will also leave behind a lot more than "grass seed for a two-week festival."
What will remain is an economic development opportunity in Atlanta's downtown, which will spur growth and bring jobs to an area that residents, black and white, will be able to reach by public transportation.
Mr. Huey has fallen back on the old stereotype of the big white corporate gorilla sitting on the poor downtrodden colored folks, in this case, a tiresome and inaccurate image.
The Centennial Olympic Park is not about race. It is about change and about the frustration of unrealistic expectations from this giant sports event. The Games will come and go, and like the aftermath of any party, the memories of it will differ, based on what those involved feel they got out of it.

HEADLINE: Low Rates May Keep 1994 Bond Sales Sluggish

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasuries were everything in 1993, but in 1994 they won't be. And reversals of that stripe will keep heads spinning and returns down in 1994.
Mortgage-backed securities, which took a beating last year, may be back in vogue, as fewer people refinance higher-rate mortgages. Municipal bonds, underperforming last year because of the oversupply of issues as cities took advantage of low rates, should also shine. And if 1993 was the year of capital gains -- of double-digit total returns -- this will be the year of the coupon -- single-digit payoffs mostly from interest earned. 
 The reason: while long-term rates are likely to stay low, they are not favored to dip below 1993's lows. And that steadiness means less chance for the kind of capital gains that, for example, helped bring returns of over 18 percent on the 30-year bond last year.
"We're trying to lower expectations," said A. Keith Brodkin, the chairman of Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston.
Plunge in Interest Rates
With a new President and a surprisingly weak economy in the first six months, long-term interest rates plunged, propping up the stock and bond markets and giving investors huge capital gains. This decline, beginning in January, gained force in the summer and fall when it appeared that inflation might end the year lower. With slow growth and declining inflation, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to a 25-year low of 5.78 percent in mid-October.
The decline in interest rates produced a record $290 billion of new issues in the tax-exempt municipal bond market as state and local governments rushed to pay off older, higher interest rate borrowings. The junk bond market also thrived, setting its own record of $60 billion in new issues as investors set aside credit concerns to seek higher yields in a low-interest environment.
The scramble for yield will be a prominent theme again this year. With interest rates expected to remain low, picking up higher yields will mean taking on more risk, either by buying securities with longer maturities or by trying corporate or municipal bonds with credit ratings below the top grade or junk bonds below investment grade.
The 1994 outlook hinges on economic growth and inflation in the United States and the performance of the economies in Europe and Asia that market American exports.
If the outlook on moderate growth and inflation here and sluggish growth abroad proves correct, long-term interest rates will bounce around in a narrow range between 6 percent and 7 percent. If inflation, with the help of weak oil prices, surprises and winds up at 2 percent instead of 3 percent, long-term rates could fall below last year's 25-year low. The yield on the 30-year bond finished 1993 at 6.34 percent.
Much of the forecast depends on whether the Federal Reserve raises its short-term interest-rate target, which has been three percent for over a year. Short-term interest rates have already moved higher on this expectation and could continue to rise, depending on the Fed. The six-month Treasury bill finished 1993 with a discount rate of 3.19 percent and a jump of a quarter to half a percentage point is expected.
If traders and investors think the Fed is not being tough enough in fighting inflation, long-term rates could rise. But, if the Fed is decisive and punctures any burst of inflationary worries, as it did with its subtle shift in monetary policy last May, then long-term rates could fall.
In either case, rates are likely to remain low. That means that corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than Treasuries, should be more attractive. Junk bonds should be sought out for their yields -- averaging possibly 9 to 11 percent. And steady economic growth with low interest rates will make some of the below investment grade companies selling junk healthier and eligible for credit upgrades -- adding price increases to yields.
Mortgage-backed securities should rebound this year if long-term interest rates remain stable or inch higher. Last year's rush of home mortgage refinancings, set off by the sharp drop in long-term interest rates, forced the early payoff of many higher interest mortgage-backed securities, undermining their performance. And some refinancing risk will linger this year in the higher yielding mortgage-backed securities because millions of homeowners have yet to take advantage of lower interest rates. So mortgage-backed securities with coupons around 7 percent are safer.
But municipal bonds may be the most attractive, underappreciated play for investors in 1994, even those who are not in the new top tax bracket, which, with the so-called millionaire's surcharge, is 39.6 percent.
The reason is that forecasters are predicting a steep decline in new bond issues because stable interest rates will stifle Government refinancing of higher interest rate debt. The record refinancing last year held down prices by swamping investors. But with projected new issues falling almost 40 percent this year that downward pressure on municipal bond prices will disappear.

HEADLINE: Markets Around the World Set Records in '93

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
From Wall Street to Kuala Lumpur, the world's stock markets finished the year higher, and some reached records on the last day of trading in 1993.
As the world economy rebounded and showed signs of growing stronger in 1994, stocks have gone along for the ride. 
 Foreign stock prices have also been bid higher by U.S. investors scouring the globe for better returns than the 2 or 3 percent offered at the local bank. Americans have also shopped for promising foreign issues because of concerns that the stock markets in the United States are overvalued.
 
Money Flows In
 "With the amount of money flowing in and the small capitalization of foreign markets, it's no surprise they had huge moves," said Michael Metz, investment strategist for Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. "The question for 1994 is: What if those flows don't continue?"
Higher interest rates, which could result from higher inflation, stand to entice many investors to bring their money back home and send a wave of selling rippling around the world, Mr. Metz said.
From Britain to even the long-slumping Japanese market, stocks finished the year higher. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index in London finished Friday 20 percent above the end of 1992 at 3,418.4. In Tokyo, where markets were closed Friday, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues had finished at 17,417.24, 2.9 percent higher on the year.
The annual gain for the Nikkei came because of a three-day rally at year's end. If not for the 597-point surge, the index would have finished lower for the year. Japan's worst recession since World War II persisted in the past year, despite Government stimulus efforts worth $174 billion.
Elsewhere, sometimes on little-heard of stock exchanges, markets soared.
In Manila, the composite market index finished the year 150 percent higher, and the index on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange nearly doubled to finish the year at a record.
As Hong Kong moved another year closer to Chinese rule, its stocks soared to records.

HEADLINE: A High-Technology Outcry Against the U.S. Patent System

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The nation's 203-year-old patent system is on a collision course with new technology.
 Framing a crucial public-policy issue for 1994, a growing number of software publishers and patent experts are calling for fundamental changes in the way the Government assigns ownership to computer hardware and software inventions. Failure to revise the system, these critics say, will stifle creativity in crucial high-technology areas. 
Although many software companies, including the Microsoft Corporation, continue to support the idea of patent protection for original ideas in software and computing, the critics complain that the process too often awards patents in fields already plowed by others. And they fault the Patent and Trademark Office for issuing what patent lawyers call "land mine" awards -- patents that explode onto the scene a decade or more after an established industry has broadly deployed the technology.
 Then there are the absolutists, like the Oracle Corporation, a big software publisher, which argues that patents are totally inappropriate in the computer software industry.
 The issue reached a crisis point last month over the Patent Office's award of a wide-ranging patent to a small San Diego software company, Compton's New Media, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based Tribune Publishing Company. The patent seems to give Compton's control over the most popular techniques for searching for information in multimedia data bases -- software that combines computer information and text with color pictures, compact-disk-quality sound, animation and video clips.
 The award alarmed many industry executives, who said they feared that Compton's had been given a virtual stranglehold over a crucial kind of software that computer, telephone, entertainment, publishing and cable companies are counting on as the basis for a vast new information economy. Compton's created a further stir by indicating it planned to seek royalties from multimedia hardware and software companies.
 Responding to the industry outcry, the Patent Commissioner, Bruce Lehman, took the unusual action in late December of announcing that his office had new information and would re-examine the patent.
 Despite the move, there has been a chorus of calls for fundamentally revamping the patents system, which was originally intended to promote innovative research by protecting inventors and entrepreneurs. But critics now say the system is creating a public-policy contradiction: on one hand, the Clinton Administration is eager to foster competition in telecommunications; on the other, the agency continues to grant 17-year monopolies, just as it did when technologies evolved at century-long intervals.
 "The Patent Office has no sensitivity to its economic impact," said Brian Kahin, director of the intellectual property project for the Interactive Multimedia Association, a trade group representing software developers. "We have the Patent Office regulating from the bottom up by controlling innovation."
 Mr. Lehman, in an interview, defended his office, saying that the Clinton Administration is the first to recognize the relationship between the patent system and economic and technical development. "The patent system has a great influence on the economy and the development of technology," he said. "There has to be a delicate balance between over-protection and under-protection."
 Still, Mr. Lehman conceded that it was impossible to foresee the policy impact of each patent. "We issue 90,000 patents a year, and I'm not able to read every one," he said. "One of the frustrations I have is in the difficulty in identifying policy-oriented and other problem patents."
 Mr. Lehman has announced that his office will hold hearings in Silicon Valley on Jan. 26 and 27, at which software industry executives may air their complaints about the system.
 Software was not even considered a patentable technology until a United States Supreme Court ruling in 1980. That put the Patent Office in the awkward position of having to review filings without having historical data against which to check the originality of the ideas.
 Today, as a result, critics of the patent system argue that there are obvious "bad" software patents, which disregard development work by others that predate the patent applications. But the bigger problem, critics say, involves other patents that are valid under current rules but threaten the development of important new systems.
 A group of leading computer scientists and software developers, for example, is considering a challenge to a longstanding patent held by Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and two private groups. The patent covers a fundamental approach to encrypting computer data to keep it private. The challengers say the patent is so broad that it is stifling widespread development of new mathematical coding algorithms essential to providing security for electronic communications.
 The industry is also upset by what it refers to as land mine or "submarine" patents -- ones awarded a decade or two after inventors' applications. Roger Billings won a 1987 patent for the concept of "file server" computer networks and Gilbert Hyatt was awarded one in 1990 for the computer-on-a-chip microprocessor that lies at the heart of today's personal computers. Both were issued after thriving industries emerged.
 To many computer scientists, Mr. Billings's claim -- the basis for his suit against one of the nation's largest software publishers, the Novell Corporation -- is an outrage.
 "I've read his patent, and I feel like I've watched the tapes of the Rodney King beating," said Robert Metcalfe, the publisher of the computer newspaper Infoworld and a pioneering computer scientist who invented the modern office network while at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. Mr. Metcalfe argues that there are numerous prior examples of the types of networks to which Mr. Billings is claiming exclusivity.
 Several large software companies are questioning whether it is appropriate to continue using a patent system designed in a era before computing and computer networks.
 "The software industry in the United States grew up dramatically and made a lot of millionaires before anyone thought we should patent any of this," said Michael Kurtz, vice president and legal counsel of Oracle, which is based in Redwood Shores, Calif., and is one of the nation's largest software companies.
 Earlier this year Oracle took the unusual step of announcing its opposition to all software patents. The company argued that existing copyright law and available trade-secret protections were better suited to safeguarding new ideas in software.
 "Of course they don't like patents," John Shoch, a venture capitalist at Asset Management in Palo Alto, Calif., said of Oracle. "They built their whole company around ideas that I.B.M. invented but was not able to protect."
 Oracle grew rapidly during the 1980's on the strength of database management software invented at I.B.M. during the 1970's, before software came under patent law.
 To be sure, many large software companies, like I.B.M., support the current patent system. And companies that in the past have not aggressively pursued an intellectual-property business strategy are now building arsenals of patents. But Mr. Kurtz argues that the patent process itself has made it increasingly necessary to build these libraries, and he blames the phenomenon for sapping the software industry of its innovation.
 "When our engineers are helping us write patents, they're not writing software," he said, and filing a single patent can cost $20,000 or more, including lawyers' time. "Companies like Apple, which grew from two guys in a garage," Mr. Kurtz said, "would never have happened if they had to spend a bunch of money on patents."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 3, 1994, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 19 reported that child welfare and police officials in Chicago had concluded that a group of fourth graders seeking to retaliate against a strict substitute teacher had concocted a tale accusing him of molestation. The article added that parents, unhappy with the conclusion, were threatening to file charges against the teacher, Albert Thompson.
While the article quoted parents and two school officials extensively in support of the children, there was no comment from Mr. Thompson about the findings, or about the parents' threats. The article should have noted that attempts to reach Mr. Thompson through the union were unsuccessful, and that calls to the Albert Thompsons in the Chicago telephone directory failed.
Mr. Thompson has since approached The Times to emphasize his exoneration by all the investigating agencies and his reinstatement as a substitute teacher. "The parents should not have had the last word," he said.
In addition, the article's headline misstated the result of the official exoneration. It did not "fail to end" the case; it failed to silence the debate.

HEADLINE: Stocks Drop Sharply With Mexico Strife

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Mexican stocks fell sharply today after armed peasants began an uprising in southern Mexico.
The IPC index of 36 companies dropped 100.4 points, or 3.86 percent, to close at 2,502.23. It was the biggest one-day drop in four months. 
 Starting on New Year's Day, when the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, about 600 armed peasants, many of Mayan descent, declared war on the Mexican Government, saying they were fighting for the future of native people. Dozens were killed, and the rebels took over at least four towns, later abandoning three of them, calling for land reform and a new Government.
Some financial analysts, though, said today that the conflict was unlikely to weigh on the market for long. "This gives investors the perfect opportunity to do what people have been expecting -- to take profits," said Geoffrey Dennis, emerging markets research chief at Bear, Stearns.
The Mexican stock market has sharply risen on hopes for economic expansion with application of the North American trade pact.
 
Profit Taking Seen
 Susana Ornelas, an analyst at Baring Research, also called the drop an overdue correction. "This is mostly profit taking on the huge rise in the past two weeks by investors coming back from vacation," she said.
Given the favorable long-term economic prospects in Mexico, some analysts said a market retreat was likely to attract buyers. "We may have a quite significant or quite prolonged move sideways to downward, possibly for a couple of weeks," Mr. Dennis said. "Then you have an enormous buying opportunity."
Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley & Company, said the fighting reflected the problem of income distribution in Mexico. He said that one danger would be if, as a result of the uprising, the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decided to increase spending and created deficits.
American investors also took profits in Mexican stocks trading in the United States. Those declining included the American depository shares of Telefonos de Mexico, down $2, to $65.50, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and of the glassmaker Vitro,, which lost 50 cents to close at $18.625, also on the Big Board. Three large closed-end funds in Mexican equities fell: the Mexico Fund down $2 to close at $37, the Mexican Equity and Income Fund down $1.625, to $23, and the Emerging Mexico Fund down $2, to $23.75.

Macy's Future
Macy reacted coolly to efforts by Federated to add Macy to its stable of stores. Allen I. Questrom, Federated's chairman, met with Myron E. Ullman 3d, Macy's chairman. But Macy said its plan to emerge from bankruptcy would not be altered by Federated's purchase of some of its debt and its possible new role as the largest Macy creditor. [Page A1.] 
 Federated's attempt to seek a merger with Macy bears the hallmarks of a grand merchant, a marketing wizard and a shrewd strategist -- in short, an Allen I. Questrom. [D4.]
 
The Economy
Consumers, rather than business or government, are fueling economic growth, and most forecasters say their spending should help sustain the economic expansion in 1994. Little has dampened this eagerness in recent months to spend, and retailers are stretching their resources to accommodate the demand. [D1.]
Spending on construction projects rose 1.8 percent in November and the manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, more evidence of a stronger economy. [D3.]
 
Companies
Toys "R" Us said that Christmas sales had exceeded most analysts' expectations and that it was giving more responsibility to two senior executives as part of a long-term succession plan. Charles Lazarus, its 70-year-old founder, remains chairman. [D1.]
General Motors is working to improve efficiency in its parts-making operations, a painful but essential move considered critical to restoring profitability throughout the corporation. [D1.]
Coopers & Lybrand adopted Lotus for its personal computers, a significant endorsement for Notes software. [D5.]
Reynolds Metals will cut aluminum-sheet output, take a fourth-quarter charge and post a yearly loss amid falling demand. [D5.]
The Well, a computer on-line service, is being bought by Bruce Katz, a businessman who already owns half of it. [D5.]
MCI will make a "significant" announcement expected to relate to reports it plans to build local telephone networks. [D6.]
Walgreen reported record first-quarter sales and profits and said it planned to open 175 drugstores in the fiscal year. [D6.]
An 84-year-old grandmother won the right to buy an American Stock Exchange seat over objections by the exchange. [D6.]
Walt Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, will not get a bonus because of the company's troubles with Euro Disneyland. [D16.]
 
International
On Nafta's first day, there was no surge in shipping activity on the U.S.-Mexico border. With most manufacturers just reopening after the holidays, there was little ready to be shipped. [A6.]
Mexican stocks fell sharply amid a peasant uprising. The Bolsa's 3.86 percent drop was the biggest in four months. [D3.]
 
Markets
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply as the economy's continued firm recovery heightened inflation fears. The Treasury bond yield rose to 6.41 percent, the highest since August. [D1.]
Stocks ended mostly lower as interest rates rose. But the Dow industrials gained 2.51 points to 3,756.60. [D8.]
Orange juice futures jumped 8 percent on forecasts of a freeze in Florida. [D18.] The dollar and gold rose. [D18.]
 
Today's Columns
More companies raised their dividends last month than in any month since 1983, a possible indication of confidence that the higher profits of 1993 will continue. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D1.]
The advertising and media implications of a merger of Macy and Federated would be significant. But the reaction of agency executives was mixed. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D15.]

HEADLINE: Whitman Picks Outsider to Fill Treasurer Post

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Governor-elect Christine Todd Whitman today picked Brian W. Clymer, a Bush Administration official who mailed in his resume with hundreds of others, as her state treasurer, the post most critical to keeping her campaign promises to shrink state government and cut state income taxes by nearly a third.
Mr. Clymer, 46, is a Pennsylvanian with no ties to New Jersey politics, no friends in the political labyrinths of the statehouse. He is the first of Mrs. Whitman's appointees to come without either years of experience in the state's government or a background of personal and professional kinship with the Governor-elect.
 
Calls Whitman's Plan 'Doable'
 Instead, Mr. Clymer sought the job along with hundreds of other applicants after Mrs. Whitman was elected, and he was selected after a series of interviews, said Carl Golden, Mrs. Whitman's spokesman. Mrs. Whitman said today that she met Mr. Clymer for the first time two weeks ago, and that he was the only person offered the treasurer's job. At Mr. Clymer's first public appearance, Mrs. Whitman reaffirmed her determination to cut the state government and Mr. Clymer several times called the Governor-elect's plan "doable." 
 He joins a cabinet whose appointees have so far come from either within state government, as in the case of Mrs. Whitman's choice for Education Commissioner, Dr. Leo Klagholz, or else as members of Mrs. Whitman's personal and professional circle when she was chairman of the Board of Public Utilities in the administration of Thomas H. Kean, such as Deborah T. Poritz, the nominee for Attorney General, and Lonna R. Hooks, her choice for Secretary of State.
In accomplishing his task for Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Clymer will need the cooperation of legislative Republicans who control the budget-writing committees in both houses, and who have have expressed the worry that budget cuts at the state level may leave them exposed to voter anger at the local level, where dependence on state aid is high.
Today, Mr. Clymer met the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, for the first time, and the nominee does not have any friends in the legislature who will smooth his way through the budget thicket.
Mr. Clymer will assume primary responsibility for the most politically arduous task facing the Whitman administration, that of cutting income taxes for most taxpayers by 30 percent over three years, while limiting the growth of the state budget to the rate of inflation. Mrs. Whitman has said she would accomplish this without forcing tax increases on local governments, which receive two-thirds of the New Jersey state budget, or forced layoffs of state employees.
Mr. Clymer is currently head of a Media, Pa., transportation engineering company, Railway System Design Inc. From 1989 to 1993 he was the Bush-appointed head of the Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration, dispensing nearly $4 billion a year in aid to the country's 1,100 mass-transit systems.
He has therefore been a more openhanded administrator than a tightfisted one as Mrs. Whitman has commanded him to be, and Mr. Clymer made it clear today that he was aware how his job as the Whitman administration's chief budget, staff and tax cutter would differ from the work he did in Washington.
"I am certainly aware that the closer you get to the taxpayers, the hotter the seat gets," he said at a news conference with the Governor-elect today. "It is always difficult to cut back and to make tough decisions that affect people's lives, but the long and the short of it is that the Governor is committed to making the state government more efficient, we think we can carry out that commitment, and that's what we're going to do."
Assuming he is confirmed, Mr. Clymer will preside over an annual budget of nearly $16 billion that will be burdened with a built-in deficit of upward of $1.5 billion beginning in July. Moreover, income-tax receipts are lagging behind projections made by the administration of Jim Florio, the incumbent Mrs. Whitman defeated.
The transit agency Mr. Clymer headed actually grew slightly during his tenure in Washington, where he was remembered today as an adept fighter for mass-transit aid against White House budget cutters.
When he was asked to weigh the prospect of presiding over a shrinking budget and staff instead of a growing one, Mrs. Whitman stepped to the microphone to make sure everyone understood that it was not just the Treasurer's 5,300 employees, but an entire state government that was going into the shrinker.
"We're looking at not only seeing one department end up smaller than the one he took over, but an entire government," she said. "That is what the commitment is going to be, and we have had no problems so far on agreeing on that as a result."
 
Series of High-Level Jobs
 Mrs. Whitman praised Mr. Clymer's administrative skills and the prospect of marrying his business experience with public service. Before joining the Bush Administration, he held a succession of high-level positions with the Philadelphia area's publicly owned rail and bus commuter system, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. He is a certified public accountant.
Mr. Golden, meanwhile, said there was nothing unusual in a governor picking an unfamiliar face to head her cabinet's most critically important department. Half of Mr. Kean's cabinet were strangers to him at the outset of his administration in 1981, said Mr. Golden, who was Mr. Kean's spokesman. Mr. Florio, for his part, reached to Texas and Washington state to fill some cabinet slots.
Throughout his meeting with news organizations today, Mr. Clymer said he believed the Whitman plan is "doable." He said that he has gleaned some ideas from members of the transition staff, and that he has seen some figures on state tax receipts that will be crucial to the success of the new governor's plans. No New Jersey governor since the 1960's, Republican or Democrat, has left office with overall state tax rates lower than when he took office.

HEADLINE: Dow Ekes Out a Slight Rise as Most Stocks Slip

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks ended mostly lower in quiet trading yesterday as good news on the economy prompted inflation fears and pushed interest rates higher. Blue-chip issues, however, managed a late advance.
Stocks of smaller companies and technology stocks were among the hardest hit. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.51 points, to 3,756.60. Declining issues outnumbered advances, 1,318 to 902, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 279.3 million shares, up from 171.4 million on New Year's Eve.
Stocks spent much of the session firmly lower, but recovered slightly late in the day, when the Dow skipped to its narrow advance. Oil shares helped buoy blue-chip stocks.
 
Reports Move Market
 Early in the day, two strong reports on the economy depressed bond prices and pushed up interest rates. Bond investors dislike word of strong growth because it brings the threat of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments.
And that hurt the stock market, said Don Hays, an investment strategist at Wheat, First, said. Stocks and bonds have often moved in tandem recently because low interest rates make shares more appealing and cut the cost of money to companies.
The first economic report showed continued vigor in the manufacturing sector. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its December index rose to 57.9 percent from the previous month's reading of 55.7 percent.
A reading above 50 percent is generally indicative of growth in manufacturing.
The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 1.8 percent in November. That was higher than the 1.0 percent advance private economists had forecast.
Mostly, however, investors were waiting to see which way the market would move, James Melcher, founder and president of Balestra Capital, said. "There's always a lot of uncertainty at the beginning of the year," he said.
Among other leading market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.01 points, to 465.44, the New York Stock Exchange's composite index lost 0.81 point, to 258.27, while the Nasdaq index slipped 6.04 points, to 770.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.09 point, to 477.24.
Concern about inflation pushed gold prices and gold-mining stocks higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery gained $2.80, to $394.70 an ounce. Meanwhile, Sunshine Mining led the Big Board's most-active list, rising 1/2, to 3 1/8, while ASA jumped 3 5/8, to 52 7/8.
 
Oil Stocks Rise
 Oil stocks moved higher after news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering bringing forward its scheduled March 25 meeting. Chevron rose 7/8, to 88, while Exxon gained 5/8, to 63 3/4.
Among other actively traded issues, Federated Department Stores rose 2, to 22 3/4, after the company bought a stake in R. H. Macy & Company for $449.3 million.
American depository receipts for shares in Telefonos de Mexico lost 2, to 65 1/2, on the New York Stock Exchange, amid reports that dozens of people had been killed in a peasant uprising in southern Mexico.
Technology shares led the Nasdaq index lower. Oracle Systems lost 1/4, to 28 1/2. Intel fell 3/4, to 61 1/4; Microsoft dropped1/2, to 80 1/8; Lotus Development shed 1 1/2, to 53 1/2, and Cisco Systems lost 3/8, to 64 1/4.
Shares ended higher abroad, although markets were closed in Tokyo and London. Stocks rose 0.1 percent in Frankfurt and 1.0 percent in Paris.

HEADLINE: Prolonged Lyme Treatments Posing Risks, Experts Warn

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
Almost two decades after Lyme disease was detected in Old Lyme, Conn., health experts and officials are warning that overdiagnosis of the disease and complications from long-term antibiotic treatments may pose as great a danger to public health as the disease itself.
In one instance cited by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 14 children had to have their gallbladders removed, and 22 suffered bloodstream infections because of complications from long-term treatment with intravenous antibiotics at the Jersey Shore Medical Center. Though the children's doctor defends their treatment, the centers found no evidence that most of the children had Lyme disease.
 
'Obsessively Diagnosing'
 In another case, a New Jersey doctor's license was suspended for "obsessively diagnosing late-stage Lyme disease" in patients lacking clinical evidence of the disease, falsifying records and collecting fees for referring patients to companies that provide intravenous antibiotics in the home. The Board of Medical Examiners says it is investigating links between other physicians and such companies as well. 
 Diagnosed early, Lyme disease is often remedied by a single course of oral antibiotics. The controversy involves the prolonged use of intravenous antibiotics, sometimes for several years, to treat chronic infections. That use can cost as much as $17,000 a month and has been reported to cause life-threatening complications in some patients.
Health experts in the New York region say overdiagnosis stems largely from the lack of any simple conclusive test for Lyme disease and the lack of agreement over how frequently the infection persists or recurs. For example, in the early stages, only 40 percent of infected patients will show signs of the disease in blood tests.
Another factor, they say, is greed: Some Lyme-disease hot lines refer patients to a network of doctors and clinics that will readily, and often wrongly, diagnose Lyme disease in return for payments from companies that sell in-home treatment.
"The bulk of the evidence suggests that Lyme disease is overdiagnosed and that many of those given the diagnosis do not have the disease and will not benefit from antibiotic treatment," said a committee of medical experts appointed by the New Jersey Health Department after a report last February on problems at the Jersey Shore Medical Center.
While the committee acknowledged that in individual cases, "underdiagnosis can be just as serious a problem as overdiagnosis," it said the greater number of patients risk hazardous side effects of "antibiotics given for a disease they do not have."
The issue has become public and political. On one side are patient advocates, drug companies and a small number of practicing doctors who favor long-term antibiotic treatment for chronic infections. On the other are physicians and research scientists and insurance companies that generally stop paying for intravenous antibiotics after 28 days; all point out the absence of any published research on such treatments.
In New Jersey, a bill requiring insurers to cover intravenous antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease indefinitely passed the State Assembly, despite warnings by the State Health Commissioner that the law would encourage potentially damaging treatment. The bill, which has not reached the Senate, is expected to be reintroduced in amended form next session.
The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are carried by deer ticks that bite humans, leading to a bull's-eye rash and flu-like symptoms, like fatigue and muscle aches. Oral antibiotics usually clear up the infection. Ignored, it can produce cardiac and neurological problems, including facial paralysis, and later, arthritis or inflammation of the brain or nerves. Eventually, some doctors say, the disease can cause permanent tissue damage and weaken the immune system.
Even at this late stage, many doctors stress, the disease can be detected through an examination of spinal fluid and other tests and often can be cured by a month of intravenous antibiotics, and this is the generally recommended approach. Most doctors now say, however, that this treatment may fail in rare instances where Lyme disease has infected the central nervous system.
In 1992, 9,677 cases of Lyme were reported to the Centers for Disease Control, mostly in East Coast states north of Pennsylvania.
 
Near-Fatal Complications
 Dr. Allen C. Steere of Tufts University, who first identified Lyme disease in 1975, wrote recently that more than three quarters of the patients referred to his Lyme Disease Clinic at the New England Medical Center and the majority of 100 patients at a New Jersey Lyme referral center were misdiagnosed and given unnecessary antibiotics.
"Lyme disease has become an overdiagnosed and overtreated illness," he wrote in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
Dr. Gary P. Wormser, director of the Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center at the Westchester County Medical Center, wrote in The Southern Medical Journal about a patient who was convinced he had Lyme disease. He nearly died of complications from intravenous antibiotics, including a sharp drop in white blood cells, ulcers and inflammation of the colon. Later tests showed a brain tumor, Dr. Wormser said in an interview.
The most dramatic misdiagnosis, Federal officials said, was at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune.
Epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control visited the hospital after noticing an unusual number of students in Monmouth and Ocean counties were receiving home instruction. They say they discovered a preponderance of children, most of them girls, in whom Lyme disease had been diagnosed without supporting evidence and who were out of school receiving intravenous antibiotics. State Senator John O. Bennett, visiting the hospital's pediatric unit near that time, said that "every pediatric patient was a Lyme patient."
The Centers for Disease Control's report described the consequences of the doctors' frequent recourse to intravenous antibiotics: 14 gallbladder removals and 29 bloodstream infections in 22 children. Hospital records showed that only 2 to 3 percent of the children under care met the standards of confirmed criteria for Lyme disease, David T. Dennis, the report's author, said in an interview.
Patient advocates and parents of some of the children who lost their gallbladders defended the hospital and criticized the centers. In letters to the Governor's Lyme Disease Advisory Council, an advocacy group for Lyme-disease patients, parents spoke of their children's suffering. They said the hospital's pediatric neurologist had warned that gallstones can be a side effect of ceftriaxone, the intravenous antibiotic that some children took for almost six months.
Lorraine Garvilla, whose daughter Meghan lost her gallbladder, wrote, "The discomfort from the gallbladder surgery was minor compared to what Meghan has suffered from Lyme disease."
 
Defending the Treatment
 The pediatrician, Dr. Dorothy N. Pietrucha, defended the diagnoses and treatment. She said that the documentation of Lyme disease was often in her office records rather than at the hospital, and she said the gallbladder removals and bloodstream infections were not numerous, given the 1,352 treated for Lyme disease during the period reviewed. "I have a lot of patients who have done well with long-term treatment," she said.
And Ken Fordyce, the father and husband of Lyme-disease patients and the chairman of the Governor's Lyme Disease Advisory Council, criticized the Centers for Disease Control's report. Though Dr. Elliott Frank, chief of infectious diseases at the hospital, said he believed the study had followed standard guidelines, Mr. Fordyce called the research "slipshod" and said "the C.D.C. owes the people of New Jersey an apology."
"In most cases, the parents made the decisions and said they were pleased with the quality of care they received," he said.
Dr. Frank said the hospital has begun urging patients to seek second opinions before beginning long-term intravenous treatment.
Health officials are also concerned by what they say is profiteering among certain physicians who may have a financial stake in prescribing home intravenous therapy.
Before his license was suspended in September, Dr. Vithaldis Shah, who has offices in West Milford and Pompton Plains, N.J., received $150 to $175 a week for each patient he referred for treatment to at least five companies that provide in-home treatment, according to the findings of a State Board of Medical Examiners administrative hearing.
Accounts of the 22 cases reviewed at the hearing show repeated instances of falsifying records to make a case for Lyme-disease treatment. They also show instances of diagnosing Lyme disease from symptoms as vague as swollen glands, neck stiffness and fatigue, or headaches and pelvic pain.
 
'Room for Disagreement'
 The board rejected Dr. Shah's contention that he was simply treating patients with a controversial, yet valid, approach to the disease. "Just because we have identified an area of medicine where there is room for disagreement does not mean that all manners of approach are acceptable," it said.
Chris Hyde, a lawyer for Dr. Shah, said the physician was "following an accepted medical school of thought" and planned a "vigorous defense" at his coming trial.
The New Jersey bill would double to 56 days the period insurance companies must pay for the antibiotic treatment. After that, it would require a second opinion to continue treatment. Patient-advocate groups say a new law is needed to stop the financial devastation Lyme patients face because of the cost of home intravenous treatment.
"The insurance companies are making an economic decision," Mr. Fordyce said. "They have rejected IV care beyond 28 days, but they will allow oral care beyond 28 days. Let's get our science straight -- either the bug is eliminated or it's not."
Charles M. Cutler, vice president of medical services for the Prudential Insurance Company, acknowledged that oral antibiotics, more commonly prescribed and inexpensive, tend not to come under the same scrutiny as intravenous medications. He pointed to the absence of published studies showing benefits from the use of long-term antibiotics in large numbers by Lyme patients.
The outgoing New Jersey Health Commissioner, Bruce Siegel, warned that the legislative cure may create new maladies. Dr. Siegel, who has joined the Giuliani administration as head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, noted the complications of long-term treatment at the Jersey Shore Medical Center. "If we just give it a green light I don't think we're helping anyone," he said.

HEADLINE: Rates Rise As Inflation Fears Grow

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday and interest rates rose as continuing evidence that the economy was recovering at a firm pace heightened fears of resurgent inflation.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond fell $10 for each $1,000 of face value and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose from 6.34 percent on Friday to 6.41 percent, the highest yield since mid-August. 
 With a crop of recent data indicating that economic growth in the fourth quarter might exceed the 2.9 percent recorded in the third, and that the current inflation rate of about 3 percent might also rise, the bond market has caught a case of the jitters lately. The uncertainty has been heightened by the impending release of significant year-end economic data, including December employment figures on Friday.
 
Market 'Ready to React'
 "After being in the doldrums for a couple of weeks, the market is ready to react to the economic data we get this week," Darwin Beck, an economist with First Boston, said.
He said that the market's expectation was for further signs of economic strength, a possibility that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a pre-emptive strike against higher inflation.
"The market will be looking for some reaction from the Federal Reserve Bank sooner, rather than later," Mr. Beck said. "However, the Fed will have to have pretty clear evidence on the economy's first-quarter performance before it takes any steps to change monetary policy. And that evidence will not come until late in the first quarter."
Analysts cautioned that yesterday's moves came on a day still affected by slow holiday-related trading. Traders said the selling began when bonds futures broke below a technical support level.
Two reports of economic strength yesterday affected trading. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its survey of manufacturing activity in December rose for the third straight month. But some market participants had expected a stronger rise, which had weakened Treasury prices before the survey's release.
Prices bounced slightly higher when the weaker-than-expected manufacturing numbers were released, but retreated after the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose 1.8 percent in November, more than expected.
 
Construction Spending Up Again

 
 Analysts at MMS International noted that the gain in construction spending was the seventh straight advance. They pointed to significant acceleration in both residential and nonresidential spending since the middle of 1993.
The market also came under pressure from the Commodity Research Bureau's report that its daily index of commodity prices continued to tick higher over the last few sessions, aided by hefty gains in precious metals and energy components. Yesterday, gold prices rose $2.80, to $394.70 an ounce, and crude oil for February delivery was up 39 cents, to $14.56 a barrel.
Analysts said data within the purchasing managers' report might provide clues to Friday's employment data. The employment component of the purchasing managers' report rose in December to 49.2 percent from 46.1 percent in November. A reading above 48 percent over time generally translates into a rise in the Government's manufacturing employment data.
Matthew F. Alexy, a Government trading specialist with First Boston, cautioned that yesterday's market might not have provided a true indication of its general direction. He said the activity might be a continuation of last week's selloff and that it came on a day of less than total participation.
"We did not see a significant number of buyers or sellers," he said. "This market is running only on 40 percent power; last week it was 20 percent."
Treasury Auctions
 The weekly Treasury bill auctions of three- and six-month maturities drew decent demand at the average rate of 3.10 percent and 3.29 percent, respectively. The level of noncompetitive bids was slightly better than at recent auctions, at $1.322 billion for the three-month issue and $960 million for the six-month issue.
Analysts said the smaller volume of bills being sold this week, down $800 million from last week, helped demand at the auctions. They also said investors might be taking a defensive posture, buying more short-term maturities and selling long-term issues until the direction of interest rates becomes clearer.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Frustrating Fight for Acceptance;
For Older Job Seekers, a Sad Refrain: 'I'd Love to Hire You, but You Just Won't Fit In'

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
Despite a decade-long push by private and government organizations to market older people as reliable and mature workers, advocates for people 55 and older say their efforts have largely failed. They say that employers continue to view age not in terms of experience or stability but as deterioration and staleness.
People who have worked to promote the older labor force say that 10 years ago they were confident that, through intensive public relations and educational efforts, American businesses would recognize and harness what they argued are the skills of older workers. Although it is impossible to tally how much money went toward that end, people who work in the field estimated that tens of millions of dollars were spent nationwide on studies, job fairs, seminars for executives and advertising. 
 Libby Mandel is 69 years old and has been looking for a job for two years. She has taken advantage of many of these programs, going to computer classes, resume writing workshops and job fairs, and thrusting herself forward as an experienced secretary who had, for 25 years, skillfully handled the paper, telephone and student traffic at Seward Park High School in Manhattan.
"These senior programs were all supposed to show people that age doesn't matter," said Mrs. Mandel, in a voice more resigned than hopeful. "But it does. It still does. It's like a handicap. Really."
 
Anger and Frustration
 Now people running these programs, as well as older workers themselves, say they are frustrated and angry at how little headway they have made in changing attitudes and hiring practices.
To be sure, all agree, the recession has not helped. But in many cases, they say, the burden of age in the job market is as profound as those of race and gender.
The Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which was enacted in 1967 and amended several times since, prohibits any form of discrimination in the workplace due to a person's age. The law now eliminates mandatory retirement ages for all but very select positions, including top-level executives.
Employers may not ask a job applicant's age or consider it when making a hiring decision, except where it is a so-called "bona fide occupational qualification." An example of that would be a job like construction, where physical strength is an issue, but even then a fit and robust older worker would be protected. The fact that a job is entry-level or that a company envisions training someone for a longterm career track would be irrelevant to the law.
But it is too often relevant to employers, complain advocates for older workers, although proving age discrimination in employment is very difficult.
People like Mrs. Mandel who have journeyed futilely about the job market say that they can actually feel themselves dissolve from vital individuals into antique stereotypes as they sit before interviewers who, careful not to run afoul of discrimination laws, try surreptitiously to find out applicants' ages and couch their biases in the most deferential terms.
"When I look at myself, I see a funny person basically, a helper; I'm enthusiastic," Mrs. Mandel said. "But when I talk to these recruiters or go on interviews, I know what they see is an old lady. They don't have to see my date of birth. They see the gray hair, they see the wrinkles, and they think, 'Old.' "
The job market, while showing some recent signs of recovery, is still a grim odyssey for most unemployed people, but it is particularly so for older people.
Statistically, the situation for older workers in the New York region is significantly worse than the country as a whole. Nationwide in 1992, about 738,000 people age 55 and older were unemployed and actively looking for jobs, a rise of about 51 percent in five years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the New York area, those ranks swelled nearly 2 1/2 times in the same period -- from 28,000 to 67,000 -- due, in large measure, to the corporate reorganization that took place here in the 1980's and the subsequent recession.
Still, the jobless rate for older workers -- 4.8 percent in the United States and 6.8 percent in the New York region in 1992 -- is lower than that of the general work force. But experts say those figures reflect the stability of workers who have had steady jobs and have not been forced back into the marketplace. The numbers also don't reflect older workers who, put off by dismal prospects, have stopped looking for jobs.
 
'Untapped Resource'
 There are, to be sure, some companies that have responded and have reached out to aging workers. But experts say that the "untapped resource," as one report referred to workers 55 years and older, remains largely that -- untapped.
"I wish I could say that because of all these case studies, companies are running out in droves to hire older workers," said Michael Barth, a labor economist and senior vice president for ICF, a Washington consulting firm that specializes in labor market studies. "But if anything, they are finding more ways to get rid of them and the reason is because there is a lot of pure bias, of behaving toward older workers totally in the context of their age, not their ability."
People 55 and older are increasingly looking for jobs for many reasons. People are living longer and healthier and have a desire and ability to keep active professionally for longer.
In addition, in a period of massive corporate layoffs and downsizing, older workers are frequently induced into taking early retirement, afraid that if they don't accept severance packages one year, they will be let go without any safety net the following year. But the money is usually not enough for them to live on, considering average life expectancy and a troubled economy.
 
Studies Offer Praise
 A variety of studies -- some of which surveyed human resources executives at hundreds of firms, others of which focused on particular companies -- have found that workers age 55 and older are more reliable, have lower rates of absenteeism, higher productivity and were just as easy to retrain as their younger colleagues.
But the prejudices against older workers are so ingrained, people who have studied the issue say, they defy logic and hard data.
"In the beginning, I was more optimistic that if we corrected the stereotype, if we could document productivity, that it would help change attitudes," said Karen Davis, the executive vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation based in New York that recently completed a five-year, $4 million study of workers over 55.
"I really thought the reports would have had more of a positive impact. But we are running against the economic trends and some deep-rooted bias. I still think it may turn around, but it's clearly going to be an uphill struggle to make it happen."
At a recent job fair for older workers at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan -- promisingly named "Ability is Ageless" -- participants walked from booth to booth, leaving their resumes with recruiters and commiserating with each other about the indignities of job-hunting at their age.
 
Handling the Age Question
 "I'm ashamed to admit it, but I dye my hair, like a lady, to give myself a more youthful appearance," said one man, a 62-year-old former salesman from Flushing who declined to give his name. "And I wear bright ties. They should think I'm with it, and not stuffy." He fingered a yellow swath of silk with aqua crests and sighed, "So far, it hasn't helped."
Similar laments are repeated at job fairs in other cities and at workshops and training programs designed to make aging workers more competitive. At AgeWorks, a 16-week skills-improvement course run by the New York City Department for the Aging, several women compared euphemisms for "you're too old" that they had encountered in their job quests.
"They say that you're overqualified, even if you're willing to take a lower-level job," said Sara Lerner, a former bookkeeper from Riverdale, who, like many people interviewed, would give her name, but not her age.
"That's the main one they use," said Karen Halpern, who was given early retirement recently from her job at I.B.M.
"There's also, 'I'd love to hire you, but you just won't fit in,' " said Helen Miller, of Ridgewood, Queens, who was candid about her 66 years and is looking for clerical work. "They also get around asking you your age by asking what year you graduated, or asking to see your driver's license."
If they do get hired, many older workers find that it is for a job that is far lower in pay and stature than their previous position.
For 25 years, Cecil Frazier was a chef at the Gloucester House, a pricey midtown restaurant where he was known for his lobster bisque. Now he grills burgers and fries chicken for a T.G.I. Friday's restaurant in Manhattan, and in spite of that drop in status, he is grateful.
Most of the people he worked with before the Gloucester House closed in 1992 are still looking for work, their years of experience proving no lure to potential employers. "They're working 20 years and more and can't get no jobs," said Mr. Frazier, who is 60 and searched nearly a year before finding work. "But the younger guys, now they got the jobs. They've got no experience, but they got the jobs."

 
Signs of Change
 There are some in the field who say they are optimistic that the trend is beginning to turn. But those voices are all but drowned out by the once hopeful -- and now befuddled -- advocates in the field, who say they are at a loss trying to figure out how to translate their information into jobs.
In a study issued last year, the American Association of Retired Persons and the Society for Human Resource Management surveyed about 1,000 managers in a range of businesses and found that even though "workers over the age of 50 are admired for their skills and their work habits" they are nonetheless "underutilized and undervalued."
"Everybody saw them as reliable, like a Saint Bernard," said Dr. Martin Sicker, director of Work Force Programs for A.A.R.P. "They love them, but they won't hire them and we really couldn't get at why. None of the negative stereotypes show up in the answers, but even positive stereotypes cause pigeonholing.
"They use words like 'mature' and 'dependable' but they don't look at individual skills and characters. They lump older workers together in a way that they don't younger ones, and any buzz words set off alarms for me. It does just come down to 'ageism' and we haven't found a way to crack it."

HEADLINE: Rebels Determined 'to Build Socialism' in Mexico

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALTAMIRANO, Mexico, Jan. 3

 BODY:
As Government spotter planes buzzed circles in the gray sky and young policemen shivered in the local jail, soldiers of the peasant army that captured Altamirano and three other towns on Saturday morning swarmed over the squat concrete town hall today, smashing it apart with sledgehammers.
"The orders we have are to knock it down," said a leader of the rebels holding this rural town in southern Mexico, a thin 20-year-old who identified himself only as Jesus. "Our thinking is that we have to build socialism." 
 That the cold war had ended seemed to mean nothing to the hundreds of insurgents who stunned their countrymen Saturday by announcing themselves as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and declaring war on the Government. The struggle they describe is the timeless one of poor Indians against "the rich," the new world they envision being one where things would simply be better.
 
Confusion Replaces Muscle
 Government forces appeared mostly to avoid any offensive against the rebels today after at least 84 people were reported killed in the seizures of the four towns and the fighting that ensued as the rebels retreated from three of them -- Las Margaritas, Ocosingo and San Cristobal de las Casas -- on Sunday.
The guerrillas' military weakness was obvious today along a 30-mile stretch of rural highway that remained more or less under their control. From quiet conversations with townspeople and villagers, the rebels' sway seemed a product less of any considered support than of confusion and fear.
Yet the mere sight of scores of Indian men and women, staked out along the road with assault rifles, was a remarkable measure of the despair that has taken root in this land since Spaniards began to conquer the Maya almost five centuries ago.
"There is no longer any way to survive the situation in Mexico," said Jesus, who described himself as the child of poor peasants from another part of Chiapas state, near the border with Guatemala.
 
'This Is Where We Live'
 "There is no work, no land, no education," Jesus said. "There is no way to change that in elections," he added, echoing the proclamations of his superiors without seeming to mimic them. "This is not going to be a war of two or three years. This could be a war of 25 or 30 years."
When a reporter asked the dozen men clustered around Jesus whether they were prepared for such a sacrifice, no one spoke up. Asked whether they wanted to go home, one said, "This is where we live."
Physically beautiful and dismally poor, Chiapas is known for the lush jungle ruins left by the Maya, the Baroque colonial churches left by the Spaniards and the deep inequities that have prevailed since the cultures met.
 
Near Servitude
 Even after the 1910 revolution, the Indians often continued to live in almost feudal servitude to the landowners. The state's riches, from pine forests and tropical farmlands to vast cattle ranches, were controlled by a small clique of European and mixed blood.
The Indians were controlled politically by village bosses, called caciques, who were fully integrated into the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico for 65 years.
It has since become a standard photo opportunity for candidates and Presidents of the governing party to appear in the brilliantly colored ponchos that Indians in many villages still wear over their jeans or skirts.
But even as President after President have declared their deep commitments to the Indians, the social and economic problems have eased only somewhat, and fights over scarce arable land have kept poor peasants and farmers in perpetual conflict, often with the Catholic Church and the Government as their respective proxies.
Chiapas ranks last among Mexican states in households with electricity (66.9 percent), last in the number of children under 14 who attend school (71.3 percent) and last in the number of people over 14 who can read (69.6 percent). It is fourth from the bottom in the percentage of households with access to sewers (41.2 percent) or running water (58.4 percent).
The state has also consistently earned one of the country's worst records of human rights abuse, and advocates for the Indians, most notably the outspoken Bishop of San Cristobal, Samuel Ruiz, have accused the Government frequently of torture. Such assertions emerged again last April after hundreds of soldiers swept through Indian villages seeking the killers of two officers, touching off initial rumors of guerrilla activity.
In an interview in San Cristobal, Bishop Ruiz's spokesman, the Rev. Gonzalo Ituarte, said the poverty and political domination of Indians had eased in recent years. But he argued that the situation had also grown more volatile as a new concentration of the region's wealth grew more apparent.
 
In Rebellion Since 1712
 "Any Indian who has a tiny little hovel and one change of clothes comes to the city now and sees new cars and beautiful hotels and all of these fine things, and they are not insensitive to that," Father Ituarte said. "The control of the caciques has been reduced. The big landholdings have been reduced. The problem is, these things continue to exist at the door of the 21st century."
Periodic rebellions date to 1712, when Tzeltal Indians rose up after being forced to pay taxes to build a church and hospital in San Cristobal. But despite some rumors earlier this year of guerrilla activity in the sparsely populated pine forests around Ocosingo, another of the towns seized by the Zapatista army, the new war seemed unfathomable even for many of the people who found themselves surrounded by the rebels today.
"Look at this," said Francisco Gomez Sanchez, 53, a teacher in the farming town of Oxchuc, sweeping his hand toward a spontaneous gathering of hundreds of townspeople who seemed to have been stranded by the fighting. "There are no big landholders here, no rich people. How do you explain that they burned down the town hall?"
In their proclamation of war, the Zapatista army, named for the peasant hero of the 1910 Revolution, Emiliano Zapata, offered any number of reasons.
Their struggle, they wrote, was "for work, land, housing, food, health care, education, independence, freedom, democracy, justice and peace." They also decried environmental degradation and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they called a "death sentence" for Indians handed down by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
 
'The People Must Rule'
 A 20-year-old rebel leader who gave his nom de guerre as Eliseo said the goals could only be achieved by the fall of Mr. Salinas and his party. "The people must rule Mexico," he said.
Another guerrilla, in a ski mask, with a semi-automatic rifle and a walkie-talkie, who would identify himself only as a 28-year-old captain, insisted vehemently that the rebels had received no outside support, as some Government officials have suggested, but were fighting "for socialism like the Cubans have, but better."
Some peasants, like Romeo Jimenez, said the act of rebellion was enough to bring their sympathy.
"We Indians are the conquered ones," said Mr. Jimenez, 32, a farmer in San Cristobal. "The Government always says they will help us, and they never pay attention. We don't know those men," he said of the rebels. "But we understand them."

U.S. Says Americans Safe
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Reuters) -- The United States Ambassador to Mexico has sent five aides to southern Mexico to assess the situation, the State Department said today.
"We understand that all Americans who have wanted to leave that area have been able to do so recently, and we have had some direct contact with American citizens who indicate that they are safe," said the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry.

HEADLINE: Free Trade Era Begins, Uneventfully, at Border

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTAY MESA, Calif., Jan. 3

 BODY:
He was only dimly aware of it, but Tomas Estrada helped make trade history this morning.
The young truck driver from Tijuana, Mexico, wheeled up to the United States Customs dock here with a white truck filled with 6,368 women's blouses, 1,657 pants, 3,910 shorts and 3,974 girls' head bands -- all assembled in Mexico and destined for Los Angeles. They were among the first cargoes of merchandise to enter the United States at reduced tariffs under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 But for Mr. Estrada and many others whose livelihood is rooted in border traffic and commerce, this day was not notably different than any other, and if anyone expected a rush to take advantage of the new, lowered duties, that did not happen.
With most manufacturers just reopening after the holidays, there was little ready to be shipped. And experts predicted that the free-trade accord would not produce sudden changes. Trade was liberalized over the last six years, and red tape already was reduced by other means, said Liliana Ferrer, consul for economic affairs and special assistant to the Consul General of Mexico in Los Angeles.
 
A Slow Day
 The port of entry here, on a sunny, dusty mesa 23 miles east of San Diego, is normally the second-busiest commercial port of entry on the Mexican border, after Laredo, Tex. An average of 1,033 trucks from Mexico enter it daily, laden with vegetables, textiles and electronic products made or assembled in Mexico, often from American components. And it was equally slow today eight miles west, at the border crossing between San Ysidro, Calif., and Tijuana, the Mexican port of entry for exports from the United States, where 1,100 trucks a day normally cross.
Nonetheless, this first business day after the agreement formally took effect on Jan. 1 marked a milestone for relations between the United States and Mexico. Though critics say the agreement will destroy American jobs and the environment, backers hail it as a great experiment that will prove an economic boon for Mexico, the United States and Canada.
The warming of trade relations is welcomed on both sides of the border, though tensions remain high over the current crackdown by the United States on illegal immigration.
Even as trade barriers came down, American authorities were continuing to raise barriers against illegal aliens along the Mexican border from Texas to California. In the last few months, American workers have been erecting a 10-foot-high iron border fence north of Tijuana that will stretch 14 miles inland from Imperial Beach, south of San Diego. They are also installing steel pilings 340 feet into the Pacific Ocean to thwart illegal immigrants arriving by boat.
 
The Proponents' Hope
 In retaliation for these actions and for what they call immigrant bashing by politicians in California, Mexican groups in Tijuana organized a boycott of businesses on the American side during the weekend of Nov. 20-21. That caused a drop of 7 percent in legal border crossings and several million dollars in lost business in San Diego, Chula Vista and other American cities where shopkeepers depend heavily on customers from south of the border.
The hope of backers of the trade accord in both countries is that it will create enough jobs in Mexico, which has large areas of high unemployment, to reduce pressures to emigrate. Jorge Bustamante, president of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana, estimated that illegal emigration to the United States would be reduced by 15 to 25 percent after the trade pact has been in force for five years.
Under the trade agreement, Mexican tariffs, which have ranged from about 5 to 20 percent on 4,500 American-made goods like computers and telecommunications equipment, are eliminated immediately; others are to be reduced gradually until nearly all trade barriers come down by the year 2004. Similarly, the lower American duties on Mexican goods like textiles and apparel are to be cut or eliminated.
Rudy M. Camacho, the district director for United States Customs in San Diego, said that even without the trade agreement, Mexican-American trade in the last six to eight years grew 5 to 7 percent a year. That is expected to increase, and Customs is building a large truck-inspection station here.
The trade agreement means no relaxation of Customs inspections, either entering or leaving the United States, Mr. Camacho said, to deter the use of commercial imports to conceal drugs and exports to conceal protected high-tech goods and large amounts of currency.
 
Searching for Contraband
 Inspectors made Mr. Estrada, the Mexican truck driver, go through the arduous process of unloading his entire shipment of women's clothing from their racks and spreading them on a loading dock -- not so much to count the goods for duty purposes as to see if anything was concealed in the load.
The inspectors could not say what duty would be levied on Mr. Estrada's cargo because the duty is not calculated until 10 days later by customs accountants; the shipper is then billed.
One way life may change for Mr. Estrada and other truckers on both sides of the border is that with proper paperwork they will now be able to drive deeper into each other's countries; previously, they had to unload their cargoes near the border for transfer to a domestic carrier.
There was also confusion among those wanting to ship to Mexico. In a small, trailer-like hut in San Ysidro, where trucks bound for Mexico pass through a small opening in the high metal fence that marks the border, Jorge Lopez, who works for the T. J. Serrano customs brokerage firm, sat at a cluttered desk and pondered hundreds of pages of rules that he had just received from Mexico City. Mr. Lopez helps Mexican buyers of American goods cut through the red tape.
"There's a lot of confusion," he said, slapping his forehead in dismay. "They don't know nothing on the Mexican side." What would be the effect of the trade pact on imports into Mexico? "Everybody is waiting," he said. "It's too soon to know."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Deal With North Korea On Atomic Site Inspections Is Near

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
American officials said today that the United States was close to reaching a deal that would allow international monitors to inspect seven nuclear sites in North Korea and end a tense standoff.
Building on progress made in talks last week, the two sides may complete an agreement by the end of this week if North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency settle a few remaining details, said a State Department official who insisted on anonymity. 
 American officials said the two sides still had to work out the inspection procedures. In addition, the officials said Washington wanted North Korea to resume a dialogue with South Korea and wanted the two Governments to exchange envoys, with the goal of insuring that the Korean peninsula remained free of nuclear weapons.
 
'Hopefully Soon'
 At a White House news briefing, Dee Dee Myers, the President's spokeswoman, declined to say whether an agreement was possible this week. "I would be very reluctant to set any kind of deadline on that," she said. "We're making progress, and we'll have an announcement when we have an announcement, hopefully soon."
If North Korea meets Washington's demands, then the United States in return will suspend a joint military exercise that is intended to reinforce South Korea's defenses.
In addition to demanding the one-time inspection of the seven sites, the international atomic agency and the United States are eager for North Korea to agree to let the agency's cameras continuously monitor North Korea's nuclear sites.
Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said at a daily briefing today that "we do expect to have contacts in coming days," and that "there may be more to say somewhat shortly on the subject."
An agreement would be expected to lead to high-level talks in which American officials would press the North Koreans to let international inspectors visit two nuclear waste sites that are off limits to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Those two sites, which are not among the seven under negotiation, could furnish evidence of how much weapons-grade nuclear material North Korea has.
 
Improved Ties Possible
 Washington has proffered improved political and economic ties if North Korea consents to such inspections.
The dispute has divided American officials: the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that North Korea has probably developed one or more bombs, while State Department intelligence experts are not convinced.
Last March, North Korea said it would withdraw from the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. This made American officials worry that North Korea might rush ahead with building nuclear warheads.
One of the sticking points in the dispute is that the United States wants the inspections to be carried out under the aegis of the treaty, but North Korea, insisting that it has withdrawn from the treaty, is demanding that any inspections be performed ad hoc and outside the treaty.
 On Saturday, optimism about an accord increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Il Sung, said Pyongyang and Washington had agreed to a joint statement, which he said indicated that the dispute might be "settled fairly."

HEADLINE: New Haven Mayor Pushes Property-Tax Issue

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Jan. 2

 BODY:
John DeStefano admits to having had qualms about campaigning for mayor last fall on a promise to sue the state.
He would sue, he told voters in New Haven, one of the nation's poorest cities, to overturn the property-tax system that pays for local government in Connecticut. The system, he said, unfairly saddled the city with high taxes that were driving jobs and the middle class to the suburbs. 
 "My initial concern was 'Would it be perceived as pandering to people's miseries in the city by blaming someone else?' " he said.
But now that Mr. DeStefano has taken office, his doubts seem gone. He has become a leading spokesman for a growing number of people who believe Connecticut's reliance on the property tax is harming not just the state's cities, but its entire economy. They are pushing the General Assembly toward a debate on the property tax -- how to make it fairer, how to lighten it for everyone.
Other mayors, legislators, business organizations and municipal lobbying groups are all calling for changes in the local tax that generates nearly 30 percent of all tax revenue in Connecticut. That is more than the state's income tax and sales tax combined and 50 percent more than the national average.
 
Regional Solutions
 "The re-examination of the property tax will take place," said Nicholas Carbone, a former Hartford deputy mayor who heads a state-sponsored institute studying the issue. "The outcome of that is much harder to predict."
Revising the property tax could prove even more controversial than Connecticut's income tax, enacted despite a public uproar three years ago. 
The debate is likely to focus on regional and statewide solutions in a state with no county government, where cities and suburbs often view each other with suspicion. And it would also mean examining how the overall tax burden should be redistributed, when nearly everyone already complains that taxes are too high.
Mr. DeStefano says he would support a statewide property tax, which would equalize the tax among all communities, or regional plans that would share among several communities the tax revenue from new development in all.
 
No Legal Precedent
 Officials in many suburbs have vowed to fight plans that would add any part of their residents' property taxes to the income tax and sales tax they already send to Hartford, for redistribution as aid to the state's cities.
Even filing a lawsuit as a catalyst for serious discussion is daunting. While many courts have overturned property taxes in cases challenging the fairness of a state's school-financing system, the lawyers putting together the New Haven suit say they have no precedent for a case attacking the fundamental fairness of a state's reliance on the local tax.
The state government is also limited in what it can afford in terms of tax relief. "The administration is examining a number of different approaches to the question of how to restructure the property-tax system," said Avice Meehan, spokeswoman for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. "Having said that, no one believes there is the financial wherewithal to undertake any major overhaul."
Experts like Mr. Carbone, who heads the Connecticut Institute for Municipal Studies, say the need for change is driven by the collapse of the Northeast's real-estate market in the late 1980's. The property tax's burden has increasingly shifted to homeowners as commercial construction has halted and as the value of office buildings and other commercial property has fallen.
"Property wealth is rapidly dissipating in Connecticut," Mr. Carbone said. "To have the major source of revenue be the property tax is insane when it's in a state of deterioration."
In New Haven, Mr. DeStefano announced last May that he was preparing a suit to challenge the property tax on the ground that it violated the principle of equal protection under the law. New Haven's municipal services and tax-exempt universities, hospitals and public housing projects serve the entire region, he said, but the reliance on local property taxes make the city's tax rate two to three times as high as its suburbs'.
Mr. DeStefano, a 38-year-old New Haven native who has spent most of his career in city government, has since developed an analysis of the property tax's failings that extends beyond his city to the economic welfare of the metropolitan region and the state. More equitable tax rates, he said, would make the state more competitive and would attract more jobs for everyone.
"This isn't about compensating New Haven at the expense of other towns," he said, perched in a chair in the office on Whalley Avenue where he was piecing together his new administration. "It doesn't have to be a zero-sum game where someone is going to benefit at the expense of somebody else."
His starting point, however, remains the starkly different tax rates among the state's cities and suburbs. In New Haven, the annual tax on a home with a market value of $150,000 is $3,570, while in neighboring North Haven the tax is $2,295.
The owner of a new $15,000 car would pay a $642 tax on it in New Haven, $241 in North Haven. A business with $1 million worth of computers would pay a $42,800 tax on them in New Haven, but only $16,100 in North Haven.
Those differences, Mr. DeStefano said, contribute to the growing segregation and poverty of cities by giving employers and the middle class an incentive to leave. But as the deterioration of cities threatens the vitality of the regions around them, he said, Connecticut will become less able to compete with other parts of the country unless it finds a basis for cooperation among its cities and suburbs.
"When people talked about metropolitan government in the 60's," he said, "the thrust was more efficient delivery of services through economies of scale. I think regionalism now is founded on the fact that for the core city and the towns surrounding it to survive and thrive, they need to work together."
An ally, State Senator Martin M. Looney of New Haven, has proposed a statewide property-tax rate on motor vehicles. The effective annual tax rate on vehicles, according to the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, ranges from 5.01 percent in Waterbury to 0.74 percent in Lyme, so that a $15,000 car is taxed at $751 in Waterbury and at $111 in Lyme.
"It seemed that the equity of property-tax reform beginning with the motor-vehicle tax would be clear," Mr. Looney said. "While you might be able to argue that the value of homes might vary greatly depending on location, it seems clear that a car is a car wherever it is."
Mr. DeStefano said he hopes that legislators will begin a serious discussion of tax revision in 1994. If they do not, he said, a lawsuit against the state will be filed in both state and Federal courts. But he would prefer to make the case to his suburban neighbors that equalizing tax rates would unlock the door to new jobs for the entire region.
The region needs a new industry, he argues, and the most promising is biotechnology, nourished by the research going on at the Yale School of Medicine. But the city's high property taxes discourage investment.
"There are some businesses that should be in Branford, or North Haven or Wallingford," he said, naming three suburbs. "But if a business needs a harbor or a rail system or to be next to the School of Medicine, then it needs to be here, and it shouldn't have a disincentive to come because of the property-tax structure."
Suburban officials are leery of any New Haven initiative that would affect their property taxes. In his own election campaign, Anthony Rescigno, the North Haven First Selectman, vowed to fight a city lawsuit.
 
View From Suburbs
 "The people of North Haven already pay more than their fair share to the state in terms of income tax and sales tax that then gets funneled back to the cities," Mr. Rescigno said.
"I think that's O.K.," he continued, "but to suggest that we should be paying more is not O.K. We would fight it legally, and that's unfortunate, because we want to see New Haven thrive."
In Hamden, where the tax rate is nearly as high as New Haven's, Mayor Lillian D. Clayman won re-election over an opponent who campaigned against regional taxes, but she is cautious about talk of regionalism. "It's become a catch-all phrase, and it means a lot of different things," she said.
Hamden's taxes are high in part, she said, because residents are willing to pay for good schools, parks and other services. "If you're going to use regionalization to have other people use our services without paying for them, we don't want that burden," she said.
"Regionalization is something legislators have to grapple with in this session," she said. "I'm not sure they will, because it's an election year. But someone has to define what it is."

HEADLINE: U.S. Approves Plan To Reduce Fishing Off of New England

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Jan. 3

 BODY:
Hoping to stem the collapse of fish stocks off New England, Federal officials today approved a plan to reduce fishing of some species by 50 percent over the next five to seven years.
The fishing management plan will impose a moratorium on new commercial fishing licenses, limit the amount of time boats can spend at sea and prohibit two boats from working together to pull a single large net. 
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who approved the plan, said in Washington that he would also propose $2.5 million in economic aid for Northeastern communities that depend on the fishing industry.
 
Hurting Fishermen
 Fishermen and dealers will also be required to buy electronic equipment to help report catches. The data will be used for enforcement and scientific research.
The new rules, many of which take effect immediately, cover boats that fish in American-controlled waters off New England. The rules are expected to have a major impact on coastal communities in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine, officials said.
The National Marine Fisheries director, Rolland A. Schmitten, acknowledged that the restrictions would hurt New England fishermen but warned that further steps might be needed to protect dwindling groundfish stocks.
Stocks of cod, yellowtail flounder and haddock -- the principal groundfish species -- have been hit hard by overfishing.
"This plan calls for measures that impose significant restrictions, but if we fail to act now the resource will be lost and the future economic base of many New England communities will be undermined," Mr. Schmitten said in a statement.
The groundfish management plan was approved by Secretary Brown the same day that an emergency ban went into effect on haddock fishing in the United States-controlled portion of the Georges Bank in the Atlantic Ocean off the New England coast.
That ban, imposed a month earlier than usual, is intended to give greater protection to spawning haddock by increasing the area, to 2,600 square miles from 800 square miles, historically designated off limits to fishing.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Federated's move on Macy's raises more questions than answers about the retailers' media buying.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
FOR decades, New Yorkers had a catch phrase they delighted in using when asked to share a secret: "Does Macy's tell Gimbels?"
Gimbels, sad to say, has been closed since 1986. Yet now Macy's might be telling Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and Stern's. 
 That could be the result of an agreement announced by the parent of those retail chains, Federated Department Stores, to pay $449.3 million to acquire a stake in R. H. Macy & Company. Federated's goal in buying half of a secured claim against Macy, which has been operating under Federal bankruptcy protection, is to take control of its Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin units and create the nation's biggest department store retailer.
If such a merger comes to pass -- and that is, of course, a rather large if -- the advertising and media implications would be enormous. Executives at agencies, as well as executives at the print and broadcast media organizations that carry department store advertising, cautioned yesterday that it was far too soon for definitive conclusions. Their initial reactions, though, were decidedly mixed.
"I'm not sure what it means," said a leading media executive in New York, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "But you always get nervous when there's a concentration of power."
Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst who follows media stocks for Paine Webber in New York, disagreed.
"Having a healthy retailer is a good thing, no matter what else happens," he said. "If I'm a newspaper-space salesman, or calling on Macy's from a radio or TV station, I'd rather be talking to people who are planning for the future and not worried about being out of a job next week."
As a result, Mr. Gottesman asserted, the media could offset any losses suffered if a combined Federated-Macy "qualified for additional discounts" by buying larger amounts of advertising space and time.
There could be additional positive consequences of a financially stronger Macy's, he said: "If Macy's is better capitalized, it becomes a stronger competitor. That could very likely evoke or trigger a competitive response from stores outside the Federated orbit." Thus, retailers like Lord & Taylor might also increase ad spending.
But an important media executive intimately familiar with New York retailing, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, disputed that.
Bloomingdale's and Macy's "are the two goliaths who drive each other," the executive said. "To the extent a single corporate entity would lower the temperature, it's not good."
"You'd have enormous economic clout concentrated with a very shrewd retailer," the executive added, "and it would use that clout to squeeze vendors, whether they sell clothing or advertising."
Kenneth T. Berents, who follows media stocks for Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, agreed. "Every time department stores merge, it reverberates into shudders in the newspaper industry," he said. "When you take two competitors and combine them into one, they still do advertising, though not at the breakneck pace they did before."
The crucial issue for media organizations in local markets where both Federated and Macy are strong, he added, like Atlanta and New York, "is that if Federated gets control of Macy's, how many stores will get shut to get profits up?"

 Richard N. Costello, president and chief operating officer at TBWA Advertising in New York, the agency for Bloomingdale's, was far more sanguine.
Plans to merge Macy's into Federated's holdings are "splendiferous," he said, likening the challenges faced by Macy's to those confronting Bloomingdale's, which awarded his agency its account in March.
"This is a store that's an institution," he said, "but needs to redefine itself and what it wants to become. You want a statement that captures that it's something quite terrific but that people ought to take another look at it if they haven't shopped there in the last few days, weeks, months."
TBWA is working on a campaign for Bloomingdale's, which could begin running in the spring, that Mr. Costello described as "an image repositioning, redefining Bloomingdale's, while still being very careful to sell merchandise."
The agency for Macy's is Lintas New York, which introduced a huge campaign in April 1991 carrying the theme "The magic of Macy's. We're a part of your life." Macy's, which spent about $30 million on advertising in 1990, said at the time that it would raise that figure fivefold to promote the image-burnishing message of the Lintas campaign. But its bankruptcy proceedings forced Macy to drastically curtail image-oriented ads in favor of those intended to quickly move merchandise, which are being created in-house.
"The account is inactive," said F. Stone Roberts, president and chief operating officer at Lintas New York. "But if retail sales pick up, and real estate improves, and Federated gets involved, it could become a good opportunity for us."
He paused, then added, "There's a lot of 'ifs' there."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Cold Forecast for Florida Pushes Orange Juice Up 8%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Orange juice futures jumped 8 percent yesterday, the largest single-day gain in more than two years, on forecasts for a crop-damaging freeze in Florida.
Gains in orange juice and crude oil led the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities to its highest level in three years. The index, a gauge for inflation, was a point higher at 227.34. 
 Meteorologists said two cold fronts were headed south and could bring freezing temperatures to Florida's orange groves as soon as tomorrow.
 
'A Little Enthusiastic'
 "Temperatures could fall as low as 28 degrees," said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president at the Weather Services Corporation in Bedford, Mass. "That's not damaging unless it stays that cold for a few days. There's always that potential, but I think the market may have been a little enthusiastic."
Orange juice for March delivery closed 8.5 cents higher at 115.75 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Not all weather services agree about the severity of the temperatures, said Court Turner, an analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons in Winter Haven, Fla., making the rise mainly speculative.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil prices soared on improved demand for gasoline and heating oil and on speculation that the members of OPEC would hold an emergency meeting to try to halt the 32 percent plunge in crude prices since March.
With Gulf Coast refineries shutting for annual maintenance, inventories should start to fall and prices rise, traders said. With gasoline at its lowest price in real terms since the end of World War II, traders rushed to buy contracts yesterday.
The Dow Jones News Service, citing an unnamed senior official at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the group would consider moving its meeting scheduled for March 25 to late January or early February.
Crude oil for delivery in February settled 39 cents higher at $14.56 a barrel; unleaded gasoline for February jumped 1.20 cents, to 41.20 cents a gallon. Heating oil for February rose 0.69 cent, to 45.21 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Signs of Stronger Economy Help to Send Dollar Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most currencies yesterday in response to more positive American economic news, including a national purchasing managers' survey that indicated the manufacturing sector was growing.
Gold prices also ended higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, gained $2.80 to settle at $394.70 an ounce. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index rose to 57.9 percent in December from 55.7 in November. A continual reading of more than 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector is expanding.
"There's a spreading understanding that the U.S. economy is going to be stronger than previously thought," William Arnold, chief foreign exchange dealer at Chemical Bank, said.
A growing economy helps the dollar in two ways: Investors buy dollars to invest in expanding American businesses, and investors believe the stronger economy will push up interest rates, providing a better return on some investments.
In contrast, many traders are guessing that the Bundesbank of Germany will lower interest rates at its meeting on Thursday. In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7434 German marks, from 1.7388 marks on Friday.
The dollar continued to rise against the Japanese yen, ending at 112.73 yen in New York, up from 111.85 yen on Friday. Traders said part of the continuing rise was a result of the bleak short-term outlook for the Japanese economy.
The dollar retreated, however, against the Canadian dollar. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.3138 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3218. Fund managers bought the Canadian currency for technical reasons, judging it undervalued, Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, said.
Markets in Tokyo, London and Canada were closed yesterday for holidays.
The British pound fell in New York to $1.4750, from $1.4778 on Friday.
On the Comex, silver for current delivery jumped 13.3 cents, closing at $5.220 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Consumers Let Good Times Roll

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
As the American economy heads into the new year, it is consumers -- rather than business or government -- who are fueling growth. But while most economists expect consumers to slow down at least a little this year, most forecasters say their spending should help sustain the economic expansion in 1994.
Despite white-collar layoffs, higher taxes and cuts in military spending, little has dampened Americans' eagerness in recent months to buy everything from washers to wall units -- as well as the houses to put them in. 
 And retailers are stretching to accommodate their demand.
In Raleigh, N.C., Frank R. Anderson Jr. kept the doors of the Sir Walter Chevrolet Company open all day on New Year's Eve, New Year's Day and Sunday, too, so that the pickups, four-wheel drives and Camaros could keep heading for customers' driveways. "When the good times roll," Mr. Anderson said, "you've got to roll with them."
In Irvington, N.Y., Pamela O'Keefe, a realtor at the William B. May Company, had customers asking to see co-ops on the afternoon of New Year's Eve. "December is usually a slow month," she said, "but clients are hearing that other people are buying homes and they don't want to be left behind."
And in San Francisco, Ruth Owades, chief executive of Calyx & Corolla, a fresh-flower catalogue company, said the holiday season was more frantic than usual. "Everything kind of happened at the last minute," she said, estimating that her company sent 30 percent more flowers than in the previous Christmas season.
"Everybody was waiting for some positive signs from the economy," she said. "Once they saw them, they pulled out all the stops and felt good about the spending."
Recent upbeat reports show that confidence, retail spending, home buying and hiring are all up. In fact, consumers, who were expected to be full of angst and relatively subdued in 1993, accounted for most of the economy's growth in the second half of the year. Their spending has been rising at about a 4 percent annual rate in the last two quarters, while their outlays on new housing have zoomed up at roughly a 15 percent rate, economists now figure.
Although last year's spending spurt was stronger than expected, it was not as strong as the consumer rebounds in the expansions of the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, when 5 percent annual spending growth was typical.
Still, while forecasters had predicted some pickup in spending in the second half, they did not expect households to play the leading role in carrying the expansion.
"You had people selling the idea that Americans were going to stop spending and go back to sitting on Goodwill furniture in their hand-knit sweaters," David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, said.
The surprising strength of consumer spending -- November home sales, for example, far exceeded expectations -- has also prompted many companies to gear up production, hire more workers and restock inventories. Of course, not all retailers have shared equally, and department stores and apparel manufacturers have had less stellar sales as consumers concentrate on more costly items -- from computers and cars to houses and home furnishings.
With an eye on their latest orders and sales figures, large and small companies alike are telling pollsters that they plan more hiring and capital spending.
Dan Grow, president of Drexel Heritage Furnishings Inc. in Drexel, N.C., said his company would likely keep the second shifts it had added at various plants to meet the holiday rush.
And Ms. Owades said she intended to send out more catalogues this spring and add salespeople. "We're planning for a very strong Valentine's," she said.
There are subtle signs, however, that even as the dollars flow, consumers are not really going back to their free-spending ways of the 1980's. They are still determined to get more for less, to ferret out the bargains.
These days, sales clerks at the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Boca Raton, Fla., squirrel away a half-million dollars in jewelry before private-sale night so that favored customers can get their desired baubles at a hefty discount. The blue-collar crowd that is buying pickup trucks may want them equipped with air-conditioning, stereos and other frills, but they "are still price shopping," car dealers say. And more furniture buyers are heading to lower-cost stores, like Ikea, than to more expensive stores like Drexel Heritage.
At the Ikea store in Elizabeth, N.J., last week, Tom Dickinson, a plant manager, and his wife, Marie, a homemaker, and their two children were among the throngs of shoppers. This Christmas, the Hackettstown, N.J., couple made their first big-ticket purchase in several years -- a computer for their children, ages 5 and 8. And last Friday, they drove to Ikea to hunt for a computer work station and a dinette set. By spring or summer, they expect to be shopping for a mini-van to replace Mrs. Dickinson's 1985 Pontiac station wagon.
"When you get to the point of thinking, 'Maybe it won't be me next,' you can spend a couple of dollars," said Mr. Dickinson, who survived the downsizing of his company.
 
Slower Spending Growth
 Most economists, from the Keynesians in the Clinton camp to pin-striped supply siders on Wall Street, are convinced that consumer spending growth is likely to cool to a more sustainable pace. They also see a cooling in the economy, which they think grew at a rate of 4 or 5 percent in the last few months of 1993.
"The numbers are very, very good," said Larry Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "But the current boomlet is not a forever story."
Consumers seem to share these somewhat diminished expectations. At the University of Michigan, Richard Curtin, who conducts a widely followed monthly consumer poll, pointed out that Americans are not nearly as giddy as they were a year ago. Just a quarter of the families polled, compared with half a year earlier, believe economic growth will keep accelerating.
There are other reasons for thinking that spending growth will ease this year. A key reason: people are spending more than they are earning. "They have to slow down and let income catch up with spending," said Mr. Wyss of DRI/McGraw Hill.
Taxes could also squeeze the purchasing power of some pretty big spenders. "I'm not so sure everybody's thought about how big their tax liability is going to be," Mr. Grow of Drexel Heritage said. "I'm concerned that we could see a little slowdown in spending as we get into the tax season."
And there is always the possibility of a bigger chill -- something that could foil even the most reasonable forecasts. Mr. Curtin, for example, expressed concern that "we're still vulnerable to setbacks in confidence if the job market stops improving."
That said, economists have erred lately more on the side of underestimating consumer spending. Most of them did not anticipate how fast confidence and the job market would revive and how powerful a punch low interest rates would provide.
The lowest interest rates in a generation are offering a strong incentive for consumers to buy houses or fix them up. And getting into the market before rates go up is a compelling reason for moving quickly.
"It's an excellent time to buy," said Richard Miles, who works for a Manhattan television production company and just made a successful bid for a four-bedroom Cape Cod bungalow in Nyack, N.Y. "Mortgage rates are unbelievable. Our monthly payments are going to be less than what we're paying in rent."
But even if the housing rebound slows, home sales have been so strong lately that consumers will almost certainly be spending more on furniture and appliances in the next few months.
Robert Kay, the general manager of Ikea in Elizabeth, said his biggest problem was that the store's floors were so jammed he had trouble keeping everything from beds to home-entertainment units in stock. The Dickinsons, for example, could not buy the dinette set they wanted because the chair cushions were sold out. They plan to revisit the store next week.
 
Trade-In Fever
 Consumers will keep buying cars and trucks, economists predict, because the urge to replace aging vehicles may not have run its course yet. "We've sold a lot of cars this December," said Roger Hoover, finance manager at Dresing Chevrolet Buick Pontiac Inc. in Jacksonville, Ill. "There seems to be a real super buying attitude."
At Dresing, farmers and factory workers at the local Capitol Records plant are driving off in Chevrolet pickups that cost $20,000 or so, as much as an entry-level BMW in the mid-1980's. "We can't get enough," Mr. Hoover said.
Whether spending keeps growing at a respectable pace depends mostly on income growth, and that, in turn, depends mostly on job growth. The additional spending in 1993 came in part because the economy added 190,000 new jobs a month, many factories paid overtime and wages held their own against inflation.
There are some signs of continued hiring. Weekly jobless claims are at a five-year low, an upbeat indicator at least for December. The workweek is longer than at any time since World War II, so employers have little room to increase production through overtime. And, though post-Christmas reports have not come in, all indications are that inventories are fairly lean.
 
 
A Question of Savings
 But consumers have been saving less in order to spend more -- and whenever consumer spending outpaces earnings, economists get concerned. While income should grow as fast as in 1993, or even faster, the savings rate, which hovered above 5 percent a couple of years ago, has been squeezed down to 4 percent or so. To keep spending at recent rates, consumers would have to be willing to reduce their savings even further. To most economists, that seems unlikely at a time when baby boomers are facing college bills and retirement.
Besides, consumers may not be able to keep tapping sources of extra cash. The bull market in stocks and bonds, which swelled the financial wealth of households to an all-time high last year, may not produce another big wave of capital gains for the 55 million Americans who are active investors. Unless interest rates fall further, which most economists are not predicting, the extra cash from refinancing mortgages or lower payments on floating-rate loans will not be available this year.
While there is no evidence that consumers are prepared to increase their debt at a faster pace than their incomes are growing, many consumers have become less skittish about borrowing.
"I'm not sure it's a good sign or a bad sign," said Mr. Wyss of DRI. "The good side is that it suggests confidence. The bad side is that it means consumers are living a bit beyond their means."

HEADLINE: Pop Ballet Propels Joffrey's Recovery

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Just five months ago, it looked as if the financially hard-pressed Joffrey Ballet might not be able to perform in April at the New York State Theater as planned. But now the long-awaited engagement, the company's first appearance in Manhattan in more than two years, is a sure thing. The reason can be stated in one word: "Billboards."
The full-evening ballet -- a suite of dances set to music by Prince and choreographed by Laura Dean, Charles Moulton, Peter Pucci and Margo Sappington -- opened in Iowa City last January and has been packing in audiences ever since. The most recent performances, part of the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in November, were sold out. 
 The audiences are young, too, at a time when major arts institutions are glumly facing the fact that their patrons are aging with them. But is "Billboards" art? And does that matter? The ballet has given the Joffrey, known always as a youthful pop company, a new lease on life, enabling it to pay off longstanding debts and restructure and expand its board.
Gerald Arpino, the artistic director and resident choreographer of the Joffrey, said in an interview that he had long had a fondness for billboards and that his dream of seeing the Joffrey name emblazoned over a huge sign on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles helped inspire the creation of the new piece. He admitted that Robert Joffrey, the company's founder, thought his dream crass. Mr. Arpino said he was thrilled when the ballet was advertised last summer on a billboard towering over the Strip. "There we were, opposite Schwarzenegger," he crowed.
He admitted, too, that presenters of dance groaned when they heard that the company was planning a Prince ballet. The murmurs were on the order of "Ugh, Arpino's going to ruin the Joffrey," Mr. Arpino said. "Now, they're asking me to advise them on how we've increased audiences for dance."
 
Saved From Merger
 Ticket sales soared, he said. In Chicago, the Joffrey sold three times as many tickets as the dance company that preceded it at the same theater. In Washington, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts added seats for the ballet. At the University of Iowa in Iowa City, whose Hancher Auditorium presented the premiere, student attendance climbed from a high of 27 percent of the audience at dance, music and theater performances to 46 percent for "Billboards." "Sales for dance companies coming in after 'Billboards' went up, too," Mr. Arpino added.
Not so long ago, however, it seemed possible that the company might not survive long enough to present "Billboards." Faced with severe financial problems that threatened their existence, the Joffrey and American Ballet Theater briefly contemplated a merger in July 1992.
Soon after, Ballet Theater chose a former principal dancer, Kevin McKenzie, and a young financial hotshot from the Houston Ballet, Gary Dunning, as new directors. That May, Mr. Arpino had quietly brought in a mild-mannered mystery man named Cecil C. Conner Jr., an international business lawyer and a partner in the Manhattan firm of Mandelbaum, Schweiger & Conner. A serious amateur musician and a balletomane, the 51-year-old Mr. Conner, now the executive director of the Joffrey, had done a good deal of volunteer legal work for nonprofit arts organizations. But he had never helped run a major dance company.
 
Cash and Work Flow Again
 As part of its stabilization plan, the Joffrey decided not to perform unless it had a sponsor. "The economic risks of self-producing are so great and the cash flow pressure so great," Mr. Conner said in an interview. "That's why our only New York season in 1993 was at the Brooklyn Academy, where they presented 'Billboards' in the Next Wave Festival."
"The success of 'Billboards' has given us a lot of bookings around the country," he went on. "It has given us constant work -- and constant cash flow -- in the 1993-94 season. In some locations we made more than the sponsor's guaranteed fee, and traditionally we get a split of the box office."
The Joffrey performed in Milwaukee for the first time in 17 years and added eight cities to the customary seven where the company regularly performs. It will perform about 40 weeks during fiscal year 1994, which starts on July 1, four weeks over its contractual obligation to the dancers. The dancers worked 30 weeks in 1991 and 32 in 1993. "We worked out an arrangement to take care of lost weeks in long-range payments to the dancers," Mr. Conner said, adding that the company would perform about 40 weeks, more than its contractual obligations to its performers, in fiscal 1994.
The Joffrey, which has 40 dancers and a $9 million budget, has also reduced its deficit by $1.1 million, about half of what it owes in loans from individuals and in unpaid vendor fees. It has expanded its board both numerically and geographically, enlarging it by 13 members to 53. The company has also created a new board structure with more levels of donations, starting at $5,000. And board committees have been reformulated so that board officers have more individual responsibility.
 
Classics of the Future
 All of this can be attributed at least in part to the revitalizing effects of "Billboards." It is to be performed at the State Theater with a repertory of familiar and new works, including the company's long-awaited production of "Les Presages." The Joffrey is the first American company to present the 1933 ballet, choreographed by Leonide Massine to Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. Though plotless, the piece deals with man's struggle against fate and has been seen as a presentiment of World War II.
"If we hadn't done it, if I hadn't conceived, produced and directed 'Billboards,' we wouldn't be doing 'Les Presages' or presenting a new piece by Randy Duncan or reviving Kylian's 'Return to a Strange Land' and Ashton's 'Patineurs' in New York," Mr. Arpino said. "Of course, change is hard to take. 'Billboards' is a 'now' piece that reflects its era. In a few years it will be a classic, probably like Jerome Robbins's 'New York Export, Opus Jazz.'
"I created a billboard for American dance and I spread it all over the United States. Elitists draw a circle that keeps people out. I'm drawing a circle and saying, 'Come in,' to people who would never go to the ballet."

HEADLINE: Enduring Mystery Solved as Tin Is Found in Turkey

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
ARCHEOLOGISTS have discovered tin in Turkey.
No one is predicting a rush by miners to stake claims or any quick riches to be made on the world's metal markets, for the amount discovered is trifling. But scholars are hailing it as a solution to one of the most enduring mysteries about ancient technology: where did the metalsmiths of the Middle East get the tin to produce the prized alloy that gave the Bronze Age its name? 
 The new findings could change established thinking about the role of trade and metallurgy in the economic and cultural expansion of the Middle East in the Bronze Age, which ran from about 3000 B.C. to 1100 B.C.
After thousands of years in which copper was the only metal in regular use, the rising civilizations of Mesopotamia set off a revolution in metallurgy when they learned to combine tin with copper -- in proportions of about 5 to 10 percent tin and the rest copper -- to produce bronze. Bronze was easier to cast in molds than copper and much harder, with the strength of some steel. Though expensive, bronze was eventually used in a wide variety of things, from axes and awls to hammers, sickles and weapons, like daggers and swords. The wealthy were entombed with figurines, bracelets and pendants of bronze.
Digging through ruins and deciphering ancient texts, scholars have shaped an image of the Bronze Age as a time of vibrant economic expansion, the earliest Sumerian cities and the first great Mesopotamian empires. They found many sources of copper ore and evidence of furnaces for copper smelting. But despite their searching, they could never find any sign of ancient tin mining or smelting anywhere closer than Afghanistan.
It seemed incredible that such an important industry could have been founded and sustained with long-distance trade alone. But where was there any tin closer to home?
After systematic explorations in the central Taurus Mountains of Turkey, an archeologist at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago has found a tin mine and ancient mining village 60 miles north of the Mediterranean coastal city of Tarsus. This is the first clear evidence of a local tin industry in the Middle East, archeologists said, and it dates to the early years of the Bronze Age. Some of the metal might have been imported from faraway Afghanistan or elsewhere, but not all.
In an announcement by the university yesterday, Dr. Aslihan Yener of the Oriental Institute reported that the mine and village demonstrated that tin mining was a well-developed industry in the region as long ago as 2870 B. C. She analyzed artifacts to re-create the process used to separate tin from ore at relatively low temperatures and in substantial quantities.
"Already we know that the industry had become just that -- a fully developed industry with specialization of work," Dr. Yener said. "It had gone beyond the craft stages that characterize production done for local purposes only."
Dr. Vincent C. Pigott, a specialist in the archeology of metallurgy at the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, said: "By all indications, she's got a tin mine. It's excellent archeology and a major step forward in understanding ancient metal technology."
To Dr. Guillermo Algaze, an anthropologist at the University of California at San Diego and a scholar of Mesopotamian civilizations, the discovery is significant because it shows that bronze metallurgy, like agriculture and many other transforming human technologies, apparently developed independently in several places. Much of the innovation, moreover, seemed to come not from the urban centers of southern Mesopotamia, in today's Iraq, but from the northern hinterlands, like Anatolia, in what is now Turkey.
Speaking of the ancient tin workers of the Taurus Mountains, Dr. Algaze said: "It's very clear that these are not just rustic provincials sitting on resources. They had a high level of metallurgy technology, and they were exploiting tin for trade all around the Middle East."
The mine, at a site called Kestel, has narrow passages running more than a mile into the mountainside, with others still blocked and unexplored. The archeologists found only low-grade tin ore, presumably the remains of richer deposits that had been mined out.
For this reason, Dr. James D. Muhly, a professor of ancient Middle Eastern history at the University of Pennsylvania, said he was skeptical of interpretations that Kestel was a tin mine.
"They have identified the geological presence of tin," he contended. "Almost every piece of granite has at least minute concentrations of tin in it. But was there enough there for mining? I don't think they have found a tin mine."
In her defense, Dr. Yener said: "His arguments are still based on an analysis of the mine and not the industry. He has to address the analysis of the crucibles."
On the hillside opposite the mine entrance, the archeologists found ruins of the mining village of Goltepe. Judging by its size, Dr. Yener said, 500 to 1,000 people lived in the village at any one time. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal and the styles of pottery indicated that Goltepe was occupied more or less continuously between 3290 and 1840 B. C. It began as a rude village of pit-houses dug into the soft sedimentary slopes and later developed into a more substantial walled community.
 
Clues in the Crucibles
 Scattered among the ruins were more than 50,000 stone tools and ceramic vessels, which ranged from the size of teacups and saucepans to the size of large cooking pots. The vessels were crucibles in which tin was smelted, Dr. Yener said, and they hold the most important clues to the meaning of her discovery and her answer to skeptics.
Slag left over from the smelting, collected last summer from inside the crucibles and in surrounding debris, contained not low-grade tin ore but material with 30 percent tin content, good enough for the metal trade. This analysis, including various tests with electron microscopes and X-rays, was conducted with the assistance of technicians from Cornwall, a region of England famous for tin mining since ancient times.
The tin-rich slag, Dr. Yener concluded, established beyond doubt that tin metal was being mined and smelted at Kestel and Goltepe. They could not have met all of the Middle East's tin needs in the Bronze Age, she said, but neither was all the tin imported, as had long been thought.
By this time, the scientists realized the significance of all the stone tools and could reconstruct the methods of those ancient tin processors.
The mining was done with stone tools and fire. Miners would light fires to soften the ore veins and make it easier to hack out chunks. Since the shafts were no more than two feet wide, the archeologists said, children may have been used for much of the underground work. This inference was reinforced by the discovery of several skeletons buried inside the mine; their ages at death were 12 to 15 years. Further examination should determine if they died of mining-related illnesses or injuries.
 
Isolating the Tin
 Once extracted, the tin ore, or cassiterite, was apparently washed, much the way Forty-Niners in the American West panned for gold in streams, separating nuggets from the rest. Many of the stone tools at the site were used to grind the more promising pieces of ore into smaller fragments or powder.
Then crucibles, set in pits, were filled with alternating layers of hot charcoal and cassiterite powder. Instead of using bellows, workers blew air through reed pipes to increase the heat of the burning charcoal. Tests indicated that this technique could have produced temperatures of 950 degrees Celsius and perhaps as high as 1,100 degrees (1,740 to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit), sufficient to separate the tin from surrounding ore.
Droplets of tin were encased in molten slag. When this cooled, workers again used stone tools to crush the slag to release the relatively pure tin globules. Sometimes the slag was heated again to separate any remaining tin.
If this site is typical of ancient tin processing, Dr. Yener concluded, then archeologists may have overlooked other local sources of Bronze Age tin. They had been searching for the remains of large furnaces for tin smelting, much as had already been found for copper smelting, and had not suspected that a major tin-processing operation could be conducted successfully with fairly low grades of ore and in small batches in crucibles. In this manner, with hard work and many people, tin might even be recovered at relatively low temperatures.
The identity of these highland mining people is unknown, but their pottery betrays cultural ties to societies in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. The Taurus Mountains were known in the powerful cities of southern Mesopotamia as a rich source of metals, and Sargon the Great, founder of the Akkadian empire in the late third millennium B.C., wrote of obtaining silver there. Although Kestel was close to many ancient silver, gold and copper mines, no traces of copper were detected at the site, indicating that the processed tin was traded elsewhere for the production of bronze.
Among the remaining mysteries of ancient metallurgy include the question of how people first recognized the qualities of bronze made from tin and copper and how they mixed the alloy.
For several centuries before the Bronze Age, metalsmiths in Mesopotamia were creating some tools and weapons out of a kind of naturally occurring bronze. The one used most frequently was a natural combination of arsenic and copper. The arsenic fumes during smelting must have poisoned many an ancient smith, and since the arsenic content of copper varied widely, the quality of the bronze also varied and must have caused manufacturing problems.
Scholars have yet to learn how the ancient Mesopotamians got the idea of mixing tin with copper to produce a much stronger bronze. But excavations have produced tin-bronze pins, axes and other artifacts from as early as 3000 B.C. In the Royal Cemetery at the ancient city of Ur, 9 of 12 of the metal vessels recovered were made of tin-bronze, suggesting that this was the dominant alloy by the middle of the third millennium B.C.
Some of the answers may be awaiting discovery in Afghanistan. Sumerian texts referred to the tin trade from the east, and finally, in the 1970's, Russian and French geologists identified several ancient tin mines in Afghanistan. Until now, that discovery had seemed to resolve the issue of Mesopotamia's tin source. Since tin appeared to be more abundant there, archeologists are eager to explore the mines because they may provide evidence of the first tin-bronze technologies, but the civil war in that area is keeping such plans on hold.
Although he was skeptical of Dr. Yener's claim to have found an ancient tin mine, Dr. Muhly praised her effort to find the sources of metals in the Middle East as "tremendously important archeology" because of the connection between the development and widening use of bronze and the emergence of complex societies, large urban centers, international trade and empires.
The Bronze Age could not continue forever, scholars say, in part because tin was so hard to get, contributing to the expense of the metal alloy. The age came to an end around 1100 B.C., when iron, plentiful and accessible just about everywhere, became the most important metal in manufacturing.

GRAPHIC: Photos: A panning shovel can be used to produce tin. Ancient miners may have blown through a reed pipe onto molten slag, on the shovel, then ground the slag to purify the tin. Dr. Aslihan Yener, right, held tin ore excavated from what she calls the first Middle-East tin mine associated with the Bronze Age.; The shafts of an ancient Kestel tin mine in Turkey were two feet wide. Archeologists say children might have done the underground work. (Photographs by University of Chicago) (pg. C10)
 
Drawings: Children may have helped mine tin ore from narrow tunnels in Turkish mines. Nuggets were panned out, powdered, mixed with charcoal and smelted in small crucibles, using blowpipes.
 "The Dawn of The Bronze Age"
 Harder and more easily cast than copper, bronze was prized for tools and ornaments. Archeologists had long wondered where tin for manufacturing bronze came from.
Crucibles and other artifacts found at the village of Goltepe near the Kestel mine suggest an early source of tin much closer than Afghanistan. Bronze was used in things like ornaments, cups and daggers.

HEADLINE: Wastelands Transformed

BYLINE: By Richard M. Daley; Richard M. Daley is the Mayor of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Since 1960, America has lost 10 million manufacturing jobs, leaving a wasteland of abandoned, contaminated industrial sites too expensive and numerous for local governments or private businesses to restore. Our communities are scarred with dangerous, useless properties and abandoned factories, and jobs have been driven away -- to the suburbs, rural areas or abroad.
Last summer, I testified before Congress on proposed legislation to clean up abandoned industrial sites. The legislation, which was sponsored by Representative Mel Reynolds of Chicago and is awaiting action in the House Ways and Means Committee, combines a package of Federal tax credits, private financing and local government incentives to get businesses to take a fresh look at the problem. 
 The bill calls for a Federal commitment of $75 million a year in tax credits for a five-year pilot program. Companies that restore industrial sites would receive credits worth one-fourth their cleanup costs; and local governments would offer grants, loans, tax abatements or donations of property, and could issue tax-exempt bonds to cover land acquisition and cleanup.
In Chicago, one of the cities that would be covered under the pilot program, there are hundreds of abandoned industrial sites with environmental problems: asbestos-laden rubble, contaminated underground storage tanks, illegal dumps and hazardous waste. A 50-acre site on the South Side with access to road, rail and shipping terminals sits idle because no one will invest the millions of dollars needed to clean it up.
And Chicago recently lost a 40-employee metal-stamping firm that had been on the West Side since 1954 because the owners, who wanted to expand the business, could not find a big enough site free of pollution problems. After an extensive search in the city, the company moved to the suburbs.
There is great demand for old factories that are clean and functional. In the last six months, two major Chicago manufacturers have committed to relocating to a new industrial park on the site of the former Chicago stockyards. And a number of potential buyers have expressed interest in a 15-acre site on the Northwest Side on which the city is spending more than $1 million, demolishing abandoned buildings and starting an environmental cleanup.
Yet Chicago does not have the resources to clean up more than a handful of these sites. Under the Federal proposal, the city could be eligible for $6 million in tax credits, which could lead to $24 million in private financing. That sum would help level the playing field in the jobs competition between Chicago and outlying areas.
The bill's real virtue is that it uses Federal tax dollars to enlist the private sector for job creation and environmental cleanup. By trading $375 million in tax credits for $1.5 billion in private investment over the next five years, government becomes the catalyst for economic development. By creating a partnership among the private sector and local and Federal governments, this bill would distribute the burden of cleanup costs.
Putting environmentalists and industrialists on the same side, it builds on our common interest in keeping good, solid manufacturing jobs in our cities and towns and in broadening their tax base, which is critical to the viability of urban America. It can also slow the runaway development that has led to uncontrollable suburban sprawl.
If the program succeeds, it could be renewed or expanded after five years. If it doesn't, we can try something else. But we must do something to restore these abandoned sites to productive use. We must do more to keep good jobs and to make our cities and towns attractive to new investment. This bill is a good first step.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Berlin '38 To Beijing '94

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
On Oct. 27, 1938, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote a letter to President Roosevelt about Joseph Kennedy, then United States Ambassador to Britain.
Mr. Kennedy had been using his post to fight publicly for the appeasement of Adolf Hitler. He used the word proudly. He said that the West could do fine business with Hitler, and in peace. Only economics counted, he said, -- trade, finance, deals -- not how the Nazis chose to rule. 
 Justice Frankfurter wrote to F.D.R.:
"I wonder if Joe Kennedy understands the implication of public talk by an American ambassador. Such public approval of dictatorships, in part even, plays into their hands."
Hitler was already moving to conquer Europe. The Joe Kennedys played their part by looking in their mirrors and crying out that only money mattered. Dictators can always be bought off by cash and credits, they said.
Berlin, Yalta, Baghdad, now Beijing. I read the Frankfurter letter, in Nigel Hamilton's book "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," the day after an interview with J. Stapleton Roy, U.S. Ambassador to Beijing, appeared in The New York Times.
At the moment, the issue between China and the U.S. is not one of conquest. Well, Tibet, of course. But that was decades ago, and sometimes the Dalai Lama gets tea in Washington.
All that is being asked of China is to treat its own citizens and Tibetans with somewhat more decency -- say, to refrain from torturing them in prison, rounding them up for labor, enforcing abortion, arresting dissidents; human rights kind of things.
In the interview with The Times in Beijing, Mr. Roy concedes that repression is the normal governing method of maintaining control in China. He also says that there were human rights "setbacks" in China in 1993.
But he comes to the conclusion that because China is moving ahead economically, the lives of its citizens have dramatically improved and that this should be taken into account when Mr. Clinton has to make a major decision this summer.
The decision is whether to use the only lever the U.S. has to improve human rights in China -- import tariff rates.
One major reason China has moved ahead economically is that by government regulations Chinese workers are paid so little that labor hardly counts in its international trade balance sheet.
For Beijing, rising American tariffs could be such unpleasant medicine that it might decide to loosen up a little on human rights. Maybe not -- but it is the only threat the U.S. has.
Last year, to ward off a powerful Congressional move to remove the present Chinese privilege of getting lowest available U.S. tariffs, Mr. Clinton issued an executive order. It bound him to remove that privilege by July 1994 unless he is convinced significant human rights progress has taken place.
Mr. Clinton's Ambassador in Beijing plainly believes the President should decree that such progress has been made, despite those "setbacks" and that continued rule by repression.
Mr. Roy is not Joe Kennedy. He does not shoot his mouth off no matter what Washington happens to think and he stands well in the State Department. That makes it important for the Administration to assure Congress publicly that the game is not already fixed against removal of China's lowest tariff privileges.
Each traveler to a tyranny sees what his own ethics permit him to see. Planeloads of Westerners arrive in China, see what their self-interest or mindset permit -- quality control but not police control, more computers but not more kangaroo trials. They return home announcing that they have seen the future and it works.
They expound their theory that eventually economic progress, even at slave wages, must bring human betterment and human rights. Thus they carve their names for history on a list that includes John Reed, Walter Duranty, Joe Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh.
But by now the offense of self-blinding is even greater. What excuse can be presented to history now that Nazi Germany, the Soviet Empire and Imperial Japan have proved the theory one of history's great lies?
Ethically and politically, the decision on China will be one of the more important that Bill Clinton will make. The President's name should not be on that indelible list, nor America's.

HEADLINE: A Dismal Recovery

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You are surely correct that President Clinton deserves neither full credit nor blame, yet, for the condition of the economy (news article, Dec. 20). But is your article's underlying presumption, that the economy is humming, correct? 
 Not if you compare this recovery with past recoveries. For example, growth in the last nine quarters, since the trough, works out cumulatively to about 5.5 percent. For the noninflationary recovery of 1983-84, the total in the first nine quarters was more than 12 percent. And for the (admittedly inflationary) recovery of 1975-77, it was more than 11 percent.
The growth record of this recovery is dismal by past standards, and it is a shame, not a blessing, that efforts to generate faster growth with deficit reduction were blocked this year in Congress.

HEADLINE: Mexican Rebels Are Retreating; Issues Are Not

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALTAMIRANO, Mexico, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The peasant guerrilla army that burst into Mexican life with the New Year retreated today from this town and others it had occupied in the southern state of Chiapas as army troops moved in.
Fighting continued around the city of San Cristobal de las Casas and the town of Ocosingo as rebels from the force, which calls itself the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, battled soldiers backed by planes and helicopter gunships. Military officials said at least 93 people had been killed since the rebels seized the state's second-largest city and three sizable towns just hours after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect. 
 But while the rebels' offensive appeared to be waning, it seemed clear that Mexico has not seen the last of them. Although the guerrillas disappeared with few traces from this town, and from nearby Ocosingo and most of the other hamlets they had held, many of them vowed that they would return to fight another day.
Government forces moved aggressively to take control of the area, drawing accusations of human rights abuse for the apparent executions of at least five rebels in Ocosigno and the strafing and rocketing of rebels near a populated neighborhood outside San Cristobal.
Far from exulting over driving the rebels back, the Government seemed chastened by the rebels' exposure of a vulnerability in the development model that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has used in his efforts to lift Mexico from the third world in partnership with its northern neighbors.
Mr. Salinas and his aides moved to strike at what they clearly took to be the source of Mexico's first leftist rebel movement since the mid-1970's. Officials promised food programs, farm credits and other aid to fight poverty in the region. They also promised strict respect for human rights.
In the elaborate pronouncements of its leaders and the often halting, inarticulate explanations of the peasants who joined them, the Zapatista Army seemed to make one basic point: that while the Salinas Government may have brought new wealth to the affluent and new hope to the middle class, it has made far less of a change in the lives of its poorest citizens.
Even as he lay bloodied and hog-tied in a gazebo in the central plaza of Oxchuc, a town he had mistakenly entered two days after the brief rebel occupation there, one young guerrilla said defiantly today that the trade agreement represented a future much like Chiapas's sorry past.
"It is always the same," the man, Jose Perez Mendez, said of the Government. "We work and they take advantage of us."
 
An Army of Innocents
 And on Monday, Mr. Salinas stood before congressmen as though at a political confessional. "We know that needs and inequalities persist," he said. "We know that the benefits and opportunities are not yet tangible realities for many."
Virtually all of several dozen rebels interviewed in the past few days said they had come from towns like Altamirano and Oxchuc and more dismal hamlets in the pine forests and jungles beyond. Compared with the hardened, disciplined traditions of the peasants who fought in Central and South America over the last two decades, the innocence of many of the Mexican insurgents would be hard to overstate.
On the edge of Altamirano this afternoon, two young rebels appeared to have simply taken off their bandanas and uniforms, showered and settled in by the wooden shack of one of their families, waiting to fight another day.
"I think the war can be won," said one, a 29-year-old man who might have given his full name had reporters not been uneasy about taking it. "In general, the people don't support us. Some are against us. But people see the advance that our army has made."
He said he had joined the Zapatista Army two years earlier, but that he still only knew "more or less" how to handle a gun. He said he trusted in God to help the rebels overcome the far more powerful Mexican Army.
He said he understood little of the trade pact. The rebel leaders "explain everything to us," he added, "how a peasant works from sunrise to sunset and we are more exploited all the time."
Just who those leaders are is a question that the Mexican authorities still seem to be asking. They have linked the Zapatista leaders to two radical fringe groups -- the Revolutionary Workers' and Peasants' Party of Popular Unity and the Party of the Poor -- that emerged from guerrilla forces operating in Mexico in the 1970's.
Tonight, however, Eloy Cantu, a senior official of the Secretariat of Government, Mexico's Interior Ministry, said "an important number" of the rebel leaders were foreigners, "particularly Salvadorans and Guatemalans.
"It is clear," he said, "that the leadership is in the hands of professionals of violence."
After speaking in San Cristobal, Mr. Cantu did not take any questions. But he added that the apparent leader of the several hundred rebels who occupied the area on Saturday and Sunday, a man who called himself "Commander Marcos," was blond, green-eyed, spoke four languages and would soon be identified in greater detail.
A self-described captain in the rebel force said that some of the movement's leaders had participated in the Mexican guerrilla groups of the 1970's and the huge student movement that flowered in Mexico City in 1968. Another said that some priests and members of the Catholic Church had also helped the guerrillas, although church officials and other rebels denied this.
At least in Oxchuc, the guerrillas also appeared to have gained some support from townspeople.
"They said they were going to attack the rich and the Government, and those people received them," said a town commissioner, Ricardo Gomez. "We don't know what happened to them, but they have taken off out of here."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Central American Role Is Seen
 SAN SALVADOR, Jan. 4 (Special to The New York Times) -- High-ranking officers from the armies of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador said at a meeting here today that current or former guerrilla movements in Central America may be helping rebels operating in southern Mexico.
The Guatemalan Defense Minister, Gen. Mario Rene Enriquez, said his army thought it was likely that the rebels in Mexico had received help from Guatemalan guerrillas, but none of the officers here offered any evidence to support their suspicions.
A Honduran officer who attended the meeting today said the weapons and training could be coming from the Sandinista Army in Nicaragua or former guerrillas in El Salvador, while others said they suspected former contras, the rebels organized by the United States to overthrow the Sandinistas.

HEADLINE: U.S. Now Seeks Just One Survey Of North Korea

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Backing away from their previous insistence that North Korea accept frequent nuclear inspections, Administration officials said today that they were prepared to accept North Korea's offer of one full inspection of seven atomic sites now in the hope that more could be agreed upon later.
The officials said further that, under the terms of a tentative agreement with the North Koreans, the United States would urge South Korea to suspend joint military exercises with the United States if such an inspection is arranged and North Korea resumes talks with South Korea on guaranteeing the removal of all nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula. 
 Administration officials said they hoped that an agreement on one inspection would ease a 10-month standoff over North Korea's nuclear program. The standoff began when North Korea said it would withdraw from the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons and no longer permit regular inspections.
But it was not clear that tensions over North Korea's nuclear program would be defused.
 
Approval by Nuclear Agency
 For one thing, American officials said that no agreement on the inspections would be completed until the International Atomic Energy Agency hammers out final details with North Korea. The agency has consistently said that only regular repeated inspections would bring North Korea into compliance with the treaty.
American officials said that an agreement by North Korea to permit one inspection, at least for now, was an important concession. They said also that North Korea had agreed to future talks in which Washington would press it to allow additional inspections.
But the officials acknowledged that the new Administration position fell short of Washington's original demand that the North Koreans fulfill their obligations under the treaty to allow regular repeated inspections.
 
Regular Inspections Required
 The treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons requires nations that sign it to agree to a regular system of inspections to track their nuclear fuel to make sure that it is not diverted to a weapons program.
In interviews today, International Atomic Energy Agency officials said they had not been notified of any agreement with United States and would have no comment. But they voiced fears that the idea of a one-time inspection would set a bad precedent, perhaps encouraging other countries to seek to limit inspections.
Nonetheless, several arms-control experts predicted that the agency would accept the one-time inspections on the grounds that North Korea would not make further concessions.
Administration officials defended their new approach, with North Korea, insisting that it was the best deal that could be struck at the moment. They said their negotiations not only provide for a thorough inspection but will keep North Korea from totally withdrawing from a treaty barring the spread of nuclear weapons.
In March of last year, North Korea said that it would withdraw from the treaty, and thus would not be obligated to allow international inspectors into its nuclear sites. But in June, after talks with the United States, it agreed to suspend that withdrawal.
Since then, North Korea has argued that it is still not bound by the treaty provisions.
One Government official who concentrates in arms control conceded that the Administration's latest position represented a tactical retreat.
"It's one of these cases where the Administration was huffing and puffing and backed down," he said. "There's nothing wrong with trying to come out of this without starting a war."
United States intelligence officials believe North Korea has already assembled at least one nuclear device. But regular inspections are considered critical to the effort to prevent future diversions of nuclear fuel from its reactors to its weapons program.
"We're giving the International Atomic Energy Agency what they need to keep this thing in the game," said one Government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
'Get the Job Done'
 "The Government's approach is, it wants to be practical, to get the job done," the official added. "We need to coax the North Koreans back to the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime, without falling on our own sword over phony principle."
In the Administration's view, the new approach is one step in a long-term process in which Washington plans to press and coax North Korea into further inspections, while proffering improved economic and political ties to one of the world's most isolatedgovernments.
Over the last several months, Administration officials have taken a tough line publicly with North Korea, vowing to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons and warning of economic sanctions if Pyongyang failed to agree to regular inspections.
But China has been reluctant to go along with sanctions, making that approach problematic, and South Korea and Japan have also warned against a confrontational approach. Administration officials worried in private about the consequences of a showdown with what they see as a volatile and heavily armed regime.
 
Assessment by C.I.A.

Complicating matters further was a recent assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency that concluded that North Korea probably has already manufactured one or two nuclear devices.
Conservatives in the Pentagon and Congress, some of whom have called for bombing North Korea's nuclear sites, have opposed any deal that does not guarantee regular inspection of those sites.
Officials from the international inspection agency said that when they negotiate with North Korea they would urge it to accept regular inspections. But if Pyongyang rejects that, then the agency will have to decide whether to accept a one-time inspection.
 
Conditions for Inspection
 "If conditions of any type are attached to a resumption of inspections in North Korea, than those terms would have to be examined very carefully," David Kyd, the inspection agency's spokesman, said in a telephone interview from Vienna.
On Monday, an Administration official said he hoped the inspection agency could work out final details with North Korea this week, but an official with the inspection agency said today that this was overly optimistic since the agency and Pyongyang have not yet agreed to a time or place for talks.
If North Korea, Washington and the inspection agency reach an agreement, the next step would be high-level talks in which American officials plan to press the North Koreans to let international inspectors visit two nuclear waste sites that North Korea has placed off limits to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Those two sites, which are not among the seven sites under negotiation, could furnish evidence of how much weapons-grade nuclear material the North Koreans have.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Scrambling for a Strategy On Eve of Clinton European Trip

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Less than a week before the NATO and Moscow summit meetings, the Administration is still groping for a coherent strategy as President Clinton prepares to embark on his most comprehensive and ambitious overseas trip.
On Russia, the Administration retreated from the position outlined by Strobe Talbott, its leading Russia strategist, just two weeks ago that American policy is now to find a way to de-emphasize rapid economic change in favor of maintaining living standards. 
 On NATO, the White House called in reporters to try to quiet Eastern European complaints about the inadequacy of its proposed "Partnership for Peace" by insisting that it is intended as a prelude to expansion of NATO.
And on Ukraine, the Administration scrambled to respond to an unverifiable report on Russia's Interfax news agency that Mr. Yeltsin had invited the President Leonid Kravchuk to Moscow to meet with Mr. Clinton. Some senior officials said such a meeting was possible, but others said it probably would not happen because Russia and Ukraine had not yet made sufficient progress on Ukrainian disarmament.
The confusing signals came in the face of a frenzy of news briefings by senior Administration officials that highlight the Administration's campaign to explain its foreign policies.
At the White House, a senior Administration official sought to steer reporters from 10 regional newspapers away from the view that the United States was easing pressure on Mr. Yeltsin to reform his country's economy.
The official, later identified by Administration officials as Nicholas Burns, the National Security Council's senior official on the former Soviet Union, took issue twice with the idea that in talking about "shock therapy" for the Russian economy, the United States was putting more emphasis on "therapy" and less on "shock." He said that Mr. Talbott had not intended to convey that idea when he spoke to reporters after the strong showing of Russian nationalists in parliamentary elections last month.
 
Suggests Change of Thinking
 But Mr. Talbott's remarks suggested Administration thinking had shifted to the view that there had been too much emphasis on remaking the Russian economy and not enough on improving the daily lives of the people.
When asked specifically whether the Administration wanted Russia to reform as soon as possible, Mr. Talbott said: "It might be a mistake to cast it in terms of fast and slow. It's more a concept of broadening reform."
Mr. Burns said today, however, that Mr. Talbott's remarks had been taken out of context, that reforms should "speed up, accelerate, go very strongly in support of reform," according to reporters who attended the briefing.
Asked at the State Department briefing whether Mr. Talbott's remarks had been taken out of context, State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said: "I think he was just being quotable, probably."
A senior Adminsistration official said Mr. Talbott had "not seen the text of Mr. Burns's remarks," but added, "Ambassador Talbott coordinates closely with Nick Burns on matters relating to Russia policy and is not aware any differences between them."
As for NATO, a senior Administration official spent more than 90 minutes this afternoon outlining the "Partnership for Peace" plan before two large groups of reporters. Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later appeared in the White House briefing room to repeat assurances on eventual NATO membership for Eastern European nations. But he warned that an immediate expansion of the alliance could have a destabilizing effect on Europe.
 
'Premature Question'
 "We hope that the process can lead to an extension of membership, but who, when and how -- it's a premature question," General Shalikashvili said.
The most outspoken critic of the plan has been the Polish President, Lech Walesa, who today accused the West of deserting countries in the region by deciding not to offer them full membership.
The White House explanation of the plan was unusual in that its final details have not yet been approved by current members of NATO.
"We are setting in motion a dynamic process which is explicitly opening the door -- and one we hope that they walk through -- to membership in NATO," Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, said at the same White House briefing.
President Clinton told reporters separately today that he thought some East European nations had misunderstood the American position. "That's why I'm going to Prague to see them," Mr. Clinton said. "We're going to work hard to try to make everybody feel good about this approach."
On Ukraine, senior Administration officials said that Ukraine and Russia had not agreed on Russian compensation to Kiev for its tactical nuclear weapons that have already been sent to Russia and that Ukraine had not made a clear commitment to dismantle its SS-19 and SS-24 strategic missiles.
Although the officials agreed that no decision had been made on whether Mr. Clinton would meet with Mr. Kravchuk in Russia next week, they seemed to differ in their assessments of the probability of such a meeting.
One senior official said Mr. Clinton had sent a letter to Mr. Kravchuk reaffirming a willingness to meet soon if Russia and Ukraine can resolve their outstanding differences.
But another senior official said that it was "inconceivable" that Mr. Yeltsin had extended an invitation to Mr. Kravchuk, that there was no deadline for a meeting and that "the two sides still had a long way to go."

France Seeks U.S. Role in Bosnia
 PARIS, Jan. 4 (AP) -- France will ask the United States to intervene in the war in Bosnia to keep the fighting from spreading, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said today.
At next week's NATO summit meeting, "We will ask the United States to intervene and help us so that this war does not extend to the south of Europe and throughout the Balkans," Mr. Leotard said in a television interview.

HEADLINE: T.W.A. Ousts Chairman of 7 Months

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines, which is struggling to find a stable flight path after emerging from bankruptcy protection in November, yesterday replaced its chairman, who had been appointed only seven months ago.
It replaced William R. Howard with Donald F. Craib Jr., a T.W.A. board member and former chairman of the Allstate Insurance Group who has no airline operating experience. The carrier also said that Glenn R. Zander, vice chairman, had resigned for personal reasons. 
 The airline offered few insights into the circumstances that prompted the changes. A company statement suggested that Mr. Howard was stepping down after accomplishing his goal of shepherding the carrier out of bankruptcy. However, during an interview earlier this summer, Mr. Howard, who is 72, said he planned to stay as long as he was having fun or until he was asked to leave. When pressed, he figured he would stay in the job for a few years.
But Mr. Howard, the former chief executive of Piedmont Airlines, is a man of many hobbies, including his car and motorcycle collections, as well as several boats at one of his homes, in Key Largo, Fla. Indeed, his eyes brightened and his impatient manner softened when talk turned to his hobbies during the earlier interview.
Mr. Zander, a longtime T.W.A. employee who had hoped to run the airline, had often clashed with Mr. Howard. At one point last fall, he submitted his resignation, but was persuaded to stay.
The changes add to the stream of mixed news from the airline in recent months. Although its service was long believed to be among the worst in the business, it recently won top honors on international flights for customer satisfaction in a J. D. Power & Associates survey of business travelers.
 
Incentive for the Employees
 The turnaround was attributed in part by industry analysts to employees' gaining in the reorganization a 45 percent stake in exchange for $660 million worth of concessions over three years. The airline's creditors own the rest.
Although T.W.A. has defied predictions of its demise, some industry analysts have raised concern about the airline's thin cash cushion. "We believe the carrier could run out of cash over the next few months unless it can raise additional funds," Paul Karos, an industry analyst, wrote last month.
After it emerged from bankruptcy, T.W.A. had a new board, which unanimously approved Mr. Craib's appointment yesterday at a meeting.
Mr. Craib, 68, was elected chairman and chief executive of the Allstate unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company, in 1982 and held the position until he retired in 1986. He worked in a number of posts during his career at Sears, which he began in 1950 as a claims adjuster. As vice chairman for corporate administration between 1980 and 1982, he coordinated personnel, consumer and government affairs and communications for the corporation.
He was not available for comment yesterday, but said in a statement that he would work with Mr. Howard and Mr. Zander, who will continue as consultants for T.W.A., "to accelerate my knowledge and ability to support the truly remarkable effort by T.W.A.'s 26,000 employee-owners in continuing the dramatic turnaround of their airline."
Mr. Zander's employment contract called for him to receive $500,000 when he left the company. The terms of Mr. Howard's severance package were not known yesterday.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers' Sales Rose 8.4% in 1993

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The American auto industry finished 1993 on a strong note with sales in December roughly 5 percent ahead of 1992 levels and overall sales for the year up about 8.4 percent.
Several foreign manufacturers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, had not finished tallying their numbers late today, preventing an exact accounting. However, sales analysts at the Ford Motor Company estimated total industry sales of 8.6 million cars for 1993 and 5.6 million light trucks for a total of 14.2 million vehicles, the best year since 1989 and up from 13.1 million in 1992. 
 The year just ended was one of optimism, relief and hope for the nation's auto makers -- relief that the cyclical pattern of sales was again rising after four anemic years, and hope that next year will be even stronger. Economists are generally predicting that sales this year will be in the range of 14.5 million to 15 million, though some are forecasting sales of 15.2 million cars and light trucks.
 
Gains for the Big Three
 The Big Three's total sales of cars and light trucks rose 10.4 percent in 1993, to 10,369,987. Car sales were up 5.9 percent and light-truck sales rose 16.3 percent.
The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, posted total car and light-truck sales of 4,713,254, up 5.9 percent for the year. Ford sold 3,608,911 vehicles, up 12 percent for the year. The Chrysler Corporation posted the biggest gain, 19.9 percent, with sales of 2,047,822.
For cars only, G.M. had an estimated 34.4 percent share of the market, down from 34.6 percent in 1992. Ford had a 22.1 percent share, up from 21.7 percent, and Chrysler had a 9.2 percent share, up from 8.3 percent. Japanese manufacturers had a 29.7 percent share, down from 30.1 percent.
With consumers generally more optimistic as the nation's economy picked up modest steam, some Japanese auto makers achieved higher sales in 1993. Sales for the Toyota Motor Corporation rose 1.3 percent, to 1,033,211. The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation posted sales of 189,069, up 7 percent from 1992. The Mazda Motor Corporation sold 290,474 vehicles, an increase of 3.5 percent.
The Honda Motor Company reported sales of 716,546 for the year, down 7.2 percent. But Honda said sales in the second half of the year rebounded with the introduction of a new Accord and Acura Integra.
Again, the best-selling vehicle in America was a pickup truck, the F-series model made by Ford, with sales of 565,089. The best-selling car again was the Ford Taurus, with 360,448. The Honda Accord again was No. 2.
In Detroit's intramural competition to determine which auto maker can sell the most light-duty trucks, G.M. won over Ford, 1,754,135 to 1,684,239. In the narrower race between Ford and Chevrolet for pickup supremacy, the Ford F series light pickup edged Chevy's pickup. Demand for pickups has been so strong that auto makers are constrained by their capacity to build.
"We have 20 people waiting for the extended cab four-by-four pickup," said Robert Wilson, sales manager of Anderson Ford in Lincoln, Neb.
Economists from G.M., Ford and Chrysler are predicting further sales growth this year, and possibly for a few more years. Martin Zimmerman, Ford's economist, is looking for sales of 14.5 million to 15 million vehicles. George Eads, G.M.'s economist, predicts sales of 14.8 million. Don Hilty, Chrysler's economist, is the most bullish, with a prediction of 15.2 million.
Ford and Chrysler said they believe annual vehicle sales could peak at 17 million in a few years, while G.M. said it thinks the next peak will be about 16 million. The previous record was 16.3 million in 1986. Mr. Eads offered the most conservative outlook because he said he believes the Federal Reserve, fearing an overheating of the economy, may act to raise interest rates, which could hurt vehicle buying.
Because several manufacturers had not reported sales, it was impossible to determine exact market shares of individual auto makers or the Big Three's share versus that of the Japanese industry.
But estimates showed that the Big Three clearly gained because of rising prices among Japanese auto makers as a result of the more expensive yen and because American consumers were more willing to consider Detroit's offerings.
G.M., Ford and Chrysler accounted for roughly 66 percent of total car sales in 1993, compared with about 65 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Fed Assails President's Bank Plan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
In an unusual public attack, the Federal Reserve today strongly criticized a Clinton Administration plan for the consolidation of bank regulatory agencies that would hand over much of the Fed's regulatory role to the Treasury Department.
Saying that the Administration's plan would lead to neither an efficient regulatory system nor good government, the Fed instead proposed a new regulatory lineup that would preserve much of its own current role. 
 The criticisms prompted outspoken complaints this afternoon by Treasury officials that the Fed was simply seeking to protect its turf. But some banking-industry officials praised the Fed's proposal as a way to limit possible abuses of power by the single agency sought by the Clinton Administration.
While the Fed's unhappiness with the Administration plan has been well known, the exchange today was a sharp departure from both the Fed's tradition of reticence and the Clinton Administration's desire to preserve good relations with the central bank.
 
Political Advantage in Harmony
 The Fed's current policy of holding interest rates low is generally regarded as crucial to the success of President Clinton's economic program. Fed and Treasury officials have so far taken pains not to drag interest-rate policy into regulatory arguments.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has been seeking to combine functions of the Administration's two regulatory agencies for banks and savings and loans -- the independent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, plus some of the Fed's regulatory responsibilities, into an entity called the Federal Banking Commission, responsible for examining banks and savings and loan institutions.
The Fed proposed today that the Administration combine the agencies while allowing the Fed to regulate the largest bank-holding companies plus all financial holding companies in which the largest entity is a state-chartered bank or savings and loan. The F.D.I.C. regulates many state-chartered institutions, but would be limited under the Fed plan to handling deposit insurance and some ailing banks and savings and loans.
John P. LaWare, one of the Federal Reserve Board's seven members, presented the proposal in a commentary published this morning in The American Banker, a daily newspaper. The Federal Reserve has been trying to rally support among bankers for its position as it prepares to fight the Treasury Department plan in Congress this year.
Mr. LaWare said in an interview that although his name appeared alone on the commentary, his column was a summary of current views at the Fed. "It's expressed as a particular view, but it represents the distillation of our thinking here at the Federal Reserve," he said.
Mr. LaWare, a former chairman of the Shawmut National Corporation, a bank holding company, tends to take the lead on bank-regulatory issues.
Specifically, Mr. LaWare proposed today to combine the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates many savings and loans, with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates many banks. Both are part of the Treasury Department.
Richard Carnell, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions, told reporters this afternoon that the Federal Reserve's proposal would give it direct regulatory authority over 40 percent of the nation's banking system, as measured by assets, compared with 18 percent now.
 
Competition Between Regulators
 Mr. LaWare responded, "Contrast that with their proposal, which says they want 100 percent."
He said that retaining two regulatory agencies would encourage competition between them, resulting in better ideas. But under the Fed plan, banks would retain some of their current freedom to choose which agency regulated them.
Frank N. Newman, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, warned that this could prompt regulators to compete in leniency, and noted the lenient regulation that allowed the collapse of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's. Mr. LaWare responded that the savings and loan industry had been regulated by a single agency then.
Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, a trade group that represents small- and medium-sized banks, said his group preferred the Fed plan to the Treasury's because it would limit the concentration of regulatory power.
Edward L. Yingling, chief lobbyist for the broader American Bankers Association, said his group had not yet taken a position and would continue to review both plans.

HEADLINE: Cuomo: Miles to Go or Nearly Gone?;
He Ponders Another Term, as Critics Assess First 11 Years

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Six years after he first chose not to run for President and two years after he declined for a second time, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo no longer has quite the star quality that once bolstered his popularity at home.
A brutal recession and 11 years of incumbency have taken their toll on his approval ratings. And the experiences of David N. Dinkins in New York City and Jim Florio in New Jersey serve as reminders that the record of just one term can be enough to convince voters to reject an incumbent. 
 Now with his poll numbers at an all-time low, Mr. Cuomo is deciding whether to run for a fourth four-year term, knowing that a 1994 campaign would focus almost exclusively on his 11-year record in New York.
And that record, according to a broad range of lawmakers, lobbyists and economists, is a decidedly mixed one, particularly on the critical issues of fiscal management and crime.
Mr. Cuomo guided the state through the second recession of his tenure without either raising broad-based taxes or unraveling the state's extensive social-services safety net. But he was unable to stem the loss of 524,000 jobs from New York in the last four years, fully 6 percent of the state's job base.
And while Mr. Cuomo has doubled the state's prison capacity and increased the ranks of the state police by 14 percent, New York's violent crime rate is 11 percent higher than it was when he took office in 1983.
The Democratic Governor plans to disclose his political plans by the end of the week, shortly after delivering his 12th State of the State address on Wednesday, his aides said.
Even before making that announcement, Mr. Cuomo seemingly has set out to separate himself from the failings of the government he has led since 1983.
Unable to convince the state's divided Legislature, which has a Republican majority Senate and a Democratic-controlled Assembly, to address political issues like campaign spending limits and voter registration at the polls, he has led a crusade for a constitutional convention that could circumvent the Legislature. Unable to win an equitable distribution of education aid for New York City, he appointed a special commission to examine, and ultimately condemn, the state's Balkanized system of school governance.
After years of withering Republican criticism about the state's tax structure and its epidemic of violent crime, he will use his State of the State speech to propose tax cuts and gun-control measures.
In sum, as Mr. Cuomo enters the last year of his third term, and prepares for a possible race for a fourth, he is working aggressively to publicize his successes and shore up the vulnerabilities in his record.
Mr. Cuomo's critics maintain that he has failed after 11 years to build a distinctive legacy out of either concrete or policy. They complain that he has never approached the potential suggested by his elegant oratory and searing intellect.
"Here's a person who raised our hopes so high and has yet to fill them in," said Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Garden City, L.I., whose comment was echoed by lawmakers in both parties. "We always remember Rocky for what he did for the state university system. What are we going to remember Mario for?"
Many legislators and Capitol lobbyists said that too much of Mr. Cuomo's energy has been devoted to political calculation, whether it be blaming the state's economic failings on Republican administrations in Washington or using his differences with the Senate Republicans as a foil for inaction. Not enough time has been spent, they charge, in building public support for his initiatives, including two failed bond acts, or in forging the ties and trading the chits necessary to make things happen in Albany.
 
A Lasting Legacy? No, Thank You
 Mr. Cuomo mocks the word "legacy." If he does not have one, he says, it is only because he has done so much in so many areas that his record is not easily reduced to bumper-sticker sloganeering.
Why not call him "the education governor," he asked in an interview on the last day of his 11th year in office, noting that state aid to schools has doubled during his tenure. How about "the master builder," he suggested, citing the $32 billion in state, local and Federal money he says will be spent on infrastructure projects from 1993 through 1997.
Is there, he asks, any part of his environmental agenda, including the country's first acid rain law and a dedicated fund for land preservation, that he should have sacrificed "in the name of focus, emphasis and legacy, whatever that is?"
Maybe, he suggests, he could be called "the ethics governor," a reference to the state's first ethics law, passed in 1987. Or "the lifesaver governor," because the state's highway fatality rate is the lowest since 1945, the product of $11 billion invested in road and bridge construction, the nation's first mandatory seat-belt law, and a rise in the legal drinking age.
He said he would settle for "the governing governor."
"You ask me kind of broadly what was your greatest accomplishment," he said, propping his feet on his desk. "It was resisting the temptation to put my ego before the agenda and say: 'I will do something to let them remember me for all time. I will build myself a pyramid of accomplishment.' "
But with his approval rating now hovering at 34 percent, down from a high of 78 percent five years ago, Mr. Cuomo is trying aggressively to spotlight his successes. His press office has distributed a pair of synopses, one of five pages and one of 12, that itemize his accomplishments. With the help of aides on the state payroll, he has written a book that aims to debunk what he calls "the shibboleths" about New York and his government. It is scheduled for release in April.
He takes credit for the construction of Battery Park City, Riverbank State Park and Stuyvesant High School. He boasts of appointing the first two female, the first black and the first Hispanic members of the Court of Appeals.
He trumpets his role in creating programs that offer state-subsidized health insurance for the children of the working poor and that require health insurers to accept all paying applicants, regardless of risk. Last week, he signed a bill that will increase spending on community mental health programs. And he has nurtured several welfare programs that encourage welfare mothers to seek work.
 
Coming Up Short Against Republicans
 Mr. Cuomo also admits to failures, attributing most of them to the recalcitrance of the Senate Republicans. He said, for instance, that he regrets not winning a larger share of school aid for New York City or convincing the Legislature to limit campaign contributions and spending.
And he said he was disappointed that he had not been able to win agreement from the Senate Republicans on a variety of crime proposals, including bills that would create special penalties for bias crimes, establish a sentence of life without parole for murderers, and end the requirement that second-time felons go to prison. His conflicts with the Senate on those issues are at least partly the result of polarization generated by Mr. Cuomo's opposition to the death penalty, which he has vetoed each year.
But the Governor rejected any suggestion that he could have won concessions by wielding his veto more aggressively to create bargaining opportunities with the Senate Republicans.
"How do you reach people who have been in power for 55 years and know that as long as this campaign finance law remains unchanged and the freedom of information law does not apply to them that you'll never be able to beat them?" he asked.
The key issue that would confront Mr. Cuomo in a campaign this year is his management of the economy and the state budget. Mr. Cuomo said the recession made him feel as if "I have lost three years, as if I never had a chance to govern because we spent all our time trying to balance the budget."
Throughout New York's economic decline, which hit harder and lingered longer than in many other states, Mr. Cuomo has adhered to twin principles. He was committed to freezing rates on broad-based taxes in order to keep New York competitive with surrounding states. He avoided the sharp cuts in welfare programs enacted by states like California and Michigan, feeling they would punish the poor at their most vulnerable time.
But the methods that Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature used to avoid more serious fiscal pain has brought them heavy criticism. For three consecutive years, they mounted midnight raids on reserve funds and concocted an imaginative brew of fiscal gimmicks, some of which have been declared illegal by the state's courts.
They delayed paying salary to state workers, changed accounting methods to reduce the state's payments to its pension fund, and sold highways and prisons to quasi-public authorities. Wall Street's most respected credit rating agencies responded by lowering the state's bond rating, which is now the second lowest in the nation.
Mr. Cuomo said he did not regret his decisions, even those overturned by the Court of Appeals.
"I regret that it was illegal, or found to be illegal, but I think the result comes out a very good one," he said. "Is it the best thing to do? Of course not. But normally the question is was it better than a tax increase or a cut in substantial programs like education and health, which is where most of our money goes. And my answer is absolutely. Are you glad you did it? Absolutely."
Some economists, like Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer of First Albany Corporation, commend Mr. Cuomo for keeping the state competitive, regardless of his methods. Other fiscal monitors said the reliance on gimmicks and nonrecurring revenues would only prolong the state's budgetary problems, insuring that budget gaps recur long after the economy regains strength.
"They set the stage for creating bigger deficits in the future without solutions," said Cynthia Green, deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission. "That's why we're still not out of the woods."
The recession worsened what already was a forbidding fiscal problem, the growth in the cost of the state's generous Medicaid and welfare programs.
From 1989 to 1993, a period when the state's welfare rolls grew by 31 percent, its spending on both public assistance payments and Medicaid grew by about 50 percent. During Mr. Cuomo's tenure, state Medicaid spending has increased by 276 percent, partly because the state now pays some long-term care costs once paid by local governments.
In the last three years, the Governor and Legislature have made modest efforts to control Medicaid costs, like requiring many patients to join managed-care programs and asking some to make co-payments for selected services. But those changes have yet to have much impact on the budget.
The cost of social services is a major reason that the state's total spending grew by 129 percent during the Cuomo years, a period when the cumulative inflation rate in New York was 50 percent.
But the state's tax burden, measured by the Census Bureau as a percentage of personal income, is no higher today than it was when Mr. Cuomo took office. The Governor and Legislature cut personal income tax rates during the 1980's and the sales tax has remained at 4 percent in the Cuomo years.
But the Governor has agreed to a number of other increases in taxes and fees since 1990, including a 15 percent surcharge on the corporate income tax, a 5 percent hotel tax, and steep increases in taxes on petroleum.
Business leaders complain that the state's tax environment has contributed mightily to job losses. The state added 469,000 jobs in the first seven years of Mr. Cuomo's administration. But since then the state has lost that many jobs, and more. From July 1990 to February 1992, the period over which the country experienced a net loss of jobs, New York accounted for 28 percent of the total job loss.
"Sitting back and watching the erosion of the job base, clearly this situation can't go on much longer," said Marc M. Goloven, an economist with Chemical Bank. "Otherwise it becomes a question of who's going to turn off the lights. Stabilization of the job base isn't enough. I think the state has to begin discussing a radical transformation of its tax structure."
That message seems to have gotten through to Mr. Cuomo in the last year. In Wednesday's speech, he plans to call for "an atmosphere of aggressive hospitality to business," including cutting the corporate tax surcharge and the hotel tax.
 
Ultimate Happiness Of Unhappy Voters
 Local government leaders, meanwhile, argue that Mr. Cuomo has raised some taxes significantly -- theirs. Just as Mr. Cuomo has complained that the Federal Government passes financial burdens to the state, local leaders charge that the state has done the same to them, and that they have had to raise taxes to cope.
When only state taxes are considered, New York's tax burden ranks 22d among states, according to the Census Bureau. When state taxes are combined with local taxes, the state ranks second.
Edward C. Farrell, executive director of the New York Conference of Mayors, said that property taxes in cities and villages increased by an average of about 10 percent a year from 1989 to 1993, a period when the state cut its unrestricted aid to local governments by half. Twenty-one counties and four cities have increased sales taxes since 1990.
But Mr. Cuomo argues that local governments, particularly New York City, have not tightened belts the way the state has. He notes that the share of the state budget allotted for local aid has increased to 69 percent from 60 percent when he took office, although Mr. Farrell says that much of that money was for Medicaid and schools.
"They don't have an argument," Mr. Cuomo says of the local officials. "But they're winning politically because they have access to their people and they tell them over and over that it's the Governor."
Mr. Cuomo predicted that he will not be able to convince the public that he is right. "It's too complicated," he said. "And it's worse than that. People don't want to be convinced. Why? Because then I deny them the right to be mad at me. Then they're really unhappy."

 BODY:
The Rev. John Francis Cronin, a Roman Catholic priest who was an expert on labor, race relations and social justice, died on Sunday at St. Charles Villa, a Sulpician retirement home in Baltimore. He was 85.
Father Cronin came to national prominence in 1945 when the National Catholic Welfare Conference, now the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, named him assistant director of its Department of Social Action in Washington. He held that position for 22 years. 
 He often served as a church spokesman on social and political issues. He was considered an expert on Communism, and at the height of the cold war he was vice chairman of the All-American Conference to Combat Communism.
In 1962, his pamphlet, "Communism: Threat to Freedom," also took on right-wing fringe groups in the United States. He held that extremists were fomenting "a virulent form of disunity that is dangerously weakening the nation."
Father Cronin was a strong supporter of equal rights and opportunities. In 1963, he called for the formation of interdemoninational groups in every state to work for strong civil rights legislation.
"We should be in the forefront of demonstrations," he declared a year later, "to show our support for the civil rights movement."
He published many articles and books, including "Social Principles and Economic Life." Its final edition appeared in 1966.
He was a native of Glens Falls, N.Y. He studied at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., and graduated from the Sulpician Seminary in Washington, now known as the Theological College of Catholic University of America. He was ordained in 1932 in Albany as a member of the Society of St. Sulpice, an order devoted chiefly to the education of Roman Catholic priests.
He spent 11 years teaching economics and sociology at St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore. During his 11 years as a professor there, he became increasingly involved in labor relations and an expert on socio-economic matters.
He retired from the priesthood in 1975.

HEADLINE: Economists Trade Barbs Over President's Policy

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
No annual meeting of the American Economics Association would be complete without an assessment of current economic policy, but the one that took place today produced some unusual sparks.
Robert Barro, a Harvard professor and Reagan Republican, conceded that the Barro misery index had declined by half a percent during the first year of Bill Clinton's term. The index, which is occasionally featured in The Wall Street Journal, measures changes in joblessness, interest rates and such. "Less misery," he acknowledged. 
 Professor Barro, however, gave most of the credit for the improvement to a fellow Republican, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, not the President.
That brought a sharp retort from Robert Solow, a Nobel Laureate from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, a Democrat, who applauded the Administration's willingness to tax the rich and help the poor. His precise words, uttered with a glare at Professor Barro, and a flourish, were, "Stupidity is stupidity."
 
The Snow Factor
 Another panelist, Allan Meltzer from Carnegie Mellon, blamed the snowstorm swirling outside for the fracas.
Today's deliberations were the second in two sessions on Clintonomics. The session on Monday was a somewhat lopsided duel between four Clinton supporters, including two Administration members, on one side, and a lone Clinton critic, Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist who is the president of the National Bureau of Economics and was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in President Ronald Reagan's first term.
"It's a pleasure to be on a panel when the plaintiff is so badly outnumbered," Alan Blinder said on Monday.
Both sessions were "ritual dances," in Professor Solow's words. "Any kids with a computer could have predicted what everybody would say a year ago," he said.
 
Some Common Ground
 The least predictable thing about both panels was that the economists agreed about a few things.
Each agreed that the economy was doing fine -- despite the fact that they all live somewhere between Washington and Boston, a part of the country that is still struggling.
It is hard, Professor Feldstein acknowledged on Monday, to complain too loudly about an economy that is growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent or better, has a 6.4 percent unemployment rate and inflation of only about 3 percent.
He smiled when he, too, gave all the credit to Mr. Greenspan.
"Alan Greenspan deserves very high marks," he said. "As economists, we are all aware that the economy's performance is not a function of current Administration policy."
And all the economists, several of whom said they had feared the worst, sang hosannas about the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
'Very Good' Performance
 "The Administration's performance was not only positive, surprisingly positive," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an M.I.T. professor and Clinton supporter on Monday's panel. "It was actually very good.
Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Treasury Secretary who is being awarded the John Bates Clark medal for the best young economist under age 40, recalled wondering a year ago whether it would be a good idea to accept the invitation to defend the Administration's economic policy. On Monday, he said he was glad he had made the right deceision.
After all, as he put it, "This has been the most successful year for American international economic policy than any year since World War II."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Interest Rates Fall in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Interest rates on Government securities fell yesterday during a session that traders said was notable for its lack of liquidity.
Thin trading conditions often lead to big swings in prices, and yesterday was no exception. 
 After moving higher early in the day, prices of Treasury securities gave back all of their gains around midday on rumors that someone was selling a large block of intermediate-term notes.
But those rumors never materialized, and prices subsequently recovered. Bond yields, which reached their highest level since mid-August on Monday, fell back.
 
Yield Falls to 6.35%
 By late in the day, the Treasury's 6 1/4 percent 30-year bonds were offered at a price of 9822/32 , up 7/8 point, to yield 6.35 percent, down from 6.41 percent late Monday.
"There are not a lot of positions around, and there does not seem to be a willingness to take on new positions either," said John Costas, head of the government trading department at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Until we get the employment numbers on Friday I don't think we will see people willing to commit much money to the market."
The Labor Department is scheduled to report on December's employment conditions on Friday.
Some credit market analysts also pointed to weaker-than-expected 10-day car sales as a more fundamental reason for the turnaround in prices, although such sales are reported by only General Motors and Ford. Analysts had expected auto sales to increase in the final 10-day period of 1993 from already-strong levels recorded earlier last month. Still, auto sales for all of December were up roughly 5 percent from a year earlier.
The car sales numbers, along with a Johnson Redbook survey of retailers that showed sales slowed in December from November, means that December retail sales data expected next week are likely to show a rise of about four-tenths of a percent, said Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers.
That figure "is consistent with the idea that the economy will grow at a somewhat slower rate in the first quarter," Mr. Slifer said, "somewhere around 2.5 percent to 3 percent" from the 4.5 percent rate of growth he projects for the fourth quarter.
Despite the one-day rise in Treasury prices and drop in yields, many market participants remain wary. To a number of traders, stronger economic growth and a move by the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates appear almost inevitable.
"I think what we have seen for the last three or four months is likely to continue this year," one government-securities trader said. "Since August or early September, yields on the five year have moved from around 4.60 percent to close to 5.30 percent. That retracement has been fairly orderly. And I think that over the next year you will see a continuing trend toward higher rates and lower prices."
If not halted, the upward movement in yields on Treasury notes was delayed a bit yesterday.
 
Secondary Market Offerings
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 5 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at a price of 99 1/2, up 19/32 , to yield 5.82 percent. Meanwhile, the Treasury's 5 1/8 percent five-year notes were offered at a price of 9918/32 , up 10/32 , to yield 5.22 percent. And the 4 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 9931/32 , up 2/32 , to yield 4.26 percent.
Elsewhere, the first new issues of the year were priced in the corporate bond market. Three deals totaling $525 million in debt were priced.
The largest new issue was offered by the Bear Stearns Companies. The parent of the investment banking firm sold $250 million of 10-year, 6 5/8 percent notes through its principal subsidiary, Bear, Stearns & Company.
The notes, which mature in 2004, were priced at $99.55 to yield 6.687 percent, 85 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The other two new issues were a $150 million five-year note offering from the International Lease Finance Corporation and a $125 million high-yield note offering from ICF Kaiser International.
The quest by Federated Department Stores to take over R. H. Macy & Company continued to have a positive effect on the price of Macy's debt securities outstanding.
In the secondary market for high-yield junk bonds, the 14 1/2 percent Macy bonds due in 1998 were offered yesterday at $522.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. A week ago those bonds were trading at around $400 per thousand.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Snow Shuts Building Sites In East, Depressing Lumber

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lumber futures prices fell sharply yesterday as heavy snow in the East shut down construction sites and stifled demand for building materials.
Spruce two-by-fours for January delivery fell $10.50 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to $453.10 for 1,000 board feet. 
 January deliveries have tumbled nearly $35 since peaking Friday at a nine-month high of $488. The record high is $493.50, reached last March 15.
Cash lumber prices have remained between $460 and $465 since Christmas.
The futures market rocketed last week in response to strong housing sales figures, but the snowy weather that hit the East Coast Monday and yesterday cooled the speculative fever, analysts said.
"We got way ahead of ourselves," said Curt Cunningham, president of Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. "As long as the wood's not moving to the job site, the buyers can put off their inventory acquisition."
 
New Orders Scarce
 New orders were scarce yesterday at sawmills, but most mills have order files stretching to Jan. 17, so immediate price cuts are not likely on the cash market, said Bud Merrill, an analyst for Smith Barney Shearson in Eugene, Ore.
Meanwhile, weather worries eased in the market for frozen concentrated orange juice, where the January contract gained 8.25 cents a pound Monday on fears of freezing temperatures in the Florida Citrus Belt. January deliveries fell 3.7 cents Tuesday on the New York Cotton Exchange to $1.0895 a pound.
"You had panic buying yesterday and the trade took profits today," said Judy Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "The forecast seems to have moderated. People took a step back and realized that maybe the more conservative temperatures estimates were more in line with what was happening."
Forecasts for biting cold weather in the Northeast and Midwest also drove heating-oil futures higher and helped lift crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Light sweet crude for February delivery rose 11 cents, to $14.67 a barrel; January heating oil rose 0.20 cent, to 50.50 cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline jumped 0.93 cent, to 42.09 cents a gallon, and February natural gas rose 3.5 cents, to $1.964 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Michael Crichton;
Scarier Than Dinosaurs: Men vs. Women

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The waitresses and the owner of Takanawa welcome Michael Crichton enthusiastically as he walks in with a nod and a smile. It's his favorite luncheon spot in town -- a small, unfancy Japanese restaurant less than a mile from his office in Santa Monica, Calif.
"In this restaurant, the then owner came up to me with a review of 'Rising Sun,' and said, 'Is this you?' and I said, 'Yeah,' and he said, 'People are saying I shouldn't be your friend,' and I said, 'I'd like you to read it,' " recalled the author of such best sellers as "Jurassic Park" and "The Andromeda Strain." 
 Mr. Crichton settled into a seat. "So I got on the horn to Tokyo to get him an early Japanese copy," he said. "And when I came back he said two things that were characteristic of almost all Japanese readers. They say, 'The book is true, and I understand why you're being criticized.' And that's that."
The 51-year-old writer, bespectacled and buttoned-down, speaks slowly, firmly and laconically. Although charming and usually articulate, he always seems to be on guard.
The critical reaction to "Rising Sun" stunned him, he said, because reviewers mostly saw the book as a shocking polemic, wrapped in a murder mystery, about Japan economically crushing the United States.
"I was astounded at the reaction," Mr. Crichton said. "I was really trying to describe the cultural chasm. The memory of my book tour was I spent most of my time defending Japan. It was weird."
Mr. Crichton looked up and smiled. He said he wouldn't be astounded by the reaction to his new book, "Disclosure." The book is being published this week by Alfred A. Knopf, which is shipping out an extraordinary 900,000 copies to bookstores. In this case, with a book about what he calls "gender relations," Mr. Crichton seems to be courting controversy.
The novel turns the sexual politics of the 1980's and 90's upside down, and raises questions about everything from the contemporary balancing act between men and women at home and at work to, most explosively, sexual harassment.
The heart of the book, which is taken from a real incident, focuses on a successful, married, 40-ish male executive at a computer company in Seattle who rejects the sexual advances of his new boss, a woman. The fact that the woman was his lover 10 years before complicates the relationship. And what turns the situation even more treacherous is that the woman falsely accuses the man of sexual harassment.
The woman is, of course, beautiful and manipulative and has a pattern of trying to seduce men who work for her. (Picture a combination of Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" and Faye Dunaway in "Network.") The man is, well, a perfectly nice guy from the Tom Hanks school. The book has been sold to Warner Brothers for $3.5 million.
So, as feminist critics might ask, what can a multimillionaire from a privileged Long Island family, married four times, contribute to the often-ferocious debate about men, women and sex, circa 1994? Mr. Crichton anticipates that the main criticism of the book will be that sexual harassment of men by women is rare. He insists he is not obligated to write about typical situations.
He has done homework on the issue, as he habitually does before he writes. He interviewed the participants in the case. He read books about feminism, visited computer companies to talk to employees about sexual relationships between co-workers and spoke to lawyers about sexual harassment.
"Statistically," he said, "25 percent of harassment cases are brought by men, and the majority of those are against other men. Five percent of all harassment cases are brought by men against women.
"I think we live in a society in which it's perceived that if a man is coming on to a woman she's being stressed, but if a woman comes on to a man he's lucky. The reality is not necessarily that way.
"On all sides here there are unexamined issues and unstated feelings, feelings that people don't even know they have," he said. "You bring this out by reversing the ordinary roles. Let everybody see what the other side feels like. The goal, really, is to do something about harassment."
The goal is most certainly also to push a societal hot button and churn out another best seller. Although Mr. Crichton has been writing since his days at Harvard Medical School, and had his first best seller, "The Andromeda Strain," in 1969, he ascended to superstardom with the success of the movie "Jurassic Park."
Although he is not the darling of the literary critics, his books have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide. They are often viewed as a thinking person's escapism, chockablock with technical information.
In the restaurant, Mr. Crichton knows the menu by heart. He orders tea. He's solicitous and, essentially, a private man. "Do you like sushi?" he asks. "Do you prefer that or something cooked?" His interviewer pauses. "I detect some hesitation," he says. A compromise is reached: sushi and chicken teriyaki.
He works nearby in a bungalow that resembles a doctor's office. Although he graduated from medical school, he never practiced medicine, choosing to write instead, to the horror of his family -- even though his father was a journalist. ("I saw writing as a normal thing to do," he said. "My father would sit at a typewriter and pound out a story.")
Mr. Crichton also lives in Santa Monica with his wife, Anne-Marie Martin, an actress, and their daughter, Taylor, 4. Although married three times previously, he has no other children. Mr. Crichton is not fond of talking about his personal life, and barely smiles about the comment once made to him by the comedian Steve Martin: "Haven't you ever heard of pre-marital sex?"
He shrugs. "All those times I just wanted to get married," he said, grasping for words. "It was very emotional, you know. I was just trying to get it . . . right." He bursts into nervous laughter.
What propelled him to write "Disclosure" was, he said, the evolving relations between men and women. And beyond this, his ambition has always centered on questioning "the reigning dogma."
"What you're really seeing here is a protected area, a kind of intellectual protectionism where things aren't debated or fully discussed," he said. "And certainly many people have commented that feminism has not been very tolerant of internal dissent." He cited authors like Katie Roiphe and Naomi Wolf, whose books on rape and women's issues have stirred some angry comments among feminists.
As for him? His book, unlike theirs, is a novel, but a novel that he insists is a reflection of what's happening.
Mr. Crichton said his research at computer companies startled him.
"For one thing, there's a lot of sex in these companies," he said. "More and more people draw their social life from their work environment. And the human-resources people kind of throw up their hands. A lot of companies have a rule that if you're having a private relationship with someone who works for the company you have to report it. You can do it but it can't be secret. Well, of course it's secret.
"People are naturally concerned that their boss may have a special relationship with someone and that person will receive favored treatment. And women basically felt that they didn't have any problems with harassment or even unpleasant situations, except with men over 40."
But as more women rise to senior levels, Mr. Crichton said, the situations are bound to become complicated. Or reversed.
"I asked women how they arranged their social lives, and they said they sometimes pick stud muffins for their subordinates," he said. "And I'd say, 'Are you sure this man is free to turn you down?' It seemed to me almost classic."
Having finished his meal, he relaxed a bit as he chatted about less weighty matters. At 6 feet 9 inches, Mr. Crichton rose from the table, bid farewell to the restaurant staff, and slouched beneath the door to leave. "People always say to me, 'You play basketball?' and I say, 'No," and they say, 'You should.' " He laughed and walked along Wilshire Boulevard to his white Ford Explorer.
"It would be a refreshing change to write something where I'm not attacked," Mr. Crichton said. "When the movie 'Jurassic Park' came out, public-relations flacks for biotechnology companies began writing Op-Ed pieces saying how damaging and anti-science it was."
"Give me a break," he said with a laugh. "Life is too short. It's only a dinosaur movie."

DATELINE: MASHATU GAME RESERVE, Botswana

 BODY:
DOES zinfandel go well with kudu? Or leopard? Elephant? And baboon, what about baboon?
Here in the far southwest corner of Botswana, in Southern Africa, zinfandel goes with any of a hundred different wild creatures 
 Not, to be sure, while eating these exotic birds and beasts, because in this game reserve, no one is allowed to harm them, much less eat them. Let's just say, they don't seem to object to anyone drinking wine in their company.
This fact became vividly clear at a "wine weekend" held at Mashatu recently, during which this correspondent conducted, if that's the word, a tasting of American wines deep in the African bush.
Mashatu, named after a tree native to this part of Africa, is the largest privately owned game reserve in Southern Africa, comprising 90,000 acres, twice the size of Brooklyn. Located about 300 miles north of Johannesburg, it is bordered on the northeast by Zimbabwe and on the south and southwest by South Africa.
Although privately owned, by Rattray Reserves, a South African company, Mashatu is part of the 17 percent of Botswana's land devoted to wildlife preserves. Landlocked Botswana is supported by a substantial income derived from diamonds. Larger than France but with a smaller population than Dallas, Botswana is sometimes called the Switzerland of Africa because of its political stability and relatively strong economy.
Tourism is a growing business in Botswana. Travelers from around the world come here, though still in small numbers, to catch a glimpse of what many ecologists fear is a disappearing Africa.
Visits of any length can be arranged, but at a remote reserve like Mashatu, the schedule is attuned to long weekends. Guests, almost all of them from South Africa, arrive Thursday or Friday and leave Sunday. Some drive to the South Africa-Botswana border and make the trip into the reserve in Land Rovers; most fly into the Mashatu airstrip in private planes or on charter flights.
From 5 to 9 A.M. and again from 4 to 8 or 9 P.M., guests spend their time crashing through the bush in four-wheel-drive vehicles, tracking leopards, giraffes, cheetahs, impalas, kudus, baboons and the herds of elephants, which trudge tirelessly through the park in search of food.
Animals and visitors tend to lie low in the midday heat, making it a good time for the pool -- or for a wine tasting. On the first full day, the group went through a batch of interesting South African wines.
The next day, a steady breeze prompted the rangers to suggest taking the American wines outdoors. Carrying them gently, in ice buckets, over the rough, often nonexistent trails though the bush, we did, to an idyllic spot on the bank of the dry Limpopo River, a victim of southern Africa's decade-long drought. The Limpopo forms the border between Botswana and South Africa.
Onerous import duties combined with the now-lifted sanctions have effectively kept all but a minute quantity of foreign wine out of South Africa. So the 25 or 30 guests, all of them South Africans, were as eager to try a California chardonnay as they had been to see a kori bustard or lesser kudu earlier in the day.
What wines to show? Good wines, widely available in this country at reasonable prices. Chosen were:
* Edna Valley Vineyards, chardonnay, 1991.
* Bonny Doon Vineyard, Vin Gris de Cigare, 1991.
* Sanford Winery, pinot noir, 1990.
* Ridge, zinfandel, Sonoma, 1991.
* Fetzer Vineyards, Barrel Select cabernet sauvignon, 1989.
* Robert Mondavi Vineyards, Reserve cabernet sauvignon, 1989.
Except for the Mondavi cabernet, which sells for more than $20, all the wines sell for about $15 or less and are nationally distributed in the United States.
Burgundy-style wines are much in vogue in South Africa. Both new wine makers and older wineries are working to improve the quality of their pinot noirs and chardonnays. The Sanford Winery and Edna Valley wines were judged to be the equal of anything currently produced in South Africa, but even more impressive to the professionals in the group was the fact that thousands of cases of both wines are produced annually.
Most in the group felt the Bonny Doon Vin Gris, a rose, was excellent but not much different from some of the better roses produced in South Africa. The Mondavi reserve cabernet, though still closed-in, was greeted with something akin to awe; not so much for its intensity but for its elegance and breed, qualities sought after but not always achieved to such a degree in wines of the Western Cape.
The popular favorites of the day were clearly the Fetzer cabernet and the Ridge zinfandel. Cabernet is not uncommon in South Africa but tends to be austere. The plummy richness and sheer accessibility of the Fetzer wine came as a revelation to the tasters. Even more astonishing was the price, usually under $10.
The zinfandel got much the same reception. A small amount of zinfandel is produced in South Africa, but it's still considered rather exotic. The tasters were intrigued by the fact that a wine could be so intense and so drinkable at the same time.
Peter Devereux, a Johannesburg writer and wine expert, who presided over the wine weekend, told his assembled countrymen that the tasting, even though limited to half a dozen wines, indicated to him that South African wine makers were 15 years behind their Californian counterparts.
He spoke of South Africa's long isolation and need to catch up in order to share in the world market. "When South Africa can make wines like these consistently and at similar prices, we can be said to have arrived," he said.
Among other things, the tasting in the bush showed that good California wines can stand up under some unusual conditions. Before the jaunt into the bush, Mr. Devereux banned smoking and suggested that no one wear any strong scent.
He forgot to tell the elephants. Fortunately the breeze held up for most of the afternoon.
 
TASTINGS Rodney Strong Zinfandel 1990, Old Vines, Russian River, Sonoma; about $14.
 
 These gnarled vines, which Rodney Strong estimates to be at least 90 years old, are hardly prolific, but the fruit they produce is deeply colored and intensely flavored. And so is the wine he and his wine makers make from them. From the days when the winery was called Sonoma Vineyards, it has been known for full, rich zinfandels at reasonable prices. This particular wine spent 18 months in oak and is about 14 percent alcohol, which is high, except for a rich, full-bodied wine like this. Rhone wines are the latest thing in California -- wines made from the hot-climate grapes of the Rhone Valley in France, like sirah, mourvedre, cinsault and grenache. Luckily a few farsighted wine makers are focusing on the old-fashioned zinfandel, an American grape with many of the properties so admired in the Rhone varieties. The best zins, as Californians call them, are more than a match for most California versions of Chateauneuf and Hermitage. This estate-bottled wine is one of those zins.

HEADLINE: Review/Opera;
Lush French Rarity, Via Shakespeare

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
The sensitivity and gentle exoticism of Reynaldo Hahn's art songs have made them centerpieces of the modern recital literature. But the operas, operettas and musical theater works he composed for the French stage in the first decades of this century have become footnotes in operatic history, scarcely mentioned in reference works and virtually never performed.
Hahn died only 47 years ago, so perhaps history's verdict is not final. Granted, a real reconsideration would require full-scale productions and recordings of works that have been collecting dust, and given the costs involved in presenting opera these days, few major companies (or singers) are likely to commit their resources to uncertain payoffs. 
 Small companies, on the other hand, thrive on taking chances, and perhaps their efforts should have greater reach. Opera Manhattan, a six-year-old company dedicated to presenting rarities, is making an eloquent case for Hahn with "Le Marchand de Venise." The production runs through tonight at St. Peter's Church (Lexington Avenue at 54th Street).
Hahn composed this setting of Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice," with a French libretto by Miguel Zamacois, for the Paris Opera in 1935. Zamacois and Hahn took some interesting liberties with the Shakespeare text. Minor characters are dropped and the play's many changes of setting are compressed into five scenes in three acts. Shylock is also conceived differently. In some ways, the verbal abuse he suffers from the Venetians is more direct than in Shakespeare, but instead of the "Hath not a Jew eyes" speech, Zamacois and Hahn give him a dramatic aria in which he delivers a more historically pointed denunciation of centuries of Christian anti-Semitism.
Hahn's musical characterizations are magnificent. Offsetting the bitterness and drama of Shylock's music are the shapely, supple melodies assigned to the three pairs of lovers: Portia and Bassanio, Jessica and Lorenzo, Nerissa and Gratiano. There are touches of tone painting, the most vivid being the gently bobbing music that underlies the discussion of the gondola that will spirit away Jessica and Lorenzo. Holding everything together is a musical language that combines Mozartean gracefulness, a distinctly French sense of harmony and pastel coloration, and even a touch of French folk song in the choruses.
Since 1992, Opera Manhattan has donated the box-office receipts from all of its productions to the Community Research Initiative on AIDS, and in the interest of keeping its production costs low, it resorts to some inventive economies. The company's director, Gabriel Guimaraes, reduced the orchestration to wind quintet, harp and piano, and took the work's Mozartean character as a cue to accompany the recitative sections with piano only. Yet the arrangement offered a vivid impression of the work's lushness and beauty, and on Monday evening the musicians, directed from the keyboard by Mr. Guimaraes, gave the score an energetic, nicely balanced reading.
There is no scenery to speak of, but Marc J. Reiss's stage direction made good use of the church's resources, and suggested the settings and action reasonably. The attractive costumes, by Anthony Muto, also abetted the illusion of a more ambitious staging. Unusual for a production this small, there were English supertitles, which were helpful.
Vocally, the company was hobbled by throat infections on Monday evening, but the singers persevered and generally did themselves credit.
Peter Becker took the role of Shylock on two days' notice, and sang it from the score. Yet he endowed his reading with power and coloration.
Among the better-rehearsed singers, the strongest were Robert Sapolsky, whose smooth, firmly produced baritone made him an appealing Bassanio, and Rosemary Barenz, who brought a bright, steady soprano to Portia's often challenging music.
Keren Bernbaum, a mezzo-soprano with a warm, rich tone, was an effective Nerissa, and Marion Capriotti, also a mezzo, gave lively performances of some smaller roles. The cast included Michael Alhonte (Antonio), Robert Hancock (Gratiano), Richard Slade (Lorenzo), Erin Langston (Jessica) and Eric Owens (Tubal).

HEADLINE: Economy Dampens Ardor of Brazilians

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 3

 BODY:
In a tropical land soaked with sensuality, economic anxieties are tarnishing a point of Brazilian national pride: bedroom performance.
Harried by annual inflation of 2,500 percent, a national record, sexually active Brazilians are now having sexual relations 1.6 times a week, according to a survey of 2,631 adults conducted by the Brasmarket polling group. 
 This is almost half the rate of three times a week registered by pollsters five years ago and dangerously near the once-a-week frequency recorded in polls of American adults.
"You can't be a victim in the street and a hero in bed," Moacir Costa, a Sao Paulo psychotherapist, told Isto E, a newsweekly that commissioned the poll.
Two-thirds of the adults surveyed complained that the economic crisis was dampening their libido.
"What is happening in Brazil was recorded in Argentina during the 1980's when that country went through a great economic crisis," said Gerson Lopes, an author of books on Brazilian sexual mores. Surveys indicated that Argentine sexual encounters dropped sharply with economic hard times: from four a week to one a week.
A non-economic worry may be affecting Brazilians' sex habits, too. Roughly one million Brazilians are infected with the virus that causes AIDS. So far, about 45,000 Brazilians have developed AIDS, a toll that, outside Africa, is second only to that in the United States.
Brazil's sex crisis is manifested at the dilapidated motels that line Rio's access roads. These establishments charge by the hour, feature mirrors on the ceilings and carry suggestive names like Lipstick, Pussycat and L'Amour. Opened up like beer bottles in the economic go-go years of the 1970's, many of Rio's 225 motels are now deteriorating from a lack of maintenance.
Once discreet, the motels now fight to survive by advertising on television and by offering promotions like discount lottery tickets or a free lunch for two. Even so, Rio's motel industry trade association estimates that motels are renting their rooms at discounts averaging 40 percent.
This decline in leisure spending is seen throughout Brazil's economy, including video rentals, record sales and movie ticket sales. Since 1991, Brazil's cigarette consumption has dropped by one-third, to about a billion cigarettes this year.
"Economic constraints have a big impact on casual sexual relations," said Richard G. Parker, an American anthropologist here who wrote "Bodies, Pleasures and Passions: Sexual Culture in Contemporary Brazil" (Beacon Press 1991). "There are an awful lot of heterosexual encounters that require a fair amount of money: a bar bill, a dinner, a motel room."
Contributing to sexual frustration, weddings dropped sharply during Brazil's recessionary years. From 1988 to 1990, the number of weddings in Brazil dropped 18 percent, to 777,000. Census data show that the favorite month for Brazilian weddings shifted from May to December, the month when workers receive year-end bonuses mandated by law.
Brazil's sex crisis has tormented Valdomiro Ferreira in more ways than one. In 1992, Mr. Ferreira owned six shops selling sexual aids. With the economic squeeze, his clientele dried up, and he closed four shops.
"I got to the point of going without sex for one month, I was so worried about my work," the Rio businessman complained to Isto E. "Before, I used to have relations every day, even without being any kind of superman."
In descending order of importance, respondents to the Brasmarket poll listed the following reasons for flagging sex drive: insecurity; lack of money for a date; criminality, which may discourage people from going out, and lack of money for a motel.
In a country traditionally known for optimism and self-confidence, male self-doubt has reached such a point that a prime-time soap opera, "Fera Ferida," featured an impotent athlete in its plot this season. Once a rake, the character started to encounter bedroom trouble after he broke his leg on the eve of his debut on Brazil's national soccer team.

HEADLINE: In America;
Balance, Mr. Mayor

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It's a good thing Andrew Giuliani was on hand throughout his father's inaugural address on Sunday. The sustained antics of the uninhibited 7-year-old -- who made faces and parroted his father, and offered such unsolicited observations as "He's right, you know" -- provided the only real warmth and exuberance during the speech.
It'll be awhile before we see another successful politician as stiff and as chilly as New York's new Mayor. By comparison, Vice President Al Gore is a regular vaudevillian. 
 Andrew also gave his dad, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the opening for a rare display of humor. Mr. Giuliani said the city's corporation counsel had expressed concern that Andrew, having helped his father recite the oath of office, might in fact have become co-Mayor.
"We're trying to figure out what's the legal effect of what he did yesterday," said Mr. Giuliani. "Paul Crotty is concerned that not only did he take the oath, he gave an inaugural address."
New Yorkers may need Andrew before this whole thing is over. He's the lighter side of his cold and calculating, technocratic and potentially ruthless old man.
In essence, Rudolph Giuliani is a cop. What the city hopes to get from him is a crackdown on crime. Anything else is a bonus. Anything less is a failure.
Toward the end of Sunday's speech, Mr. Giuliani said, "American cities can't survive as we know them if they remain so violent. Our priority must be to reduce the violence.
"I'll place a much greater emphasis on stricter enforcement of the law to reverse the growing trend of ever-increasing tolerance for lawless behavior. I'll work for changes in policing and in criminal justice that will redress the balance that I believe is now out of balance. Guns, the handguns, will be a particular source of our efforts."
The Mayor made a good start when he ordered the deployment of 15 cops to patrol the area around Taft High School in the Bronx. The administration described the deployment as the first step in fulfilling Mr. Giuliani's promise to create safety zones around the city's schools.
The Mayor also spoke in his inaugural address about the need to get at "the underlying causes of crime."
"This," he said, "will be as important a part of my administration as respect for the law."
Don't count on it. This is the same man who threatened during the campaign to throw homeless people out of the shelters after 90 days; the same man who vowed to sweep the streets of drug dealers without explaining how he would pay for prosecuting or incarcerating them; the same man who said initially that gun licensing would be a good idea even if it put guns into the hands of more people.
Rudolph Giuliani is not a root-causes kind of guy. He's much more likely to say "Stop doing that!" than "Why are you doing that?"
Compassion, even apart from the crime issue, has not been Mr. Giuliani's strong suit. And it's not likely to be a hallmark of his regime.
Last week's flap over funding of the arts provided a revealing glimpse of the cold heart of this administration. John Dyson, Mr. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, suggested that more support be given to the city's elite cultural institutions, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, by reducing the funding to smaller and less renowned cultural groups.
The reason: The elite institutions bring in more tourist dollars, thus boosting the city's economy.
This caused a furor and Mr. Dyson subsequently backed off. But his proposal is exactly the kind you can expect from an excessively technical and pragmatic approach to city government.
The city needs some balance. There's more to life in a great metropolis than budgets and badges.
By inclination, and with the public's blessing, Mr. Giuliani will be focused on law enforcement.
Co-Mayor Andrew will be available to provide us with a chuckle from time to time.
The many other aspects of life in the city -- including the joyful, the magical and the humane -- will have to be watched over by the rest of us, both in and out of government, who understand that while safe streets are essential, they're only the beginning.

HEADLINE: Foreign Policy Nears a Peril Point

BYLINE: By Brent Scowcroft and Richard Haass; Brent Scowcroft, president of the Forum for International Policy, a foreign affairs foundation, was national security adviser under George Bush and Gerald R. Ford. Richard Haass, a National Security Council staff member in the Bush Administration, is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The foreign policy debate during the Clinton Administration's first year focused almost totally on secondary issues. The country can ill afford such a luxury this year.
The only first-magnitude issue to get large-scale public attention and sustained Presidential focus (at the eleventh hour) was the North American Free Trade Agreement. Other such issues -- Russia, the Middle East, North Korea, China, Japan, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- drew episodic high-level attention from an Administration preoccupied with domestic concerns. 
 Three of the four most debated policies were Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti -- all areas of actual or potential military intervention where American interests were less than vital.
Despite progress on trade and in the Middle East, the lack of focus on the big issues has led to weakened relationships with our allies and a loss of support at home for continued U.S. leadership in the world.
The outlook is approaching a point of peril for shaping a coherent foreign policy. To reverse this trend, President Clinton needs to choose a few priority issues for 1994 and act on them. Here are five candidates -- all matters where important U.S. interests are at stake and where our actions can make a difference.
Dealing with Russia, Ukraine and the rest of the former Soviet Union.
The Administration has established American support for Boris Yeltsin as a leading force for political and economic reform. With the parliamentary elections over and the new Constitution approved, we have to broaden U.S.-Russian relations.
Besides expanding our contacts with all responsible elements of the political spectrum and emphasizing support not for individuals but for democratic institutions and market reforms, we should spend more time on such emerging features of Russia's foreign policy as its more menacing positions on nuclear weapons and the former Soviet empire.
If Russia can object to the expansion of NATO, the West should be able to make the expansion of Russian influence no less an issue. We have to make clear that our long-term support is not unconditional and will depend on Russia's adherence to political and economic reforms and restraint toward its neighbors.
U.S. relations with Russia cannot be the sole avenue through which U.S. relations with Ukraine are conducted. Our policy toward Ukraine has been confrontational and one-dimensional, linking our willingness to provide assistance and normalize relations to Ukraine's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons. But the more we push this approach, the more the Ukrainians conclude that the weapons are valuable.
Given Ukraine's collapsing economy and Russia's uncertain intentions toward an independent Ukraine, we could end up with the worst of all worlds: an unstable and isolated Ukraine with nuclear weapons. We should seek to promote Ukrainian stability, with support tied only to needed economic and political reforms; with this approach, the nuclear question can be addressed more productively.
Consolidating European security.
Too much of the U.S.-European dialogue has been consumed by squabbles over trade, finger-pointing over Bosnia and counterproductive suggestions that Asia is more important to us than Europe, as if the two regions were mutually exclusive. We need to resume a serious dialogue on possible external threats to European stability.
The issue of expanding NATO will top the agenda at the NATO summit meeting next week. But it does not need formal expansion to deal with former Warsaw Pact countries. Our goal in Eastern Europe should be to provide security and to consolidate political and economic progress (on which our help has been stingy), not to encourage governments to devote scarce resources to defense in order to earn admission to NATO.
Nor should our goal be to make NATO so large that it becomes unwieldy. We can promote European stability by developing less formal military ties to Eastern Europe and making it clear that we will extend security guarantees if Moscow threatens its neighbors' security. This approach should reassure Eastern Europe, avoid unduly provoking Moscow and give us leverage over Russia's external behavior.
Pacifying North Korea.
We have a clear interest in avoiding conflict on the Korean peninsula. We have an equally clear interest in making sure North Korea does not provoke an Asian arms race and does not add a nuclear dimension to the threat it poses to regional stability.
The Administration said yesterday it was close to a compromise with Pyongyang. It is making a crucial error. Any arrangements for inspections must provide for not onetime but regular and full access to all sites -- not merely the seven apparently agreed upon -- that are known or suspected of having nuclear-weapons activities. If the North takes concrete steps to reduce the threat to the peninsula and the region, we should open meaningful political and economic relations. But whatever happens, the U.S. and South Korea should continue joint military exercises and strengthen the defenses of the South against attack from the North, whether nuclear or conventional.
Fostering strategic dialogue with the Asia-Pacific powers.
The North Korean issue demonstrates how important political-military relations remain in the Pacific.
China's negative attitude on sanctions against North Korea, its aggressive and dangerous policy on arms exports, Japan's hints about rethinking its non-nuclear-weapons policy, the conventional military buildup among members of the Association of Southeast Asian states -- all suggest strongly that we cannot allow our diplomacy with the world's most vibrant economies to be dominated by trade disputes.
Instead, we need broader consultations on national priorities and changing national relationships in a dynamic Asia.
Strengthening the sinews of foreign policy.
Chief among the requisites for successful foreign policy is a credible military able to give weight and support to policy. The Administration has cut the already much reduced defense budget it inherited from George Bush. The cuts are even larger than often realized, considering that the defense budget includes a range of international activities that do not contribute directly to U.S. forces.
We cannot allow the U.S. military to become a hollow instrument in which the sizes and composition of our forces and their readiness are not supported by necessary training, maintenance, personnel and spare parts. The Defense Secretary-designate, Bobby Ray Inman, faces a tough job. He must convince President Clinton to finance the Pentagon's possible budget request of $255 billion for the 1995 fiscal year and fight for it on Capitol Hill.
President Clinton, who has shown his ability to exploit the power of his office to shape the nation's political agenda -- on the budget, health care, crime -- must do no less on issues of foreign and defense policy.
There are, of course, other national security matters deserving high-level attention. A short list includes consolidating and where possible expanding gains in trade liberalization, continuing Iraq's isolation, maintaining vigilance toward Iran, promoting democratic change in Cuba, normalizing ties with Vietnam, coping with continuing instability in the former Yugoslavia and rethinking our relationship to peacekeeping, peacemaking and the United Nations.
These or other issues may turn out to require sustained, high-level involvement -- say, if the Middle East peace process falters of if the war in Bosnia spreads. But what is certain is that the big issues require special attention in the Oval Office. They offer the areas of greatest opportunity if the U.S. takes the lead -- and the greatest risk if we do not.

HEADLINE: Raise in Rent Aid Would Curb Homelessness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In these recessionary times, when even people with substantial work histories and job skills face reduced job security and people with few skills or handicaps are virtually barred from the work force, New York State must maintain its safety net for people unable to work. County public assistance grants are often the last resort to which people with no income can turn. 
 The majority of public assistance recipients in this state are children, and the vast majority of grants are given to families. A critical part of the grant is the shelter allowance, an amount issued to pay rental expenses, which is supposed to allow these families to secure and remain in stable housing. However, the allowance is inadequate.
The level of the shelter allowance has not been raised since 1988, despite almost universal increases in housing costs. The public assistance grant for a household of three brings that household, on average, to only 58 percent of the poverty level. The disparity between income and cost leads directly to homelessness, as families who rely on public assistance cannot pay their rent, are evicted and cannot obtain new housing.
It also contributes to hunger and poor health, as these families try to juggle their income to meet expenses and must choose between a roof over their heads or enough to eat.
This low shelter allowance is also a false economy for the state. Emergency assistance to homeless families, whether as huge shelters in urban areas or welfare motels in rural areas, costs more per family than paying the rent on an apartment. Those adults who have employment often lose it in periods of homelessness because of the disruption in their lives, loss of transportation to their jobs, if the emergency shelter takes them out of the area, and the overwhelming time demands of the bureaucracy involved.
This inevitably increases the need for public assistance. There is an additional human cost in psychological trauma, especially to children, which is difficult to measure but is ultimately borne not only by the victim of homelessness but also by society when that child has difficulty adjusting to school, integrating into the work force or interacting with peers.
New York State should increase the shelter allowance in the 1994-95 budget year to meet these needs. This requires political courage on the part of government officials. However, such courage and compassion for those excluded from the economic benefits of society can justifiably be expected and demanded from those who lead.

HEADLINE: Cuba Embargo Has Had Desired Effect

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"U.S. Companies Use Affiliates Abroad to Skirt Sanctions," your Dec. 27 front-page report on Cuba and Libya, misleads your readers to believe that the case regarding Cargill Inc.'s sale of Cuban sugar shows how American corporations seize on "porous laws" to use foreign subsidiaries and circumvent the United States embargo on Cuba. This is not the case. 
 The 1988-89 Cargill case involves the Trading With the Enemy Act and took place three years before enactment of the Cuban Democracy Act, which I sponsored and which became law on Oct. 23, 1992.
The Cuban Democracy Act prohibited such trade. The results speak for themselves: United States trade through foreign subsidiaries fell from $718 million in 1991 to only $1.6 million last year. What remains covers contracts in effect when the Cuban Democracy Act became law because United States laws are not applied retroactively. The Cargill case discussed in the article involves the possible involvement by Cargill United States in the 1989 financing of sugar, which had already been sold by Cuba to Venezuela. The case is an enforcement action under the Trading With the Enemy Act, and it is continuing.
I have expressed my outrage about this case to Attorney General Janet Reno and underscored that if the allegations are true and if Cargill is found guilty, both the corporate officers involved and the company should be prosecuted.
Contrary, however, to your article's assertion that "the trading involved here raises questions about the effectiveness of one of the most visible tools of United States foreign policy," the Cuban Democracy Act, passed four years after this case, definitely answers questions about the effectiveness of the embargo. United States trade through foreign subsidiaries has ground to a halt.
While your article's investigative reporting is valuable, your analysis of the United States embargo must be put into context. The Cuban economy, particularly without its Soviet benefactor, is crumbling; Fidel Castro's own family wants out, and the final period of President Castro's dictatorship is here.
The embargo has had its effect, and the day when the United States will trade with a free Cuba is near.
In the meantime, it is important to correct the impression that is given by the article, that United States laws regarding trade with Cuba are lax. That is simply wrong, and it is a dangerous impression because United States trade with Cuba, directly or indirectly, without a license is illegal, and violators will surely be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

HEADLINE: Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Dies at 81; A Power in the House for Decades

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

 BODY:
Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., an unreconstructed New Deal liberal from Massachusetts who rose to become Speaker of the House for 10 years, died last night at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 81 and lived in Washington and Harwich Port, Mass.
The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a statement released by his family. 
 Mr. O'Neill was an old-style politician and proud of it, a House Speaker comfortable with power, who clung to his brand of liberalism long after it ceased to be fashionable, even among his fellow Democrats.
An early opponent of the Vietnam War, Mr. O'Neill took strong positions on many controversial issues. He was the Congressional leader who pushed hardest for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon and later, as Speaker, put his prestige on the line for Congressional reform.
Mr. O'Neill was the Speaker from 1977 to 1987, during the Presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, both of whom ran against entrenched Washington officials and considered Mr. O'Neill the ultimate insider.
But although he reached the heights of political power and mingled easily with national and world leaders, Mr. O'Neill was perhaps best known for his advice to colleagues to attend carefully to their constituents, because, as he put it, "All politics is local."
He was a large, joyous, generous-spirited man with a bulbous nose, yellowed white hair that flopped over his forehead and an ever-present cigar. He was a rabid sports fan, frequently attending baseball games and boxing matches, a skilled poker player and a devoted but struggling golfer.
To Mr. O'Neill, who spoke of the Democratic Party with near-religious fervor, the party was the one of the cities, the working people, the poor, the needy, the unemployed, the sick and the disinherited. "And no way are we ever going to let them down," he would insist. He opposed a balanced budget because, he said, it would "dismantle the programs that I've been working for as an old liberal."
When President Reagan persuaded Congress to curtail many of Mr. O'Neill's favorite social programs, the Speaker lamented that the Democrats had been too successful at their work. He said the Democratic programs had created a broad middle class whose members had forgotten the many benefits they had received from government -- in education and housing, for example -- and wanted to pull up the ladder behind them.
Republicans made Mr. O'Neill a target of their 1980 and 1982 campaigns, portraying him as a bloated old pol with outdated liberal ideas. They produced a television commercial that featured an actor who resembled the Speaker laughing off warnings that his car was low on fuel, until the vehicle finally ground to a halt. The announcer then proclaimed, "The Democrats have run out of gas."
Mr. O'Neill remained steadfast. "I haven't changed my philosophy," he frequently told reporters, with whom he met daily.
He made no apologies for the kind of politics he had mastered in Boston. As Speaker, he rewarded friends and punished enemies with the help of a long memory but few grudges.
 
Carter and O'Neill: Different Democrats
 Mr. O'Neill's became Speaker the year Mr. Carter took office as President. About all they had in common was their political party. Mr. Carter, an emotionally taut Georgian with a scant power base among Democrats, had reached the White House as an anti-politician, an outsider who publicly disdained Washington insiders personified by the gregarious Speaker, who had worked his way up from ward politics.
"Our first conversation," the Speaker recalled, "he told me how he had handled the Georgia Legislature, by going over their heads directly to the people."
Mr. O'Neill said he responded by referring to the 289 House Democrats in the majority. "I said: 'Hey, wait a minute. You have 289 guys up there who know their districts pretty well. They ran against the Administration, and they wouldn't hesitate to run against you.
"He said, 'Oh, really?' "
The two men did not speak the same language. Mr. O'Neill said he had once told the President, "Keep your left hand high." But the Speaker found that Mr. Carter was no boxing fan and was unfamiliar with the boxer's classic defensive posture. "He didn't know what I was talking about," Mr. O'Neill said.
But as a loyal Democrat Mr. O'Neill felt morally bound to help Mr. Carter whenever possible. An autographed photograph from the President was inscribed, "To my friend Tip O'Neill, thanks for another lesson in good politics, Jimmy Carter, June 1977."
But in 1980, when the Republicans won the White House and the Senate and cut deeply into the House Democratic majority, the Speaker privately blamed the President, believing him inept.
 
O'Neill and Reagan: Different Irishmen
 Mr. O'Neill never shied from wielding power, although he frequently lamented that the power of the Speaker had declined since the days of Sam Rayburn, the Texas Democrat whose word became law during his 17 years in the post, ending in 1961. That was when a Speaker could get binding commitments from committee chairmen; it was before the diffusion of power that Mr. O'Neill himself worked to bring about.
From 1981 to 1987, Mr. O'Neill led the loyal opposition to President Reagan, a man with whom he shared an Irish heritage, an interest in sports and an outgoing personality. But the two men had a profound philosophical disagreement about government: the Speaker regarded government as the solution to many social problems, as an agent of social change; Mr. Reagan regarded it as a problem in itself, interfering in the lives of Americans and impeding economic and social progress.
The Speaker also found Mr. Reagan to be appallingly ignorant of the intricacies of government; indeed, he called him the most ignorant man who had ever occupied the White House. Publicly, Mr. O'Neill called Mr. Reagan "Herbert Hoover with a smile" and "a cheerleader for selfishness."
Early in his time as Speaker, when his bill for a new House code of ethics was in trouble, he lumbered to the well of the House and cut through the debate on the key provision, a limitation on outside income. The speech was vintage O'Neill.
Sure, he said, he knew what it was to be strapped. Wasn't he the one who had fought for a raise of $12,900 a year in Congressional pay? But in exchange he had promised the American people "the strongest code of ethics that this country has ever seen." The issue, after Watergate, he thundered, was "restoring public confidence in this Congress as an institution, restoring confidence in its membership."
He looked out at an audience that included the 80 Democrats for whom he had campaigned the previous fall, the scores of members he had appointed to the nine select and special committees over which he had jurisdiction, and the more than 200 beneficiaries of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Fund, for which he had been the chairman.
His listeners knew that the Speaker had a great voice in their committee assignments, the scheduling of floor action on bills, the disbursing of campaign money and the small favors that can make or break a Congressional career. Mr. O'Neill called in his chits. The result was a foregone conclusion. The vote was 344 to 79.
Four years later, when 44 Democrats joined in voting to overturn a ruling of the chair, the kind of parliamentary decision that is the lifeblood of the House, Mr. O'Neill wrote them a letter that he was "extremely disappointed" and obliquely warned that "disciplinary measures" were under consideration.
Such measures could affect a member's committee assignments. He added that he felt that such measures were unnecessary. No future Democratic votes against the judgment of the chair were noted.
Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. was born on Dec. 9, 1912, in working-class area of Cambridge, Mass., which later became part of his Congressional district. His father was a member of the Cambridge City Council. His mother died when he was a child, and his father remarried.
He picked up the nickname "Tip" from a baseball player, James Edward O'Neill of the old St. Louis Browns, who had the knack of hitting foul tips until the pitcher walked him. So Mr. O'Neill's boyhood friends gave him the name. The Speaker was an inveterate fan of the Boston Red Sox.
Educated in Roman Catholic schools, he broke into politics at 15, campaigning for Al Smith in his 1928 Presidential campaign against Herbert C. Hoover. "All I knew was that Al Smith was an Irish Catholic and we had been suppressed all our lives," he said.
Four years later, he helped get out the vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt. "You'd have Mrs. Murphy ready to get into an automobile to take her to the polls," he recalled. "And then you'd go to the next house, Mrs. Sweeney, and you'd have the car come for Mrs. Sweeney. We walked the streets to get the votes out."
As a senior at Boston College, Mr. O'Neill lost his first campaign, for the Cambridge City Council, by 150 votes. But he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1936, where he rose to Speaker, and where he remained until 1952 when, he was elected to the United States House.
He won the seat vacated by John F. Kennedy on Kennedy's election to the Senate. It was also the seat once held by James M. Curley, the Boston politician whose career was the basis of the Edwin O'Connor novel "The Last Hurrah."
 
 
Avoiding a Move To Washington
 Mr. O'Neill and his wife, Mildred, decided not to move their family to Washington when Mr. O'Neill was first elected, and they did not go back on this agreement until Mr. O'Neill became Speaker, a quarter century later.
Until then, Mr. O'Neill roomed with Representative Edward P. Boland, Democrat of Massachussetts, his closest friend. Their refrigerator was said to be stocked almost exclusively with beer.
In Washington, Mr. O'Neill became a protege of Representative John McCormack of Massachusetts, then the Democratic whip, who introduced him to the House power structure as part of the informal "board of education" meetings that Speaker Rayburn held after hours for Congressional leaders and friends. By his second term in the House, Mr. O'Neill had won a coveted seat on the Rules Committee.
 
War and Conscience
 Mr. O'Neill's opposition to the Vietnam War in 1967, when he was a leader of the Rules Committee, was a decision affected by the anti-war feelings of his own children (three boys and two girls) as well as among the intellectual communities at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his own district. His blue-collar constituents, who made up the bulk of his support, were overwhelmingly in favor of the American role in the war.
But Mr. O'Neill wrote in his autobiography, "Man of the House" (Random House, 1987), that he had come to the conclusion that the conflict was a civil war and that American involvement in it was morally wrong. When President Lyndon B. Johnson called him to the White House to explain his change of position, Mr. O'Neill recalled, he told the President, "In my heart and in my conscience I believe your policy is wrong." Johnson accepted his position, Mr. O'Neill said, when he found out that the Congressman had not changed it for political reasons.
But his opposition to the war did eventually reap some political dividends: he won the trust and support of younger House members who shared his position on Vietnam, and they became important allies as Mr. O'Neill rose in power.
In 1971, having supported Hale Boggs of Louisiana as majority leader, Mr. O'Neill was selected by Mr. Boggs to be majority whip, an appointive post. After Mr. Boggs died in a plane crash in Alaska in 1972, Mr. O'Neill was elected majority leader.
Mr. O'Neill, as the whip under Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma, was the Democrats' strong man; he did the difficult things. He was instrumental in bringing changes that stripped the committee chairmen of their autocratic power, and he was the Democratic leader who pushed hardest for the investigation and impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon, who resigned before a vote on impeachment was held.
 
At 64, Speaker, by Acclamation
 Mr. O'Neill was elected Speaker by acclamation in December 1976, when he was 64, and took office the next month. "The wonder of it is that such a decent, compassionate man could rise to the top of a place like this," said Representative Benjamin S. Rosenthal, Democrat of Queens.
But Mr. O'Neill was not without lapses of judgment.He was among many House members who accepted favors from Tongsun Park, the South Korean lobbyist and intelligence agent. In 1973 and '74, Mr. O'Neill permitted Mr. Park to sponsor two lavish birthday parties in his honor, thereby bolstering Mr. Park's prestige.
Similarly, Some questioned Mr. O'Neill's judgment when he intervened in an application for Federal money made by James P. Wilmot, who had been chairman of the Democratic Party's Finance Committee.
The Speaker telephoned the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Carla A. Hills, asking when there would be a decision on Mr. Wilmot's request for $2.2 million in annual rent subsidies for a housing project. Such inquiries tend to be viewed as requests for special consideration. In any event, Mr. Wilmot got his subsidies.
 
 
Remaining Neutral As a Kennedy Ran
 Although he had close ties to the Kennedy family, Mr. O'Neill remained neutral in the party's Presidential nomination fight between Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and President Carter in 1980. He played a role behind the scenes at the Democratic National Convention, however, negotiating an agreement that led to Mr. Kennedy's reluctant endorsement of the President.
Until his retirement, the O'Neills maintained their home in Cambridge, enabling the Speaker to keep in touch with the city's intellectual community as well as its neighborhoods. A Saturday morning ritual when Mr. O'Neill was in Cambridge consisted of stops at the Chinese laundry, the Italian food store and the Star Market in Porter Square.
In retirement, Mr. O'Neill divided his time between a house in Harwichport on Cape Cod and an apartment in Washington and spent some holidays at a condominium in Florida.
The Speaker's oldest son and namesake, Thomas P. O'Neill 3d, a former lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, is in public relations. Another son, Christopher, is a Washington lawyer, and a third, Michael, is in business in Cambridge. One daughter, Susan, has her own business in Washington, and another, Rosemary, is a political officer for the State Department.
After suffering colon cancer, which led to a colostomy, Mr. O'Neill made public service advertisements in which he joined athletes and movie stars in talking candidly about having cancer.
Unlike some politicians who amassed a fortune, Mr. O'Neill retired from the Speakership in relatively modest circumstances. His book, "Man of the House," however, written with William Novak, became a best seller that made him financially secure. Mr. O'Neill also made commercials for a credit card company and a motel chain.
Mr. O'Neill's book was a treasure trove of stories, including some about his political campaign for the Cambridge City Council while he was a senior at Boston College. He finished ninth in a field of 60 candidates, of whom the top eight were elected.
The race taught him a lifelong lesson. He had not campaigned in his own neighborhood, which he had taken for granted and where he made a poor showing. In a post-mortem on the campaign, Mr. O'Neill's father told him what he had learned in a lifetime of politics: "All politics is local."
In addition to his children, he is survived by his wife, Mildred, and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO PRESS RUSSIA TO USE AID TO ASSIST JOBLESS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
After a long internal debate on Russian policy, President Clinton plans to go to Moscow next week urging continued tough economic reforms, officials said today.
But they added that he will also offer some new ideas about how Western aid can be used to retrain Russian workers and cushion those left unemployed by economic change. 
 Administration officials said they are still thrashing out what sort of programs to propose, as well as whether Washington should lead by example and add more money to the aid pot.
But at a White House lunch today with newspaper columnists, Mr. Clinton left little doubt about where he stood on whether the strong showing by ultranationalists in last month's elections meant the West should urge a slower pace of reform. He said he would tell President Boris N. Yeltsin that Russia needs more reform -- not less -- and more Western help to reduce the political fallout.
 
Thoughts for a Bumper Sticker
 "I am going to Russia to reaffirm the support of the United States, both for democracy and for reform," said Mr. Clinton, who spoke to the journalists after a two-hour meeting with his top advisers. "We were thinking of a slogan today. We were trying to think of what our bumper sticker would be about. Because in reaction to the last election there, there were some people who were questioning whether, well, has reform gone too fast or not fast enough? Or whatever.
"I think our slogan would be, there needs to be more reform and more social service support," he added, "more attempts to build a safety net to deal with the consequences of reform, but not an attempt to slow down the reform effort. More reform, more support."
At the lunch, three days before he embarks on his first European mission, a 10-day journey, Mr. Clinton spoke in detail not only about Russian aid but also about the future of the Atlantic alliance and relations with Eastern Europe.
 
Issue of NATO Expansion
 Mr. Clinton devoted his opening statement to an attempt to assure Eastern Europe of continued support, despite Washington's opposition to immediate NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. He defended Washington's plan for only limited military partnerships between those countries and NATO. And he hinted that Washington was acting at least in part in response to an appeal by Mr. Yeltsin not to isolate Russia with an expanded Western alliance.
"The signal that Yeltsin sent me is, he did not want to feel that Russia was being isolated, was being sort of moved back into a potential enemy status," Mr. Clinton said.
The President said NATO was "reaching out" in a limited way to Eastern European countries because "we don't want them to feel threatened by an eastward pull anymore, but neither do we want to prejudge the future intentions and policies of Russia and other countries in the newly independent states, and especially Ukraine."
He said he believed that Russia and the other former Soviet republics appreciated this cautious approach because they do not want to be condemned to the status of enemies.
 
Integration Into Europe
 "It recognizes that they should be given the opportunity to develop a new sense of their national purpose that is not aggressive and permits them to be a part of an integrated European political economic and strategic system," Mr. Clinton said. "I think strategically that is very important. How do these options that are before us affect Ukraine? How do they affect Kazakhstan? They matter too, and they don't want to be pushed back into some pattern that reflects what was in their past, but may not be what they wish for their future."
Mr. Clinton said he would also use his talks with Western European allies at NATO summit talks to press them to open up their markets more to Eastern European exporters, whose industries are withering for lack of customers right next door.
Since militant nationalists and Communists made a surprisingly strong showing in last month's elections, Administration officials have been reconsidering their approach to Russian aid, with some seeming to hint that maybe the West should ease up on its demands for economic reform.
 
More Harsh Medicine
 In recent days, though, economic experts, particularly Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, have argued that what Russia needs now is to intensify its reform efforts. But, they add, that reform must be better cushioned -- to avoid the sort of political reaction seen in the elections -- by better helping pensioners and Government workers.
In a speech Monday to economists in Boston, Lawrence Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, alluded to this evolving strategy.
He said it would be "a grave mistake, and not one that anyone in the United States Government intends to make," to think there was some sort of "third way" for dealing with Russian aid -- a way that would make for painless reforms.
Mr. Summers said "there is no viable alternative to the hard work of economic stabilization." He added, though, that while encouraging that hard work, the United States and the West had to insure that their aid dealt "with the dislocations that are inevitably associated with reforms."
 
Talks With Wealthy Allies
 But how will the Administration go about this? In part, Mr. Clinton will offer some new ideas still being thrashed out; in part he will want to hear from Mr. Yeltsin; in part the President and Treasury officials plan intensive discussions with other members of the Group of Seven industrial nations on whether they should give new directives, and possibly new money, to the international institutions working with Russia.
"The first thing to do is actually get the money flowing again," said Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard University economist, who is advising the Russian Government. "The fact is that, of the $28 billion promised last year by the Group of Seven countries, only about $3 billion of real program support has been delivered. We have to reinvigorate the whole aid process, and begin with a discussion with the Russian Government about how they feel the money should be targeted."
For example, Mr. Sachs said, in order to reduce the deficit, Russia needs to close down many of its inefficient coal mines. One approach would be to offer severance payments and money for relocation or even job retraining, and to pay for it either with aid from the West earmarked for the miners or by rewriting the Russian budget to address the workers' needs and then financing the budget with direct foreign aid.
"To do this without creating a social crisis requires a major job of coordinating, to pull all the pieces together so everyone has an interest in going forward," Mr. Sachs said. "I would compare it to something like the job that Lee Iaccoca did with Chrysler when it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Someone has to coordinate the creditors, the industrialists, the unions, the board of directors -- which in Russia is the Parliament. That is what has been missing.
"That is our role," he added. "The I.M.F. is not Lee Iaccoca."

HEADLINE: IN MESSAGE, CUOMO ECHOES G.O.P. IDEAS

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Sounding election-year themes for a state recovering from a lingering recession, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed today an array of incentives to encourage job growth, including cutting taxes on real-estate developers, corporations and hotels.
In his 12th State of the State Message, Mr. Cuomo made three long-standing Republican themes -- improving the state's business climate, fighting crime and reforming welfare -- the centerpieces of his legislative blueprint for 1994, a year in which he and all 211 members of the state Legislature are up for re-election. Mr. Cuomo has said he will announce by the end of the week whether he will seek a fourth term, and he used his speech today to systematically shore up each of his most distinct political vulnerabilities. [News analysis, page B6.]
 
Allies and Skeptics Switch
 In a political role reversal, Mr. Cuomo's tax-cutting and welfare proposals got a frosty reception from his fellow Democrats who control the Assembly, particularly the Speaker, Saul Weprin, while receiving support from his usual nemesis, the Republican-controlled Senate. Today, Senate Republican leaders praised Mr. Cuomo's speech for embracing ideas they have proposed, even as they chided him for not going far enough. 
 Though Mr. Cuomo offered relatively detailed information about his tax-cutting and anti-crime proposals, his plan to encourage more welfare recipents to work is more long term and is not fully developed.
Departing from the dire economic forecasts of recent State of the State speeches, Mr. Cuomo said today that the improving economy had provided enough tax revenue to justify phasing out or reducing several taxes, many of which had been established over the past four years to plug budget gaps.
Though details about the tax cuts remain unclear, aides to Mr. Cuomo said they could cost the state $500 million or more when fully carried out. However, because some cuts would be phased in, their greatest impact would be after the elections. And in the long run, the aides said, the cuts could lead to increased tax revenues by encouraging business expansion.
As an inducement to development, Mr. Cuomo proposed exempting commercial construction and renovation on property worth more than $1 million that is started before 1996 from the state's real estate gains tax. The 10 percent tax is charged on profits from the sale of commercial property. He also proposed phasing out the state's 5 percent portion of the tax on hotel rooms costing over $100 a night, possibly by the end of 1995.
A third cut proposed by Mr. Cuomo, in the corporate surcharge, would simply reduce a tax that the state was scheduled to eliminate last year but couldn't because of a looming gap in the budget. Mr. Cuomo is considering cutting the tax, which is tacked onto a variety of other state corporate taxes, from 15 to 12.5 percent.
"Here's the message," Mr. Cuomo said. "New York State believes in business; we want the jobs you produce, we want you to do well. And if you're prepared to create jobs for our people, we'll do everything we can to make it worth your while. We need you. We want you."
In his notably cool reaction, Mr. Weprin said the Assembly Democrats are concerned that business tax cuts could lead to a reduction in social services. "The Assembly will not abandon people who need help," Mr. Weprin, a Queens Democrat, said.
While praising many of Mr. Cuomo's proposals, Republican legislative leaders questioned his sincerity, derisively describing his speech as a death-row conversion to conservatism by a liberal Democrat fearful of voters' wrath.
"After 11 years, the Governor has finally embraced much of the Senate Republican agenda to combat crime, revitalize our economy and restore the pride and productivenss that earned New York its reputation as the Empire State," said the Senate majority leader Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican. "The failed policies of the past are now clear to everyone."
 
Change in Welfare Offices
 Mr. Cuomo, hammering at the theme that work can solve many social ills, said he will seek to increase job training and counseling for welfare recipients. And he said he would ask his Commissioner of Social Services to restructure local welfare offices so that they provide job counseling to welfare applicants before approving them for welfare grants.
"Jobs should come first, not welfare," Mr. Cuomo said. "Welfare should be only a last resort."
Mr. Cuomo also proposed a pilot program that would increase welfare grants for parents who keep their children in school and reduce grants to parents whose children drop out. And he called for increasing programs to detect welfare fraud, including expanding a program that requires the fingerprinting of state welfare recipients, most of whom are single males. Currently, the program is being tried in Rockland and Onondaga counties.
In a proposal designed to help the working poor, Mr. Cuomo called for a state income tax credit for an estimated 820,000 low-income families. By 1995, the credit would reduce state taxes to a family with two children and an annual income of $26,000 or less by a maximum of about $300.
At the outset of the 45-minute speech, Mr. Cuomo said crime should be the lawmakers' first priority. He said he will seek legislation mandating life sentences without parole for three-time violent offenders, longer sentences for most violent crimes and "sharp" limitations on parole for sexual offenders. He said he will include $10 million for prison construction in his budget, which he will introduce on Jan. 18.
Mr. Cuomo also proposed several gun-control initiatives, including banning assault weapons, creating special task forces to prosecute gun and drug traffickers and raising the legal age for purchasing a gun from 16 to 18. Following the speech, Mr. Cuomo met with legislative leaders to discuss common ground on crime proposals, particularly a ban on assault weapons, but nothing conclusive resulted from the talks, legislative aides said.
Though Republicans said they support Mr. Cuomo's proposal for limiting parole, they said no anti-crime package can be complete without the death sentence. Mr. Cuomo has vetoed death sentence bills for 11 consecutive years. He did not discuss the death penalty in this year's speech.
Though he usually bridles when called a tax-and-spend liberal, Mr. Cuomo today poked fun at his and the Legislature's taxing proclivities. Referring to a $25 fee that businesses have to pay so they can give their employees their wages in checks, Mr. Cuomo said, "Even for us, that was obnoxious."

HEADLINE: Bentsen Foresees Rate Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
After a year of touting lower interest rates as an Administration accomplishment that has stimulated the economy, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen predicted today that short-term rates would rise modestly.
Mr. Bentsen refused to say how soon he expected an increase. And he would not say whether he expected the Federal Reserve to move actively to raise them or simply allow the market to push them up, as it has already begun to do. 
 Mr. Bentsen also made an unusually blunt, but unsuccessful, effort to halt the Japanese yen's steady slide against the dollar, which has improved the competitiveness of Japanese exporters at the expense of their American rivals. In a speech at the Brookings Institution here today, the Treasury Secretary called for "exchange rates that will reflect the underlying cost competitiveness of Japan and its trading partners."
 
Reaction to Japanese Economy?
 The yen climbed briefly after his remarks but then resumed its slide. Traders attributed the decline to a lack of investor confidence in Japan's weak economy. [Page D16.]
Most economists have attributed improvement in the United States economy in considerable measure to the current low interest rates, particularly long-term rates. Mr. Bentsen repeated in his Brookings speech his contention that the Administration deserved the credit for the low rates because it had tried to bring down the budget deficit.
Short-term rates have already risen slightly in the last few weeks. The emerging consensus of private economists has been that a further slight increase is likely soon, but would do little damage to the economy.
Asked this morning before his speech whether there was any need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates during the first quarter, Mr. Bentsen responded, "I must say that in our projections we assume that there would be a modest increase in short-term rates, but I must say on the other side of it that inflation has been even better contained than anticipated."
A minute later, he sought to amend his remarks to make clear that the increase might not come in the first quarter. "I said, 'we anticipated a modest increase in short-term rates over a period of time' -- we did not get definitive, I'm not that good on my crystal ball," Mr. Bentsen said.
Officials at the Federal Reserve declined to comment.
 
Stating a Perceived Reality
 The Treasury Secretary was acknowledging the likelihood of higher rates -- which many economists believe to be the natural accompaniment to strong economic growth -- but not advocating them. Nonetheless, he allowed for the first time the possibility that short-term rates would rise this quarter.
On Dec. 19, Mr. Bentsen said that the Administration foresaw a modest increase in short-term rates, but not until after the first quarter of 1994, His remarks were not widely reported. Four days earlier, President Clinton had said "it would be inappropriate" for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
When Mr. Bentsen predicted last Thursday that the United States economy would grow at a steady and sustainable rate in 1994, he said, "This should allow interest rates to remain relatively low and reduce further the rate of unemployment."
A Treasury Department official who insisted on anonymity said that the Administration was still discouraging the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. But the department believes that some increase is inevitable anyway.
The Treasury Department has very little direct influence over interest rates. The Federal Reserve guides rates by buying and selling Government securities.
 
Rises Seen in Other Forecasts
 The latest Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, a survey of economists' predictions, estimated that the yield on three-month Treasury bills would edge up to 3.3 percent in the first quarter from 3.15 percent in the previous quarter. The President's Council of Economic Advisers forecast in August that short-term interest rates would average 3.6 percent in 1994, up from 3.1 percent in 1993.
The Treasury Department aide said late this afternoon that Mr. Bentsen's predictions were based on internal department forecasts of interest rates and that the Secretary was anticipating further increases in addition to the slight upward creep of short-term rates in recent weeks.
Mr. Bentsen spoke at Brookings as part of the the Administration's effort to claim much of the credit for economic growth.
"The Administration doesn't believe that it, by itself, was able to bring it all off, but the Administration has certainly had a major influence," he said.

HEADLINE: A.M.A. Found to Donate More to Foes of Its Views

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
The political arm of the American Medical Association gives more money, on average, to Congressional candidates who oppose the doctors' positions on important public health issues than to those who support such positions, a new report says.
The report, published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, concludes that the political action committee affiliated with the association "contributed more frequently and more heavily" to conservative lawmakers, despite the fact that they often opposed the association's positions on issues like tobacco exports and Federal restrictions on abortion counseling. 
 In an interview today, Dr. Steven S. Sharfstein, an author of the report, said the committee, known as Ampac, "inadvertently undermines the public health agenda of the A.M.A." In giving money to members of Congress, Dr. Sharfstein said, "Ampac emphasizes the economic concerns of physicians more than the excellent public health stands of the A.M.A. itself."
 
Comparison of Contributions
 From 1989 to 1992, the study said, the political arm of the association contributed an average of $13,270 to members of the House of Representatives who opposed the association on three major votes, while "members who sided with the A.M.A. on all three votes received an average contribution of $8,800."
The report was written by Dr. Sharfstein and his son, Joshua M. Sharfstein. Dr. Sharfstein is president of a psychiatric hospital in Baltimore, the Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, and is secretary of the American Psychiatric Association. He has been a member of the medical association for 10 years, but has not given money to Ampac. Joshua Sharfstein, who is a student at Harvard Medical School and has done political work for several Congressional candidates, said he and his father were "progressive Democrats."
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the association, said that while the findings were interesting, "no credible conclusions" could be drawn because the study was too narrowly focused and did not consider the full range of the association's lobbying and public affairs activities.
Brenda Laukaitis Craine, a spokeswoman for the association, refused to say how Ampac decided on campaign contributions. "It's complicated," she said. "The process involves all state medical societies. The Ampac board has the final say. The board of the A.M.A. is not directly involved."
In an interview, Joshua Sharfstein said: "Ampac's campaign contributions go preferentially to members of Congress who are more conservative, as measured by the ratings of their voting records by the American Conservative Union. Those conservative members are significantly more likely to oppose the A.M.A.'s positions on public health issues."
Joshua Sharfstein said Ampac spread its money broadly, typically donating to more than 80 percent of House members seeking re-election.
The study focused on money given in the campaigns of 1989-90 and 1991-92. It examined votes on three issues: handgun control, use of Federal money to promote foreign sales of tobacco products and a Federal rule banning abortion counseling at family planning clinics that got Federal money.
Campaign contributions by the health care industry have increased sharply, with the likelihood that Congress will pass legislation to revamp the nation's health care system.

HEADLINE: Whitman Says Tax Reduction Will Hurt

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J., Jan. 5

 BODY:
Governor-elect Christine Todd Whitman began talking tonight for the first time about the pain as well as the promise of her campaign pledge to cut taxes and state government.
In the third of her appearances with voter groups the Governor-elect answered questions and took suggestions for an hour on ways to cut income taxes by nearly a third over three years. 
 Tonight she began to note that making good her tax-cut pledge will have its costs. In earlier appearances she had more to say about auditing state performance, freeing local governments and supporting innovation than about the nuts and bolts of cutting spending. Asked when she would be specific, she gave as an answer her inauguration date, Jan. 18, and the date of her first budget message, March 15.
"Well, there is always going to be pain," she said in response to a question from Maggie Benoit, 16, a high school junior from Hillsboro, N.J., about the prospect of state financing cuts forcing local taxes higher. "The state is going to have to impose some discipline on itself, and local government is going to have to do that, too."
Despite this muted warning, Mrs. Whitman maintained the posture of student of government more than governor that she had established in the two earlier sessions. A fourth program will be held in New York City at the studios of WABC radio and will be broadcast as a one-hour call-in session on "The Bob Grant Show" on Thursday after she visits Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City.
 
Criticized During Campaign
 During the campaign, her Democratic opponent, Gov. Jim Florio, frequently criticized Mrs. Whitman for a lack of specifics in her broad tax-cutting program, but each time Mrs. Whitman maintained that she would listen to the people before deciding where the cuts would be made.
A 10 percent cut in the state income tax for each of three years would cost the state about $1.4 billion out of its nearly $16 billion budget. In addition, she has pledged to limit the increase in the state budget to less than the inflation rate.
Throughout the campaign and during the early weeks of her transition, however, Mrs. Whitman refrained from preparing the public for the logic of those numbers. Nearly 10 percent taken out of a budget burdened with a built-in deficit that Mrs. Whitman herself has estimated at $1 billion will require large-scale reordering of state spending, Republican legislators have been warning privately.
Tonight's session was broadcast on Rutgers University's Wednesday night "Caucus: New Jersey" television program.
"Right now we are in a learning process, trying to put the budget together," Mrs. Whitman said. "There are not always going to be popular decisions."
Mrs. Whitman offered her prediction of fiscal stringency early in the one-hour show, but then she showed herself willing to embrace a wide range of popular but budget-draining programs that members of the audience mentioned for her protection.
For example, Mrs. Whitman lamented the lack of adequate financing for the state's community colleges, suggested that students at the state college system be charged on the basis of their ability to pay, promised to maintain the state's Lyme disease prevention program and implicitly called for more money for the state's social programs as a deterrent to crime.
 
Endorses Clinic Program
 Soon afterward, she endorsed a Federal-state program of neighborhood clinics to reduce the use of expensive emergency room services and seemed to urge the state to create a new program:
"Not only do we want to build on that kind of health care, we want to take it further, taking doctors to the people where they work," she said.
Mrs. Whitman made two other ideas more specific: she said she would endorse a law to allow communities to exempt themselves from state-mandated services, like providing 911 emergency telephone service, for which no state funds are appropriated. And she called on the Legislature to attach both a price tag and a source of funds for each spending proposal that it passes.
Mrs. Whitman won general praise from an audience that included high school students, educators, union leaders and a contingent from the Ross Perot grass-roots group, United We Stand, whose spokeswoman, Beverly Kidder, attempted to elicit the Governor-elect's public support for initiative, which allows residents to place measures on the ballot through petition drives, and referendum, which allows citizens to directly vote in laws.
Mrs. Whitman said tonight that she supported the idea, but with some restrictions -- that the ballot questions be limited to three, that full financial disclosures be required to show who is behind the initiatives and that no issue that was defeated could be brought back the next year.

HEADLINE: NATO CLEARS PLAN FOR TASK FORCES

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
NATO officials removed the final barriers today to an American-backed proposal that would change the military alliance's command structure to make it easier for NATO and former Warsaw Pact troops to combine forces to defuse crises both inside and outside Europe.
The plan calls for establishing multinational task forces of NATO and non-NATO troops that would conduct joint military exercises and be ready to rush into action on peacekeeping or relief missions. 
 In interviews today, NATO officials said France had abandoned its last objections to the plan, paving the way for President Clinton and other NATO leaders to approve it when they meet in Brussels early next week.
The Clinton Administration has supported the plan because it furthers its goal of shifting some of the alliance's defense burden to Europe. Also, it will give European nations more flexibility and resources to police their own backyard.
 
Europe Could Act Along
 Under the plan, European nations in NATO could use European troops and NATO resources, like radar and intelligence reports, to try to defuse conflicts in the region while American troops remained out of the mission.
An American official at NATO headquarters said the plan "provides a vehicle that enhances burden sharing by allowing the European members of the alliance to make use of existing NATO command structures and assets to conduct operations in which the United States would not choose to be involved."
The Clinton Administration supports the plan because it discourages the Europeans from setting up a separate multinational force outside the NATO structure -- an idea that made Washington uneasy because it would reduce American influence in Europe. The Bush Administration opposed the plan, believing that it would reduce the American role in NATO.
NATO officials said today that the new strucutre would create "combined joint task forces" involving troops from different branches of the armed services and from different countries. For example, a joint task force might inlclude six Western European NATO members along with Poland and Hungary -- and some officials said that Russia might also be able to take part.
NATO officials said that if the proposal is approved at the summit meeting next week, alliance planners will begin drawing up its details.
 
Warsaw Pact May Join
 American and NATO officials see these forces as a way for former Warsaw Pact nations to cooperate more closely with NATO as part of the Partnership for Peace plan that President Clinton has pushed to tie Eastern European nations closer to NATO. President Lech Walesa of Poland and other Eastern European leaders have urged instead that NATO members grant them immediate membership in the alliance.
In many ways, the plan caps off efforts begun by the Bush Administration two years ago to develop ways to make NATO more responsive to crises.
"The plan institutionalizes a more flexible way of employing allied forces," one official said, adding that the alliance's slow, clumsy response in Bosnia was due in part to NATO's inflexible structure.
Even though some NATO countries might not take part in a specific task force action, the North Atlantic Council, with 16 member countries, would have to approve such an action before it was carried out.
"It will mean less dependence on U.S. involvement all the time, but will do so without diminishing the core functions of the alliance in maintaining the collective defense of its members," one Pentagon official said.
The plan helps satisfy a desire among France and other European nations for Europe to establish a more independent defense identity.
Nonetheless, French officials were at first uncomfortable with the plan because they were eager to set up a large separate military force under the command of the Western European Union. France, Germany and Belgium have already set up a small Eurocorps, based in Strasbourg.
But Western officials said France was forced to abandon its vision of a much larger force because of the tremendous cost at a time it is weighed down by recession and budget deficits.

HEADLINE: Mayors in Florida Demand More State Help on Crime

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 5

 BODY:
Alarmed at what they described as the "explosive growth" of violent crime throughout Florida and the damage to the state's reputation, mayors and police chiefs from six of Florida's seven largest cities met here today for a "safe city summit" and called on the state government to mete out harsher punishment to habitual criminals.
"We have reached a point of exhaustion," said Mayor Ed Austin of Jacksonville, the host of the one-day conference that was also attended by officials from Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Orlando, St. Petersburg and Tampa. 
 Speaking for the group, Mr. Austin demanded that the state increase its prison capacity by at least 50 percent. Failure to do so, he said, would mean that "we are aiding and abetting criminals."
 
Plan for Legislature
 The meeting came after a recent series of widely publicized crimes, especially against visitors, that have given Florida an image of danger and lawlessness. In little more than a year, the state has been shaken by sniper attacks on motorists in Jacksonville, the racially motivated burning of a black tourist outside Tampa and the killings of 10 foreign tourists in locations as far apart as South Florida and the Panhandle.
At the end of today's session, the officials drew up a joint resolution to take to the Legislature. It said construction of 25,000 new prison beds would prevent criminals from being released early to ease prison crowding, which has become a severe problem here. It said the cost would be a maximum of $375 million but did not address where the money was to come from. Mayor Austin suggested shifting monies in the existing budget and said taxpayers would gladly pay extra if they knew the money was going to build prisons.
The resolution also called for legislation to "grant a broader range of sentencing discretion" to juvenile-court judges and to eliminate all sentencing guidelines for adult offenses, with the result that sentences over all would be tougher.
"We can't be bluffing," said Mr. Austin, a former prosecutor. "We are now bluffing. We have got to have enough prison and juvenile beds to return integrity to the criminal justice system" and convince habitual offenders that they will indeed be punished for crimes they commit.
 
Promise of Lobbying
 The Legislature met in November for a special session that was devoted in large part to the crime problem, especially among juveniles, but lawmakers made little headway in their discussions of constitutionality, cost and efficiency. The Legislature's regular session is scheduled to begin next month, with many of the same issues expected to dominate the agenda.
"We're personally going to attend the session of the Legislature" to push the package agreed upon today, Mayor Steve Clark of Miami said. The mayors will be able to exert more influence on lawmakers and hold them accountable to voters, Mr. Clark said, because they are, for the first time, united on how to fight crime.
Although mayors in Florida meet periodically to discuss common problems, the conference today was the first time officials of largest cities have gathered solely to discuss crime. Their joint initiative is also unusual by national standards, even though city officials in states as far afield as Massachusetts and California have made tentative efforts to speak collectively to their state legislatures.
Though national crime statistics for 1993 are not yet available, Florida has in recent years had the highest crime rate of the 50 states. In addition, according to 1992 statistics of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Dade County, which includes Miami, had the highest crime rate among all metropolitan areas nationwide of more than 500,000 people, with a total of 12,336 serious crimes per 100,000 residents, more than twice the national average.
Two other counties immediately north of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, also rank in the top 10 of serious crimes in urban areas. New York City is 10th, with a crime rate of 8,491 serious crimes per 100,000 people.
 
'Bleeding to Death'
 "When you have a state that leads the country in crime rates, you're hemorrhaging," Mayor David Fischer of St. Petersburg said in explaining the stimulus for today's meeting. "When you're bleeding to death, you have to put a tourniquet on it, and that's what we're doing today."
The mayors openly acknowledged that another reason for their meeting was the need to fight the public relations disaster their state has suffered as a result of its high crime rate. Both in this country and abroad, magazine, television and newspaper reports have portrayed Florida as "a state of fear," even though the number of visitors slightly increased in 1993.
"We're in the business of image management for our cities and our state," said Mayor Glenda Hood of Orlando, which brags that it is the world's most popular tourist destination. "There's a perception problem that's become reality."
Mayor Austin of Jacksonville added that Florida's economic well-being depended on its ability to be seen as "a good place to come to and visit and trade with." And, he added, "you can't do that if you are a crime center."

Fighting Crime in California
 SACRAMENTO, Calif. Jan. 5 (AP) -- In his annual address to a joint session of the State Legislature, Gov. Pete Wilson today proposed several anti-crime measures, including a $2 billion bond issue to build six new state prisons.
Mr. Wilson, a Republican, also requested mandatory life sentences for rapists, child molesters, arsonists and felons caught with a gun. In addition, he proposed doubling prison terms for two-time felons and putting three-time felons behind bars for life.

HEADLINE: Admiral to Visit Hanoi, as Relations Improve

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
In another sign of improving ties between Hanoi and Washington, Adm. Charles R. Larson, commander of United States forces in the Pacific, will visit Hanoi this month, the highest-ranking American military officer on active duty to go to Vietnam since the war in Southeast Asia ended in 1975.
Admiral Larson, a four-star officer based in Hawaii, is to go to Vietnam on Jan. 16 for three days to review the work of American and Vietnamese specialists investigating the fate of missing Americans. Admiral Larson is also expected to meet with high-ranking officials in the Foreign Ministry. 
 The Administration is moving toward easing the trade embargo against Hanoi, and has conditioned a relaxation of the embargo on resolving the fate of more than 2,000 servicemen who did not return from the Vietnam War.
An upbeat assessment from a senior commander like Admiral Larson that Vietnam is cooperating fully would provide the Administration with a defense against complaints that could come from veterans' groups that oppose closer ties to Hanoi.
As a candidate, Bill Clinton promised that he would not lift the embargo until Hanoi made a "full accounting" of missing Americans. But Mr. Clinton eased the sanctions slightly last September when he allowed American companies to bid for projects in Vietnam financed by international lending institutions.
The admiral's visit will come a month after Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. Mr. Lord argued in favor of immediate action to ease the embargo to reward Hanoi for its help in resolving the M.I.A. issue.
Admiral Larson, a former submarine captain who served as President Richard M. Nixon's naval aide during the Vietnam War, will meet with American civilian and military investigators in Hanoi and with specialists excavating crash sites and pouring over archives in various parts of the country.
His visit coincides with the largest field inquiry the United States and Vietnam have conducted together since Washington began sending investigators to Vietnam in 1988. The American team of 84 specialists, including archeologists and linguists, intends to investigate as many as 89 cases and excavate as many as 13 sites, the Pentagon said in a statement.
There are 2,239 Americans unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. Of those, 1,648 were lost in Vietnam.

On West 145th Street, opposite an uneven commercial row of boarded-up stores, a gas station and a thriving burger shop, four sand-colored buildings stand waiting for new occupants. Their bricks are scrubbed clean, six stories of brand-new windows sparkle underneath sculpted moldings and green marble glows around the lobby entrances.
The buildings, vacant for years, are at the heart of Bradhurst, a 40-square-block neighborhood in north Harlem. The neighborhood became a symbol of the decay that has blighted Harlem for decades, with some areas looking as if they were reduced to rubble by shelling. 
 But the rehabilitated buildings are signs of a new Bradhurst. Families will be moving into the 236 apartments this month, completing the first phase of the largest neighborhood redevelopment project in the city's history. The plan calls for more than 2,200 units of mixed-income housing, a community center and a new commercial base -- and, eventually, a use for every vacant building and lot in the area.
For decades much of the bustle and vitality that made Harlem a center of black America was lost, as people left and buildings fell apart, but it is slowly returning with a burst of construction in Bradhurst and elsewhere.
 
Making Comebacks
 "In 26 years of working here, this is the first time I feel we have gotten a little bit ahead of the deterioration," said Wyatt Tee Walker, pastor of Canaan Baptist Church, which has almost 600 units of housing built or under construction in Harlem.
Many projects like Bradhurst have been on the drawing boards for years, taking shape in the Koch administration but becoming reality under Mayor David N. Dinkins. Neighborhoods in the South Bronx, East Brooklyn and southern Queens, as well as Harlem, have been revitalized with new housing and new residents, families bringing life to long-silent streets.
But there is uncertainty about the future of such projects under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who comes to office facing a budget gap of more than $2 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
"Koch and his people were not unsupportive," said Canon Frederick B. Williams, chairman of the board of Harlem Churches for Community Improvement. "They were supportive, just at a minimal level. They said, 'Here's a little crumb.' David Dinkins came in and said, 'I know you can serve a banquet.'
"Now, if I'm to continue the metaphor, we would like for the new Mayor to let us serve coffee and dessert."
 
Vacant City-Owned Buildings
 More than 6,000 units of housing have been completed in Harlem since 1989 or are under construction, most of them rehabilitated tenements or walk-ups. In Harlem, as in many of the other neighborhoods, the revitalization has extended to a web of community organizations, which have come together and strengthened in their pursuit of a reborn community.
The Bradhurst plan, for instance, is being overseen by the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, a group of 11 community organizations representing religious, development, real estate and business interests.
Harlem has the highest concentration of vacant city-owned buildings in the city, buildings whose owners defaulted on taxes after the migration out of Harlem in the 1960's and 70's. About 3,000 units in central Harlem are scheduled for development. Another 2,800 units in city-owned vacant buildings are not yet committed for rehabilitation. And those numbers do not take into account the hundreds of privately owned vacant or substandard buildings or the vacant lots, which comprise 12 percent of the land in central Harlem. The potential for growth is high, but so is its cost.
With the new wave of building, Harlem began to chip away at the trends it has been mired in since the 1970's, the declining population and the shrinking housing stock. One by one, and even in large chunks, abandoned buildings are being rehabilitated and filled with families, most of them poor but more and more working and earning moderate incomes.
 
Rebirth in the 80's
 Harlem's rebirth began in the last years of the Koch administration, when the Department of Housing Preservation and Development initiated a 10-year, $5.1 billion capital plan for revitalizing neighborhoods in 1986. By the late 1980's, construction began on what were perhaps the first housing units created with city money in Harlem in a generation.
Mayor Dinkins and his administration accelerated the housing boom, spending more than $200 million in central Harlem over four years, and brought more community groups into the process. Under Mr. Dinkins and his Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner, Felice L. Michetti, the city began a variety of new programs citywide that allowed community-based organizations to build more easily, either by developing projects themselves or by acting as community sponsor, with substantial say in the final product.
The city also opened the planning process, working with community organizations and the local community boards to develop zoning and development plans that they felt would help their neighborhoods.
"The efforts, particularly in a couple of areas, started back in the Borough President's office," when Mr. Dinkins held that position, said Bill Lynch, a former Deputy Mayor and campaign manager for Mayor Dinkins. "It is all part of what I would call a comprehensive effort to bring community development up there."
 
Extra Effort
 Bradhurst is the largest but by no means the only project being developed in Harlem. The Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce has finished the first phase of Strivers Center, named after the historic Striver's Row district, which is nearby. The mixed residential and commercial project will include a row of nightclubs, restaurants and a Jazz Hall of Fame. A Third World Trade Center, which would combine a hotel with offices for African and Caribbean countries, is being planned for 125th Street and Lenox Avenue.
But Bradhurst exemplifies the community effort that has gone into rebuilding Harlem. The Consortium and its executive director, Todd Jones, have tried to include the community in their planning, making sure that services are available for those who need them and that the buildings' designs are attractive and convenient. They fought for extra city money to install elevators, for instance, because they realized how difficult it was for a mother to climb up four or five floors with a few children and a load of groceries.
The first apartments are for low- and moderate-income families, as well as 16 studios for artists. Rents will range from $350 a month for a one-bedroom apartment for a low-income tenant or family to $675 for a three-bedroom apartment for a moderate-income family. The tenants will be chosen by city lottery, with 30 percent of the apartments reserved for Harlem residents.
They also used the project to bring jobs to the area. Most of the architects, engineers, contractors and their workers are black or Hispanic. Some are local untrained workers whose training the groups provided.
 
'Protect Investment'
 But the outlook for plans like Bradhurst is uncertain, at least according to Kathy Wylde, who served on one of Mr. Giuliani's housing transition panels. Although the future phases of the plan call for home-ownership opportunities and more private investment, the first phase alone cost the city more than $24 million. One estimated the ultimate cost to the city at $163 million. And with a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall, that type of city investment will be hard to come by.
"The city budget was going to be severely constrained no matter who was mayor, and there is every indication that the capital budget programs are likely to suffer," said Ms. Wylde, the president of the New York City Housing Partnership. "The kind of model that was used in Bradhurst is not going to be continued or replicated on any large scale."
Deborah Wright, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, said the new administration was considering its role in Harlem. "The Harlem community is important to the city," she said. "Obviously the city has made a huge commitment there. We will be looking at ways to do everything we can to protect that investment."
As a sort of insurance policy against severe budget cuts or indifference from City Hall, many Harlem leaders are looking to Washington, both to the Clinton Administration and to their most powerful political force, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem.
 
Urban Empowerment Zone
 Some community leaders are applying for the area to be designated an urban empowerment zone, under legislation that Congressman Rangel wrote and with his strong support. If Harlem is one of the 10 areas selected, it will receive $100 million over two years, offsetting a loss of city money and, they hope, forcing the city to continue its commitment to an area in the national spotlight.
"If you can keep people off welfare, working, off the streets and paying taxes, that's a hell of a lot better than abandoned buildings and people on welfare and in the streets," Mr. Rangel said. "That's what we've been able to do with our abandoned buildings. If Giuliani is nearly as intelligent as his supporters claim, he should move forward."
Not everyone involved in development in Harlem is despairing at the change in administration. Evelyn King, the founder of the United Black Street Front Association, said she had found little support under the Dinkins administration for creating low-cost co-ops or condominiums for working families, who do not qualify for many public projects but cannot afford market rents.
 
Community on the Move
 "People love this community and they have to leave because they cannot afford to live here," said Ms. King, one of Mr. Giuliani's few vocal supporters in Harlem and one of two black members of his transition council. "We need housing that working people can afford to live in."
But for many community leaders, the Dinkins administration was a known and supportive quantity. Until they learn about the Giuliani camp, they can only hope their own strength is sufficient.
"I am not optimistic concerning the political situation," said the Rev. William James, chairman of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation and of the Consortium. "But I am optimistic concerning the community itself and what it has come together to do. I don't think whoever was elected could stop that."

HEADLINE: Francis Ferguson, Insurer's Chairman In 80's, Dies at 72

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Francis Eugene Ferguson, retired chairman of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Phoenix. He was 72 and had homes in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Milwaukee.
He had had a long respiratory illness, the company said. 
 Mr. Ferguson was elected president and trustee of Northwestern Mutual in 1967 and named chief executive the following year. He became chairman in 1980 and served as both chairman and chief executive until 1983. He retired as chairman in 1985 and from the board in 1991.
Under his stewardship, Northwestern Mutual's assets more than doubled to more than $13 billion in 1983 from $5.7 billion in 1968. Most recently, the company posted assets of $35.7 billion.
"As C.E.O., he successfully led the company through the turbulent economy of the 1970's and early 1980's," said James D. Erickson, president and chief executive of Northwestern Mutual. "He also played a leadership role in the insurance industry as it coped with the effects of runaway inflation."
 
Civic Projects
 As a civic leader, Mr. Ferguson helped to invigorate the Wisconsin State Fair, bring the baseball Brewers to Milwaukee and revitalize downtown around Grand Avenue. He was a past campaign chairman for United Way, president of the Milwaukee Redevelopment Corporation and board chairman of the state fair.
He was born in Batavia, N.Y. In World War II, he served in the Army Air Forces, reaching the rank of captain. Piloting a B-17 bomber, he was shot down over Schweinfurt, Germany, and spent 19 months in a prisoner-of-war camp. After the war, he returned to Michigan State University and received a degree in agricultural economics in 1947.
He joined Northwestern Mutual in 1951 as an economic specialist in the mortgage-loan department.
Mr. Ferguson is survived by his wife of 48 years, Patricia Reddy Ferguson; two daughters, Susan Bonneau of Milwaukee and Penny Pratt of Hastings, Neb., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Outflanking G.O.P.

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 5

 BODY:
By calling for tax cuts, a crackdown on crime and a welfare program that emphasizes work, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, once the darling of liberal Democrats, sought today to outflank the Republicans who want to hang him this election year from the twin nooses of joblessness and crime.
Days before he may announce a bid for re-election, the Governor used his 12th State of the State Message to systematically shore up each of his most distinct political vulnerabilities. In each case, he anticipated the criticisms capable of damaging him most severely and developed proposals to undercut them. 
 It was a demonstration of the political art of boxing one's opponents. But the larger issue remains whether this year's maneuvering will dazzle voters enough to obscure the perceived shortcomings in an 11-year record.
"It will take more than one speech to move the public's perception," said Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Republican from Columbia County and a frequent critic of the Governor.
 
Prose Instead of Poetry
 Emblematic of Mr. Cuomo's approach today was his opening. Sensitive to the criticism that his leadership has been more poetry than substance, he stated from the start that this speech would be all prose (even if he could not resist quoting a master poet to make the point).
"This I think is not a time for sweet recitations," Mr. Cuomo said. "Shakespeare said it best: action is eloquence. And this is surely a time for action."
Then Mr. Cuomo moved quickly to combat the notion that he is soft on crime, a side-effect of his firm stance against the death penalty. He proposed toughening penalties for violent criminals, hiring more state troopers and placing strict controls on guns.
Mr. Cuomo's emphasis on anti-crime legislation has sent Republican state senators scurrying to reclaim an issue they traditionally have owned.
Shortly after the Governor finished speaking, members of the State Senate's Republican majority met behind closed doors to discuss Mr. Cuomo's proposal to ban assault weapons, a bill they killed last year. They emerged to say their discussion was inconclusive, but they clearly feel public pressure for action against the deadly weapons as well as political pressure to prevent Mr. Cuomo from claiming the issue as his own.
 
Anti-Welfare Symbolism
 To rebut Republican charges that Mr. Cuomo's New York is "the Cadillac of welfare states," the Governor said in his speech that the state should exhaust efforts to find jobs for welfare applicants before allowing them on the rolls. And in a proposal that carries strong anti-welfare symbolism, he called for expanding a pilot program that requires welfare recipients in two counties to be fingerprinted as a protection against fraud.
In New York, fingerprinting has been the most emotional issue in the welfare debate, even though it is not nearly as punitive as measures in other states. Assembly Democrats fought the pilot project fiercely when it was enacted two years ago, saying it seemed to equate welfare recipients with criminals. They labeled its Republican supporters as welfare bashers.
But in an interview last week Mr. Cuomo disagreed with that notion. "I do not have the same conceptual concerns that some others do that this is somehow demeaning," he said.
Perhaps most significantly today, Mr. Cuomo offered himself so effusively as a new friend of big business that the formal response of Daniel Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State, consisted of only one sentence: "Happy days are near again."
Rather than using his speech to honor an individual, as he did two years ago with the former hostage Terry Anderson, Mr. Cuomo paid tribute today to three New York companies -- Corning, Kodak and Carrier -- for recent technological innovations.
 
Reductions in Taxes
 Mr. Cuomo's historic weakness with the business community has been taxes. Although the Senate Republicans have approved every increase in taxes and fees enacted in the Cuomo years, the Republicans have scored political points over the years by blaming Mr. Cuomo for the state's forbidding tax environment.
The Governor tried to take that issue away today by proposing reductions in many of the taxes and fees that he and the Legislature have raised to fill the state's recession-era budget gaps. He called for cutting the corporate tax surcharge, phasing out the hotel tax, declaring a two-year moratorium on the real-property-gains tax and reducing a number of nuisance fees.
At one point in the speech, Mr. Cuomo seemed to acknowledge that the Senate Republicans have previously proposed many of the measures he endorsed today, particularly the cuts in business taxes and fees.
"No new taxes, no new business fees," he said, glancing impishly at the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino. "Read Ralph's lips."
 
Resolving Differences
 And Mr. Marino, like many of his members, said Mr. Cuomo sounded like a born-again Republican. "It seems he has resolved our differences concerning a candidate for governor in 1994," Mr. Marino joked. "I certainly would endorse the present governor for our own candidacy. It sounded like a speech that could have been written for me and any other Republican running for high office in this state. The problem is it took him 11 years to get the message."
In fact, many Capitol observers said, it is not just that the Governor has moved but that the Republicans have as well. They have dropped their insistence on major cuts in welfare spending and have abandoned calls for some of the most punitive measures against welfare recipients. For the first time, they are considering a ban on assault weapons.

HEADLINE: Fare Cards Make Debut In Subways

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
The subway token has mingled with coins on dresser tops and in the purses and pockets of New Yorkers for 40 years. But today it moves a bit closer to extinction as the Transit Authority begins to sell electronic fare cards in the first two stations of its sprawling subway system, the nation's largest.
The introduction of automatic fare collection, starting with the Whitehall Street station on the N and R lines and the Wall Street station on the 4 and 5 lines, both in lower Manhattan, brings New York City into the company of other major cities, from Washington to London, that have long used cards instead of coins or tokens. Officials say it will eventually lead to fundamental changes in the transit system, making fare purchases quicker and more convenient and paving the way for discounts, monthly passes and other fare incentives intended to lure more riders.
 
69 Stations by April
 Between now and April, 69 of the busiest stations in the system will activate the sophisticated new turnstiles equipped with fare card machines. The remaining 400 stations will start offering the cards in phases, but not until early 1995 because officials say they need a year to work out possible problems in the technology. 
 The 3,650 buses operated by the Transit Authority will also be outfitted with the card readers during that time, enabling riders to use the MetroCard, as the thin plastic card is called, on both subways and buses. The entire network should be in place by the end of 1997, when the token should finally become an urban relic.
"It's a new era for our customers," said Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the Transit Authority. "It opens up the possibility for fare structures that over time will help us increase our ridership, which is why we're in business."
The automatic fare collection system making its debut today has been studied, criticized, lobbied for and delayed for more than a decade. At a cost of nearly $700 million, it is one of the biggest undertakings in the 90-year history of the subway system and one on which officials are pinning lofty goals, from improving the environment by curbing car emissions to improving the economy by lifting the region's traffic burden.
 
$5 Increments
 Initially, the cards will be encoded in $5 increments, with amounts ranging from $5 to $80. Each time a passenger swipes the card through the electronic turnstile slot, a $1.25 fare will be deducted from the magnetic stripe and the machine will flash the amount left on the card. Once the value is depleted, the passenger will be able to re-use the card, buying more rides from a token clerk who will simply register a new dollar amount.
About half the stations in the subway system have been outfitted with the new turnstiles, which have both a slot for fare cards and a slot for tokens and are also designed to foil fare beaters. But upgrading the power supply and installing the electronics is a slow process.
Transit officials expect that only 8 percent of the riders who pass through the first 69 stations will buy the cards because most people will still need tokens for all the stations that do not yet accept fare cards. But financing is already approved for the switch to automated fare collection, and officials say the program's future doesn't hinge on how many riders participate at first.
Later this year, the M.T.A. plans to introduce the first of what it hopes will be a package of discounts, giving passengers a couple of extra rides, for instance, on a large fare purchase. When more of the system is outfitted with the electronic readers, the agency will be in a better position to offer monthly passes for unlimited rides at a set price, and free bus-to-subway transfers, two incentives urged by Mr. Stangl and supported in principle by the M.T.A. board.
There is also discussion by M.T.A. officials of off-peak discounts and weekly passes. But the agency says it will not offer varying rates for different distances traveled, as Washington's system does, because passengers would have to swipe cards through the turnstiles on their way in and out, slowing traffic in subway stations to a crawl.
 
Single Paper Fares
 The M.T.A. assumes that many riders will buy their fares in bulk as more and more stations offer the cards. However, the system will still need to accommodate passengers who want a single fare, and those cards will probably be made of paper rather than plastic, officials say.
Transit advocates were pleased about the start of automatic fare collection but raised concerns about whether the discount for monthly passes will be big enough to be attractive. The Straphangers Campaign, a transportation watchdog group that had been promoting fare cards since 1980, believes there should be a substantial discount to attract new passengers to a subway system that has lost half its ridership in the last four decades.
Joseph G. Rappaport, coordinator for the Straphangers Campaign, said a monthly pass that sold for the price of 40 trips, or $50 at the current fare, would win new passengers who use the subway to commute to work, since evening and weekend trips would in effect be free.
He fears that the M.T.A. will price the monthly passes in the $60 to $75 range. "They believe that some riders will find it more convenient to buy the electronic equivalent of a 10-pack of tokens, rather than the 10-pack itself," he said. "That's fine. But you don't spend $700 million for that. What you do is figure out ways of getting more people."
The M.T.A. is now studying how to price the monthly passes, as well as what incentives to offer. Its goal is to maximize ridership without severely hurting revenue. Increased ridership would offset the cost of a discount somewhat, but there could still be a significant gap, officials say.
Bernard Cohen, director of policy and planning for the M.T.A., said the agency wanted the package of discounts and incentives to yield a "5 to 10 percent increase" in riders. Average weekday ridership is now 3.4 million on the subways and 1.25 million on the buses.
 
No Rush at First
 With only a fraction of the system starting up this spring, passengers may not rush to buy the fare cards. "It's true that the faster you roll out a system, the quicker you'll get adoption," said Russ Broshous, president of the M.T.A. Card Company, the agency established to establish automatic fare collection. "But given the starkness of the change, we felt that we should be prudent and make sure that it runs well."
That could prove to be a challenge. Other cities experienced technical problems upon start-up of their automatic fare collection, with the machines not reading the cards properly. A critical report issued last year by the New York State Comptroller's Office challenged the claims made by the Transit Authority as to the durability of the card and the accuracy of the fare card machines.

Prices Fall Sharply on Long Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Government securities fell sharply yesterday, with investors nervous over the inflationary implications of continuing economic growth.
The skittishness was heightened by a jump in oil prices, the Government's report that factory orders rose in November for the fourth straight month and comments by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that he expected short-term interest rates to rise. 
 Bond traders were already wary ahead of the scheduled release tomorrow of data on employment for December, which could indicate strong economic expansion that might spill over into the first quarter and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to head off a resurgence in inflation.
 
Longer Yields Rise
 While short-term rates fell slightly yesterday, yields of longer maturities rose, erasing the price gains made in Tuesday's rally. The price of a 30-year bond fell by 24/32 , to 981/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.40 percent, from 6.35 percent on Tuesday.
Mr. Bentsen, in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that the Administration expected a modest increase in short-term rates. He did not make clear whether moves by the Fed would cause them to rise or whether they would be pushed up by market forces.
But Mr. Bentsen also said inflation was "even better contained than anticipated."
That view was shared by Thomas H. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. In a television interview yesterday, he cautioned against assuming that faster growth would necessarily generate higher inflation.
Analysts at MMS International said Mr. Hoenig's statements were consistent with their own: that an imminent tightening in monetary policy by the central bank was unlikely. But, they added, a move to raise short-term interest rates late in the first quarter or early second quarter is probable.
 
Narrow Range Seen
 Analysts expect the market will trade in a narrow range with a negative bias until the December employment report tomorrow. Until then, most investors are likely to trade cautiously, not prepared to make any major commitment at this time, they said.
Expectations are for nonfarm job growth of 215,000 in December, with expectations for the unemployment rate to rise to 6.5 percent, from 6.4 percent in November.
Maureen Allyn, the chief economist at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, said the 1.6 percent gain in factory orders in November was not unexpected. "Nonetheless," she added, "it was a good strong report and confirmed other data seeing a lot of production strength."
"This is the time to buy long bonds," she continued, "because this number -- factory orders -- is not a precursor of what is to come, but a confirmation of past strength."
A rise in heating oil prices because of cold weather contributed to weakness in government bond prices yesterday. Traders said the February futures contract for a barrel of light crude rose above $15 for the first time in almost a month.
 
Tax-Exempt Market
 In the municipal market, the New Jersey Building Authority competitively priced $310.1 million of tax-exempt state building revenue bonds, awarding the issue to Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Serial bonds were priced to yield from 3.25 percent in 1996 to 5.30 percent in 2017 through 2019, with the bonds rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by Standard & Poor's.
Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in a letter to the National League of Cities, responded to the league's request that the S.E.C. delay consideration of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's proposed Rule G-37 placing restrictions on political contributions by underwriting firms. The league asked that it be considered after the November elections.
The S.E.C. chairman said he was disappointed by the league's request and could not see a reason why "we should permit the continuation of practices which, at the least, raise serious conflicts of interest."

Dollar Hits Its Highest Level In Nine Months Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday to its highest levels against the Japanese yen in nearly nine months as the market shrugged off comments by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that appeared aimed at restraining its rise against the yen.
The dollar was mixed against other currencies. 
 Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, fell $3, to $392.10 an ounce.
The dollar rose against the yen during early trading after reportes of comments by an unidentified Japanese official saying the dollar should rise to 115.00 yen. But it plunged after Mr. Bentsen said that a weaker yen was not "an acceptable way out of recession for Japan."
In New York, the dollar dipped to about 112.35 yen, but investors quickly snapped it up, which drove it to finish at 113.07 yen, up from 112.65 on Tuesday.
"As much as the Administration tries to knock it down with these statements, it bounces back immediately," said Bob Lynch, currency analyst at MMS International.
And Hubert Pedroli, manager of foreign exchange for Credit Suisse in New York, said, "Nobody's got any confidence in what's going on in Japan."
American officials are concerned that a weaker yen will make Japanese exports cheaper, increasing their sales to countries like the United States. That, in turn, would aggravate the huge American trade deficit with Japan.
Last spring, American officials helped drive up the value of the yen by saying it ought to be stronger. But now the Japanese economy is in such poor shape that traders are no longer as concerned that United States authorities will act to push up the yen.
Paul Alley, an associate at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. in New York, said the difference between the strengthening American economy and the ailing Japanese economy was "telling people right now, 'You've got to buy dollars.' "
Investors were also concerned about political instability in Japan, he said.
The dollar also rose in New York to 1.7405 German marks, from 1.7355 on Tuesday. The British pound rose to $1.4875 from $1.4858.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Making a case for regional banks as an undervalued segment.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin

 BODY:
INVESTORS looking for value in the stock market might do worse than consider regional banks.
Shares in many of these stocks have been battered in recent months on fears that rising interest rates and a recovering economy will lead to a repetition of the bad lending judgments that got banks in so much trouble in the late 1980's. 
 But analysts say the risks are overstated and that compared with the rest of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, regional bank stocks are selling at their lowest levels since 1990.
"There have been three years since 1956 when regional bank stocks were selling at these sorts of levels," Elaine M. Garzarelli, a stock market strategist at Lehman Brothers, said.
"During those periods, relative earnings momentum slowed for the group, but their stock prices advanced significantly because the group represented great historical value," she said. "We believe the current period resembles those of 1972, 1976 and 1990, and predict that current valuations will produce superior price performance."
Last month Ms. Garzarelli put out a favorable report on the 17 stocks that make up the S.& P. 500 regional bank group, a list including the Banc One Corporation, Fidelity Bancorp, Nationsbank, Fleet Financial Group and Wells Fargo & Company.
Ms. Garzarelli must have faith in history and in the ability of investors to recognize value, because according to Lehman's own estimates, regional bank earnings growth will slow quite significantly this year from the rapid pace achieved in 1993.
In the coming 12 months, the firm estimates, the regional banks in the S.& P. index will see earnings rise by 4.8 percent, compared with an estimated 37.9 percent increase for all of 1993.
Stewart J. Pillette, a former chairman of the stock selection committee at Drexel Burnham Lambert who now heads his own investment management company in Oakland, Calif., said regional banks not only looked attractive because of their valuations compared with the rest of the market, but for fundamental reasons as well.
"The worry is that in a rising economy, banks, who for the past few years have been making no-risk loans to the Government through their purchases of Treasury securities, will make loans to the real world," Mr. Pillette said.
"But if interest rates rise, that means there will be more demand for money. I see that as healthy for banks. I think they will look really good as investments, not trades, for the next six months, and maybe longer."
Of the 25 stocks cited by Mr. Pillette on Jan. 1 as representing good value, three -- the First Union Corporation, Suntrust Banks and First Tennessee National, are regional bank stocks.
James J. McDermott Jr., president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a bank-stock research company, noted that bank stocks were usually cheap relative to the market because investors had a tough time putting a value on loan portfolios. "Today, that risk has been reduced or eliminated," he said, "because of the improving economy and steps taken by management to bolster reserves."
Those efforts have raised bank equity capital to its highest level in 30 years. As a consequence, analysts said, stock buybacks and sharp dividend increases are likely during the coming year, providing solid underpinning to regional bank share prices.
Further, Mr. McDermott said banks would not return to the lending spree that marked the late 1980's because "there is just not that much lending going on any more."
The focus for banks in general and regional banks in particular in the coming year, he said, would be on fee generation -- "who can generate revenues and control costs." Keefe also expects a continuing consolidation in the industry.
Because of its major effort to alter its revenue mix, Mr. McDermott likes the Mellon Bank Corporation, which ended 1993 by buying the Dreyfus Corporation. He also favors Integra Financial, a Pittsburgh bank that could be a takeover candidate in the next few years.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Is France's Cultural Protection a Handy-Dandy Trade Excuse?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"MARRIED WITH CHILDREN" is coming! To the barricades, Citoyens!
Of all the trade issues left hanging in the GATT deal, none, it is safe to say, aroused as much passion as France's insistence on continuing protection from America's entertainment juggernaut. It is equally safe to say that no other excuse for protection elicits so much sympathy from analysts otherwise disposed toward open trade. 
 Japanese rice growers and American textile magnates may, after all, be dismissed as sand in the wheels of progress. But who wants to see the good folks who brought you Truffaut, Godard and Chabrol buried in an avalanche of Love Boats, Inside Editions and Muppet Babies?
That, however, is not the last word on the subject. Before France's victory becomes the stuff of myth, it's worth a closer look at the logic behind the protection of "cultural services".
The European Community requires all TV channels, public or private, to carry a minimum of 50 percent European-made programming. France goes further, imposing a 60 percent minimum and enforcing the quota separately for prime-time shows. Then, too, Europe subsidizes local programming and films, often using taxes collected on movie tickets and video rentals to cover the cost.
Jacques Toubon, France's Minister of Culture, argues that the quotas and subsidies are needed to defend against the American industry's wish "to impose domination by any means." Jack Valenti, the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, dismisses the argument as a last refuge of scoundrels. "This is all about the hard business of money," he concludes.
Who's right? Eli Noam, the director of the Institute for Tele-Information at Columbia Business School, questions Europeans' assumptions. The premise that the game is rigged, that no one is in a position to beat Hollywood in a fair fight, he says, is based on a misunderstanding
Mr. Noam concedes that it does sometimes pay American producers to sell very cheaply in Europe, treating revenues as just a little extra on the side after costs are recouped at home. But the fact that royalties paid on European broadcast rights are low, he argues, says more about the lack of competition among European broadcasters than the willingness of Americans to sell their product for whatever the market will bear.
Indeed, Mr. Noam points out, what in other circumstances might be an "anti-dumping" argument against American imports can be turned on the alleged defenders of European culture. If the rights to non-European programming were bid up through greater competition, domestic producers in the same market would also benefit.
In any event, he notes, this shoe fits on both feet. If European producers can cover their costs at home, anything earned in America is lagniappe. And while America is larger and thus a seemingly stronger economic base than Europe, the American market is, in fact, equally fragmented: There are as many films made in America per million people as in Europe.
That said, it is still true that Hollywood blows away the European competition. Isn't that reason enough for the Europeans to nurture the business?
Harold Fruchtgott-Roth, an economic consultant in Washington, puts the cultural arguments in economic context. The fact that American entertainment sells so well, either because it is cheaper or better, is hardly in itself an argument for protection, he suggests, any more than the superiority of French Champagne to California bubbly would excuse an American quota on the former.
Nor is it possible to find much credibility in the "infant industry" argument -- the notion that protection is needed to prevent the European film industry from being strangled in the crib. "The French have been making movies as long as the Americans," he notes.
On the other hand, Mr. Fruchtgott-Roth says, it is plausible to defend a helping hand for the home product on the ground of "externalities" -- that Europeans as a community gain from exposure to European sensibilities in ways that aren't captured in the price of tickets, video rentals and television advertising.
The catch, Mr. Noam argues, is that the preservation of culture has become the handy-dandy, all-purpose excuse. It's one thing, he points out, to sweeten the pot for the best of the domestic product: Virtually every government subsidizes high culture. It is quite another to put a quota on American cop shows so that French studios can crank out their own car chases.
If there is a bright side here from Hollywood's perspective, Mr. Valenti says, it is the fact that the Europeans failed to get a formal exemption for cultural services from GATT rules. That means the American producers are still free to take the Europeans to court over alleged discrimination.
More ominously from the perspective of free traders, it will keep the pressure on the White House to invoke America's Draconian trade sanctions unilaterally against Europe. Wiser heads in the European Community may yet regret its 11th- hour cave-in to French demands.

HEADLINE: National Endowment Cuts Theater Training

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The National Endowment for the Arts, responding to a budget cut by Congress earlier this year, is eliminating its 20-year-old Professional Theater Training Program, which supports 16 of the nation's premier drama schools, including the Juilliard School, the Yale School of Drama and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.
There has been no formal announcement of the endowment's action, but some schools have been informed by letter of the cutbacks and endowment officials yesterday confirmed them. 
 The elimination of the theater program saves only $250,000, but it is the leading edge of a $4.7 million reduction in the endowment's $174.5 million budget for 1994-95.
"I'm the first one, as an actress, to recognize the need for theater training, and I ached over the elimination of the Professional Theater Training Program," Jane Alexander, the endowment chairwoman, said in a telephone interview. "It's highly regrettable, but we have to respond to the cuts that Congress handed to us."
Ms. Alexander took over in October, a month after Congress cut the endowment's budget.
The endowment has also decided to eliminate another program, the Dance Heritage Initiative, which had planned to disburse $300,000 in 1994-95 to dance companies and other institutions to preserve dance productions on film and video tape.
Some arts organizations have already received notices of their cuts, and many others are waiting uneasily to see how their budgets will be affected by the Congressional action. Although the endowment grants are in many cases in the tens of thousands of dollars or less, they are crucial to recession-starved arts groups and are often used as a magnet in other fund-raising efforts.
 
Saving Theater Companies
 The theater-training-program cut was selected "because we wanted to preserve as much money as we could for theater companies themselves," Ms. Alexander said. Last year the endowment distributed $7.2 million to 234 nonprofit theater groups, and Ms. Alexander said that this category would be cut by only $75,000 in the new budget.
Among the drama schools that will be affected by the elimination of the training program are Juilliard ($25,000), Yale ($27,500), New York University ($17,500), the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco ($22,500), the University of Iowa ($16,000) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ($10,000). Among the other institutions are Brown University, Rutgers University, the University of Delaware and the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.
Joseph W. Polisi, the president of Juilliard, confirmed that the endowment had told the school about the loss of the grant, which was to have helped pay faculty salaries. The four-year undergraduate acting program has 78 students. Its graduates include Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, Robin Williams, Christopher Reeve, Mandy Patinkin, Kelly McGillis and Val Kilmer. More than 700 students apply for the 20 spaces in the school every year.
"Of course, the money has financial importance," Mr. Polisi said, "and the endowment grant was also an anchor for other fund-raising, showing that our program had been reviewed by peers and was worthy of funding. But the greater significance is symbolic. We thought with a new Administration and a new chair of the endowment, we'd be moving forward. This sends a discouraging message."
 
Other Schools Hear
 Mary Schmidt Campbell, the dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, said its drama school had not received a letter from the endowment but understood that it would be losing its grant.
She said the money would have gone to graduate programs in acting, design, dance and other disciplines for about 200 students.
Victoria Nolan, the managing director of the Yale School of Drama, said the program "must have seemed an easy cut, because there are relatively few grantees in the program." Yale's $27,500 grant, the largest in the program, had already been reduced from $47,500 the previous year.
Ms. Alexander said many arts institutions other than theater schools would soon be notified about cuts in other categories, including dance, visual arts, museums, opera, music, film, video and radio programming.
A list of specific organizations and cuts would be premature, Ms. Alexander said, since she wanted the institutions to be told before public announcements are made. In addition, she said, cuts in many categories have not yet been decided upon.
But at least one Manhattan organization, the Kitchen, which presents performance art, dance and music, has been told that its grant will be cut 80 percent, to $10,000 from $50,000 last season (and $65,000 the previous season).

No Growth in 12 Years
 Ms. Campbell of the Tisch School called the $4.7 million cut "Draconian, because the N.E.A. budget has had no growth in the last 12 years." She added, "This is going to put a large number of groups at serious risk and make it harder to perform their mission."
Ms. Campbell, a former New York City Cultural Affairs Commissioner who was mentioned last year as a possible head of the endowment, was the host of a New York reception in November after Ms. Alexander became chairman, and guests from the theater celebrated her confirmation. Ms. Campbell said that the round of budget-cutting "is the first serious issue that the new chair has to confront."
She added: "This will be an important measure of the kind of leadership Jane will provide. It's important that she make the Congress and the President understand the impact of these cuts on so many organizations."
Ms. Alexander said she deplored having to cut the endowment's programs. "It's cutting into muscle, since it's been a long time since there was any fat to cut." The endowment, she said, has suffered "a reduction of 46 percent in funding since the late 1970's."
Ms. Campbell said she worried about the impact of the cuts "on smaller arts organizations, some of which are on the edge." She added that "for larger universities, the impact won't be as severe, but it will limit the range of possibilities and the educational options we present to our students."

HEADLINE: Composer Ensembles Are Focus Of Series

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
For young musicians of a certain stripe in the 1960's, getting a band together, setting up in a garage and hashing out some home-grown music was almost a cultural imperative. Usually the music was rock-and-roll; at least, the rock bands got most of the attention. But there was another kind of band scene coalescing at the time. Composers whose tastes had led them away from both atonality and neo-Romanticism were putting together bands of like-minded players to explore the experimental visions that led to Minimalism and to the many hybrids of rock, jazz and concert music that flourish in the Downtown new-music world today.
At first, these bands were matters of practical and economic necessity. They were laboratories for composers, who knew the capabilities of their players and often stretched them, and who were guaranteed performances that were entirely under their control. And composers discovered that they could often earn larger fees as players -- particularly as the sole performers of their own music -- than through the more traditional route of publishing works for other musicians to play. 
 The Kitchen, a haven for composer-led groups for more than two decades, is celebrating the band world in "Gruppen II: Chamber Music for the 21st Century," a series that opens tomorrow evening and runs through Jan. 15. The concerts are at 9 P.M. at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea. Information: (212) 255-5793.
 
Reduction in Grants
 Just at the moment, the Kitchen is doing a bit of scrambling. Early this week it learned that its grants from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts were being cut considerably. Because of a budget reduction imposed by Congress, the endowment slashed its overall grant by about 80 percent, to $10,000 from $50,000 last season. The part of the grant earmarked for music (the Kitchen also presents dance and performance art) was eliminated entirely (it was $8,000 last year). The council's grant dropped to $22,500 from $35,500, said Eric Latzky, the Kitchen's spokesman.
Offsetting these disappointments is a new grant from the Rockefeller Foundation -- to be used in the commissioning of a new-music theater piece, "The Negroes' Burial Ground," by Leroy Jenkins -- and renewed grants from several other foundations, including the Mary Flagler Cary Trust, the Aaron Copland Fund for Music and the Virgil Thomson Foundation. All told, the Kitchen has an annual production budget of about $400,000.
But Ben Neill, the 36-year-old trumpeter and composer who is in his second season as the Kitchen's music curator, is not letting financial pressures rain on his series. In fact, he regards the problems of paying for new music almost as an integral part of contemporary composing and performing life.
"The whole phenomenon of composers' ensembles is an important aspect in the development of new music," said Mr. Neill, who presented a similar series last year. "It's difficult for young composers who are not working at an academic institution to get their works performed. On the other hand, I know from experience that it's difficult to maintain an ensemble, given all the economic demands of working in New York today. So I put the series together because I thought it was important for the community to support this kind of work.
"The series is really focused on New York groups. But this year I tried to broaden it to include not only composer-directed ensembles, but ensembles like the Meridian Arts Ensemble, Essential Music and the Sirius String Quartet. They have composers within them, and they play their own music. But they also perform other composers' works."
 
A Quest for Balance
 The opening concert, tomorrow evening, has exactly the kind of balance Mr. Neill is seeking. Jon Gibson, the post-Minimalist composer and saxophonist, is to lead his quartet (with Blue Gene Tyranny on synthesizer, Martin Goldray on piano and Bill Ruyle on percussion) in his own works. But sharing the program with the Jon Gibson Quartet is the Meridian Arts Ensemble, a brass quintet that will play music by one of its members, Jon Nelson, as well as arrangements of pieces by Frank Zappa and the art-rock band King Crimson.
The other concerts offer similar stylistic variety, the balances depending on the peculiarities of the musicians taking part. Zusaan Kali Fasteau, a wind and reed player whose music combines jazz and third-world exoticism, is sharing a bill on Saturday with Julia Heyward, a singer whose music draws more on pop-music sensibilities. The Walter Thompson Orchestra, a jazz band, will play Mr. Thompson's music and works by Duke Ellington and Charles Ives next Wednesday.
"I wanted to bring these different angles in," said Mr. Neill of the jazz- and rock-influenced music in the series. "I did not want to limit it to people who are considered experimental or avant-garde."
One of the quirkier ensembles on the bill is Impossible Music, a trio that makes music using portable CD players. The group treats CD's as "found" sound sources, in much the same way musique concrete composers of the 1950's used pieces of tape. The three players -- Ikue Mori, David Shea and David Weinstein -- present the results as collaborative works, with titles like "Three Mistakes of Stravinsky and One of Yves St. Laurent," the featured piece on the program next Thursday. They are sharing the bill with Michelle Kinney, who writes music for combinations of computers, instruments and voice, with room for improvisation by the members of her band, Universal Time.
 
Collection of Hybrids
 Essential Music and the Sirius String Quartet will each play works composed for them by ensemble members and other composers on Jan. 14. And the festival ends on Jan. 15th with Toby Twining, a composer who writes microtonal music for an a cappella vocal ensemble, and Peter Gordon, whose Love of Life Orchestra Quartet is to present "Tone Poems and Video Painting: II," a program of Mr. Gordon's multi-media collaborations with the video artist Kit Fitzgerald.
"Everyone on the series is some kind of hybrid," said Mr. Neill of the swirl of popular and avant-garde influences his series embodies. "I think what's happened is that it's taken a generation of people experimenting with polystylistic music to get to the point where people could incorporate all of these things into their work without being self-conscious about it. I wanted to get into that area in the 'Gruppen' series.
"I don't think it's a matter of having to prove anything anymore. It's a given that composers can include anything from atonality to electric guitars, drums and a backbeat in a work. The question is not what you're putting in, or what you're borrowing. The challenge is to see how these things can be brought together in ways that are stimulating and which show all the elements in a new light."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
New Round in Revenue-Sharing Dispute

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Last week, Richard Ravitch fished for snapper in the Florida Keys. Today, he jumps into the water with baseball's sharks.
For the first time in nearly five months, Ravitch, the clubs' chief labor executive, will convene a meeting of the 28 major league club owners to try to produce a new agreement on distribution of their local revenue. The owners have to agree on revenue sharing before Ravitch can try to induce the players to accept a salary cap as part of a collective bargaining agreement that would replace the one that expired last Friday. 
 The meeting, in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont at a hotel near O'Hare Airport, will or will not produce a new revenue-sharing plan, depending on the point of view of the owner expressing his view.
Last August, when the owners met for 28 hours over two days in Kohler, Wis., 10 high-revenue clubs blocked adoption of a plan. One owner from that group said yesterday that the same clubs remain opposed to the plan currently on the table and that other clubs might even have joined them.
A supporter of Ravitch's plan, on the other hand, said that after speaking with many owners, he thinks chances are good that the plan, or some variation of it, will get the 21 votes needed for adoption.
 
A Call for Compromise
 "People have differing views," Ravitch acknowledged. "Compromise is essential if the owners wish to try to achieve a different kind of economic system in baseball. If they want some degree of cost control, they will have to agree on some new system of revenue distribution. They're aware of that."
Even if the owners adopt a plan, which in effect would take money from the high-revenue clubs and give it to the low-revenue clubs, it would be contingent on the players' acceptance of a salary cap. For that reason, Ravitch's effort could turn out to be futile because the players have shown no inclination to agree to a cap.
Nevertheless, Ravitch has to persuade the owners to take the first step. He could be aided by a potentially large hammer some National League clubs could wield against their wealthier brethren.
Half of the opposition 10 are National League clubs: the Mets, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Colorado and Florida. These clubs could be vulnerable because of the league television agreement that has expired. This agreement deals strictly with each club's local television practices, and has been the instrument by which teams televise games back to their cities from other parks. The other nine clubs, led by San Diego, Montreal and Pittsburgh, are threatening not to renew it if a revenue-sharing plan is not forthcoming.
"It's a weapon, and it gets people's attention," a high-ranking executive of one of the clubs said.
If they fail to forge a revenue-sharing agreement, the National League clubs could create their own plan by voting to charge the other teams fees for telecasting games from their parks.
The likelihood of a plan emerging from that scenario is far greater than the development offered speculatively in recent weeks by some baseball observers. Under that scenario, George Steinbrenner of the Yankees, perhaps the most outspoken opponent of increased sharing of revenue, would agree to it if Harvey Schiller is named commissioner. Schiller is executive director of the United States Olympic Committee, of which Steinbrenner is a vice president.
"That's absurd," said one owner, who opposes enhanced sharing.
"Not a prayer," said one proponent about the likelihood of Steinbrenner's giving up his money to insure Schiller's election.
 
Plan on the Table
 The plan on the table, details of which have not been disclosed, was proposed by Ravitch sometime after the Kohler meeting. Because the plan doesn't go far enough to meet their desires, it has elicited negative views from clubs at the low-revenue extreme as well as from the other end of the spectrum. Owners from both ends have made suggestions for altering it, but the changes would only widen the gap between the two sides.
Many people in baseball feel that failure to get an agreement would prompt Ravitch to leave his post. As a prelude to negotiations with the union, he has worked on revenue sharing almost exclusively for more than a year. Without a plan, he would have nothing to take to the bargaining table with the players. Furthermore, even if he developed a new negotiating approach, his ability to negotiate an agreement with them could be undermined by the owners' failure to back his plan.
"If there's nothing for him to do, it would be silly for him to stay," said one member of management.

HEADLINE: Lessons Well Learned

 BODY:

To the Home Section:
 Lisa M. Miller's interesting article on the boys in home economics ("Where the Boys Are: Home Ec, " Dec. 16) reminded me of my own experience. 
 In the fall of 1933 -- yes '33 -- I was the first boy to enroll in the home economics class of my suburban high school (Bronxville). The following year the group of 20 was almost equally divided between boys and girls. The third year the boys had taken over and, as I recall, only one girl was able to enroll.
The appeal then was probably more the prospect of free cake, cookies and assorted goodies in the middle of a long school day, but the lessons have served me well through life: on my own in college, where I earned extra cash catering; in the Army, where being assigned mess officer guaranteed plenty to eat; as widower and single parent of an omnivorous teen-ager, and now as the semiretired homemaking partner to a fully employed spouse.

HEADLINE: Cost Analysis Doesn't Apply to Breast Cancer;
Link to Animal Fat

 BODY:

To the Editor:
There is much debate about mammograms for women younger than 50 (front page, Dec. 27), but virtually no discussion of preventing this terrible disease. Scientific studies have documented that breast cancer is strongly connected to fat, especially animal fat, in the diet. 
 In Japan, where fat consumption is far lower than in the United States, the breast cancer rate is only one-fourth of ours. Genetics don't seem to be the reason; when Japanese women move to the United States and adopt typical American diets, their breast cancer rate rises sharply.
While there is still debate among scientists about the role of fat in the diet, the Surgeon General's 1988 report on nutrition and health noted, "Indeed, a comparison of populations indicates that death rates for cancers of the breast, colon and prostate are directly proportional to estimated dietary fat intakes."
If we want to reverse the soaring health care costs that are projected to reach an incredible 20 percent of the gross national product in a dozen years, we must recognize the role of our diet.

HEADLINE: U.S. PARES IMPORTS OF CHINA'S FABRICS IN A PUNITIVE MOVE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today cut by more than $1 billion the amount of clothing and fabrics China can export to the United States, retaliating for what it said were Chinese attempts to get around American limits on imports by shipping goods into the United States through other nations.
American apparel manufacturers quickly welcomed the Administration's punitive action, since it will slightly curb China's ability to compete with American-made goods and possibly save some jobs. But some American retailers complained that consumers could face shortages and higher prices, particularly low-income shoppers who may depend on some of these illicit Chinese sweaters, knit shirts and cotton trousers. The retailers urged the Administration to negotiate a settlement with Beijing. 
 All told, American retailers purchase about 6 percent of their clothing from China, according to the Johnson Redbook Service, a retail research organization.
 
 
Takes Effect on Jan. 17
 Because the punitive measure will not take effect until Jan. 17, there is a chance that the United States and China will come to an understanding that would better control or limit illicit Chinese exports. According to one Government estimate, about $2 billion of Chinese textiles and apparel is evading American import quotas each year.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, announced the decision at a news conference. It will take effect two days before Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen arrives in Beijing for high-level trade talks with Chinese leaders. Mr. Kantor said import quotas from China would be reduced by 25 to 35 percent on 88 categories of clothing, cloth and other products, including shop cloths used to clean industrial machinery.
 
Beijing Refuses to Talk

 Mr. Kantor said American officials had been monitoring the Chinese exports for some time and had been trying to persuade China to resume negotiations with the United States on an agreement for tighter controls and stiffer penalties to limit illicit exports. But Beijing refused this week to resume talks aimed at such an agreement, which the United States now has with 16 other major exporters.
There was no reaction today from Chinese officials to the American charges.
In foreign policy terms, the move underscores the degree to which China is gradually challenging Japan as the biggest trade headache for the United States, as well as the extent to which Chinese-American frictions are now as much over trade disputes as human rights abuses. China's trade surplus with the United States, now about $25 billion a year, is second only to Japan's.
In domestic policy terms, the move is a gesture by the Clinton Administration to American textile manufacturers and their representatives in Congress, who have been chafing over the fact that the Administration did not win them the long-term protection they were seeking from the recently concluded global trade agreement.
Mr. Kantor said that United States Customs Service investigators had found that Chinese fabrics and clothing had been illegally shipped to the United States through at least 25 other countries, including Honduras and Panama, as well as Hong Kong.
 
 
Sweaters to Macao
 In one case, he said, 3.6 million sweaters were shipped from China to neighboring Macao, a steamy Portuguese territory next to Hong Kong with a population of only 475,000.
"The climate is such that it would be quite unusual for each of them to buy eight sweaters in one year," Mr. Kantor wryly noted about the residents of Macao. What happened instead, he said, was that Chinese sweaters were relabeled "Made in Macao" and transshipped to the United States.
 In another case, he said, 625 million kilograms of shop towels -- small rags used to clean industrial machinery -- were made in China and then shipped to Honduras.
Honduras, Mr. Kantor said, is "not one of the great economic and manufacturing powers in the world." He added, "Given the limited number of heavy manufacturing industries in this country, obviously it would take decades for this volume of shop towels to actually be used in Honduras."
In fact, the goods were relabeled "Made in Honduras" and shipped to the United States.
"The President committed in his executive order last May, when extending most-favored-nation status for China, that the Administration would pursue resolutely all legislative and executive actions to insure that China abides by its commitments to follow fair, nondiscriminatory trade practices," Mr. Kantor said.
"In line with the President's policy in this regard," he added, "I am announcing today that due to our inability to reach agreements with China to stem or stop their illegal textile transshipments, which have reached massive proportions -- about $2 billion a year -- the United States is taking action to reduce China's 1994 textile quotas effective Jan. 17."
The Administration has been trying to console the American textile industry after agreeing, in the recently concluded world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to replace American textile import quotas with less restrictive tariffs over 10 years. The American textile industry had sought to phase in the new tariffs over 15 years.
Not surprisingly, the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, a powerful textile lobby, welcomed today's move. "Ambassador Kantor's bold action in cracking down on illegal Chinese textile exports is a strong message that the United States will not tolerate trade which violates our laws," it said. "Other nations, such as India and Pakistan, should also get this message."
 But American retailers, who sell the low-cost Chinese products, were not so happy. Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, an industry group, said, "Let's hope that this action is a negotiating tactic, because if it is not and China's trade is cut by these significant numbers, then the American consumer, particularly the low-income consumer, will be severely impacted."
A spokesman for the Gap, which buys about 2 percent of its apparel from China, threw in a caveat. The cutback, he said, will strain capacity at apparel factories elsewhere in East Asia -- particularly Hong Kong -- "and that will lead to higher prices for the consumer."
Mr. Kantor said he estimated that the cuts announced today would cost Beijing $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion worth of exports. This, he insisted, would have "little if any impact on American consumers" but would show the Administration's determination "to stand up for U.S. jobs."
 
 
Shift on Satellite Sale
 The Administration, apparently in an effort to soften the impact on China of the textile quota cut, is also planning to lift its ban on the sale of two broadcast satellites built by the Martin Marietta Corporation in return for Beijing's agreement to enter discussions with the United States about its exports of missiles and other weapons, officials said.
 American officials remain concerned that despite the carrot-and-stick gestures they are applying on Beijing, China is still not demonstrating the sort of human rights and trade behavior that the Clinton Administration is demanding for the renewal on June 1 of China's most-favored nation trade status, which enables it to export its goods to the United States with the lowest possible tariffs.
 For months, American officials have warned China that it must show a pattern of good behavior in trade and human rights to secure most-favored status again, and that it cannot rush in on the eve of the decision, release a few dissidents, make a few concessions and expect President Clinton to reward it. But the Chinese are running out of months to set a new pattern.
"We are not there yet," said Joan Spero, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. "The Chinese are not there yet. So we are far from a decision to renew M.F.N."

The Administration cut the amount of clothing and fabrics China can export to the U.S. by more than $1 billion in retaliation for what it said were attempts by China to get around American limits on imports by shipping goods through other nations. The punitive measure will not take effect until Jan. 17, so there is a chance that the two countries will come to an understanding. [Page A1.] 
 The value of the Japanese yen is now in retreat after a year in which its steady rise struck fear into Japan's leading industries. The reversal could lead to a profit improvement for Japan's automobile and electronics giants and help foster a slow but eventual recovery of the stagnant Japanese economy. [D1.]
Peru had the highest growth rate in Latin America in 1993 because economic losses in the country's war with Shining Path Maoist guerrillas virtually dropped by half last year. [A9.]
 
The Economy
Most major retailers reported higher December sales, though the range was broad, from a 13.3 percent gain at Sears to 1.1 percent at Kmart. Sales of durable goods like appliances fared better than apparel and other soft goods. And profit margins were hurt by an enormous amount of price-cutting and sales promotions to satisfy consumers' desire for value. [D1.]
Commerce Secretary Brown announced a 27-member council to advise the Administration on information-policy matters and the creation of the data superhighway. But noticeably absent from the panel were the big three television networks, and there were few large movie studios or television programmers. [D4.]
 
Companies
An F.C.C. commissioner conceded that Infinity Broadcasting's expansion plan would be hard to stop. James H. Quello said blocking the purchase of three radio stations because of objections to the language used on the air by Howard Stern, one of Infinity's radio personalities, would face a long legal challenge. [D1.]
Rumors circulated that Viacom would merge with Blockbuster, an investor in its bid for Paramount Communications. Such a union would help Viacom raise its bid for Paramount. [D1.]
Macy's chairman insisted that Federated's move to seek a possible merger had put little pressure on management to come up with a plan of its own to keep the company independent. [D3.]
Several states joined California's attempt to halt hearings on Prudential Securities' class action settlement of sales abuses in limited partnerships in the 1980's. [D3.]
General Motors formed a joint venture in China to make and sell engine-management systems in that country. [D3.]
Large shareholders of TLC Beatrice supported the unexpected change in management that was announced Wednesday. [D3.]

McDonnell Douglas agreed to a Pentagon order putting its C-17 cargo jet program on probation for two years. [D14.]

HEADLINE: Bond Move By Merrill

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company has temporarily suspended new business with Washington, D.C., after accusations that Merrill had a conflict of interest with the city's investment adviser, Lazard Freres & Company.
Merrill's move, announced Wednesday, prevents it from competing for about a month for underwriting deals for District of Columbia municipal bonds. 
 It came as two council members were asking for an investigation into a fee-splitting agreement between Merrill and Lazard concerning two financial deals known as interest rate swaps with the District in 1991 and 1992. Merrill and Lazard face similar conflict accusations in Massachusetts.
The two firms deny wrongdoing in both cases. They said they fully disclosed agreements in both cases for Lazard to advise Merrill on the swaps. The swaps are complex transactions designed to lower a customer's financing costs by exchanging fixed-interest payments for variable payments.
The two council members say they should have been told of an agreement between Merrill and Lazard, which is paid by the city to provide independent investment advice. The agreement brings into question the quality and impartiality of that advice, they say.
Merrill and Lazard said a report on Nov. 23 by the District's chief financial officer, Ellen M. O'Connor, cleared them of any wrongdoing. Merrill said Wednesday that it had suspended dealings with the city to give the council time to investigate.
Merrill's action comes at a time of intense scrutiny of the municipal bond market after accusations last year from several states of influence peddling or conflicts of interest.

HEADLINE: Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., a Democratic Power in the House for Decades, Dies at 81

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans today bade a warm farewell to Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., the gregarious and irrepressibly liberal Bostonian who symbolized the Democratic Party through much of the 1980's as Speaker of the House.
Mr. O'Neill, 81, died Wednesday night of cardiac arrest at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Since his retirement from the House in 1987, he had lived in Washington and Harwich Port, Mass., on Cape Cod. 
 President Clinton issued a statement today paying tribute to "a beautiful life well lived," and ordered Government flags lowered to half-staff until Mr. O'Neill's burial on Monday.
"Tip O'Neill was the nation's most prominent, powerful and loyal champion of working people," the President's statement said. "He loved politics and government because he saw politics and government could make a difference in people's lives. And he loved people most of all."
The current Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, called Mr. O'Neill "the model of what a representative and a leader of the American people should be."
Today, the capital's Republicans largely agreed. "Partisanship was put aside, and we could be the best of friends," the House minority leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, said of Mr. O'Neill today on the ABC-TV News program "Good Morning America."
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, was one of Mr. O'Neill's most biting political critics in the 1980's. But today, on the CBS News program "This Morning," Mr. Dole called his old rival "the Congressman's Congressman."
Mr. O'Neill, he said, "certainly will go down in history as one of the great political leaders of our time."
He was also one of the last and least reconstructed liberals from the cadre of Roosevelt-era New Dealers who led Congress and the nation through most the 1960's and 1970's.
 
A Proud Liberal, Fashionable or Not
 Mr. O'Neill was an old-style politician and proud of it, a House Speaker comfortable with power, who clung to his brand of liberalism long after it ceased to be fashionable, even among his fellow Democrats.
An early opponent of the Vietnam War, Mr. O'Neill took strong positions on many controversial issues. He was the Congressional leader who pushed hardest for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon and later, as Speaker, put his prestige on the line for Congressional reform.
Mr. O'Neill was the Speaker from 1977 to 1987, during the Presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, both of whom ran against entrenched Washington officials and considered Mr. O'Neill the ultimate insider.
But although he reached the heights of political power and mingled easily with national and world leaders, Mr. O'Neill was perhaps best known for his advice to colleagues to attend carefully to their constituents, because, as he put it, "All politics is local."
He was a large, joyous, generous-spirited man with a bulbous nose, yellowed white hair that flopped over his forehead and an ever-present cigar. He was a rabid sports fan, frequently attending baseball games and boxing matches, a skilled poker player and a devoted but struggling golfer.
To Mr. O'Neill, who spoke of the Democratic Party with near-religious fervor, the party was the one of the cities, the working people, the poor, the needy, the unemployed, the sick and the disinherited. "And no way are we ever going to let them down," he would insist. He opposed a balanced budget because, he said, it would "dismantle the programs that I've been working for as an old liberal."
When President Reagan persuaded Congress to curtail many of Mr. O'Neill's favorite social programs, the Speaker lamented that the Democrats had been too successful at their work. He said the Democratic programs had created a broad middle class whose members had forgotten the many benefits they had received from government -- in education and housing, for example -- and wanted to pull up the ladder behind them.
Republicans made Mr. O'Neill a target of their 1980 and 1982 campaigns, portraying him as a bloated old pol with outdated liberal ideas. They produced a television commercial that featured an actor who resembled the Speaker laughing off warnings that his car was low on fuel, until the vehicle finally ground to a halt. The announcer then proclaimed, "The Democrats have run out of gas."
Mr. O'Neill remained steadfast. "I haven't changed my philosophy," he frequently told reporters, with whom he met daily.
He made no apologies for the kind of politics he had mastered in Boston. As Speaker, he rewarded friends and punished enemies with the help of a long memory but few grudges.
 
O'Neill and Carter: Different Democrats
 Mr. O'Neill's became Speaker the year Mr. Carter took office as President. About all they had in common was their political party. Mr. Carter, an emotionally taut Georgian with a scant power base among Democrats, had reached the White House as an anti-politician, an outsider who publicly disdained Washington insiders personified by the gregarious Speaker, who had worked his way up from ward politics.
"Our first conversation," the Speaker recalled, "he told me how he had handled the Georgia Legislature, by going over their heads directly to the people."
Mr. O'Neill said he responded by referring to the 289 House Democrats in the majority. "I said: 'Hey, wait a minute. You have 289 guys up there who know their districts pretty well. They ran against the Administration, and they wouldn't hesitate to run against you.'
"He said, 'Oh, really?' "
The two men did not speak the same language. Mr. O'Neill said he had once told the President, "Keep your left hand high." But the Speaker found that Mr. Carter was no boxing fan and was unfamiliar with the boxer's classic defensive posture. "He didn't know what I was talking about," Mr. O'Neill said.
But as a loyal Democrat Mr. O'Neill felt morally bound to help Mr. Carter whenever possible. An autographed photograph from the President was inscribed, "To my friend Tip O'Neill, thanks for another lesson in good politics, Jimmy Carter, June 1977."
But in 1980, when the Republicans won the White House and the Senate, and cut deeply into the House Democratic majority, the Speaker privately blamed the President, believing him inept.
Today, Mr. Carter said in a statement that Mr. O'Neill "personified the finest of American politics."
"Of all the people I have known, Tip O'Neill knew best how to enjoy politics," he said.
 
O'Neill and Reagan: Different Irishmen
 Mr. O'Neill never shied from wielding power, although he frequently lamented that the power of the Speaker had declined since the days of Sam Rayburn, the Texas Democrat whose word became law during his 17 years in the post, ending in 1961. That was when a Speaker could get binding commitments from committee chairmen; it was before the diffusion of power that Mr. O'Neill himself worked to bring about.
From 1981 to 1987, Mr. O'Neill led the loyal opposition to President Reagan, a man with whom he shared an Irish heritage, an interest in sports and an outgoing personality. But the two men had a profound philosophical disagreement about government: the Speaker regarded government as the solution to many social problems, as an agent of social change; Mr. Reagan regarded it as a problem in itself, interfering in the lives of Americans and impeding economic and social progress.
The Speaker also found Mr. Reagan to be appallingly ignorant of the intricacies of government; indeed, he called him the most ignorant man who had ever occupied the White House. Publicly, Mr. O'Neill called Mr. Reagan "Herbert Hoover with a smile" and "a cheerleader for selfishness."
Early in his time as Speaker, when his bill for a new House code of ethics was in trouble, he lumbered to the well of the House and cut through the debate on the crucial provision, a limitation on outside income. The speech was vintage O'Neill.
Sure, he said, he knew what it was to be strapped. Wasn't he the one who had fought for a raise of $12,900 a year in Congressional pay? But in exchange he had promised the American people "the strongest code of ethics that this country has ever seen." The issue, after Watergate, he thundered, was "restoring public confidence in this Congress as an institution, restoring confidence in its membership."
He looked out at an audience that included the 80 Democrats for whom he had campaigned the previous fall, the scores of members he had appointed to the nine select and special committees over which he had jurisdiction, and the more than 200 beneficiaries of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Fund, for which he had been the chairman.
His listeners knew that the Speaker had a great voice in their committee assignments, the scheduling of floor action on bills, the disbursing of campaign money and the small favors that can make or break a Congressional career. Mr. O'Neill called in his chits. The result was a foregone conclusion. The vote was 344 to 79.
Four years later, when 44 Democrats joined in voting to overturn a ruling of the chair, the kind of parliamentary decision that is the lifeblood of the House, Mr. O'Neill wrote them that he was "extremely disappointed" and obliquely warned that "disciplinary measures" were under consideration.
Such measures could affect a member's committee assignments. He added that he felt that such measures were unnecessary. No future Democratic votes against the judgment of the chair were noted.
 
Tip (as in Foul Tip) Tastes Politics at 15
 Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. was born on Dec. 9, 1912, in a working-class area of Cambridge, Mass., which later became part of his Congressional district. His father was a member of the Cambridge City Council. His mother died when he was a child, and his father remarried.
He picked up the nickname Tip from a baseball player, James Edward O'Neill of the old St. Louis Browns, who had the knack of hitting foul tips until the pitcher walked him. So Mr. O'Neill's boyhood friends gave him the name. The Speaker was an inveterate fan of the Boston Red Sox.
Educated in Roman Catholic schools, he broke into politics at 15, campaigning for Al Smith in his 1928 Presidential campaign against Herbert C. Hoover. "All I knew was that Al Smith was an Irish Catholic and we had been suppressed all our lives," he said.
Four years later, he helped get out the vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt. "You'd have Mrs. Murphy ready to get into an automobile to take her to the polls," he recalled. "And then you'd go to the next house, Mrs. Sweeney, and you'd have the car come for Mrs. Sweeney. We walked the streets to get the votes out."
As a senior at Boston College, Mr. O'Neill lost his first campaign, for the Cambridge City Council, by 150 votes. But he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1936, where he rose to Speaker, and where he remained until 1952, when he was elected to the United States House.
He won the seat vacated by John F. Kennedy on Kennedy's election to the Senate. It was also the seat once held by James M. Curley, the Boston politician whose career was the basis of the Edwin O'Connor novel "The Last Hurrah."
 
A Protege Of a Future Speaker
 Mr. O'Neill and his wife, Mildred, decided not to move their family to Washington when Mr. O'Neill was first elected, and they did not go back on this agreement until Mr. O'Neill became Speaker, a quarter century later.
Until then, Mr. O'Neill roomed with Representative Edward P. Boland, Democrat of Massachusetts, his closest friend. Their refrigerator was said to be stocked almost exclusively with beer.
In Washington, Mr. O'Neill became a protege of Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip who went on to become House Speaker in 1962. Mr. McCormack introduced him to the House power structure as part of the informal "board of education" meetings that Speaker Rayburn held after hours for Congressional leaders and friends. By his second term in the House, Mr. O'Neill had won a coveted seat on the Rules Committee.
Mr. O'Neill's opposition to the Vietnam War in 1967, when he was a leader of the Rules Committee, was a decision affected by the anti-war feelings of his own children (three boys and two girls) as well as among the intellectual communities at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his own district. His blue-collar constituents, who made up the bulk of his support, were overwhelmingly in favor of the American role in the war.
But Mr. O'Neill wrote in his autobiography, "Man of the House" (Random House, 1987), that he had come to the conclusion that the conflict was a civil war and that American involvement in it was morally wrong. When President Lyndon B. Johnson called him to the White House to explain his change of position, Mr. O'Neill recalled, he told the President, "In my heart and in my conscience I believe your policy is wrong." Johnson accepted his position, Mr. O'Neill said, when he found out that the Congressman had not changed it for political reasons.
But his opposition to the war did eventually reap some political dividends: he won the trust and support of younger House members who shared his position on Vietnam, and they became important allies as Mr. O'Neill rose in power.
In 1971, having supported Hale Boggs of Louisiana as majority leader, Mr. O'Neill was selected by Mr. Boggs to be majority whip, an appointive post. After Mr. Boggs died in a plane crash in Alaska in 1972, Mr. O'Neill was elected majority leader.
Mr. O'Neill, as the whip under Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma, was the Democrats' strong man; he did the difficult things. He was instrumental in bringing changes that stripped the committee chairmen of their autocratic power, and he was the Democratic leader who pushed hardest for the investigation and impeachment of President Nixon, who resigned before a vote on impeachment was held.
Mr. O'Neill was elected Speaker by acclamation in December 1976, when he was 64, and took office the next month. "The wonder of it is that such a decent, compassionate man could rise to the top of a place like this," said Representative Benjamin S. Rosenthal, Democrat of Queens.
But Mr. O'Neill was not without lapses of judgment. He was among many House members who accepted favors from Tongsun Park, the South Korean lobbyist and intelligence agent. In 1973 and '74, Mr. O'Neill permitted Mr. Park to sponsor two lavish birthday parties in his honor, thereby bolstering Mr. Park's prestige.
Similarly, some questioned Mr. O'Neill's judgment when he intervened in an application for Federal money made by James P. Wilmot, who had been chairman of the Democratic Party's Finance Committee.
The Speaker telephoned the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Carla A. Hills, in July 1975, asking when there would be a decision on Mr. Wilmot's request for $2.2 million in annual rent subsidies for a housing project. Such inquiries tend to be viewed as requests for special consideration. In any event, Mr. Wilmot got his subsidies.
Although he had close ties to the Kennedy family, Mr. O'Neill remained neutral in the party's Presidential nomination fight between Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and President Carter in 1980. He played a role behind the scenes at the Democratic National Convention, however, negotiating an agreement that led to Mr. Kennedy's reluctant endorsement of the President.
 
Financial Security From a Book
 Until his retirement, the O'Neills maintained their home in Cambridge, enabling the Speaker to keep in touch with the city's intellectual community as well as its neighborhoods. A Saturday morning ritual when Mr. O'Neill was in Cambridge consisted of stops at the Chinese laundry, the Italian food store and the Star Market in Porter Square.
In retirement, Mr. O'Neill divided his time between a house in Harwich Port on Cape Cod and an apartment in Washington and spent some holidays at a condominium in Florida.
The Speaker's oldest son and namesake, Thomas P. O'Neill 3d, a former lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, is in public relations in Boston. Another son, Christopher, is a Washington lawyer, and a third, Michael, is in business in Cambridge. One daughter, Susan, has her own business in Washington, and another, Rosemary, is a political officer for the State Department. Mr. O'Neill is also survived by his wife and eight grandchildren. A family spokeswoman said the funeral would be held next Monday at St. John's Church in Cambridge, Reuters reported. On Saturday and Sunday, his body will lie in state in Boston's State House.
After suffering colon cancer, which led to a colostomy, Mr. O'Neill made public service advertisements in which he joined athletes and movie stars in talking candidly about having cancer.
Unlike some politicians who amassed a fortune, Mr. O'Neill retired from the Speakership in relatively modest circumstances. His book, "Man of the House," however, written with William Novak, became a best seller that made him financially secure. Mr. O'Neill also made commercials for a credit card company and a motel chain.
Mr. O'Neill's book was a treasure trove of stories, including some about his political campaign for the Cambridge City Council while he was a senior at Boston College. He finished ninth in a field of 60 candidates, of whom the top eight were elected.
The race taught him a lifelong lesson. He had not campaigned in his own neighborhood, which he had taken for granted and where he made a poor showing. In a post-mortem on the campaign, Mr. O'Neill's father told him what he had learned in a lifetime of politics: "All politics is local."

G.M. Forms China Joint Venture on Engine Parts

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 6

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation has formed a joint venture with a Chinese business and a Chinese Government-owned enterprise to make and sell engine-management systems in China, a G.M. executive said today.
G.M. already runs a $100 million joint venture to produce pickup trucks in northeastern China and is exploring a joint venture to build mini-vans there. Its parts division has already joined in ventures and signed licensing agreements with Chinese businesses to make and distribute spark plugs, wiring harnesses and other components. 
 G.M.'s parts-making operation, called the Automotive Components Group, has been trying to lower manufacturing costs and increase sales to companies outside G.M. Like other automotive suppliers, G.M. views China as a prime area for growth.
"This joint venture represents one more step in the A.C.G.'s efforts to invest in the growth of China and its emerging automotive market," J. T. Battenberg 3d, the vice president in charge of G.M.'s parts division, said in a statement announcing the joint venture. "A strong local automotive systems and components infrastructure will foster the rapid growth of the Chinese vehicle market."
 G.M. will put up 51 percent of the initial investment of $30 million in the new venture. The total investment could eventually reach $120 million.
At first, all components for the engine-management systems to be distributed by the joint venture will come from G.M. plants in North America, Europe and elsewhere in Asia, but G.M. said that up to 75 percent of the parts could eventually be fabricated in China. Acting together, these components control the flow of fuel and air into the engine, manage the combustion process and govern the exhaust.
While the joint venture has no customers yet, it is negotiating with several potential customers, including the G.M. truck venture, a G.M. spokesman said.
G.M.'s partners in the engine-parts project, which will be based in Beijing, are the Beijing Wan Yuan Industry Corporation and the Beijing Economic Technology Investment Development Corporation, which is controlled by the Beijing municipal government.
Wan Yuan, a subsidiary of the China Aerospace Corporation, develops and manufactures launching vehicles. It has collaborated with G.M.'s Hughes Electronics division to put communications satellites in orbit.
Mr. Battenberg also announced today the parts-operation's revenues for 1993. Total sales were $24.9 billion, compared with $23.6 billion in 1992.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
G.M. Has Profit for Year
 DETROIT, Jan. 6 (Reuters) -- John F. Smith Jr., the chief executive of General Motors, said today that the company earned its first profit in four years in 1993, and that he expected an even stronger year in 1994.
 "From an industry standpoint, 1993 was a good year and it was a good year for G.M.," Mr. Smith said. "It was a turnaround year for our North American operations. G.M. returned to profitability in total, and 1994 looks strong."
 Mr. Smith declined to say how much the company earned in 1993, but through the first nine months of the year it had net income of $1.3 billion, virtually assuring that it would end the year with a profit for the first time since 1989, when it earned $4.2 billion.
 Since 1989, G.M. has lost almost $30 billion, including a staggering $20 billion accounting charge for retiree health care benefits in 1992.
 Mr. Smith, who took over in late 1992 for Robert C. Stempel, the chairman who lost his job in a shake-up by the board, said G.M.'s directors had been "very supportive" of his efforts to turn the company around.
 "I think the board is quite pleased," Mr. Smith said. "We had a fantastic year for cash flow."
 He attributed G.M.'s success to a sharp change in attitudes toward Detroit's cars and to $2 billion in cost reductions by the company.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Visits Graves in Croatia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OVCARA, Croatia, Jan. 6

 BODY:
In one of several moves underscoring its determination to bring war criminals to justice in the former Yugoslavia, the Clinton Administration sent a Cabinet-rank official on a symbolic visit today to a grave here that is believed to hold the bodies of several hundred Croats massacred by Serbs.
On a more practical plain, that official, Madeleine K. Albright, the United States chief delegate to the United Nations, warned that the United States may use its Security Council veto to maintain the economic blockade of the Yugoslavian federation of Serbia and Montenegro until Belgrade hands over those accused of atrocities. 
 And John Shattuck, the Administration's chief human rights officer, announced that the United States will give $25 million more toward the expenses of the international tribunal set up to try them.
 
Graves at Garbage Dump
 On a mild winter day, Ms. Albright, Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck and Peter Galbraith, the Clinton Administration's Ambassador to Croatia, flew here in a white United Nations helicopter to spend about half an hour peering at an isolated scrub-covered garbage dump at the corner of a plowed field a few miles outside the town of Vukovar.
The site, now ringed by coils of shiny steel razor wire and guarded day and night by a platoon of armed Russian peacekeeping troops, is believed to contain the bodies of some 200 Croat patients who disappeared from Vukovar Hospital on Nov. 20, 1991, and were probably killed by the Serb forces who had just captured the town from the Croats after a fierce siege that reduced most of it to rubble.
Since its discovery in October 1992, when a test dig turned up the bodies of eight or nine Croats, all of them apparently shot, the local Serbian authorities, who have incorporated Vukovar into their breakaway state known as the Republic of Krajina, have systematically blocked the United Nations from digging up the rest of the grave area, although another attempt is to be made next April.
The Ovcara grave is one of 98 probable mass grave sites in the former Yugoslavia that have been identified by the War Crimes Commission the Security Council set up to start gathering evidence of atrocities. The graves are believed to hold thousands of victims of ethnic massacres by warring Serb, Muslim and Croat factions.
 
Stress on Rights Policy
 Ms. Albright said her reason for coming to the suspected grave now was to draw attention to the Clinton Administration's policy of advancing human rights and its determination to bring Yugoslav war criminals to justice before the tribunal the Security Council has set up in the Hague to judge them.
She called the grave "a symbol of the Yugoslavian war's inhumanity" and said it is "essential" that it be investigated by the war crimes tribunal. "It is a great tragedy that people end their lives in what is ultimately a garbage dump," she added.
At a meeting later in a decrepit office building in Vukovar with Goran Hadzic, president of Serbian Krajina, and Milan Ilic, head of its regional council, neither official questioned whether the grave really contained the victims of a massacre by Serbian forces.
Instead, they appeared anxious at the prospect of a war crimes investigation, accused the visiting Americans of not understanding "the history of the region" and played down the importance of the civil war in former Yugoslavia, saying the world has seen many wars in recent years.
 
Threat of U.N. Sanctions
 In a further strengthening of the Administration's support for the War Crimes Tribunal, Ms. Albright warned that the United States now favors Security Council sanctions against countries that do not cooperate with it either by refusing to surrender citizens accused of war crimes or by withholding evidence.
"In the issue of lifting sanctions, we believe that behavior vis-a-vis the War Crimes Tribunal must be considered," she said. "Withholding evidence or obstruction of justice or blocking aid are all appropriate issues for the tribunal."
On Wednesday at a briefing by United Nations relief workers here, she was told that only about 40 percent of needed supplies are being allowed through to those in difficulty in Bosnia and Herzegovina this winter, in large measure because of Serbian obstruction.
The emphasis the Clinton Administration is now putting on building up the war crimes tribunal appears to be an attempt to rescue an institution that many thought would fade into oblivion because it would never be able arrest suspects.
But American officials now argue that the Administration's support for the tribunal is part of a "twin track" approach to ending the conflict in former Yugoslavia that aids the process of national reconciliation between the rival ethnic factions.
 
Identifying the Guilty
 According to this view, identifying and prosecuting those responsible for atrocities will show that only a limited number of people are involved. Fixing the responsibility on individuals, it is argued, will prevent the ethnic groups from blaming the other for its sufferings for generations to come.
But the American enthusiasm for tracking down war criminals is not shared to the same extent by many European countries, such as Britain and France, which fear it may complicate the search for peace, which they see as their top priority.
For this reason, European countries tend to feel that war-crimes investigations and trials should come after peace has been agreed and not before.
And they have been reluctant so far to share evidence of such crimes they have collected with the tribunal's prosecutors.
The United States as well has rejected a request by the United Nations to send military engineers to help dig up evidence of war crimes, maintaining that such a step would put American soldiers at risk.
While the main emphasis of Ms. Albright's two-day visit here, the start of a tour of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, has been on war crimes, officials say she has also warned President Franjo Tudjman that his army's growing involvement in the Bosnian conflict is a source of concern to the Clinton Administration and that she hopes there will be "no more high-level discussions" in the United States Government about imposing Security Council sanctions against Croatia.
With the international mediators now scheduled to reconvene their peace talks in Geneva on Jan. 18, Muslim forces are seizing land from the Croats in central Bosnia, and the Zagreb Government is reported to have sent some 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers as well as dozens of tanks to stiffen Croatian resistance there.

A Talk With Ginsburg On Life and the Court

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
New Supreme Court Justices customarily introduce themselves to the Court family -- the 300 or so people who work in the building -- by granting an interview to the Docket Sheet, a newsletter published for Court employees.
It was a relaxed and reflective Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who answered questions from Toni House, the Court's public information officer, and Kathleen L. Arberg, the editor of Docket Sheet. The result was a lively, informative interview, in some ways more revealing of the new Justice's approach to work and life than her days of cautious testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last summer. 
 Excerpts from the interview, which took place in October and was published this week, appear below.
One bit of Court jargon requires translation: Justice Ginsburg's reference to "cert. petitions" and the "cert. pool." Cert. petitions are legal briefs that initiate a Supreme Court appeal, known technically as a petition for a writ of certiorari. Eight of the nine Justices -- all but Justice John Paul Stevens -- assign their law clerks to a pool that divides the work of reading and summarizing the thousands of petitions that reach the Court each term.
The cert. pool has come under criticism recently from Court critics, who assert that the process makes the Justices too reliant on their clerks for the important work of deciding which cases to hear. Justice Ginsburg quite clearly had that criticism in mind when she described her approach to picking cases. LINDA GREENHOUSE
Q. Has becoming a Supreme Court Justice changed your life?
A. Yes, indubitably, yes. Have you seen Sally Potter's film "Orlando"? It's based on a novel by Virginia Woolf. The principal character spends a few centuries as a man, and then wakes up one morning to find she's a woman. She looks at herself in the mirror and says, "Same person, just another sex." But her life becomes totally different because she's a woman instead of a man, although inside she is the same person.
That's what has happened to me. I have gone about my business as a very private person, as a law teacher, even as an advocate for women's rights. Now people recognize me in shops, even in movie theaters. Someone recently remarked to my husband, "Your wife reads her mail by flashlight in the movies." True enough, we went to our local movie house not long ago, and while we were waiting for the feature film to begin -- I don't care much for commercials and previews -- I did take out the day's mail and a flashlight. No one would have paid any attention to my compulsion to save time before.
Q. What is your daily routine like on a day when the Court is not sitting?
A. On most days, I am chained to my desk, but I expect to have a more flexible routine in time. A lot of the Court's work is new to me. One part of the job that's entirely new, and is particularly challenging, is the cert. petition review.
Some people outside the Court seem to think the cert. pool makes it all a piece of cake -- that the Justices simply read and follow what the law clerks recommend. But, to quote Sportin' Life, "It ain't necessarily so." We read pool memos with care and the judgment that comes with experience. And when in doubt, we do read the petitions and responses.
The law clerks are highly intelligent, very able, uncommonly diligent. They save us hours upon hours of labor. But most of them are also young and in need of the seasoning that experiences in life and in law practice afford. Whenever I think a case may be cert. worthy, I will do the homework required and will not rely solely on a pool memorandum.
Q. What characteristics do you think make a judge a good one?
A. It's important to be secure in your own judgment, to be ready to make decisions and not look back. Some of the best legal minds are not the best judges because they're constantly rethinking a position and won't let an opinion go. A judge should have the attitude, "I can resolve this as well as, or probably better than the next person. I'm as comfortable as one should be making the decision, and I'm not going to worry about it constantly after I've made it."
Q. An unprecedented step you've taken is agreed to a flexible schedule for one of your law clerks. What made you decide to do that?
A. You have in mind David Post. David clerked for me in the D.C. Circuit. I'm very grateful he was willing to come back to help me this first year. When I received his application for a clerkship several years ago, he explained he was attending Georgetown at night rather than in the day because his wife, an economist, had a demanding job, so he attended to the children in the morning and early afternoon.
I thought, "This is my dream of the way the world should be." When fathers take equal responsibility for the care of their children, that's when women will truly be liberated. I was so pleased to see that there are indeed men who are doing a parent's work, men who do not regard that as strange. People like David, I hope, will be role models for other men who may be fearful they won't succeed in their profession if they spend time caring for their children, or are concerned they will be thought of as less than a man if family is of prime importance.
More than anything else, I believe, the acceptance of full parental responsibility by men will make things genuinely equal for women. Women will have truly equal opportunity when men accept responsibility for raising children to the same extent that women do. Is that an impossible dream? I don't think so. The fact that there are people like David Post in the world encourages me.

HEADLINE: Retailers' December Sales Solid

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
Most major retailers reported yesterday that their sales rose during December, though the range was very broad, from 13.3 percent at Sears, Roebuck for stores open at least a year to 1.1 percent at Kmart.
But underneath those higher sales was an enormous amount of price-cutting and promotions, which took a toll on profit margins.
 Everywhere, the theme was value, value, value. 
 "Shoppers are very price-conscious," said Duncan Muir, a J. C. Penney spokesman at the company's headquarters in Dallas. "An item has to be good quality, and fashionable, but it's when the price is right that they buy." Mr. Muir noted that Penney spent $60 million on advertising during the Christmas season alone to draw shoppers to its promotions.
 
Rise in Salomon Index
 Same-store sales are generally regarded as the best measure of retailing performance, because they exclude new stores that often do well but have not demonstrated any sustained performance. Salomon Brothers said its retail index, a weighted average of the monthly comparable-store sales of 22 major retailers, rose 4.3 percent, a substantial improvement on the 2.9 percent gain in November but well below December 1992, when the index rose 7.4 percent.
Of course, December 1992 was marked by a burst of consumer confidence in the period between the election of President Clinton and his inauguration, built on modest signs of an improving economy.
Most retailers begin their fiscal year on Feb. 1, so full-year returns will not be available for several weeks.
 
Strong Sales in 'Hard Goods'
 As had been the case much of the year, stores whose main business is what retailers call "hard goods" -- appliances, tools, furniture -- generally had a good month, while those that sell "soft goods" like apparel and bedding fared worse. Yet everywhere there were exceptions, like Penney, whose main business is apparel but whose same-store sales rose 10 percent in December.
Looking ahead, Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers, said he was cautiously optimistic while acknowledging "the tax increases will hurt."
Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence, also said he expected retailers to enjoy a strong first quarter compared with last year, partly because of "good economic momentum" and also because "last March was wiped out by the snowstorms."
Yet Mr. Edelman stands apart from the chorus chanting "value shopping."
"Department store sales were stronger than we thought, and at discount stores, apparel was weaker than store averages," he said. "And apparel stores were weak, too. In spite of what everyone says about value, the customers wound up shopping at the department stores."
The strongest performance of any major chain came at Sears, Roebuck & Company, whose turnaround continued after years of slippage. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, said same-store sales rose 4 percent for the month.
At the Limited, a chain of apparel shops, same-store sales fell 1 percent, while at Gap Inc., same-store sales rose 4 percent.
The tension between increased sales and slipping profit margins was demonstrated yesterday in consumer electronics. Circuit City Stores said its December sales exceeded expectations but that it planned to cut prices in 1994 because of increased competition. That sent its stock tumbling, and it closed down 20 percent, or $4.50 a share, at $17.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Backs Loan Program For Broadway

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has pledged to create a new state-financed program of loans for the repair and upkeep of Broadway theaters, whose owners have complained for more than a decade about government indifference.
With that -- although not as a quid pro quo, according to the official line -- two of Broadway's major theater owners dropped their opposition to the Walt Disney Company's plans to take over the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street, clearing away a high political hurdle faced by the project. 
 After years of feeling that the state and city governments were ignoring their economic plight, Broadway owners were outraged last year when they learned that Disney might receive a low-interest construction loan from the state to help reconstruct the badly deteriorated New Amsterdam for live entertainment.
But after Mr. Cuomo announced his loan plan for the Broadway theaters, one critic of the Disney project, Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, said: "We are now a non-objectant to the Disney proposal. And we hope that it will regenerate and stimulate the development of 42d Street."
 
To Preserve Commercial Theater
 Mr. Cuomo said the new loan program would be "dedicated to preserving commercial theater on Broadway." The director of economic development for New York State, Vincent Tese, said yesterday that the program, whose details are still sketchy, would provide the "capital improvements necessary to make sure that the structures are well maintained and keep their historic character in good condition."
Although details have yet to be worked out, the program may begin with $1 million being made available by the State Urban Development Corporation, of which Mr. Tese is chairman and chief executive.
"It's an important moment for theater in New York," said Jack L. Goldstein, special assistant to Ron Silver, the president of Actors' Equity Association. "I think it marks a new partnership."
Mr. Schoenfeld made his opposition public at a hearing before the Urban Development Corporation in November. He suggested that Disney was gaining an unfair advantage in offering "legitimate attractions that would otherwise be presented in non-subsidized theaters."
Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, had also objected to the Disney subsidy. Together, they control two dozen Broadway houses. The Nederlander Organization made no public comment then, and its executives could not be reached yesterday for comment.
Mr. Schoenfeld applauded Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Tese yesterday for having endorsed a "comprehensive plan for the long-term preservation" of Broadway's commercial theater, which the industry has been advocating since 1984.
Mr. Schoenfeld said the loan program "would be a sort of quasi-equivalent for the low-interest loan fund that Disney was receiving, although not in the same amount at first."
"It's a significant recognition of the need for such a long-term plan," he said.
 
Queasy About Competitors
 Mr. Tese said Broadway theater owners have "always been queasy about having a competitor" on 42d Street. But that was not what prompted the idea of starting a loan program, he said.
"They went through a litany of problems," Mr. Tese said: "the way they've been misunderstood, the way they've not been helped, the way they've been taken for granted by the city and state."
"The truth of the matter is -- after they went through the litany -- I felt to a certain extent that they had a case," Mr. Tese said. "They're an important part of the cultural and economic fabric of New York, and we should do everything in our power to see that they are prosperous and healthy."
Theatrical unions have welcomed the prospect of Disney's bringing live entertainment back to the New Amsterdam, Mr. Goldstein said.
 
No Better Amusement Partner
 "The key to revitalization of 42d Street is a serious marketing effort to bring in entertainment, retail and tourist- and resident-related amusement enterprises," he said. "If I were to reach out in the universe of available partners, I could not come up with a better one than Disney."
The prospect of Disney's turning the New Amsterdam into what Mr. Cuomo called a "showcase theater" is one of several developments in the long-delayed rejuvenation of 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. In his annual message to the Legislature on Wednesday the Governor also mentioned a "modern version of Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum with electronic exhibits."
The plan also includes the retail rehabilitation of existing buildings that were to have been demolished to make way for four giant office towers. Construction of the skyscrapers has been postponed indefinitely.
A Disney spokesman at its Burbank, Calif., headquarters said the company had no comment on the New Amsterdam project.

Treasuries Up on Reich's Jobs Remark

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities traded sharply higher yesterday, and interest rates fell after remarks by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich were interpreted as indicating that data on payroll employment for December, which are due out today, would show job growth below expectations.
Arousing the ire of a number of economists, Mr. Reich, who was in Washington participating via satellite in a television forum in Paris, responded to a questioner seeking an indication of what the December employment numbers would show. 
 He said that while he could not tell exactly what the numbers would be, he thought they would show "employment rising, probably in the area of another 160,000 to 200,000" jobs.
 
Lower Than Forecast
 That figure was lower than most forecasts, and bond traders seized on the remark as an indication that the economic expansion remained moderate and would not rekindle inflation, which erodes the value of debt securities. Bond prices had been battered earlier this week on fears that the economy would pick up speed too fast and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to counter possible inflation.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 23/32 , to 98 24/32 , and its yield fell to 6.34 percent, from 6.40 percent Wednesday. Short-term interest rates also declined moderately. The declines helped lift stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing above 3,800 for the first time. [Page D4.]
Although Mr. Reich's remark prompted traders to buy bonds, it also stirred the wrath of a number of Wall Street economists, who complained to the Labor Department.
"In our opinion, a person in his position should be saying nothing about the employment report this close to the release date," Stephen Slifer, chief financial economist at Lehman Brothers, wrote in a commentary distributed to the firm's customers yesterday.
Mary Meagher, a spokeswoman for the Labor Secretary, said Mr. Reich was merely repeating what he thought was the consensus forecast of private analysts.
"He did not know what the number was and gave his own estimate based on other public information and past data," she said.
 
Only White House Knows
 The Labor Department said only the White House, not Mr. Reich, received the numbers ahead of their early morning release, which is usually on the first Friday after the end of the month in the report. The jobs report is the first significant economic report of the previous month.
Some hard data were released yesterday, however. The Government said new applications for jobless benefits last week increased by a stronger-than-expected 70,000, to 363,000, from a revised 293,000 the week before, which was shortened by the Chirstmas Eve holiday.
But economists and credit market traders dismissed the surge as an aberration, saying the holidays and other factors made the report an unreliable indicator.
More important will be today's jobs report. Some estimates of jobs growth last month are as high as 300,000. Market participants have been preoccupied all week with the jobs number because they hope to get a clue in the December economy of whether the fourth quarter's momentum will be strong enough to carry into the 1994 first quarter.
 
Inflation Threat Denied
 Secretary Reich contended there was no inflation threat in the United States and thus "no need for a tightening of monetary policy."
Dennis M. Bushe, a managing director at Prudential Investment Advisers in charge of fixed income funds, said the importance of Mr. Reich's remarks was magnified by the bond market's skittishness all week. "Every day this week has been a seesaw," he said.
Today's employment number "will set the tone of the market for the next couple of weeks," Mr. Bushe added. "The issues in the market are: Will the Fed act now and make a pre-emptive strike against inflation, which has been behaving itself, or will the economy slow in the first quarter with no need for the Fed to act immediately?"
At the Treasury's one-year bill auction yesterday, investor demand was strong and the average rate was 3.52 percent. Noncompetitive bids totaled an impressive $568 million, well above typical one-year bill auctions.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction:

HEADLINE: Giuliani Instructs Agencies To Cut Spending 1 Percent

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Facing a gap in next year's budget estimated to exceed $2 billion, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has ordered most New York City agencies to cut spending by 1 percent immediately.
And to insure that he wrestles spending under control, Mr. Giuliani has imposed what he called "a strict monitoring system" that requires agency heads whose spending goes over budget to meet with the budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, or Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers to explain why. Anyone whose agency's spending rises more than 2 percent will have to explain the reasons to the Mayor himself. 
 The spending reductions -- ordered by Mr. Giuliani in a letter on Wednesday to each of the city's commissioners and directors of other agencies -- will pare $75 million from the current budget, which ends in June, Mr. Lackman said.
Trimming all city services except for the police and fire departments and the school system by 2 percent over a full year should also save about $150 million in next year's budget, which Mr. Giuliani and his aides are now drafting.
"It's a sizable down payment," said Mr. Lackman, who is assembling the options for closing the $2 billion budget gap without the politically troubling cuts in service that the Mayor has promised to avoid.
By imposing a rigid review process, Mr. Giuliani clearly intends to be deeply involved not only in making the city's budget but also in overseeing the spending of each agency.
In the letter, Mr. Giuliani said that similar reviews would be conducted every three months from now on to help to insure that agencies keep spending within the budget.
"It's a message to the commissioners that this Mayor wants to get control of this budget," Mr. Lackman said. "And you can't wait till next year. You have to start right away."
 
No 'Border Wars'
 Mr. Giuliani also met yesterday with Governor-elect Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, and together they pledged to help improve the region's economy by ending the "border wars" that have erupted between the city and its neighbor over jobs, commuter taxes and sports teams.
Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Whitman offered no details on initiatives or agreements on any of the issues that have divided the city and state, particularly taxes on commuters. But after their brief meeting at City Hall, they agreed that outright hostilities, especially over luring companies and their jobs, had proved only harmful.
"Our competition right now in the State of New Jersey is not New York," said Ms. Whitman, who is to take the oath as Governor on Jan. 18. "We are here in a region with New York. It behooves us to have a strong region. Our competition right now is with North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas."
It remains to be seen whether amity between Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Whitman -- two Republicans who ousted Democrats last fall on campaign platforms that promised economic turnarounds -- can bridge the deep divisions that have existed, and any spirit of cooperation will surely undergo strain when their often contradictory interests arise.
Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Whitman said they would establish a formal relationship between their offices, with regular meetings, like the alliance Mr. Giuliani has already established with the county executives of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland.
Their meeting, though, indicated that in some respects at least, relations between the city and New Jersey had improved. When asked whether the bidding wars over corporate giants would continue, Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Whitman acknowledged that there would always be some disagreements.
"What it means," Mr. Giuliani said, "is that maybe that game isn't as tough as it was before."
 
Freeze on Hiring
 Mr. Giuliani's letter to city agencies also included his order to agencies to stop hiring new employees unless those hirings are approved by the highest mayoral deputies. Mr. Lackman has also asked commissioners and directors to draw up plans to reduce their budgets for next year by 5 percent or 10 percent.
If needed, those cuts will be included in the budget now being drafted. After receiving an extension from the City Council on Monday, Mr. Giuliani must submit a preliminary financial plan by Feb. 1.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 5.06 to Reach Record Close of 3,803.88

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average eked out another record high in hectic trading yesterday, closing above 3,800 for the first time.
Helped by a drop in interest rates, the Dow rose 5.06 points, to 3,803.88, eclipsing Wednesday's record of 3,798.82. 
 Despite the Dow's record close, many analysts said they were not that impressed with the market's performance. Gains were not broad-based: On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,076 issues rose in price, but 1,054 declined.
"Normally, when you have more than 1,000 stocks gaining ground, it's a great day," Larry Wachtel, a vice president at Prudential Securities Inc., said. "But right now, the Dow is an average that is getting in the way of a rotation of ownership. And the enormous volume you are seeing represents money managers choosing up sides."
 
Heavy Trading Week
 There were 367.9 million shares that traded hands on the Big Board yesterday, bringing total volume for the week to more than 1.37 billion shares traded.
Barring some sort of calamity today, volume for the week will almost certainly be the second most active in the history of the exchange, exceeding the 1.55 billion shares that changed hands during the week of Nov. 5, 1993. But it is unlikely that volume will come anywhere close to the 2.3 billion shares traded during the week of Oct. 23, 1987, when the stock market crashed.
"The volume is extraordinary, and is a tribute to the huge amount of money that is in mutual funds, pension funds and other sources being pushed through the market," David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said. "But I view this as being a little bit negative, because we are getting all this volume and the market is going nowhere."
 
Nasdaq Index Up 2.36 Points
 Among broader market averages, the Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.43 point, to 467.12. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose by 0.21 point, to 479.00. And the Nasdaq's composite index was up 2.36 points, to 780.41.
Though the market appeared to be moving sideways yesterday, there were stocks that went places.
Led by railroad stocks, the Dow's transportation index soared by 23.38 points, to a record 1,802.21.
Among transportation issues, Union Pacific gained 1 3/4, to 66 3/8. Burlington Northern gained 1 3/4, to 58 3/4. And the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, rose 1 1/8, to 69 7/8.
Leading the 30 issues that make up the Dow were Allied Signal, up 1, to 77 1/2; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose 1 1/2, to 107 1/4, and American Telephone and Telegraph, up 1 1/8, to 53 3/4.
 
Retail Stocks Fall
 Some retailing stocks were among the session's biggest losers, as investors dumped shares of companies whose performance in December and stated prospects for the new year failed to meet expectations.
The losers included Circuit City Stores, which fell 4 1/2, to 17 5/8, after the electronics retailer reported that while December sales exceeded expectations, it saw the coming year as being increasingly competitive. The stock was the Big Board's most active of the day. Investors also sold Best Buy, which fell 7 1/2, to 39 3/4, on heavy volume after the electronics retailer posted its December results.
But Gap Inc.'s sales performance last month was good, and its stock rose 3 1/8, to 41 1/2.
Newspaper and publishing stocks continued to do well, with the Washington Post Company's B shares showing considerable strength.
The stock closed up 20 3/4, to 282 1/4. Early in the session, the New York Stock Exchange briefly suspended trading to ask Post management why the stock was rising so strongly. The company said it had no announcements planned.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Yen Slide Cheers Business in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 6

 BODY:
After a year in which "endaka" -- the rise of the yen -- struck fear into Japan's leading industries, the Japanese currency is now in retreat.
The strengthening of the dollar against the yen since the dollar's historic low point in August, amounting to a rise of more than 12 percent, could lead to improved profits for Japan's automobile and electronics giants and help pave the way for a slow but eventual recovery of the stagnant Japanese economy, company officials and economists suggest.
 
Toyota Now Sees Profit
 Last summer, for instance, when currency rates had fallen to just above 100 yen to the dollar, the Toyota Motor Company said it might report its first operating loss ever. But with the dollar having risen, Tatsuro Toyoda, the company's president, recently reaffirmed that the company now expects a small operating profit in the current fiscal year ending June 30. 
 The one cloud hanging over this outlook for Japan is the possibility that the United States will intervene in the market to make the yen stronger to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen raised such fears on Wednesday when he said that allowing the yen to decline would not be an acceptable way for Japan to try to escape from its recession.
The comment had some effect. In Tokyo trading today, the dollar slipped to 112.65 yen from 113.12 yen Wednesday. Later in New York, it eased to 112.60 yen, from 113.07 on Wednesday. Still, it is up substantially from the record low of 100.40 yen reached last August and also up significantly from about 108 yen a month ago. It is still down, however, from 125 yen at the beginning of last year.
Economists say that aside from the political factors, the dollar has been gaining because the American economy appears to be getting stronger, especially in comparison with the Japanese economy.
The changing trade situation is also helping. Last year, the yen rose in part because United States officials indicated they would like to see a stronger yen to help trim Japan's huge trade surplus. Recent monthly figures suggest that Japan's trade surplus with the world, although not yet with the United States, is starting to fall.
 
Dollar Seen at 115 Yen
 Economists have been saying the dollar could continue rising against the yen until it reaches the 115 to 120 range. But traders say Secretary Bentsen's comments could make it hard for the dollar to get much above 115 because the currency market would fear American intervention at that point.
Another factor is that the trade talks between the United States and Japan are not making much progress. If that remains true, approaching Feb. 11, when President Clinton is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan, the yen could be bid up on speculation that the United States will again resort to using the strong yen as a weapon.
Even without political considerations, there is a difference of opinion as to how the currency exchange ratios will move in the long run.
Robert Alan Feldman, director of economic research for Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said that Japan's trade surplus was still very large, which would put upward pressure on the yen. "It's very hard to get the yen to stay on a weakening path for much longer than a couple of months," he said.
But Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, disagreed, arguing that the dollar had begun a sustained climb that would last two to three years and bring it above 130 yen.
"The economic backdrop is absolutely unequivocal -- a stronger dollar," he said. "It's breaking out of the downtrend that the dollar's been on against the yen since 1990."
 
Export Profits Sag
 As the dollar sank last year, Japanese export-dependent companies saw their revenues and profits drop sharply because their products became less competitive abroad, while foreign products became more competitive in Japan's market. Furthermore, the Japanese sales that were made abroad became worth less when converted into yen.
Companies responded by shifting manufacturing offshore, importing more foreign components or finished products to Japan and raising prices on exports. Economists and company executives say it is still too early to consider reversing any of those steps. Because of high costs for land, labor and materials in Japan, it still makes sense to import parts and to shift manufacturing offshore.
Toyota, for instance, just raised prices by an average of 1.8 percent on cars sold in the United States to account for the yen's appreciation last year, and there is no plan to lower prices now. "We do not decide according to temporary fluctuations of the yen," a spokesman said.
 
Industry Favors 115 Yen
 "If the yen comes down to 115, the majority of Japanese industry would be quite happy with that," said Toru Kusukawa, chairman of the Fuji Research Institute, last month.
Yukio Ozawa, deputy general manager of investor relations for the Sony Corporation, said the company made its profit predictions for this fiscal year assuming 105 yen to the dollar. As a result of the dollar's recent rise, sales and operating profits might come in better than expected, although pretax earnings are not likely to change much because the company had hedged against currency fluctuations, he said.
But Mr. Ozawa said that more important than any short-term impact on reported earnings was the impact on the general economy.
"Psychologically, it's very helpful to us," he said. "The sentiment of top management in Japan may be a little brighter and the general consumer might also loosen their spending a little bit," he said.

Dollar Up Against Mark
 By Reuters
 The dollar climbed against leading European currencies yesterday, reaching a five-month high against the German mark on expectations for brisk American economic growth in the coming months.
The dollar rose to 1.7462 marks, its highest level since August, before closing in New York at 1.7453 marks, up from 1.7395 marks late Wednesday. The British pound, meanwhile, slipped to $1.4815, from $1.4870.

HEADLINE: Workers Redirect Their Kindness to Help the Neediest

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
For decades, lawyers at the small Manhattan firm of Pulvers, Pulvers, Thompson & Kutner celebrated the holidays by giving gifts to the people who helped make their lives easier, such as paralegals, court reporters and secretaries.
But since 1986, the firm's 11 lawyers have redirected the money they would have spent on scarves, cologne or liquor, and instead have written a check to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. This year they gave $700. 
 Patrice M. Pulvers, a partner in the firm, said the lawyers abandoned traditional gifts because they believed that the former recipients would rather see the money used to help those in need. "We all live and work here," Ms. Pulvers said yesterday. "And we all know when we look around that it's a city that needs our help."
 
Establishing a Tradition
 Around the city, at law firms, brokerage houses, medical practices and countless other businesses, hundreds of people have established similar traditions, forgoing gifts to each other or to their clients in order to help the Neediest Cases Fund reach the homeless, disabled and elderly.
The fund, which is conducting its 82d annual appeal for contributions through Feb. 28, was created in 1912 with the idea that New Yorkers would help the poor in their city if they were made aware of the dire conditions. All contributions go directly to seven social-services agencies because The Times pays all overhead.
The campaign has raised $3,009,953.85 this year, nearly $100,000 more than at the same time last year. The money helps the charities, whose resources are already stretched thin, to provide needy New Yorkers with more of the most basic necessities such as winter coats, hot meals, dental care and temporary shelter.
While fewer individual contributions have been received -- 7,692 compared with 8,198 at this time last year -- donors have reached deeper into their pockets despite the lingering effects of the economic downturn in the New York region. But the fund still lags behind the level of its most successful campaign in 1991-1992, when more than $5 million was raised.
For more than a decade, the employees in the asset management and business development divisions at the United States Trust Company of New York have used their collective power to help. This year, instead of exchanging holiday cards, the employees contributed 37 checks for the Neediest Cases Fund, raising $1,150.
 
Bake Sales and Odd Jobs
 Other companies and groups that contribute range from large financial concerns like Sterling Group, a marketing and design consulting firm in Manhattan that gave $500, to smaller companies like Cityproof Corporation, a window-installation company in Queens.
"As we go through our daily routine and deal with our everyday problems, we often lose sight of those who are less fortunate than ourselves," wrote Michael Damelin of Cityproof, in a letter with the company's $100 donation.
Sometimes the fund-raising efforts are made by groups of donors who have not yet entered the business world and must rely more on elbow grease and baking savoir-faire than on financial clout.
The 15 students in Elizabeth Block's fourth-grade class at Rye Country Day School in Rye, N.Y., gave $227.10 after they held a bake sale and collected money by doing odd jobs at home.
"Some of the jobs were cleaning rooms, folding wash, cooking, cleaning our parents' offices, shoveling away ice, baby-sitting, watering plants and back rubs," the students wrote. "We hope you will make good use of our money."

HEADLINE: Whitman's Right-Hand Woman in Trenton;
Hazel F. Gluck, Lobbyist, Friend and Political Pro, Has No Office but Plenty of Power

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
In the summer of 1992, two old friends, both political pros, finally found time for a long-promised lunch together.
"Right away I asked Christie, 'Are you going to run for governor?' And she said, 'Yes,' " Hazel Frank Gluck recalled the other day. 
 "And then Christie asked, 'Are you going to run?' and I said, 'No. I want you to be the next governor.' "
Hazel Gluck reflected and smiled, "It was the best choice I ever made."
As almost every schoolboy (and schoolgirl) knows, Christine Todd Whitman went on to defeat Jim Florio for New Jersey governor. Her good friend Hazel may have swallowed her own ambitions, but now her fortunes are soaring as well.
 
No. 2 Woman, No. 1 Lobbyist
 Though largely unknown outside her state, Hazel Gluck has probably become the second most influential woman in New Jersey politics. She will go to the Whitman inauguration on Jan. 18 as a kind of godmother to the New Jersey Republican women's movement. She has served as co-chairwoman of both Mrs. Whitman's campaign and her transition office, having a major hand in the new Governor's cabinet appointments. And without question Ms. Gluck will enjoy the best access and greatest influence among all Trenton's thronging lobbyists.
"Has it helped my business? Absolutely." That is how Ms. Gluck describes the impact of Mrs. Whitman's victory on the fortunes of Public Policy Advisers Inc., the lobbying firm that Ms. Gluck founded in 1989 after weighing but rejecting a run for governor.
To Ms. Gluck's way of thinking, it took guts for a Republican woman to set out in the influence business at such an inauspicious time -- even someone as accomplished in state government as she. New Jersey was in deep recession, Mr. Florio had crushed his Republican opponent and Democrats controlled both houses of the Legislature.
Now, of course, Mr. Florio is the goner, and the men and women that Ms. Gluck has helped pick for the Whitman cabinet will soon be measuring the walls of imposing offices for portraits of their families and political friends. They include her former partner, Judith Shaw, as the new Governor's chief of staff.
 
Clients Tramp the Stairs
 Since the election, clients and would-be clients have been tramping the narrow stairs to Ms. Gluck's second-floor office suite in a refurbished brownstone next to the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy. Casino operators, garbage haulers, land developers want to enlist the friend of the Governor. State House Democrats say Ms. Gluck is telling people she will bill a million dollars in fees during her friend's first year in office.
So far, Ms. Gluck's firm is still a small one. Her clients reported paying Public Policy Advisers $82,102 for lobbying at the state level in 1992, according to a compilation of lobbying spending for the last available reporting period by New Jersey Common Cause, the government reform group. (That amount excludes what she earned from lobbying local governments and public relations work.)
By contrast, the biggest lobbying firm, Harold L. Hodes's Public Strategies Inc., was paid $1.7 million in 1992, and Roger A. Bodman's Impact Inc. received $1.2 million for state-level lobbying.
 
A Shadow Government
 Ms. Gluck is by no means the only lobbyist on Mrs. Whitman's 300-member transition team. Last month, The Record of Hackensack counted 36 registered lobbyists on the Governor-elect's panel, including Deborah T. Poritz, whom Mrs. Whitman has chosen to be her Attorney General, and Judith Shaw, the new chief of staff.
Like Ms. Gluck, many of these Whitman advisers are alumni of the Kean administration. During the Florio years, they became an informal shadow government in law firms, academia and lobbying concerns. But no one else acquired the reputation for decisiveness and dependability that Ms. Gluck now enjoys.
"You just don't stop Hazel," said former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who promoted Ms. Gluck up a ladder of progressively more challenging jobs during his administration in the 1980's. "She has no hesitation. Whether it's a union leader or a legislator or whoever happens to be standing in the way, she comes right at them."
"It sort of surprises them sometimes," Mr. Kean added and chuckled at the recollection.
Ms. Gluck, then married to a pediatrician, got her start in politics in the early 1970's when she won appointment as head of Ocean County's first Office of Consumer Affairs. Within five years, she had become head of the County Board of Freeholders that had appointed her. In 1979, she won a seat in the Assembly. Defeated in a campaign for the Senate in 1981, the year Mr. Kean won his first term, she became the new Governor's Lottery Director. The key to the position was learning and promoting new games; in three years under Ms. Gluck, the young agency increased its revenues to $900,000 a year from $500,000.
 
Patience and a Big Room
 In 1984, Mr. Kean, facing a crisis in municipal liability coverage, made her Insurance Commissioner. Insurance rates were soaring, and some townships could get no coverage at all. Ms. Gluck imposed order on the chaos by using her favorite management tools: patience and a meeting room big enough for all sides to sit down together.
Where she really established her reputation as a trouble-shooter and Kean insider was in her next job as head of the giant Transportation Department. The Transportation Trust Fund, a major source of financing for roads and bridges, was almost depleted. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority was bulling through a plan to widen the interstate without so much as a by-your-leave from Trenton.
"You could see that Tom Kean grew to rely on Hazel for more and more difficult jobs," said Donald T. DiFranceso, the Senate majority leader. "She was lottery commissioner, which is not necessarily a very heavy lift. Then she went to Insurance, which has always been a tough job, and then she went to Transportation, which is a huge department."
Ms. Gluck shepherded a 2.5 cent gasoline tax through the Legislature to replenish the trust fund, and she spearheaded a Kean program to make cabinet members ex-officio members of all state authorities, a step that helped rein in the Turnpike Authority. As a kind of parting gift, Mr. Kean appointed Ms. Gluck to one of New Jersey's seats on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a term that expired in July.
 
Sticking to Her Business
 Had she wished, Ms. Gluck said, she might have parlayed Mrs. Whitman's sponsorship into becoming the first woman to head the Port Authority. But she said she had rejected the idea of new state appointments in favor of sticking to her business.
Ms. Gluck acknowledges a muted but distinct feminist consciousness in the new Whitman administration, more rooted in pride than ideology. She often refers to Mrs. Whitman as "New Jersey's first female governor," and in an interview, she described the state Republican Party, which is broadly progressive on social issues and distinctly in favor of abortion rights, as a natural home for women.
Indeed, Republicans are quick to say that the state G.O.P., with its roots in suburban township councils, school boards and volunteer agencies, has done far better at promoting women than the Democrats. Mr. Kean elevated more women, Ms. Gluck prominent among them, to high places in his administration than Mr. Florio did. In the legislature, Republican women outnumber their Democratic sisters 12 to 2.
Now long divorced and her two children grown, Ms. Gluck pours on the hours at the office on East State Street. Her client list includes dozens of companies seeking contracts or regulatory advice or help with permits from state agencies. They include K. Hovnanian Companies of New Jersey (the state's largest home builder), the Exxon, Mobil and Texaco corporations (who face environmental and land use constraints), and National Waste Disposal, a garbage hauler in one of the most tightly regulated markets in the country.
Ms. Gluck's firm also represents the G-Tech Corporation, a maker of lottery equipment, which is embroiled in a fight with Automatic Wagering International over a $100 million state contract for lottery computers. Automatic Wagering, which is represented by Roger Bodman, another lobbyist on the Whitman transition team, has protested that G-Tech is going to win the contract even though G-Tech's bid was higher than its own. The lottery commission has put off announcing the award until Jan. 20, two days after the Whitman inauguration.
 
Choosing Clients Carefully
 Ms. Gluck said that she always chose her clients carefully and had raised her level of vigilance even higher since Mrs. Whitman's election.
"I've had trash haulers come in here with a list of violations as long as their arms and say 'We want you to save our souls,' " Ms. Gluck laughed. "I won't do it."
Ms. Gluck is buying out Judith Shaw's interest in the lobbying firm, to remove any chance of the sort of conflict that touched Mr. Florio when his chief of staff, Joseph Salema, became embroiled in charges of conflict of interest with a business partner seeking state contracts.
"I am not going to take any clients who are in opposition to Christie's policies," Ms. Gluck vowed. "And I'm not going to do anything to embarrass Judy, and I'm not going to do anything to embarrass the first female governor of this state. And I sure as hell am not going to do anything that would embarrass me."

HEADLINE: Jobless Filing Up for Week

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits jumped by 70,000 last week, to the highest level in more than five months, the Labor Department said today.
But economists dismissed the surge as an aberration and said the economic expansion remained on track. They said the holidays and other factors made the report an unreliable indicator of the job market's health at the end of the year. 
 A more accurate picture of the economy is likely to emerge on Friday, when the December employment report is released. The report is expected to show a large rise in payroll jobs last month.
Initial claims for benefits rose to 363,000 in the week that ended on Saturday from a revised 293,000 the previous week, after adjusting for seasonal factors. The department previously said the claims figure for the week ending Dec. 25 was 291,000.
The number of claims last week was the highest since 395,000 were filed in the week ending July 24 of last year, and the jump itself was the biggest since July 1992.
The four-week moving average for claims -- considered a better gauge of conditions in the job market -- rose moderately, to 328,500 in the latest week from 322,000 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Jane Alexander Asks Arts Professionals' Help

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
In her first major speech to a New York audience since she took over as the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts in October, Jane Alexander yesterday called for a new partnership between commercial and nonprofit groups to counter what she called "the financial crisis in the arts."
"It's unrealistic to expect to get more public money in this time of widespread budget-cutting," she said, "so a practical partnership between the commercial sector and nonprofit groups is essential in the future." 
 Ms. Alexander was the keynote speaker at Showbiz Expo East, a three-day gathering of theater, film and television professionals at the New York Hilton and Towers that is to end tomorrow. The last time Ms. Alexander addressed a large audience on a public stage in Manhattan was last summer, when she was starring in "The Sisters Rosensweig" on Broadway.
Ms. Alexander asked the help of the professionals at the convention in "removing the stigma that's been unfairly attached to the arts endowment because of a handful of grants that some people didn't like."
 
First Cuts
 Her speech came on the heels of news articles about the first cuts in arts financing by her agency, which had its budget reduced by Congress in the fall. She told the convention that "although it almost made me feel ill," she had approved elimination of the 20-year-old Professional Theater Training Program, which has helped pay for instruction at 16 of the nation's premier drama schools.
She said that although it was "discouraging," the agency was beginning to notify arts groups of other cuts in drama, dance, museum, opera, music, film and video programs.
Explaining that "we had to cut somewhere, and there is no way to be fair," Ms. Alexander said that the affected arts groups "are surprised, but so far most people aren't blaming the endowment; they're blaming the Congress." The endowment's budget was cut by $4.7 million, from $174.5 million.
Ms. Alexander said that the lack of money was "a quiet crisis in the arts" and that economic hardship had led to a "stagnation in the arts structure and community." The resulting "talent drain" in the arts, she said, can be reversed only by increased participation of the commercial sector. "The name of the game in the future is partnership," she said.
 
'Proving Ground'
 She suggested that nonprofit theater companies "are the proving ground for many of the most well-known and acclaimed stories and dramas in America, and the crucible for many of our playwrights, screenwriters, directors and actors." Therefore, she said, "we need the help of the commercial theater sector and its sister industries in film and television to support a movement to re-inspire theater in New York and across the country."
Although joint financing arrangements between nonprofit theater companies and commercial producers have been increasing in recent years, Ms. Alexander said in an interview after her speech that there was need for "a basic change in mind set that would involve commercial producers more systematically in nurturing new works."
She called for a significant increase in "commercial support early on for writers, actors, directors and others in theater workshops and laboratories."
In the interview, she said that as the chairwoman of the agency she would support controversial or provocative artworks recommended for financing by the endowment's peer panels: works of the kind that caused such difficulties for her predecessors at the agency, often because of contoversial sexual content.
"The right wing is very organized with its campaign against the endowment," she said. "We are in precarious times when an organized segment of our society seeks to control the dissemination of information, and seeks to ban elements of our common culture on moral grounds without even knowing the art, or the books, or the plays, or the human beings they fear."
Therefore, she said, she is organizing the creation of what she called a national task force to lobby for arts financing on the local, state and national levels.
In the interview, Ms. Alexander said that as the agency's chairwoman, she is forbidden to lobby politicians about the endowment's 1995 budget, "but I'm talking to Congressmen and Senators, giving them information about the value of the arts." "I've also spoken to the President," she said, "and I have much more to tell him."
Ms. Alexander also announced that the endowment would sponsor a national conference in Chicago in mid-April for nonprofit arts groups. The conference will "attempt to map out the agenda for the arts at the dawn of this new century," she said.

An Early Champion of Modernists

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
When the collection of the dealer Charles Daniel was auctioned at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York in 1946, an article about the sale referred to "the late Charles Daniel." In fact, Daniel was forgotten but not gone. He lived until 1971. No doubt the gallery he ran, which closed in 1932, had faded so much from people's minds by the end of World War II that the confusion was understandable.
Today, probably only a handful of people have more than the vaguest knowledge of him. But a first-rate exhibition at the Zabriskie Gallery honoring Daniel and his gallery should help to rectify that. 
 The show presents works by artists he exhibited, and a few works that were displayed in the Daniel Gallery itself. The list of artists, diverse and impressive, includes Man Ray and Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Stella and Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler, Peter Blume and Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Marguerite Zorach and William Zorach, Raphael Soyer and Glenn O. Coleman.
It was Coleman who Daniel said turned him on to art. The son of immigrants who ran a German restaurant at 28th Street and 10th Avenue in Manhattan, Daniel opened, with his brother George, a cafe (he called it a saloon) on 42d Street and Ninth Avenue where Coleman regularly ate lunch. He and Daniel became friends. "That's all I needed; I was introduced to art," Daniel recalled.
In 1908 he began collecting. Four years later he rented a space on 55th Street, calling it the Daniel Studio, where artists could meet and the public could see their work. The next year, 1913, was the year of the Armory Show; Daniel sold his interest in the cafe and used the money to finance the Daniel Gallery on the top floor of a building on West 47th Street. Rockwell Kent created the logo, and Man Ray designed and hand-lettered the catalogues.
The critic Murdock Pemberton considered Daniel a genius at discovering artists. He was clearly sympathetic and wide-open to the new in art. Daniel gave dozens of artists their first solo shows in New York. He was one of the earliest dealers to treat photography as a fine art. (A pair of Man Ray photographs at Zabriskie is outstanding.) During its 20 years, the Daniel Gallery exhibited the works of 15 women. Daniel came to be identified with the Precisionists. (Some of the finest and most beautiful drawings and paintings at Zabriskie are by Demuth, Sheeler and Dickinson.) But one of his gallery's most striking qualities was the range of work that over the years encompassed artists as different as the Zorachs, B. J. O. Nordfeldt, Hartley, Blume and Soyer.
As it happened, the Daniel Gallery's life span covered the years of modernism's extraordinary, often tumultuous rise in America. Not long before the Armory Show, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sir Charles Parton Clarke, dismissed Impressionism as something "invented in the absinthe shops of Paris." And the Met's curator of paintings, Bryson Burroughs, was almost dismissed for buying a Cezanne out of the show. Hardly anybody collected modern art; Alfred Stieglitz's 291 Gallery, which Daniel credited for his interest in modernism and where he bought works by John Marin as early as 1910, was alone in exhibiting the works of artists like Matisse, Rodin, Lautrec and Picasso.
But the Armory Show inspired a spate of new galleries dedicated to modernism, including the Montross, Coady, Valentine, Bourgeois, Washington Square and Modern. Charles Daniel had plenty of company. New magazines and societies were founded. Stieglitz had his journal, also called 291, and publications like The Soil and The Blindman arose. The Society of Independent Artists came together to combat traditionalist establishments like the National Academy of Design. And great collectors like Duncan Phillips, Katherine Dreier, A. E. Gallatin, Walter Arensberg, John Quinn, Arthur Jerome Eddy, Albert Barnes, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and Lillie Bliss -- collectors with an evangelical zeal -- began to concentrate their resources not only on buying new work, but also proselytizing for it.
Another distinguished collector was Ferdinand Howald, a retired mining engineer from Columbus, Ohio, who lived on Park Avenue and bought almost exclusively through the Daniel Gallery. Thanks to Howald, it survived World War I, when many other galleries didn't. The war stirred isolationist feelings in America, and modern art was suspiciously European. The weak economy was the biggest problem. Among the galleries to fold was 291; Daniel inherited several of Stieglitz's American artists, including Stanton MacDonald-Wright, Marin and Abraham Walkowitz.
Except for the reviews of Henry McBride, one of the great champions of modernism, the shows at the Daniel Gallery, like those at other galleries of modern art, were routinely panned. You can get an idea of the persistent, and occasionally peculiar, hostility that Daniel and his modernist colleagues had to endure from the reaction in 1921 to the Metropolitan's first exhibition of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, which included no work more recent than a pre-Cubist Picasso. Lenders to the show, like Quinn, were denounced in newspapers for promoting "the same form of degeneracy that brought on the war." It was years before the Met exhibited modern art again.
Still, the 1920's was the decade when modernism finally took hold in America, and by its end institutions of modern art included the Phillips Collection in Washington, the Barnes Collection near Philadelphia (Daniel sold works to both Phillips and Barnes), A. E. Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art on Washington Square in Manhattan and, of course, the Museum of Modern Art, which in its inaugural year, 1929, was able to borrow works for its exhibitions from collections in 51 American cities in 20 states. The Whitney Studio Club, which had been founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, closed in 1928, but in 1931 it was succeeded by the Whitney Museum of American Art.
By then Daniel was almost through. The Depression hit him hard. Howald made the last of his 300 purchases from the gallery in 1929 and moved back to Columbus. Many of Daniel's best-known artists quietly found other dealers like Edith Halpert. Daniel had moved in 1924 to 600 Madison Avenue, near what had become the center of New York's art scene on 57th Street. (The Museum of Modern Art was first located at 57th and Fifth Avenue.) But by 1932, Daniel could no longer pay his rent, and authorities closed the gallery, seizing everything in it.
Pemberton once wrote: "Daniel probably never made a nickel out of art. He was that rare genius -- a patron-dealer who came to art only for the love of it." In Daniel's later years, artists who owed him their start gave him small works as gifts, which he was forced to sell to support himself. In the 1960's, Daniel began to offer some of these to the Zabriskie Gallery, and Virginia Zabriskie came to know and admire him.
She recalls him in the show's smart little catalogue (which includes an especially useful essay by Julie Mellby and entries by Heather Nevin): "Charles Daniel's interest in contemporary art continued well into the last years of his life," Ms. Zabriskie writes. "I remember his conviction that Larry Rivers 'knew how to handle a brush' and his reservations about de Kooning's ability to do the same."
At the end, she adds, "he was very poor, living shabbily with a nephew." Daniel died at 92. With this thoughtful and very beautiful tribute at her gallery, he is now gone but no longer forgotten.
"Charles Daniel and the Daniel Gallery: 1913-1932" remains at the Zabriskie Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, Manhattan, through Feb. 12.

For Children, and Parents
For Kidvidz, a distributor of children's videos in Newton, Mass., there are two not unrelated problems with supplying good tapes for viewers aged 2 to 12. 
 "Parents are baffled about what they are and where to find them," said Karen Tucker, the company's president. "And the suppliers are baffled about how to get them to the parents."
To address the situation, Kidvidz has published the first issue of Kid's Special Delivery Video, a four-page circular that lists 25 videos chosen by a panel of experts from the fields of television, education and children's publishing.
The panel was formed by Kidvidz, which distributes three of the titles in the circular. Ms. Tucker said the guide, to be issued twice a year, will be circulated with other publications from various children's organizations. It is also available directly from Kidvidz. (Information: (800) 914-5678.)
Producers are invited to submit tapes for consideration. Manifestations of "cooperation, tolerance, nonviolence and fair treatment," a "socio-economic mix of talent" and "a respect for kids' intelligence" are needed to qualify.
Among the Kidvidz titles are "Piggy Banks to Money Markets, a Kid's Video Guide to Dollars and Sense" and "Squiggles, Dots and Lines, a Kid's Video Guide to Drawing and Creativity." Both are winners of Parents Choice awards.
Other titles in the circular stress both education and entertainment: "Beethoven Lives Upstairs," for example, a critically praised dramatic feature with passages from the composer's oeuvre, or "Teaching Kids Basketball With John Wooden."
 
Three Degrees of Heat
 Steamy movies occasionally come in three versions (R, unrated and NC-17), but now one version of a steamy movie comes in three packages.
For "Red Shoe Diaries: Another Woman's Lipstick," Republic Home Video put the film, an unrated sex fantasy, in three different boxes.
"For cover art we used to pick one image and aim at a narrow audience," said Glenn Ross, a vice president of Republic Pictures. "Now we can appeal to several audiences."
Dealers choose whichever cover art suits their customers. A box with a couple entwined is intended for males. Another box, aimed at women, conveys the image of having sex but omits some of the body parts. A third box, meant for grocers and other nonvideo merchants, pictures just the lovers' heads.
"Grocery stores don't want stuff exposed on shelves where kids walk by," Mr. Ross said.
 
Latin American Films
 "Latin American cinema hasn't come into its own in this country," said Milos Stehlik, co-director of Facets International, a Chicago dealer and distributor. "Americans know very little."
To enable its clientele to see many of these titles listed in one place, Facets has issued its Spanish and Latin American video catalogue, describing hundreds of films and other features. Information: (800) 331-6197.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
Menace II Society
1993. New Line. $95.25. 104 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
The graphic killing of a Korean grocer and his wife by a young black man sets the tone for the Hughes Brothers' riveting tour of teen-age life in the Watts district of Los Angeles. Though slice-of-life realism sometimes turns to sensationalistic gore, there is an especially strong sense of how plentiful firearms, television and video-game violence and a macho ethic mix with boredom and hopelessness to create combustible situations. "More acutely than any movie before," Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, "it gives cinematic expression to the hot-tempered, defiantly nihilistic ethos that ignites gangster rap."
 
Robin Hood: Men in Tights
1993. Fox. $96.83. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
In its sendup of every Robin Hood movie ever made, Mel Brooks's breezy spoof scores its most direct hit on the clammy political correctness of Kevin Costner's "Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves." Unfortunately, steeped as it is in the horrendous taste and up-front rudeness one has come to know and love in the better Brooks films, this one struggles with dozens of bad gags that should have been fixed or thrown out. The director also has the bad habit of reprising bits from his "Young Frankenstein" and other movies, thereby focusing attention on the weaknesses of "Men in Tights." While it's acceptable to be offensive, "it's something else to scrape the bottom of your own barrel in front of everybody" (Vincent Canby).
 
Heart and Souls
1993. MCA/Universal. $95.25. Laser disk, $34.98. 104 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Here, basically, is the story: Four passengers are killed in a bus crash, but their souls enter the body of the newborn baby of a woman who was also on the bus. Later, when the baby has grown into a yuppie, portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., the four spirits emerge to express themselves. Charles Grodin is a shy loner who wants to sing, Kyra Sedgwick is a lovelorn waitress, Alfre Woodard a loving mother and Ted Sizemore a jovial greaser. In a story sodden with sentiment, only Mr. Downey shines through. "The best thing about the film is to watch his uncanny impersonations of his co-stars" (Janet Maslin).
 
The Golden Coach
1952. Interama. $59.95. 103 minutes. In English. No rating.
In Jean Renoir's film, Anna Magnani is the star performer in a commedia dell'arte troupe touring Peru in the early 1700's. The golden coach belongs to the Spanish viceroy. Over-emoting as a supposedly ravishing beauty who juggles three lovers at once while holding all of society in thrall, Miss Magnani has a hard time disguising her raucous instincts. Wooden plotting and dialogue are no help either, but "the mingled decor of Harlequin costumes, 18th-century flamboyancy and Spanish rococo makes for considerable excitement" (Bosley Crowther).

HEADLINE: Mr. Cuomo's Sobering Summons

 BODY:
Plenty of people have said that Gov. Mario Cuomo sounded like a Republican in his speech to the New York State Legislature on Wednesday. Many have also observed that the three main issues he addressed -- the economy, welfare and crime -- are uppermost in the minds of New York voters and thus an excellent formula for victory should he decide to run for a fourth term.
Yet far too little has been made of a more compelling point: As legislative programs go, the Governor's is eminently achievable. In that sense his address is a pointed challenge to the Legislature, especially the Republicans who have so often thwarted him -- and to Mr. Cuomo, who has a habit of thwarting himself. 
 The Governor's speech contained few of his customary oratorical flourishes, and not much in the way of passion or his usual promises to the poor. His most important theme was that New York needed to create an "aggressively hospitable" climate for business. To that end he called for cutting the corporate tax surcharge, phasing out the hotel tax, giving tax breaks to developers and eliminating a bunch of "obnoxious" fees.
Whether he can do all that in the face of a $1.5 billion budget deficit is doubtful; even so, Governor Cuomo is clearly aware that New York has lost 500,000 jobs in the last four years of his reign and that, recession aside, an inhospitable tax environment may have been partly to blame.
On welfare, Mr. Cuomo also emphasized jobs. He proposed that the state find work for welfare applicants before allowing them on the rolls. He would also cut benefits to families whose children are not attending schools and fingerprint welfare recipients as protection against fraud. He sounded a similarly tough note on crime, urging an overdue ban on assault weapons and harsher penalties for repeat offenders in violent crimes.
All three issues have long been part of the Republican domain. Politically, the G.O.P. cannot be pleased that Mr. Cuomo may have shrewdly positioned himself to outflank whoever runs against him; legislatively, however, it staggers the imagination to think that the Republicans who control the State Senate can, in good conscience, resist him. Indeed, his strongest opposition is likely to come from his fellow Democrats, who do not like the idea of fingerprinting welfare recipients, for example, and who can be expected to argue that cutting taxes will hurt programs for the poor.
Presumably as a call to arms, Mr. Cuomo quoted Shakespeare's "Coriolanus": "Action is eloquence." In the play, however, the line is a plea to Coriolanus from his mother to get off his high horse and go on bended knee to ask the Roman people for support. The quote actually works both ways: as a summons to action in the State Legislature, and as a reminder to himself that he must work harder than he has in the past to get his program through.

HEADLINE: Despite Settlements, Mideast May Find Peace;
The Bedouins Adapt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Bedouins' Eviction Notice" (Op-Ed, Dec. 29), Prof. Clinton Bailey's attack on Israeli Government policy toward Bedouin citizens, is emotional and unfounded. To make his case of Government mistreatment, Mr. Bailey uses such inflammatory language as "waging a kind of war against the Bedouin tribes," "ethnic cleansing" and expulsion. 
 Throughout the Middle East, nomadic life is coming to an end. Israel is no different from Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia in its efforts to settle Bedouins in towns. The reason is simple -- nomadic people require vast tracts of desert to maintain their herds of goats, and these often transcend closed national borders. United Nations committees have looked with disfavor on the negative ecological impact of grazing by herds of goats in the fragile desert habitat. Nomadic life in Israel, as elsewhere, is bowing to the exigencies of the 20th century.
Before Israel became a state, Bedouin children never went to school. Today, through compulsory education, all start in school, but unfortunately girls attend only through the fourth grade. Girls are removed at an early age because Bedouin culture frowns on education for women.
Soon after a girl reaches puberty she marries and has a large family, often 10 to 12 children. The Bedouin birth rate is 5 percent -- about the highest in the world. Despite this, the infant mortality rate is lower than in New York City's Harlem. This is a tribute to the commitment of the Health Ministry to deliver quality health care to Bedouin women through clinics and outreach teams.
I recently visited Tel Sheva, a Bedouin town outside Beersheva and saw some of the problems Mr. Bailey describes, that is, poverty and unemployment. But I also saw Arab-owned businesses, villas, a health clinic and a spanking new school building.
Finally, let us not join Professor Bailey in romanticizing the nomadic life of the Bedouin family scratching out a meager subsistence in the inhospitable and ofter cruel desert. Daily life is tough, grinding and especially harsh on women. The Bedouins in the townships are adapting reasonably well to their new communal life style.

HEADLINE: Seymour Lawrence, 67, Publisher For a Variety of Eminent Authors

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
Seymour Lawrence, an independent book publisher in New York City and Boston for almost 30 years who brought the first works of many important writers to the public, died on Tuesday at the Englewood Community Hospital in Englewood, Fla. He was 67 and lived in Wilton, Conn.
The cause was complications of a heart attack, said Irene Williams, the publicity director of the publisher Houghton Mifflin, with which Mr. Lawrence was affiliated. 
 Among the dozens of distinguished authors published by Mr. Lawrence, who was known as Sam, were Thomas Berger, Richard Brautigan, J. P. Donleavy, Jim Harrison, Katherine Anne Porter, William Saroyan, Kurt Vonnegut and Frank Conroy.
 
'Good Scout'
 "Sam's importance in the literary world was as a very good scout of talent," Mr. Vonnegut said yesterday.
Mr. Lawrence published Mr. Vonnegut's novel "Slaughterhouse-Five" in 1969, after the manuscript had been rejected by the publishing firm with which the author had a contract.
He published the works of four authors who won the Nobel Prize for Literature: Miguel Angel Asturias, Camilo Jose Cela, Pablo Neruda and George Seferis.
Mr. Lawrence started his independent imprint in 1965 with only one book on his list, "The Ginger Man," by Mr. Donleavy. Later he published such notable books as "Ship of Fools," by Ms. Porter; "Trout Fishing in America," by Mr. Brautigan; "Going After Cacciato," by Tim O'Brien; "Little Big Man," by Mr. Berger, and "Selected Poems," by Mr. Neruda.
 
Survival as an Independent
 He was unusual on the publishing scene in that he survived as an independent for more than 25 years, well into the era of merger and consolidation. In 1983, he was affected by the turmoil of the times. After 17 years of association with Dell, primarily with the Delacorte label, his imprint fell victim to the economy ax wielded by the troubled management team at Doubleday, Dell's owner.
After a stop at E. P. Dutton, Mr. Lawrence's imprint went to Houghton Mifflin in 1988.
At a party for Mr. Lawrence given by Houghton Mifflin in 1990, a number of authors, among them Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Vonnegut and Mr. Harrison, gathered to pay him tribute. Also present was a bookstore owner, John Evans of the Lemuria Bookstore in Jackson, Miss. Mr. Evans was described then as probably having sold more of Mr. Lawrence's books than any single bookseller. "Sam," said Mr. Evans, "has given the reader a fine bowl of literary gumbo."
Mr. Lawrence's authors described him as a publisher who was passionately committed to writers and writing, but who was not always tolerant of "misguided reviewers" or the publishing bureaucracy.
Joseph Kanon, an executive at Houghton Mifflin, said at the 1990 tribute: "The first time I met Sam Lawrence, he was making an argument on behalf of one of his authors. The last time I spoke with him, this morning, he was doing the same thing. On both occasions, as usual, he got what he wanted."
Mr. Lawrence, who grew up in New York City, became absorbed in books early in life. He was the editor of Wake, a literary magazine, when he was a student at Harvard University, from which he graduated in 1948. After working as a traveling book salesman, he joined the Atlantic Monthly Press in Boston in 1952. He became that firm's director three years later.
He is survived by his mother, Sophie Lawrence of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Nicholas Lawrence of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Macy Ratliff of Bothell, Wash.; two granddaughters, and his companion, Joan Williams of Oxford, Miss.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 8, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about Seymour Lawrence, an independent book publisher who died on Tuesday, misidentified the publisher of "Little Big Man," a 1964 novel by Thomas Berger. It was the Dial Press, not Mr. Lawrence.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
A Good Call on NATO

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton is making some of America's best friends very unhappy -- Europeans who lived under Communism, fought it, and helped bring down the Soviet empire. Next week he will make them even unhappier when he tells them face to face that the U.S. will not agree to their becoming members of NATO.
Face to face, he will have to deal with people like the Czech writer Vaclav Havel, who went from a Communist jail to the presidency of his country, and President Lech Walesa of Poland, the electrician who created a freedom movement that bound together workingman and intellectual. 
 They will tell him of their still-vivid fears of the Russian imperialism that enslaved their countries under czarism and Communism. They will say they have earned the protection of NATO membership. Mr. Clinton -- he will say many things but essentially no, not yet.
My time as an American correspondent in Eastern Europe during the Communist ice age binds me to Eastern and Central European democrats. In some of their countries, "ex"-Communist politicians are strong, and in others fascists use democracy to try to destroy it. Those dangers give the passions of Mr. Havel and Mr. Walesa special meaning.
So when I sat down at a Presidential lunch for columnists about NATO I was emotionally and politically behind quick membership for some of the former Communist colonies.
Mr. Clinton did not present startling new reasons for delaying. But he put enough good existing reasons together lucidly enough so that I changed my mind. What? Yes.
I went away thinking that American friends of democracy in Eastern Europe could give him enough time to play it out without getting panicky.
Boris Yeltsin fears that immediate NATO membership for countries on Russia's border would help Russian nationalists sell their line of Russia imperiled. Mr. Clinton said the Russian President sends the message that Russia should not be pushed back, treated again as an enemy.
Is this appeasement of a foreign ruler? It seemed to me, listening to that question in my head, that appeasement is trying to buy off an enemy -- not trying to help a friend survive a growing threat at home. If it takes a couple of years and another election to make Russia comfortable with NATO neighbors, it is worth the wait. If not, or if the fascist-Communist alliance washes over Russia, NATO could extend membership protection fast to Eastern and Central Europe.
Anyway, the West would have to meet any Russian military adventure against Eastern Europe. The key point is not how many new members NATO brings in but how strong its current members stay.
Mr. Clinton said the reduction of U.S. forces in Europe from 326,000 to 100,000 was enough. But has it been too much, given the rise of the Russian uglies? Is Mr. Clinton's new Secretary of Defense going to decide for himself and tell us?
Mr. Clinton did not go into it, but there is another good reason for waiting before expanding NATO. Eastern and Central Europe have not settled down politically. Yugoslavia is eating itself alive, Czechoslovakia has split in two, Poland has elected a Government of "ex"-Communists, and in Hungary and Romania fascists name plazas after their heroes in hell.
The West should have expected upheavals, not a a straight, calm line, after so many decades of Communist and Nazi brutalization. Still, it would be an even nastier shock to find a national alliance of blackshirts and Communists sitting at a NATO table.
Some of my friends say that without Eastern Europeans in NATO, between Germany and Russia, the Germans would be very upset. I can live with that thought.
The President kept saying that while they were not getting membership, the former captive nations would be brought into closer political, military and economic cooperation with NATO members. So the tests of the Clintonian policy will be these:
Will closer ties with Eastern Europe turn out to be real or mumbo-jumbo? Will we put money and some military integration on the table or play Monopoly? Will "not right now" mean exactly that, or "not ever"?
The President's policy, as he said, is a judgment call. That is what he gets paid to make. This one seems reasonable and carefully thought out. I ate my full portion but for now feel a little lighter.

HEADLINE: VIACOM ANNOUNCES MERGER AND RAISES BID FOR PARAMOUNT

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
After a week of speculation about how he might pull together the money to win Paramount Communications Inc. in a fierce bidding war, Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom Inc., submitted an offer yesterday that on the surface seemed stunning.
Trying desperately to beat a rival bid from QVC Network Inc., Viacom offered $105 a share in cash for 50.1 percent of Paramount's stock, with the rest to be purchased with Viacom stock. And in a companion move, he said Viacom would merge with the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, the giant video-rental company that has backed his bid for Paramount, in an exchange of stock worth $8.4 billion. 
 Before the merger is completed, Blockbuster will buy Viacom stock worth $1.25 billion, giving Mr. Redstone, who controls Viacom, the cash he needs to raise his Paramount bid.
 
Questions About Bid
 Despite considerable fanfare on Wall Street over the moves, financial analysts and traders quickly disparaged Viacom's bid. Because of the value of the stock portion of the offer, they pegged Viacom's bid at about $78 in cash and stock for each share of Paramount. That would be less than QVC's offer of about $83 a share, which Paramount's board has approved.
 By any measure, Viacom's return shows how intense the takeover battle has become. No media company can be certain of how entertainment programming will be distributed in the future, but all of them are aware of the need to have films and television series, like those that Paramount owns and produces, to attract viewers.
"It's a soap opera," said William LeFevre, an analyst at Ehrenkrantz King & Nussbaum, an investment firm in New York. "It's just going to go on and on."
 
MTV and Movie Rentals
 Indeed, even if Viacom fails to win Paramount, it said it would still merge with Blockbuster to create a media company with holdings including MTV: Music Television, the Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite cable channels, broadcast television programming and 3,600 video-rental stores across the country. Blockbuster sees Viacom as a way to expand out of home video, whose long-term prospects are tenuous as more and more programming is sent to homes electronically.
 Under the rules of the bidding process set up by Paramount in response to a ruling last month by the Delaware Supreme Court, Viacom had until yesterday to raise its offer before Paramount shareholders sold their shares to QVC, the home-shopping network. Paramount said yesterday that its board would meet next week to consider Viacom's revised proposal.
Many analysts on Wall Street were not happy with Viacom's latest offer. "To induce me to sell Mr. Redstone my stock, he will have to offer more total value," said a trader who owns Paramount stock that he said he had agreed to sell to QVC.
Several traders said Mr. Redstone, 70, seemed to be hoping that shareholders would focus on the $105 a share for 50.1 percent of the shares, instead of on the combined value of the stock and the cash in the bid.
Gordon Crawford, a senior vice president of the Capital Research Company, a big shareholder in Paramount, Viacom, QVC and Blockbuster, was among those critical of the new offer. He said, "To go to all the trouble of merging two companies, causing the value of both stocks to decline sharply when trading opens Monday, just to launch a bid that is clearly inferior to the existing QVC bid, seems like an exercise in futility."
The Viacom bid was announced after the stock market closed yesterday, but rumors of a Viacom-Blockbuster union had been circulating for some time. Viacom's class B shares closed at $41, down $1.75, while Paramount stock closed at $79.25, up 75 cents. QVC's shares jumped $1.125 to $40.625, and Blockbuster stock fell $1.625 to $28.25.
 
QVC Chairman's Response
 Even as Mr. Redstone and the chairman of Blockbuster Entertainment, H. Wayne Huizenga, were fielding calls from Wall Street investors yesterday, QVC's chairman, Barry Diller, said he thought the Paramount board should accept QVC's tender offer, which was scheduled to close last night, and which he noted was higher than Viacom's. Mr. Diller was speaking by phone from the offices of QVC's law firm, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz.
The Paramount board had agreed to accept QVC's bid if 50.1 percent of Paramount's shareholders tendered their stock to QVC by last night, unless Viacom made a higher offer.
But with news of the new bid, many investors held their stock back from QVC, assuming they had more time to make a decision. A person close to QVC said late yesterday that Viacom confused the market by announcing a bid at the 11th hour and trying to convince people that Viacom's new offer was higher than QVC's.
Under the terms of its new offer, Viacom's total cash investment is $6.3 billion, or about $700 million more than the cash portion of QVC's most recent bid.
But Viacom has raised its offer from $85 a share in cash for 51 percent of the company, or a cash investment of about $5.2 billion, to $6.3 billion. Traders did not simply focus on the cash portion yesterday, however, since about 49 percent of the offer is in stock.
 
Creating a New Company
 The merger will create a new company to be called Viacom-Blockbuster Inc. The core business of Blockbuster, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is the rental of films on videocassettes, a business that is seen as highly vulnerable to the technical flexibility of interactive information systems, which would let people get the programming they wanted at home, any time they wanted.
Despite Blockbuster's current economic health -- it generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually -- Mr. Huizenga is well aware that it needs to expand into businesses with a more secure future. There is some logic, therefore, to a merger.
But Mr. Crawford and several other analysts wondered whether Viacom would do well to invest so heavily in such a tenuous business. It has agreed to acquire Blockbuster's stock for about $31 a share in Viacom stock, a 10 percent premium over its trading value.
While Viacom and Blockbuster promoted the values of their merger proposal yesterday, because it would allow cost savings in various television businesses, they admitted that the talks heated up only before Christmas, just after QVC raised its bid to its current level.
The news of a merger surprised some entertainment industry executives because Mr. Redstone had said he would not give up control of his company, of which he controls 85 percent of the voting stock.
He kept his word. Mr. Redstone will end up with about 61 percent of the vote in the new company, while Blockbuster and the public will hold the balance.
Mr. Huizenga is selling control of his company to Mr. Redstone without actually putting the company on the block, and Mr. Crawford wondered last night whether Blockbuster had the legal right to do so. He said Paramount had been reprimanded by the Delaware Supreme Court for taking a similar course, selling out to Viacom without giving other companies a fair chance to bid. Blockbuster officials could not be reached for comment last night.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Joint Military Games As Step to Poland's NATO Ties

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The United States told Poland today that NATO was willing to hold joint military exercises with Polish forces in Poland later this year as part of an effort to persuade East European countries to accept a relationship short of full membership in NATO.
The offer was made to President Lech Walesa by Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was born in Poland. He has been sent to Eastern Europe on a special mission with Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States representative to the United Nations, to get approval of the "Partnership for Peace" plan, which the 16 NATO nations are expected to adopt at the organization's summit meeting in Brussels next Tuesday. Ms. Albright is Czech born. 
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters in Washington today that although the NATO plan would be the focus of the meeting, it would also deal with the Bosnian war.
President Clinton is to meet with Mr. Walesa and the leaders of Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in Prague next Wednesday. Mr. Walesa said today that he would give his response to the NATO offer to Mr. Clinton when he sees him. In recent weeks, the Eastern Europeans have been expressing unhappiness with the plan.
 
Offer Falls Short
 The plan, while offering membership at some time in the future, falls short of the Eastern Europeans' desire for prompt membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which they have said was necessary to provide them with security against possible Russian moves in the future. General Shalikashvili said he might make similar offers to the leaders of the other three East European countries when he and Ms. Albright visit them individually over the next couple of days.
Holding joint military exercises in the former Soviet bloc would have a symbolic meaning, demonstrating how far these countries have come since throwing off Communism as a ruling ideology in 1989.
 
Gradual Ties
 The United States initiative seeks to avoid antagonizing Russia's belligerent nationalists by inviting the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe to build gradually closer ties with NATO that could eventually lead to membership. But those ties would come without the immediate ironclad security guarantees that the Eastern Europeans want but that Moscow finds provocative.
The initiative also reflects President Clinton's judgment that Congress would balk at extending America's defense umbrella any farther east at present, and that it would refuse to come to the aid of these countries in the same way it is committed to defend its existing NATO allies.
American officials said the offer to hold a NATO exercise in Poland this year, which seems likely to annoy some Russian leaders, was intended to convince President Walesa that the United States is seriously interested in protecting Poland even if it is not ready to anger Moscow by guaranteeing protection against a Russian attack.
"Our message is that the security and stability of Poland is of direct and material interest of the United States," Ms. Albright said at a news conference at the end of the talks. But both she and General Shalikashvili said it would be wrong to do anything that would create new divisions between Russia and its former allies.
"At this delicate period we are going through, we should not create new divisions in this part of Europe," General Shalikashvili said, alluding to Russia's angry reaction in recent weeks to East European requests to join NATO for protection against a possible revival of Russian imperialism.
President Walesa neither rejected nor accepted the American offer of a weak security partnership.
Ms. Albright and General Shalikashvili both expressed optimism that Poland would agree to join the partnership next week. "We remain optimistic Poland will be an active participant in the Partnership for Peace," General Shalikashvili said afterward.
Backing for that optimism came in a statement issued here after parallel talks between the Defense Ministers of the four countries attending a meeting next week in Prague who call themselves the Visegrad group, after the loose cooperation agreement they signed in that Hungarian city in 1991.
 
'The Right Direction'
 The Defense Ministers said they "actively discussed the Partnership for Peace initiative" and "believe it is a step in the right direction, favorable to the idea of multilateral security, and leading to a broadening of cooperation between NATO and the states of central Eastern Europe." But the Visegrad Defense Ministers also asked for a clear commitment from NATO that it will let them join the alliance as full members at some time in the future.
General Shalikashvili suggested that NATO will in fact give such a promise at its summit meeting in Brussels next week when it is expected to endorse the initiative formally.
"Our hope is that the NATO summit will say they expect and welcome the extension of NATO to the democracies of the East," he said at his news conference.
 
The Only Link Offered
 At a brief meeting with Ms. Albright and General Shalikashvili, American officials said the Visegrad group appeared resigned to accepting the proposal as the only link offered with NATO.
"The sense of the meeting was that it meets their minimum needs but not their maximum needs," United States officials said. However, while Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are interested in a joint approach to NATO, the Czech Republic does not want to be slowed down in its effort to join the alliance. It signaled that more independent approach today by sending only its Vice Defense Minister to the meeting.
Diplomats say an understanding that joining the partnership will eventually lead to full alliance membership is important for the Eastern European Governments because they will be expected to spend money bringing their military equipment and training up to alliance standards.
Only last Wednesday Russia reacted angrily to Lithuania's request for immediate NATO membership. Lithuania is the only one of the three Baltic states from which Russia has withdrawn all of its forces.
"The President is worried that expanding NATO to new countries in direct proximity to Russian borders will prompt a negative public opinion reaction," said a spokesman for President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Officials here say President Walesa expressed deep concern in his talks with the American team today about the rising tide of nationalist feeling in Russia, then made clear that he wants the United States to guarantee Poland's safety by promising to admit it to NATO eventually.
Such fears are shared by all the Visegrad countries. President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic recently spoke of the possibility "that in Russia forces still enamored of the imperial ambitions of the former Soviet Union would temporarily gain the upper hand."
Under the partnership proposal, American officials say all former Warsaw Pact countries, eventually including Russia itself, will be invited to work toward a series of political and military goals that will qualify them for NATO membership.
On the political level these would include parliamentary democracy and adoption of a free market economy. But the military would also be expected to train with regular NATO troops, to acquire compatible equipment, to accept ultimate civilian control over its activities and to provide a full public accounting of its spending.
General Shalikashvili said tonight that the faster these countries pressed ahead with such reforms the quicker NATO was likely to admit them.

HEADLINE: Prominent Blacks Meet to Search For an Answer to Mounting Crime

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
With their communities so ravaged by crime that even people like the Rev. Jesse Jackson are saying they sometimes fear encountering young black men on the street, a group of black politicians, sociologists, ministers, celebrities and civil rights leaders met today in what some acknowledge is an increasingly desperate search for answers.
While they agreed that the problem was rapidly spinning out of control, they condemned the solution most often offered to deal with it: stiffer prison sentences and more jail cells.
 
'It's an Uphill Struggle'
 "We've got to take the initiative, even if it's an uphill struggle, to move government and the country away from this simplistic approach to the crime problem," Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said at the conference, which was organized by Mr. Jackson. 
 The hard-line method is embodied in the crime bill recently passed by the Senate. Participants at the conference, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, vowed to fight it when the House takes up the measure later this month.
The measure, which has the backing of the Clinton Administration, calls for mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain violent crimes, the construction of more jails, restrictions on death row appeals and permission for prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults for certain Federal crimes. In a marriage of liberal and conservative views on preventing crime, it would also ban certain models of assault weapons and provide money to hire 100,000 more police officers to patrol the nation's streets.
But many conference participants argued that increasing prison sentences and building more jails will not solve the crime problem. They contend that the prison population has nearly tripled since 1980 and yet the crime rate, particularly in black neighborhoods, has continued to rise and that the rate at which people are victimized by criminals is growing four times as fast among blacks as among whites.
Still, even staunch opponents acknowledged that it would be difficult to derail the measure, which aims to spend $22.3 billion over five years on anti-crime efforts.
 
Big Issue Among Blacks
 Nonetheless, conference participants say they intend to back an alternative measure drafted by the Congressional Black Caucus. That bill directs more money into crime-prevention programs, drug treatment and job creation.
"This is a very important conference," said Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California. "It is the opening shot in one of the great battles we're going to have, not only in 1994, but in the coming decade."
There is growing evidence that crime is becoming an important political and social issue among blacks. In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in November, 28 percent of the black respondents, twice the percentage of whites, placed crime and violence as the most important problem facing the country. Last January only 8 percent of black respondents in a similar poll felt that way.
Violence, crime and who best can handle it were also important issues in last year's Mayoral race in Detroit and are expected to be important issues in this year's race in Washington. Both cities have black majorities.
"Crime as an issue spilled off the page in any poll you take," said David Axelrod, who was the media adviser for Dennis Archer, the winning candidate in the Detroit race. "In any poll you do today, crime is the No. 1 issue."
The increasing concern by blacks about crime reflects the sharp increase in the rate of crime affecting them. According to the Bureau of Criminal Justice Statistics, the number of violent crimes, excluding murder, in which blacks were the victims increased 42 percent from 1980 to 1992, the last year for which this statistic is available. During the same time, the increase for violent crimes in which whites were the victims rose 9 percent.
The figures also indicate that for crimes like murder, rape, robbery and assault, the race of the offender and the victim are the same in an overwhelming majority of the cases.
 
Violence Seems Normal
 Black-on-black crime has become so pervasive, Mr. Jackson said at a news conference here today, that "we have come to accept it as normal." During the conference, Mr. Jackson noted that there had been four shootings near his home in Washington in recent months.
But if the conference illuminates an emerging consensus among blacks on the importance of crime, it also provides stark evidence that a meeting of the minds on the solutions may be difficult to reach.
For example, in the conference's opening panel on Thursday night, on violence against women, C. Delores Tucker, head of the National Political Congress of Black Women, said misogynist and inflammatory lyrics of some rap music was provoking abuse against black women. She said her group would be picketing records stores that sold such music.
Ms. Tucker was immediately warned by Laura Murphy-Lee, director of the Washington chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, that blacks should be careful not to align themselves with right-wing groups that advocate censorship. And a number of people in the audience, including teen-agers and college students, said that rap music did not cause violence but simply mirrored the experience of many youths in the inner city.
 
Debate on Young Criminals
 And while several attending the conference condemned the provision in the Senate bill that allows juveniles to be charged as adults for certain crimes, that amendment was sponsored by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois, the lone black in the Senate.
"Everything we see in the black community right now is on the level of exhortation," said Milton Morris, vice president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which researches black-oriented issues.
"But in terms of what do we do in policies, strategies and programs, I don't see anything yet," he added. "And the truth is it's tough and difficult to find solutions. All the solutions before us are either Draconian, prison-oriented types of measures or the kind of costly long-term violence prevention efforts that I don't think the society right now has the patience or the will to take on."

HEADLINE: CUOMO ANNOUNCES HE WILL RUN AGAIN DESPITE LOW POLLS

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced this evening that he would run this year for a fourth term, saying he wanted the chance to help New York rebound from a recession that has sapped both the state's economic vitality and his own popularity.
Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, who was Mr. Cuomo's running mate in 1986 and 1990, will run again at Mr. Cuomo's side, the Governor said in a statement. 
 In the statement, Mr. Cuomo detailed his accomplishments but said he recognized the public was discontented. "I don't need polls to tell me that at this moment the people are concerned and angry, and they are registering their strong disapproval with those of us in command," he said. "I know that makes us underdogs as we enter this race."
The Governor said he saw signs of resurgence in New York, but said his work was unfinished. "At this moment of possibility, I will ask the people for one more opportunity to serve them -- an opportunity to complete the job of building the strong, peaceful, prosperous future they deserve," he said.
 
Approval Rating Low
 If the 61-year-old Mr. Cuomo wins and completes another four-year term, he will become the second-longest-serving Governor in New York history, surpassing the 15 years served by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Both the state and national records for gubernatorial longevity are held by New York's first Governor, George Clinton, who served a total of 22 years.
With Mr. Cuomo's approval ratings at 34 percent, their lowest ever, Republican leaders believe he is ripe for defeat. But four years after suffering a humiliating loss in the 1990 gubernatorial race, the party remains racked by internal division.
It is far from finding a consensus candidate who could also win the critical support of the Conservative Party, which fielded its own candidate in 1990 and split the anti-Cuomo vote with the Republicans; the Governor won that race with 53 percent of the vote. Less than six months before the Republican nominating convention, 12 candidates are still considering the race. Five others, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, have dropped out of contention, although Mr. D'Amato has said he might re-enter if he thinks no other Republican could beat Mr. Cuomo. [Page 29.]
In his statement, Mr. Cuomo revealed little about how he had made his decision, but those who have spoken with him in recent weeks said he seemed to be seriously weighing both options. In several conversations, he asked his advisers whether Mr. Lundine could win if he did not run. He also expressed concerns about the impact of a campaign on his family.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo said their goal in the campaign would be to emphasize the Governor's experience, integrity and record, as well as his plan for bringing New York back to economic strength. The Governor began outlining that plan on Wednesday in a State of the State address that stressed tax cuts, welfare reform, gun control and tougher sentences for criminals.
But the Republicans will also be emphasizing Mr. Cuomo's record, including the loss of 572,000 jobs in the last four years and his lack of success in curbing violent crime.
Al Gordon, chairman of the State Democratic Committee, said he did not expect Mr. Cuomo to face any significant opposition in the Democratic primary in September.
 
Other Democrats Demur
 Each of the leading Democrats who had said they would run if Mr. Cuomo did not -- former Lieut. Gov. Alfred B. DelBello; Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Vice-Presidential candidate; Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes; United States Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, and City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone -- said this evening that they would not run against him. Mr. Hynes said he would consider running in a Democratic primary for Attorney General against the incumbent, G. Oliver Koppell.
Mr. Gordon estimated that the 1994 gubernatorial race would cost Mr. Cuomo $7 million to $10 million. The Governor had $3.1 million in his campaign account as of July, the last filing date with the State Board of Elections. The State Democratic Committee has about $1 million on hand to spend in behalf of Mr. Cuomo and other candidates.
Mr. Cuomo's long-awaited announcement had none of the balloons-and-bunting pageantry usually reserved for such events. It came instead in a three-page statement distributed by his press office at 6:02 P.M., almost too late to make the evening television news.
Friday evenings are usually when Mr. Cuomo, and many other politicians, release statements they hope will be overlooked. That clearly was not the Governor's intent today. But after disclosing his plans to top aides late this morning, Mr. Cuomo had to leave for New York City to tape a television show. With Mr. Cuomo on the road, it took the rest of the afternoon to prepare and release a statement.
Republican Party officials lingered in the Capitol for a while to await an announcement. But they declared they were bored and went home, leaving reporters with two statements from the party chairman, William D. Powers, one for either eventuality. "Some people just don't know when to leave," Mr. Powers said in the statement marked "run."
Cuomo aides said they would begin forming a campaign organization immediately. Mr. Gordon and Mr. Cuomo's youngest daughter, Madeline, are expected to have top roles. Andrew J. Zambelli, Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff in Albany, is also expected to be heavily involved.
The Governor's political aides have held discussions in recent weeks with a number of media consultants who might be hired, including David Axelrod of Chicago, Hank Morris of New York City, and Frank Greer and Robert Squier of Washington.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo said they also might consider hiring David Garth, who helped both Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani win mayoral races in New York City. Mr. Garth worked with Mr. Cuomo in his 1978 campaign for lieutenant governor, but ran Mr. Koch's 1977 mayoral campaign and his 1982 gubernatorial campaign against Mr. Cuomo.

HEADLINE: U.S. Data Show Moderate Gains In Employment

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The job market strengthened further last month as payrolls swelled by 183,000 and the unemployment rate edged down to 6.4 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
Private analysts called the job gain large enough to support optimistic forecasts for the economy in the early months of 1994 but not so large as to frighten those watching for symptoms of revived inflation, presumably including the Federal Reserve. 
 The central bank is widely expected to nudge rates up this year to keep an expanding economy from pushing up prices. So far, however, the Fed lacks compelling evidence that the inflation risk is great enough to do so.
 
Bond Market Rallies
 The bond market posted a sharp advance in the wake of the labor report, driving interest rates lower and bolstering stocks. [Page 39.]
The job statistics, the first broad assessment of activity to be published for December, "show the economy in a moderate growth phase," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. And no longer, she added, can the expansion be considered "jobless."
The New York region fared less well. The New Jersey jobless rate went up by nearly 1 percent while the rates in New York State and New York City gained slightly. [Page 47.]
During 1993 the national economy generated 1.97 million jobs, double the 1992 payroll gain and very close to the Clinton Administration's goal of two million. A separate survey counting the number of people with jobs showed a gain of 2.51 million and a shrinkage of 1.08 million in the ranks of the jobless.
The bond market's advance continued a rally touched off on Thursday when Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, predicted that payrolls would show a rise of 160,000 to 200,000, a range somewhat below the consensus.
Mr. Reich's estimate turned out to be on target. Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, repeated today in an appearance before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress the department's denials that Mr. Reich had knowledge of the figures when he made his comments on television to a forum in Paris.
This meant little to Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, a ranking member of the committee and normally a highly partisan Democrat. He criticized Mr. Reich for at least appearing to have compromised the secrecy of the statistics, cautioning him to be "sensitive" to the need to preserve the bureau's hard-won reputation for integrity.
While the December labor market results were considered generally encouraging, they also pointed up some areas that have failed to show much improvement or have perhaps begun to lose momentum again.
 
White House's View
 Among these are persistently high levels of people unemployed for six months or more, people working part time who would rather have full-time jobs and people so discouraged about the prospects of finding work they have given up looking for it.
These, said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief economic adviser to President Clinton, "warrant continued monitoring and concern."
Nonetheless, Ms. Tyson declared not only that the economy was in a "moderate sustained expansion" but also that contrary to a widely shared view, consumer incomes have been rising enough to support spending at the current pace.
Consumer retrenchment is frequently cited as a reason why the economy in the first quarter of 1994 will likely fail to match a fourth-quarter burst that could reach a rate of 5 percent or more.
 
Buying on Credit Rises
 A separate report published by the Federal Reserve today showed consumer installment credit jumping $6.88 billion in November, a bit less than October's $7.66 billion advance. Automobile and revolving loans slowed while loans for other purchases like mobile homes, education and boats expanded sharply.
The gains in payroll jobs last month were concentrated in the service sector as manufacturing and construction, two sectors that rebounded solidly in October and November, showed little change.
The biggest advance was 36,000 for the personnel supply, or temporary, business, with retail trade adding 32,000 after a small decline in November. About 75 percent of the new retail jobs were in bars and restaurants, as stores selling general merchandise pruned staffs during the month. Jobs in finance continued to rise, posting an 11,000 gain, and health care added 18,000 jobs.
After a prolonged period of lengthening, the average workweek was unchanged at historically high levels in December for both manufacturing and for the private sector as a whole, the report also showed. This suggested companies might be reaching limits in how hard they can push existing employees and have begun to hire new ones.
The department's survey of households produced an unemployment rate of 6.4 percent in December, the same as initially reported for November but down a statistically insignificant one-tenth of a point from the revised November rate of 6.5 percent. As part of its annual updating of seasonal adjustment factors, the department recalculated all the 1993 months and as a result, November's decline from October was just two-tenths of a point instead of the four-tenths of a point originally reported.
 
New System a Concern
 The introduction of new methodology this month is already proving contentious, with Senator Sarbanes and other Democrats worrying publicly about the reaction to the report on the January job market to be published Feb. 4.
Based on a pilot program, the department now estimates the rate will rise four-tenths of a point at the next calculation because of new questions aimed mainly at removing a bias against women. Inclusion of new census data is expected to raise the rate another tenth of a point and technical forces could push the new reported rate above 7 percent even if there is no change in labor market conditions, Commissioner Abraham said.
For comparison purposes, the bureau will at the same time provide estimates of what the January rate would have been using the old survey and estimates of what much of the 1992-93 period would have shown using the new methods. It will also continue the old survey, though with a much smaller sample, and publish these results on a three-month-average basis beginning with the figures for June.
There were few changes in unemployment rates among major demographic groups last month and the quarterly survey of discouraged workers -- those who have given up looking for jobs because they think it would be fruitless -- remained at the 1.1 million level that has prevailed for more than two years.
Those working part time for economic reasons, the partly unemployed, remained at about 6.2 million -- another category showing no appreciable improvement for two years.
 
Jobless Rate in States
 Among the 11 biggest states, only New Jersey and Pennsylvania had significant changes in their unemployment rates. The New Jersey rate jumped to 7.1 percent, from 6.2, while in Pennsylvania the rate dropped the same amount, to 6.3 percent, from 7.2 percent.
Because of much smaller samples, rates for individual states show much wider swings than does the national rate, with changes of nine-tenths of a point not particularly unusual.
The report today also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours, a proxy for industrial production to be reported next Friday, edged up to 125.3 last month from 125.1. There was a decline, however, to 56.9 percent from 60.1 percent, in the proportion of industries adding, rather than shedding, workers last month.
Payroll jobs, which today were revised a bit higher for October and lower for November, could be raised perhaps 20,000 for December when full results are in, one official estimated. One reason is that there were five weeks between surveys this time instead of the usual four weeks.
Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research reported that its Leading Index of Employment retreated in December for the first time in six months.

HEADLINE: Aristide Bows to U.S. On a Haiti Conference

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from the United States, Haiti's exiled President announced today that he was making changes in a conference he plans to hold in Miami next week to help resolve Haiti's crisis.
In a statement, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide said the revised conference would focus, as the Clinton Administration had hoped, on building a broad political coalition to improve the chances of forcing Haiti's military to give up power. 
 Previously, Father Aristide said the conference would focus on refugees, which could have embarrassed President Clinton because of his policy of forcibly returning Haiti's boat people.
In addition, Father Aristide agreed to invite members of the Haitian military to the conference, which is scheduled for Jan. 14 through 16. He had originally opposed inviting the military, which ousted him in September 1991. American officials had pressed him to include them, contending that it would be hard to resolve the crisis unless they were allowed to take part.
Those invited include, among others, members of Haiti's Government and Parliament and officials from the United States, United Nations, World Bank and Organization for American States.

HEADLINE: Economics of Equality: A New View

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Most economists long believed that poor countries that wanted to grow rapidly had to expect a widening gap between the haves and have-nots. And during the Reagan era, many thought the same principle applied to wealthy nations like the United States, seeing tax cuts at the top as the best way to revive investment.
But many economists are now revising their views, having begun to see greater income equality as compatible with faster growth -- and perhaps even contributing to it. That change was much in evidence at the American Economics Association conference here this week, where a dozen or so sessions focused on inequality. 
 "It's a very major shift in economists' perspectives," Joseph Stiglitz, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said.
 "There are lessons here for the United States," he added. Income disparities have been widening in the last two decades and growth has slowed from the rates of the 1950's and 60's. "Not only did trickle-down economics not solve the problems of the poor or the middle class, but it was bad growth policy."
 
Inspiration From Asia
 The new perspective is already influencing the advice that international agencies offer governments from Brazil and Mexico to the former Soviet Union.
Economists who have been studying the links between growth and equality, like Nancy Birdsall, the executive vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank, and Richard Sabot of Williams College, have been struck by the success of Asia's miracle economies, where the incomes of workers and peasants have grown even faster than those of executives and entrepreneurs -- and the contrast of those countries with others in Latin America and Africa where the incomes of those at the bottom have plunged.
"Growing inequality isn't a necessary byproduct of success," said Ms. Birdsall, who conducted some of the research that is changing people's perceptions. "If you have the right policies -- such as heavy emphasis on universal education -- you can have higher growth and lower inequality."
In South Korea, for example, where per capita income has grown rapidly, the most affluent fifth of the population has only about seven times as much income as the poorest fifth. The gap has been shrinking fairly steadily since the 1960's.
In Peru, however, where an average citizen's income is barely higher than in 1965, the top fifth of the population holds 17 times the purchasing power of the poorest fifth.
 Some researchers at the meeting argued that in Asian countries there was a direct cause-and-effect link between faster growth and policies that reduce inequality. "One of the strongest lessons from Asia is that equality is not only a corollary, but may actually stimulate economic growth," said Professor Sabot of Williams College, the co-author of a study with Ms. Birdsall, "Inequality and Growth Reconsidered."
The impact of less inequality is potentially large. They estimate that reducing by a third the gap between the incomes of the richest and poorest households could add seven-tenths of a percent to the growth of per capita income, year after year. Most countries' per capita income rises less than 2 percent a year.
Other economists, who agree that the old consensus is obsolete, said such results had to be interpreted with caution. Even if there was a cause-and-effect relationship, Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago said, telling Mexico to adopt the Korean model is like telling an aspiring basketball player to adopt Michael Jordan's shooting style.
 
 
 
Many Exceptions
 There are, moreover, plenty of exceptions. For example, Botswana, a tiny diamond-producing nation, has had one of the world's fastest-rising living standards for decades. But while nearly everyone has shared in the gains, the income of its elite is 27 times that of its poorest citizens.
"The empirical results are very fragile," said Robert Barro of Harvard. And the seemingly egalitarian former Soviet Union is the world's most compelling example of economic stagnation, Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury, said. "Forcing equality is not necessarily a route to growth," he said.
The ways that countries reduce inequality matter greatly, the researchers emphasized.
Asian countries did not rely on Robin Hood policies that frequently stifle entrepreneurship and investment. Instead, Asian governments did things that gave poor people the incentive as well as the means to improve their own earning power: access to high school educations, especially for women, in Singapore; land reform in Korea, and export promotion that raised the demand for unskilled factory workers, many fresh off the farm, in Malaysia.
The old view, established in the 1950's by the growth economists Nicholas Kaldor and Simon Kuznets, was largely based on the experience of the United States, Britain and many developing countries before the war. The thinking was that during the period of development, nations had to pay the price of rising inequality; the opportunity to get rich provided incentives for entrepreneurs to accumulate the capital needed for industrialization.
 But the new research suggests that such logic omits the important role that poor people play in development, and Ms. Birdsall and Professor Sabot offer three reasons why declining inequality may foster growth.
 
 
 
Investing in 'Human Capital'
 For one thing, the groups at the bottom of the scale have more income -- often two and three times as much -- and therefore can invest more in "human capital" like literacy or better health. What researchers have largely overlooked until recently is that poor people in poor countries "save" by devoting more resources to children, feeding them better, taking them to the clinic and sending them to school. Those investments in "human capital," new research shows, may be as important as investments in factories.
"Even when the poor see there's a big payoff to investing in their children, they often can't afford to make those investments," Professor Sabot said, referring to countries with larger gaps between rich and poor.
Less inequality may also increase the productivity of the lowest-income group by increasing the rewards for staying in school or working hard.
The economists also said there was mounting evidence that more equality could foster political stability, making it easier for governments to stick to sound economic policies.
"When people can share in the gains of growth, they are more prepared to share the sacrifice necessary to keep growth on track," Ms. Birdsall said.

The Economy
The job market strengthened further last month, with payrolls swelling by 183,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 6.4 percent. Economists said the numbers supported optimistic forecasts for the economy in the early months of 1994 but that they did not frighten those watching for symptoms of revived inflation.

HEADLINE: Stocks In Broad Rally As Interest Rates Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Stock prices rose across the board yesterday in a rally led by the shares of banks, brokerage firms and telephone companies, which were bolstered by declining interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average recorded its third consecutive record close, climbing 16.89 points, to 3,820.77. For the week, the Dow gained 66.68 points. 
 Broader market indicators also rose, but remained below their previous highs. Trading was heavy, exceeding 300 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the fourth consecutive session, although volume was down somewhat from Thursday.
"The market was buoyed by stock groups, like banks and telephone companies, which do best when interest rates fall," said Bill Beise, a partner at Wessels Arnold & Henderson in Minneapolis.
Yesterday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell sharply, to 6.22 percent from 6.34 percent, after the Labor Department said the economy added 183,000 jobs. The report suggested that the economy was growing more slowly than previously thought. Economists had forecast an increase of 215,000 jobs.
 
Fed Delay Expected
 The employment report prompted some analysts to predict that the Federal Reserve would take longer than expected to raise money market rates. "The Fed is going to do something, but it's going to be later rather than sooner," said John Niedenberger, vice president at Advanced Investment Management L. P.
Still, some traders and analysts said the stock market would have a difficult time making further gains.
"The thinking is interest rates have bottomed and will rise gradually over the next several months," said Daniel Marciano, senior vice president in equity trading at Dillon, Read & Company. As rates go higher, investors tend to shift their money from stocks to fixed-income securities.
The decline in interest rates yesterday bolstered a number of bank stocks, including Banc One, which rose 1 1/8, to 38 1/8, and Wells Fargo, which rose 3 1/8, to 130 3/4.
Among brokerage stocks, Merrill Lynch & Company gained 2, to 42 1/8; Morgan Stanley rose 3 3/8, to 72 5/8; Salomon surged 1 1/4, to 47 1/2, and Charles Schwab climbed 1 3/4, to 32 1/8.
Telephone stocks were led higher by Ameritech, up 1 1/8, to 74 3/8; BellSouth, up 7/8, to 55 1/2, and Southwestern Bell, up 3/4, to 39 1/4.
Trading in shares of Paramount Communications, Viacom, Blockbuster Entertainment and QVC Network were halted before the close late yesterday. Viacom then announced that it had submitted a bid to acquire 50.1 percent of Paramount shares for $105 a share in cash. The cash portion of the Viacom offer exceeds QVC's proposal of $92 a share in cash for 51 percent of Paramount's stock. Viacom also said it planned an $8.4 billion merger with Blockbuster.
Shares of Paramount stopped trading at 79 1/4, a rise of 3/4. Viacom's class B shares fell 1 3/4, to 41; Blockbuster fell 1 5/8, to 28 1/4, and QVC rose 1 1/8, to 40 5/8.
Shares of cellular communications companies gained after Smith Barney Shearson issued a report recommending investors "buy" several of the stocks. Contel Cellular rose 1 1/2, to 18; Centennial Cellular rose 1, to 21 3/4, and Vanguard Cellular Communications' class A shares gained 1, to 31.
Golden West Financial rose 4 1/2, to 43 3/4, after its rating was raised to an intermediate "above average" by Merrill Lynch.
In Tokyo, Japanese stocks rallied, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues gaining 242.02 points, to 18,124.01.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Surge on Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose sharply yesterday, and interest rates fell after the release of unemployment data for December that indicated the economy was growing only moderately as 1993 ended.
Long-term rates had crept up in late December and early January, as economic data for November showed stronger-than-expected growth. That concerned many bond traders, who reasoned that it could lead to higher inflation and that the Federal Reserve might then raise interest rates to counter it. On Monday, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond reached a four-and-a-half-month closing high of 6.41 percent. 
 But the Government's December jobs report yesterday, which provided the first dependable economic data for that month, quashed for the moment any notion of near-term credit tightening, traders said.
 
Long Bond Yield Off
 The yield of the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 6.22 percent, from 6.34 percent Thursday. Yesterday's level was the lowest since Dec. 23, when it was 6.21 percent. As traders sought to buy the bond and lock in its yield, its price rose 1 5/8, to 10013/32 , or about $15 per $1,000 face value.
The lower interest rates were also good news for stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.89, to a record 3,820.77, ending the week with a 66.68-point advance. [Page 40.]
Yesterday was the second consecutive day that the 30-year bond's yield declined significantly. On Thursday, it fell to 6.34 from 6.40 percent on remarks by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich that the unemployment report would show that fewer jobs were created in December than Wall Street had expected.
The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls grew by 183,000 jobs, indeed lower than the 215,000 new jobs Wall Street economists had expected. Mr. Reich had said 160,000 to 200,000 jobs were added to payrolls in December.
 
Jobless Rate at 6.4%
 The unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent, a three-year low.
Some traders said the December jobs number was the first of other data expected to show the economic expansion had moderated late in the year, and that could lead to still lower rates.
"Interest rates are likely to head lower going into the consumer price and producer price indexes to be released next week as the market shifts its attention to inflation numbers," Jay Goldinger, market strategist at Capital Insight Inc. in Los Angeles, said.
Also released yesterday were figures for November consumer credit outstanding. The numbers were released in the afternoon and showed an increase of $6.9 billion, in line with expectations. October's number was lowered to a $7.7 billion increase, from $8.1 billion originally.
The relief over the employment numbers brought heavy trading volume yesterday, with money managers -- inactive of late -- showing wide interest in Treasury securities.
 
Supply of Treasuries Light
 Analysts at MMS International said another positive condition for the market was a prevalent lighter supply of Treasury securities, although concerns about the size of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction in February are beginning to brew.
Charles S. Roden, managing director and head of fixed income trading at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, described yesterday's trading as the first day all week in which retail trading was heavy, both in municipals and treasuries.
"It was very active, with trading heavy and characterized as a liquid market," he said. "And obviously the catalyst was the jobs report. Before the numbers were released the market was down about a half- point; after they were released it was up one-half before you could blink an eye."
By the close of the New York cash market, the rate on a three-month bill was 3 percent, down four basis points, while the rate for a six-month bill was 3.14 percent, down eight basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The two-year note due December 1995 was at a price of 100 3/8, up 9/32 to yield 4.05 percent, while a five-year note due December 1998 was at a price of 100 1/2, up 3/4 to yield 5.01 percent. A 10-year note due August 2003 was 10025/32 , up 13/32 to yield 5.64 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Would Temper Oil-Spill Damage Calculation

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Dealing a setback to environmentalists, the Clinton Administration today called for "a conservative approach" to calculating how much compensation polluters should pay after oil spills. 
 Environmentalists said the proposal threatened to blunt one of their most important weapons as they seek compensation from polluters.
But the Administration said it would be better to underestimate environmental damage than to overestimate it by relying too heavily on a complex and innovative calculation that assigns a dollar value to wild species or natural resources that are never actually bought or sold.
The calculation, called "contingent valuation," uses opinion surveys to determine what value the public places on preserving such resources, then uses that value as a benchmark when the Government seeks compensation for damage to the environment.
 
What Price a Coral Reef?
 While economists consider it relatively easy to assess the value of environmental damage to a commercially useful asset, like oyster beds, it is much harder to calculate the damage to, say, a remote coral reef. This is the problem that the new method is meant to address.
The method was endorsed two years ago by an advisory panel of economists, including two Nobel laureates, who told the Government that it could be useful if it was applied carefully.
But the rules proposed today are considerably more cautious than the panel's endorsement. For example, the proposal suggests discounting by 50 percent the value that people attach to unspoiled resources.
 
Wider Applications
 The proposal disappointed conservationists, who said it would sharply curtail the usefulness of the technique. And academic experts said one proposed restriction requiring exhaustive statistical tests among large numbers of respondents would make the surveys extremely expensive.
The proposed rules, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, would apply only to oil spills, but the Interior Department is expected to adopt the same approach in rules covering a much broader range of pollution.
Sarah Chasis, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, a private environmental group, said: "Contingent valuation is one essential tool used by economists for placing a dollar value on damages to natural resources, such as whales, sea otters, birds and the entire food chain, that do not have a traditional market value.
"By placing unnecessarily strict standards on the use of contingent valuation, the proposed rule fails to hold polluters fully accountable for the environmental damage they cause, and fails to provide a strong incentive for pollution prevention."
Linda Burlington, an official at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, said the Administration was setting strict standards because it wanted the method to be "litigation-proof."
 
Need for a 'Solid Survey'
 "We have to make sure when we go into court that we have a really solid survey," she said. "So the guidelines we put in are pretty restrictive."
In its proposal, the Administration said the contingent-valuation method could be a valid tool for assessing damage to the environment, but it instructed the agencies that control publicly owned natural resources to design surveys "that would understate the natural resource damage rather than overstate the damage." The proposal was published today in more than 100 pages of fine print in the Federal Register.
The method has already proved a potent tool, as when the state of Alaska used it to calculate that the Exxon Valdez oil spill had done nearly $3 billion in damage beyond the amount actually spent to clean up the soiled beaches. Exxon settled that lawsuit for $1 billion even before the state's survey was used as evidence.
Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy research organization in Washington, said he believed the proposal was "really trying to legitimize a very shaky tool for estimating natural resource damages."
The Administration's proposal was issued after a long internal debate among scientists and economists. Several experts who have been following the issue closely said that the rules were strongly influenced by economists at the Office of Management and Budget who doubted that the new method was valid.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Sounds Confident, But Unity Proves Elusive

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Though New York State Republican leaders publicly brim with confidence about their chances of unseating Gov. Mario M. Cuomo this fall, their party remains disunited in ways that remind some of the fiasco that resulted in their crushing loss to Mr. Cuomo in 1990.
At last count, 12 men were vying for the Republican nomination, but none have been able to unite the party's key factions. And while leaders of the Republican and Conservative parties have talked about uniting behind a single challenger, tensions within and between the two parties have hamstrung their search and created the appearance of disarray among the anti-Cuomo forces. 
 "I'd be less than candid if I didn't admit that we've had problems, problems that could impair the chances of a Republican candidate for Governor," said the Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari. "It's been more a question of whose candidates will be out there than who is the best candidate for our party."
 
'Might Look at It'
 Many Republicans think that the best candidate would be United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who has said he would consider entering the race if no one can unify the Republicans.
Republican Party leaders say the large number of potential candidates is a sign of their party's vitality and Mr. Cuomo's vulnerability. Recent public opinion polls show the Governor's approval rating hovering at 34 percent, an all-time low for him. The Republicans also point to their party's victories last year in the New York City mayor's race and the New Jersey Governor's race as evidence of voters' dismay with incumbent Democrats.
And they say that 1994 is very different from 1990, when Mr. Cuomo was soaring in opinion polls and the Republicans couldn't find anyone to challenge him. At the last minute, they selected a little-known economist, Pierre Rinfret, who was trounced by Mr. Cuomo and almost beaten by the Conservative Party candidate, Herbert London, who is again a candidate this year.
"It's a strength not a weakness to have so many candidates," said William D. Powers, chairman of the state Republican Party. "You don't have one person talking about the horrendous Cuomo legacy. You have 14 or 15 out there."
 
Who's the Mystery Candidate?
 But to some Republicans, there are unsettling similarities between the 1990 and this year. Earlier this week, for instance, Mr. Powers said he was trying to encourage an unnamed millionaire to pursue the party's nomination.
Word of the "mystery candidate" caused concern, and chuckles, in some Republican circles. "Sounds like Pierre part-two," said Jay Severin, a Republican political consultant not involved in the race, noting that Mr. Rinfret had been touted in similar tones.
Mr. London, a professor of Humanities at New York University, who is considered the leading Conservative Party candidate again this year, said the failure of the two parties to unite could lead to a repeat of 1990.
"I do think the parties look somewhat foolish. Every day they trot out another name," he said. "It looks to the man on the street as if there isn't much order, as if there is internal factions, as if the Republican Party is not geared up for victory."
In October, many viewed state Senator George Pataki, 48, of Peekskill, to be the leading Republican candidate because he appeared to have the support of Mr. Powers and Senator D'Amato, who is powerful among both Republicans and Conservatives. Mr. Pataki was seen as a strong choice in some circles because he is a fiscal conservative, says he supports abortion rights and has only a small Legislative record to attack.
But Mr. Pataki's star dimmed when another important Republican, the Senate majority leader Ralph J. Marino, of Oyster Bay, said he would oppose any candidate supported by Change-New York, a conservative group that had tried to unseat Mr. Marino in 1992. The group had played an important role in helping Mr. Pataki win his Senate seat.
As an alternative to Mr. Pataki, Mr. Marino and Mr. Molinari have urged Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon to run. Mr. Solomon, a Republican-Conservative from Glen Falls, will decide whether to join the fray in the next several weeks, said Dan Amon, his spokesman.
"It's almost becoming comical that these party leaders are trying to dictate who the candidate will be," said Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman who is running. "It reminds me of the gang that couldn't shoot straight."
Among the rest of the pack, four candidates have said they plan to run in the September primary regardless of what the party does at its nominating convention. They are: Mr. London; Mr. Rosenbaum; Evan G. Galbraith, a former Ambassador to France; and J. Patrick Barrett, a former state Republican chairman and co-founder of Change-New York.
Mr. Rosenbaum and Mr. Galbraith have been building campaign warchests for months, while Mr. Barrett is a millionaire who says he is prepared to spend large amounts of his own money on a campaign.
The others considering the race are: Ronald S. Lauder, the driving force behind the New York City term-limits movement; former Representative Bill Green; Clarence D. Rappleyea, the Assembly minority leader; state Senator Roy M. Goodman of Manhattan; state Senator Dean G. Skelos of Rockville Center, and Robert L. King, the Monroe County Executive.
But overshadowing the entire pack is Mr. D'Amato. To some, his unwillingness to rule out a run represents an attempt to help Mr. Pataki by keeping other candidates from entering the race. Others suggest the state's junior Senator has supported weak candidates to make sure he remains the state's strongest Republican. Mr. D'Amato denies both charges.
"Al wants to be number one," said Julian Gingold, an adviser to Mr. Galbraith. "If he had 100 percent of state control before, now with the election of Giuliani he has only 60 percent."
