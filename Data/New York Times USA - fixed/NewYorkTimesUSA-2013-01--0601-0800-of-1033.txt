HEADLINE: Robert F. Chew, 52, Actor on 'The Wire'

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Robert F. Chew, an actor best known for his roles in gritty HBO dramas like ''The Corner'' and ''The Wire,'' died on Thursday at his home in Baltimore. He was 52. 
The cause was a heart attack, said his sister, Clarice Chew.
Mr. Chew was a well-regarded stage actor when he began appearing in television shows created by or based on the work of David Simon and Edward Burns. He played a shoe salesman on ''The Corner'' and the drug supplier Wilkie Collins on the NBC drama ''Homicide: Life on the Street.''
As Proposition Joe Stewart, the portly, deeply connected and relatively civil drug kingpin on ''The Wire,'' he preferred to broker deals between rival drug factions rather than resort to violence.
''We were looking for somebody that was sensible and even paternal, as almost a foil to the rest of the brutality and ambition that you were seeing in that underground economy,'' Mr. Simon said on Friday. ''So you needed him to be incredibly human, funny, connected to whoever's in the room, and yet he's a gangster.''
He recalled one scene in which Mr. Chew used four different voices while calling a telephone number that turns out to be that of Baltimore's homicide unit. ''He becomes four different characters before your eyes,'' Mr. Simon said. ''It was a soliloquy of pure acting.''
Robert Francell Chew was born on Dec. 28, 1960, in Baltimore. He graduated from Patterson Park High School and then studied music at Morgan State University.
Mr. Chew acted in plays all over the country and taught young actors at Baltimore's Arena Players for many years.
In addition to his sister, Mr. Chew is survived by two other sisters, Tanya Chew and Maureen Little; and his mother, Henrietta Chew.

HEADLINE: Jet Engines and Energy Equipment Lift Profit at G.E.

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
General Electric on Friday reported a better-than-expected 7.5 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit and a sharp increase in its backlog of equipment orders. 
G.E. notched strong earnings growth at units that make jet engines and equipment used in oil and gas production. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, has worked to expand its presence in the energy industry in recent years.
The order backlog, watched by investors as an important indicator of future sales growth, hit a record high $210 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $203 billion in the third quarter.
''The backlog was a really good number. I didn't expect to see a $7 billion, 3.5 percent rise in the backlog,'' said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer at the Harbor Advisory Corporation, which holds G.E. shares. ''Orders in the fourth quarter must have been really good for the industrial side.''
Orders rose 2 percent and would have been up 7 percent without a sharp drop in demand for wind turbines tied to the expected expiration of a tax credit.
Solid demand in China and other oil-producing countries helped offset unsteady economies at home and in Europe, Mr. Immelt said.
''We saw real strength in the emerging markets, and the developed regions stabilized,'' Mr. Immelt told investors on a conference call.
The company, which is one of the world's biggest makers of jet engines and electric turbines, said fourth-quarter earnings rose to $4.01 billion, or 38 cents a share, compared with $3.73 billion, or 35 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Factoring out one-time items, profit was 44 cents a share, a penny ahead of analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.
Revenue rose 3.6 percent, to $39.33 billion from $37.97 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $38.76 billion.
Profit increased across all divisions, with the jet engine unit notching 22 percent growth, and GE Oil and Gas, which makes equipment used in energy production, up 14 percent.
Profit at the GE Capital finance arm, which is being scaled back, rose 6 percent.
''They saw some good organic growth in the industrial part of their business. GE Capital was a strong contributor,'' said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, a G.E. shareholder.
Over the last few years, G.E. has bolstered its position in the energy industry.
It has broadened its lineup of equipment used in oil and gas production and mining, with an eye toward capitalizing on surging natural gas production in the United States. G.E. also makes medical equipment and railroad locomotives.
At the same time, Mr. Immelt has concentrated on cutting costs across the company to try to raise operating profit to 15.8 percent of sales by the end of 2013.
Shares of G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., rose 74 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $22.04.

HEADLINE: The Fed in Slow Motion

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Federal Reserve policy makers convened in August 2007, one of the nation's largest subprime mortgage lenders had just filed for bankruptcy, and another was struggling to find the money it needed to survive.
Officials decided not to cut interest rates. The Fed did not even mention housing in a statement announcing its decision. The economy was growing, and a transcript of the meeting that the Fed published on Friday shows officials were deeply skeptical that problems rooted in housing foreclosures could cause a broader crisis.
''My own bet is the financial market upset is not going to change fundamentally what's going on in the real economy,'' William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told his colleagues at the meeting.
That was on a Tuesday. By Thursday, the European Central Bank was offering emergency loans to continental banks, the Fed was following suit, and an alarmed Mr. Poole had persuaded the board of the St. Louis Fed to support a reduction in the interest rate on such loans. The somnolent Fed was lurching into action. 
''The market is not operating in a normal way,'' the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told colleagues on a hastily convened conference call the next morning. Mr. Bernanke, a former college professor and a student of financial crises, was typically understated as he explained that the Fed was pumping money into the financial system because private investors were fleeing. ''It's a question of market functioning, not a question of bailing anybody out,'' he said. ''That's really where we are right now.''
More than five years later, the Fed continues to prop up the financial system, and the transcripts of the 2007 meetings, released after a standard five-year delay, provide fresh insight into the decisions made at the outset of its great intervention.
They show that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues continued to wrestle with misgivings about the need for action, because at the time there was little evidence of a broader economic downturn. Several officials worried that the economy would instead overheat, causing inflation to rise. By December, as the Fed began to act with consistent force, the economy was already in recession.
Officials lacked clear information, relying on anecdotes like a reported conversation with a Wal-Mart executive who said Mexican immigrants were sending less money home. They were also limited by economic models that could not simulate the problems that seemed to be unfolding.
''This may be a situation in which you will have to resolve your ambivalence quickly,'' Timothy F. Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warned in September. ''You may not be able to resolve it.''
They questioned, too, the Fed's ability to stimulate the economy, an issue that is still at the center of the debate about its policies.
''There's no guarantee whatsoever that this thing will do what we're trying to do,'' Donald Kohn, then the Fed's vice chairman, said at a meeting later in August. As the Fed debated a strategy to encourage bank lending, he said, ''I just think it's worth giving it a try under the circumstances.''
But eventually, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues concluded that they could see the future, that they did not like what they saw and that it was time to act.
''At the time of our last meeting, I held out hope that the financial turmoil would gradually ebb and the economy might escape without serious damage,'' Janet L. Yellen, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in December. ''Subsequent developments have severely shaken that belief. The possibilities of a credit crunch developing and of the economy slipping into a recession seem all too real.''
The Fed's eventual response, which it expanded significantly in 2008 and 2009, is now widely credited with preventing an even more catastrophic financial crisis and a deeper recession. It is not clear that quicker or stronger action in the fall of 2007 would have made a big difference. Critics focus instead on the Fed's earlier failure to keep banks healthy and to prevent abusive mortgage lending, and on its later role in allowing the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.
''The outcome would have been different only if the Fed and others had reacted back in 2004, 2005, 2006'' to curtail subprime mortgage lending, Mr. Poole, now a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on Friday in an interview on CNBC.
The transcripts show that the Fed entered 2007 still deeply complacent about the housing market. Officials knew that people were losing their homes. They knew that subprime lenders were blinking out of business with each passing week. But they did not understand the implications for the rest of the nation.
''The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained,'' Mr. Bernanke said in March.
Officials said at the time that they took particular comfort in the health of the largest banks. Even as the housing market deteriorated, the Fed approved acquisitions by some of the banks with the largest exposure to subprime mortgages, like Citigroup, Bank of America and the Cleveland-based National City.
By the early August meeting, Fed officials had moved from denial to puzzlement. American Home Mortgage, a leading subprime lender, had filed for bankruptcy the previous day. Countrywide Financial, another lender, was looking for a lifeline. The investment bank Bear Stearns had liquidated a pair of mortgage-focused hedge funds.
''It is an interesting question why what looks like $100 billion or so of credit losses in the subprime market has been reflected in multiple trillions of dollars of losses in paper wealth,'' Mr. Bernanke said at the meeting, referring to the decline of global financial markets.
Three days later, the Fed moved from puzzlement to action.
It acted again the next week. There was, Mr. Bernanke said on a conference call on Thursday, ''a certain amount of panic, a certain amount of markets seizing up, with good credits not being able to be financed, and a good deal of concern that there is a potential for some downward spiral in the markets that could threaten or harm the economy.''
The Fed's response was relatively modest. It cut the interest rate on loans from its discount window, at which banks borrow from the central bank, by half a percentage point to 5.75 percent, and let banks borrow for up to 30 days rather than reapply daily. Then it arranged for four large banks -- Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wachovia -- to take what it called symbolic loans of $500 million.
Mr. Bernanke wanted to avoid cutting an interest rate that banks paid each other, according to the transcripts, because he did not want to give the impression that the Fed was engaged in the rescue of investors, banks or borrowers that made bad decisions.
''My own feeling is that we should try to resist a rate cut until it is really very clear from economic data and other information that it is needed,'' he said. ''I'd really prefer to avoid giving any impression of a bailout.''
But private sources of financing were drying up. The premium banks paid to borrow from other banks, without pledging collateral, widened to 0.85 percentage points in mid-September from 0.1 percentage points in mid-August.
In September, after the government announced that employment had declined in August, the first monthly fall in seven years, the Fed announced that it would reduce its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2003. To punctuate the decision, it cut rates by half a percentage point rather than the more typical quarter-point cut. This time, it mentioned the housing crisis.
But the Fed's biggest steps did not begin until December, when it created the Term Auction Facility, the first of several programs intended to pump money into the financial system, and arranged to put dollars into the European financial system in partnership with the European Central Bank.
By then the Fed had cut rates at three meetings in a row, but the disruption of financial markets was only getting worse, and the economy was showing strain.
The Fed's own staff still forecast that the economy would avoid a recession.
''We came up with this projection unimpaired and on nothing stronger than many late nights of Diet Pepsi and vending-machine Twinkies,'' David Stockton, a Fed economist, said as he presented the forecast in December.
Mr. Geithner said it was time to prepare for a crisis. ''I don't think the past four to six months have been kind to those who have argued that this was just a mild and transitory bump,'' he said.
The economy might still grow, but it seemed increasingly likely ''that we have a deep and protracted recession driven as much by financial headwinds as by other fundamentals,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''There are good arguments for the former, the more benign scenario, but we need to set policy in a way that reduces the probability of the latter.''

HEADLINE: In Reversal, House G.O.P. Agrees to Lift Debt Limit

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Williamsburg, Va.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Backing down from their hard-line stance, House Republicans said Friday that they would agree to lift the federal government's statutory borrowing limit for three months, with a requirement that both chambers of Congress pass a budget in that time to clear the way for negotiations on long-term deficit reduction.
The new proposal, which came out of closed-door party negotiations at a retreat in Williamsburg, Va., seemed to significantly reduce the threat of a default by the federal government in coming weeks. The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said he was encouraged by the offer; Senate Democrats, while bristling at the demand for a budget, were also reassured and viewed it as a de-escalation of the debt fight. 
The change in tack represented a retreat for House Republicans, who were increasingly isolated in their refusal to lift the debt ceiling. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had previously said he would raise it only if it were paired with immediate spending cuts of equivalent value. The new strategy is designed to start a more orderly negotiation with President Obama and Senate Democrats on ways to shrink the trillion-dollar deficit.
To add muscle to their efforts to bring Senate Democrats to the table, House Republicans will include a provision in the debt ceiling legislation that says lawmakers will not be paid if they do not pass a budget blueprint, though questions have been raised whether that provision is constitutional.
That ''no budget, no pay'' provision offered Republicans a face-saving way out of a corner they had painted themselves into -- and an effort to shift blame for any default onto the Senate if it balks. The House Republicans' campaign arm quickly moved from taunting Democrats about raising the government's borrowing limit to demanding that they sacrifice their paychecks if they fail to pass a budget.
''The Democratic-controlled Senate has failed to pass a budget for four years. That is a shameful run that needs to end, this year,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement from Williamsburg. ''We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem.''
House Democrats met the deal with scorn, indicating they would inflict maximum political pain by making Republicans either break a campaign promise to carry it to passage or defy their leaders. But other Democrats were more sanguine. The president had said he would not sign a short-term debt ceiling increase, but a senior administration official said that as long as there were no surprises, the White House was likely to accept the House's offer. Most important, the official said, Republicans had broken from the ''Boehner rule'' imposed in 2011: any debt ceiling increase was to include a dollar-for-dollar spending reduction.
The decision represents a victory -- at least for now -- for Mr. Obama, who has said for months that he will not negotiate budget cuts under the threat of a debt default. By punting that threat into the spring, budget negotiations instead will center on two earlier points of leverage: March 1, when $1 trillion in across-the-board military and domestic cuts are set to begin, and March 27, when a stopgap law financing the government will expire.
Reordering the sequences of those hurdles was central to the delicate Republican deliberations that resulted in the new plan. In the days leading to the Williamsburg retreat, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and former vice-presidential nominee, had been meeting with the leader and three past chairmen of the conservative House Republican Study Committee to discuss a way through the debt ceiling morass.
Those conversations led into Thursday morning, when Mr. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, opened the retreat by going through the timeline for the coming budget fights, according to aides who were there.
They turned the floor over to Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the House Ways and Means chairman, who delivered a blow-by-blow description of the economic disaster that could be wrought by a government default. Mr. Camp also talked through the notion held by some Republicans that the Treasury Department could manage a debt ceiling breach by channeling the daily in-flow of tax dollars to the most pressing needs, paying government creditors, sending out Social Security checks and financing the military. His message was that it would not work, the aides said.
Then Mr. Ryan stood to talk over the options he had developed with the House conservative leaders. They could do a longer-term debt ceiling extension with specific demands, like converting Medicare into a voucherlike program. Or they could lower expectations, reorder the budget hurdles with a three-month punt, and add the ''no budget, no pay'' provision.
Persuading Republicans who adamantly oppose raising the debt ceiling took some time, and the ensuing discussion stretched on and on, breaking at noon for lunch on Thursday, resuming at 2:30, until 4 p.m., then concluding Friday.
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority whip, met with freshmen early Friday to make sure they were on board. Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor joined Mr. Ryan for one last meeting with conservative leaders -- Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Jeb Hensarling of Texas and Tom Price of Georgia -- to make sure they were on board. Then the top four leaders sealed the agreement midmorning.
Mr. Obama will unveil his own 10-year budget plan in February, laying out his tax and spending plans for his second term. But Senate Democrats, for the past four years, have refused to move a budget blueprint to the Senate floor, in violation of the Budget Act of 1974, which laid out new rules for controlling deficits.
For the past two years, House Republicans have approved sweeping budget plans that would fundamentally remake Medicare and Medicaid, sharply reduce domestic spending, increase military spending and order a wholesale rewriting of the federal tax code. But without Senate negotiating partners, those plans, written by Mr. Ryan, have been more political statement than legislative program.
''This is the first step to get on the right track, reduce our deficit and get focused on creating better living conditions for our families and children,'' Mr. Cantor said. ''It's time to come together and get to work.''

HEADLINE: Transcripts Revive a Tiff Of Two Fed Presidents

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Peter Eavis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As the financial crisis gathered strength in the summer of 2007, two regional Federal Reserve presidents had a curt exchange over whether one of them -- Timothy F. Geithner, now the Treasury secretary -- might have shared too much information with bankers. 
And the official who made the assertion, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, reiterated it on Friday.
The original exchange came on a video conference call of Fed policy makers in August 2007, when Mr. Geithner was head of the New York Fed. It came to light on Friday when the Fed released the transcripts of all its deliberations in that year.
At issue was whether Mr. Geithner might have alerted Kenneth D. Lewis, then the chief executive of Bank of America, that the Federal Reserve planned to cut the rate it charged banks to borrow at its discount window.
Fed officials are not supposed to provide details of monetary policy decisions to market participants before they are made public. Bankers could profit from the information.
After Mr. Geithner reported to the group that a range of ''market participants'' had raised questions about the Fed's practices on the discount window, he added that ''they obviously don't have any idea that we're contemplating a change in policy.''
Mr. Lacker asked the group if he could follow up, and said: ''I spoke with Ken Lewis, president and C.E.O. of Bank of America, this afternoon, and he said that he appreciated what Tim Geithner was arranging by way of changes in the discount facility. So my information is different from that.''
Mr. Geithner remained cool and reiterated that he had not shared private information of what the Fed had planned.
''Well, I cannot speak for Ken Lewis, but I think they have sought to see whether they could understand a little more clearly the scope of their rights and our current policy with respect to the window,'' Mr. Geithner said.
Asked to comment on Friday, Mr. Lacker, who continues to head the Richmond Fed, reaffirmed his account. ''My understanding was that President Geithner had discussed a reduction in the discount rate with these banks in connection with these initiatives,'' he said.
A spokesman for Secretary Geithner, Anthony Coley, declined to comment, instead citing Mr. Geithner's original response in the 2007 exchange. Mr. Lewis, who left Bank of America in 2009, could not be reached for comment.
Fed watchers said the dispute bore signs of a turf war between Mr. Geithner and Mr. Lacker. Based in Charlotte, N.C., Bank of America would have been in Mr. Lacker's domain, as head of the Richmond Fed.
On the other hand, as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee and head of the New York Fed, Mr. Geithner regularly talked to top money-center banks, even if they were not based in Manhattan. Mr. Lacker, analysts suggested, wanted to make it clear that Bank of America was his bailiwick.

HEADLINE: How Obama Can Learn From Failure

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. GERHARDT. 
Michael J. Gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law and director of the Center for Law and Government at the University of North Carolina, is the author of ''The Forgotten Presidents: Their Untold Constitutional Legacy.''

 BODY:
CHAPEL HILL, N.C.
PRESIDENT OBAMA has often invited, even encouraged, comparison to predecessors like Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan who left lasting legacies. He has carefully studied what made those great presidents great. But he can also learn from presidents known primarily for their failures.
Consider, for example, James Monroe -- the only person, besides Mr. Obama, to be the third president in a row to be re-elected. His first term, which began in 1817, was known as the Era of Good Feelings because it coincided with the demise of any viable opposition party. When he was re-elected in 1820, he won every electoral vote but one. Yet most Americans know nothing about his presidency except perhaps the Monroe Doctrine, which pledged American intervention to protect the Americas from European interference. 
Once wildly popular, Monroe is now barely remembered. First, his legislative achievements eroded over time. He signed two of the most important laws of the 19th century: the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, and the Tenure of Office Act of 1820, which restricted the terms of certain officials in the executive branch. But subsequent presidents tried to repeal or amend the laws, and the Supreme Court eventually declared both unconstitutional.
Second, Monroe had no distinctive constitutional vision. The last member of a ''Virginia dynasty,'' starting with Washington, Jefferson and Madison, he lacked their vision or stature. Even without opposition, Monroe was unsure where to lead the country. His last two years in office were so fractious that they became known as ''the era of bad feelings.'' His collapse was extraordinary in its speed.
Third, Monroe, unlike his predecessor, Madison, had no natural heir. Subsequent presidents, including his successor, John Quincy Adams, who had been his secretary of state, felt little fidelity to his legacy.
If Mr. Obama wants to avoid Monroe's mistakes, he must extend the narrative of his presidency with a view to posterity. He should consider whom he wants to follow him and which of his legislative initiatives Republicans might support. If Mr. Obama doesn't get involved in the next election or cannot produce significant bipartisan achievements, he risks having his successors belittle or bury his legacy.
Grover Cleveland, who also served two terms (though they were not consecutive), is even more forgotten than Monroe. He was the only Democrat elected in the late 19th century and the only president other than Roosevelt to have won a plurality of the popular vote in three consecutive presidential elections. (Benjamin Harrison won the Electoral College in 1888, despite having received fewer votes.)
Cleveland is forgotten because he blocked rather than built. He devoted his first term, 1885 to 1889, to vetoing laws that he thought favored special interests. He eventually cast more vetoes than any president except Franklin Roosevelt. In his second term, from 1893 to 1897, the Senate retaliated against his efforts to replace executive officials by stalling hundreds of his nominations. Cleveland successfully appealed to the public to break the impasse with the Senate, but his contempt for Congress took its toll.
In his second term, his disdain for Congress, bullying and stubbornness prevented him from any meaningful action to relieve the depression that followed the Panic of 1893. Mr. Obama, whose relations with Congress, even members of his own party, have often been distant, should take heed.
Unlike Cleveland, Calvin Coolidge had the vision and rhetoric required for an enduring legacy, but he, too, failed the test of time. Virtually unknown when he became vice president to Warren G. Harding, Coolidge inherited a scandal-ridden administration when Harding died in 1923. He worked with Congress to root out corruption, established regular press briefings and handily won the 1924 election. Over the next four years, he signed the most significant federal disaster relief bill until Hurricane Katrina and the first federal regulation of broadcasting and aviation. He helped enact the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which famously (and unsuccessfully) tried to outlaw war.
Coolidge's vision had wide appeal. His conviction that the business of America is business still resonates among many Republicans, but he squandered his good will with the Republican-led Senate when, shortly after his inauguration in 1925, he insisted on renominating Charles Warren as attorney general after the Senate had rejected his nomination. Coolidge could have easily been elected to a second full term, but he lost interest in politics after his son died in 1924. He did not help his secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, win the presidency in 1928 and said nothing as the economy lapsed into the Great Depression. He was widely ridiculed for his penchant for silence. The eventual recognition of the failures of his international initiatives and laissez-faire economic policies destroyed his legacy.
A final president whose failures are instructive to Mr. Obama is Jimmy Carter. He is best praised for what he has done since leaving office, but Americans have forgotten that he actually accomplished almost everything he wanted legislatively, including landmark laws on the environment and government ethics. Carter's failure to communicate a positive vision of his presidency was arguably even more significant in his defeat in the 1980 election than the Iran hostage crisis and the high inflation of the late 1970s.
Being re-elected does not ensure Mr. Obama a permanent legacy. His challenge is to frame an inspiring vision that ties together the formidable achievements of his first term -- the health care overhaul, the auto industry rescue, reform of financial regulations, withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden -- with goals, still not strongly articulated, for his second. He has to tell a story of his presidency that he wants Americans to remember and not allow others, particularly his detractors, to frame the narrative.
In this deeply partisan era, Mr. Obama won't be able to stand above the fray like Monroe and Coolidge, but he shouldn't become mired in it, like Cleveland and Carter. He must work with Congress rather than becoming embroiled in battles with it.
On several issues, including gay rights and the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama has appeared detached from the political process -- following rather than leading. He has only a few years to build on the real achievements of his first term and be remembered as something more than having been the first black president. By examining the failures of predecessors like Monroe, Cleveland, Coolidge and Carter, he can avoid suffering a similar disheartening fate.

HEADLINE: Sheriff of Global Banking Rides Into Town

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Watch out Wall Street and look sharp City of London -- one of the sheriffs of global capitalism is riding into town. An elegant Frenchwoman with a shiny silver bob and the smooth manners of a veteran cabinet minister and white-shoe lawyer, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, doesn't conform to the most common stereotypes of a tough law enforcer. But, on the eve of the World Economic Forum, the chummy annual gathering of the world's business elites, Ms. Lagarde delivered a strong call for firmer financial regulation around the world.
Speaking at a news conference, Ms. Lagarde decried the ''waning commitment'' to tighter financial regulations and said that finishing the post-2008 effort to fix the world's banks should be one of the three economic priorities in 2013. In an interview afterward, Ms. Lagarde elaborated on the theme, warning that robust lobbying threatened to weaken the efforts by regulators and legislators to force banks to hold more and better capital against their loans and to be more transparent. 
''I see a lot of pressure coming out of the industry,'' Ms. Lagarde said. A former corporate lawyer, Ms. Lagarde isn't naïve about that muscular lobbying, or unsympathetic to its motivations. It is, she says, ''clearly part of their jobs. They will naturally lobby to support more flexible, more accommodating regulations.''
But because of the special role of finance in the economy -- including the special support the state gives banks in times of trouble -- the ''sector warrants stronger regulation, and stronger buffers against potential risks and regular tests of their capacity to resist shocks.''
''We believe,'' Ms. Lagarde said at her news conference, ''that it is important for regulators, for supervisors, for authorities to resist aggressive industry push-back.''
In our conversation, Ms. Lagarde was quick to rebuff some of the bankers' arguments against stronger financial regulation.
When I asked her whether the weak world economy was a reason to delay tougher rules, she was uncompromising, repeating her point twice for emphasis: ''It's always the wrong time here. It's always the wrong time.''
She was equally firm when I ventured the complaint of some U.S. banks that the contested Basel III regulations that set rules for banks around the world were anti-American and placed an unfair burden on U.S. companies.
''You know, when I was sitting on the other side of the pond, I heard exactly the same story from the European banks, that it was anti-European and overly pro-American,'' Ms. Lagarde said. ''So I'm sure there must be something right about it. I think the Basel committee is trying to do as good a job as it can and is trying to resist the pressure. I certainly hope that it continues doing so.''
It is just a little more than four years since a financial crisis ripped apart the world economy, destroying millions of jobs and stunting millions of lives. Those wounds are still so fresh that you may be surprised to learn that banks, whose risky behavior caused the crash in the first place, would be putting up much of a fight at all against tighter rules.
''It's human nature,'' Ms. Lagarde told me. ''The moment the situation improves, you tend to forget about the hard times. And on this occasion, I think it is the job of policy makers, of supervisors, of regulators to constantly have that in the back of their mind and as an objective to avoid a relapse of what happened back in 2008.''
The major current battle is about capital -- how much banks should hold and how liquid it should be. Ms. Lagarde sees two other big fights in the offing.
One is the regulation of so-called shadow banking, the vast world of financial transactions that are done outside open exchanges, hidden from public balance sheets or conducted by nonbank financial institutions. ''Shadow banking is clearly developing at a steady pace,'' Ms. Lagarde warned in our interview, and ''currently escapes a degree of regulation and supervision.''
Ms. Lagarde's second worry is what she called ''forum shopping'' or ''fragmentation.'' This is the Gérard Depardieu story on an institutional level. Just as today's globalized world allows the French actor to cross borders and trade passports to escape high French taxes, global financial institutions can ''shop'' for the national home base that provides the lightest regulation. But while that may be good for individual bankers and their firms, it is dangerous for the world economy.
This distinction between what is in the interest of the banks and what is in the public interest was at the heart of Ms. Lagarde's comments.
Before 2008, a lot of people -- politicians, journalists, regulators -- conflated the two.
Particularly in the United States and in Britain, Charlie Wilson's argument that what was good for General Motors was good for America started to feel true about the economic powerhouses on Wall Street and in the City of London.
Ms. Lagarde runs the world's most important public global financial institution. When most of us think of the I.M.F. at all, it is usually as the stern enforcer of the sometimes harsh rules of international capitalism. That's why we should take Ms. Lagarde's call for tougher financial regulation particularly seriously.
''My hope is that it's improved for the public interest, not for the banks' interests,'' she told me.
''And those are not necessarily one and the same?'' I asked.
She responded definitively and with a warm laugh: ''Of course not!''

HEADLINE: Earnings Vigor Drives Another Week of Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at five-year highs on Friday as the market registered a third consecutive week of gains after a solid start to the quarterly corporate earnings season. 
Morgan Stanley was the latest Wall Street bank to report strong results. Its better-than-expected earnings came after similar report cards from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase earlier in the week.
Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 7.9 percent to $22.38. It reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank's institutional securities business.
But the rise on Friday was held back by shares of the Intel Corporation, which slumped 6.3 percent to $21.25 a day after the company forecast quarterly revenue below analysts' estimates and announced plans for increased capital spending while demand is slow for personal computers.
Another factor weighing on the market before a three-day weekend is uncertainty over the federal debt limit and spending cuts that could hamper the recovery. The markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday for Martin Luther King's Birthday.
There were signs on Friday that the question of raising the debt limit would be put off for a while.
House Republican leaders said they would seek to pass a three-month extension of federal borrowing authority next week to provide time to the Democratic-controlled Senate to pass a budget that shrinks deficits.
''It could be a big positive for the markets if we come up with a plan of spending cuts that isn't too awfully hard on the economy,'' said Bryant Evans, an investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Ill.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.68 points, or 0.39 percent, at 13,649.70. The S.& P. 500 was up 5.04 points, or 0.34 percent, at 1,485.98. The Nasdaq was down 1.30 points, or 0.04 percent, at 3,134.71.
The Dow and the S.& P. ended at their highest levels since December 2007.
For the week, the Dow ended up 1.2 percent, the S.& P. ended up 1 percent and the Nasdaq ended up 0.3 percent.
The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, fell 8.2 percent.
Also reporting stronger-than-expected earnings on Friday was General Electric. Its shares rose 3.5 percent, to $22.04.
Over all, the S.& P. 500 fourth-quarter earnings are forecast to have risen 2.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That estimate is above the 1.9 percent forecast from a week ago but well below the 9.9 percent fourth-quarter earnings forecast from Oct. 1, the data showed.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 98 3/32, and the yield fell to 1.84 percent, from 1.88 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Investing In Guns

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Charles M. Blow is off today.

 BODY:
In 2006, Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm run by the secretive financier Steven Feinberg, set out to raise $6.5 billion in a new fund called Cerberus Institutional Partners Series IV. Feinberg's reputation for extracting value from troubled companies -- by replacing management, shuttering facilities and creating ''efficiencies'' -- was such that by May 2007, when the fund was finally closed, it had gotten commitments for nearly $1 billion more than it had sought.
Cerberus Institutional Partners Series IV is the fund that took over Chrysler in 2007. It bought General Motors' financing arm, now called Ally Financial. It gobbled up hospitals, purchased bus companies, and even bought the raunchy magazine Maxim. 
It is also the fund that bought Bushmaster Firearms, the company that made the assault weapon used by Adam Lanza to massacre 20 children and seven adults in Newtown, Conn., last month. It bought Remington Arms, the maker of the pump-action shotgun that was among the guns James Holmes used to kill 12 people and wound 58 in Aurora, Colo. It bought a handful of other firearms companies, which it then merged into a new parent company, Freedom Group. At which point, Cerberus was the largest manufacturer of guns and ammunition in the country.
Not long ago, I obtained a partial list of the institutional investors that committed money to the Cerberus fund. One of the investors, the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which put in $500 million, has already announced that it will divest its gun holdings. ''We shouldn't be investing in things like that,'' says Bill Lockyer, the California state treasurer. He noted that assault weapons are illegal in California.
Most of the other big investors, however, have kept their heads down. TIAA-CREF, the financial services giant, committed $147.8 million to the Series IV fund. (''No comment,'' said a spokesman.) The State of Wisconsin Investment Board put up $100 million. The University of Texas endowment made a $75 million commitment; the Regents of the University of California kicked in $40 million; the University of Missouri endowment was an investor. So were the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension system, the Indiana Public Retirement System, and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System (which kicked in $400 million). And plenty of others.
When I called these investors to ask their rationale for investing in a fund that financed a gun ''roll-up,'' as the Cerberus strategy is called, I got three main responses. The first was that the percentage of their investment that went to Freedom Group was minuscule. ''We have a very small investment in Bushmaster, which translates to about $1 million,'' said Dianne Klein, a spokeswoman for the University of California system. (She added that the California system was going to divest its gun holdings.) Jennifer Hollingshead at the University of Missouri told me that the endowment's exposure was less than $450,000 -- ''which represents about 0.01 percent of our total portfolio.''
The second response was that, as limited partners, the institutional investors didn't have a say in how Cerberus invested the money. The fact that Feinberg decided to buy companies whose guns have repeatedly been used for mass slaughter was, in effect, his decision to make.
The third was that the core duty of a pension fund or university endowment is to maximize returns. Nobody made this point more vehemently than Bruce Zimmerman, a spokesman for the University of Texas Investment Management Company. ''We have no plans to divest,'' he said. ''We invest strictly on economic considerations, and we do not take into account social and political consideration.''
Cerberus never tried to hide what it was doing. And why would it? It was proud of its gun strategy. It held annual meetings with its investors and talked freely about Freedom Group. Investors were also aware that in 2010, Cerberus had tried (and failed) to take Freedom Group public.
But until Newtown, none of the investors gave the business a second's thought. Aurora, Fort Hood, Wisconsin -- and dozens of other mass slaughters -- came and went, and the investors stuck with Cerberus.
Newtown, it is often said, has changed that dynamic, sensitizing the country to the insanity of its gun laws, and giving gun control advocates hope that reform might finally be possible. But with the tragedy barely a month old, you can already feel the pushback. Supporters of the National Rifle Association in Congress are vowing to resist any effort to tighten the nation's gun laws. Gun-friendly state legislators are pushing absurd laws aimed at pre-empting federal gun legislation. And then there are the investors, who have a unique ability to push companies to change, if they so choose. (Just recall the South African boycott.)
What I learned this week is that, Newtown notwithstanding, too many of them have other priorities. Making money is still more important that saving lives.

HEADLINE: Ryan Returns to Spotlight at House Republican Retreat

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WILLIAMSBURG, Va. -- When House Republicans arrived from the nation's capital in the colonial capital this week, they were greeted by a brigade in traditional garb. Men in tricornered hats twittered away (on the fife), and three founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry and George Washington -- stopped by to give speeches.
Over two and a half days that ended Friday, Republicans holed up at the stately Kingsmill Resort for their annual retreat tried to game out the year. The resort bills itself as a ''golf, spa and luxury hotel,'' but few of the members had much time for pleasure; as the majority in the House staring down a Democratic-led Senate and Democratic White House, there was work to be done. Even Speaker John A. Boehner, an obsessive golfer, was unable to slip away for a round. (The chilly damp weather, with a light dusting of snow Thursday evening, didn't help). 
Though the news media were not allowed to attend the official retreat, and were sequestered in a restaurant clubhouse on the property (more on that later), here's a look at what went on:
And He's Back
When Representative Paul D. Ryan's vice-presidential bid ended in November, he returned to Congress but receded into the background, giving few interviews and, save for a high-profile vote in favor of the ''fiscal cliff'' deal, keeping his head down. But for those wondering about Mr. Ryan's next act, the answer came into relief Thursday, when he addressed journalists as something of the official spokesman for his conference.
''We think the worst thing for the economy, for this Congress and this administration would be to do nothing to get our debt and deficits under control,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We know we have a debt crisis coming. This is not an 'if' question, it's a 'when' question.''
There had been some suggestion that Mr. Ryan might be considering a presidential bid in 2016 and despite his perch as Budget Committee chairman, was going to pull a rope-a-dope, allowing the House leadership to shoulder the responsibility on coming fiscal fights. But he took a front-and-center role at the retreat, both in public and behind the scenes.
Mr. Ryan was one of only two legislators officially trotted out before the gathered reporters to speak on the record, and he was the one who gave his fellow members a dose of bitter medicine, warning, ''We also have to recognize the realities of the divided government that we have.''
He was also the first to publicly mention that his conference was open to the idea of a short-term extension of the debt limit, which ultimately became the biggest news out of the retreat.
If Williamsburg marked the premiere of the 113th Congressional House Republicans, Mr. Ryan apparently intends to take a starring role.
Debt Limit, Debt Limit
The Republican retreat is meant to be an opportunity for members to discuss the coming year. But the most important strategic decision, it seemed, involved only the first 90 days.
So what does the first quarter of 2013 hold? A possible short-term extension of the debt ceiling, which emerged as a proposal on which nearly the entire conference was able to come to rare consensus. But other than the fiscal wrangling to come, Republicans still trying to get their bearings after the November elections did not seem to delve too deeply into the other big issues they are certain to confront.
When Representative John C. Fleming of Louisiana wandered over to the clubhouse to chat with reporters Thursday afternoon, he said that gun control and immigration -- two of three major issues on the White House's plate -- had not even come up.
Another participant later clarified that gun control had been discussed, albeit briefly. The verdict: ''In terms of legislation, the Senate will almost certainly act first,'' the official said.
Full Cry
Though House Republicans have struggled to marshal the majority of their majority on two big-ticket votes, the bare 218 required to pass legislation is no longer sufficient to satisfy Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority whip.
He wants the ''full cry.''
The term ''whip,'' Mr. McCarthy explained, derives from a fox hunting expression. A ''full cry,'' he added, is the call made when the dog catches the scent of the fox.
When a ''full cry'' comes, all of the other dogs -- in the case of this metaphor, presumably, the House Republicans -- fall into line, pursuing the prey with unified vigor. And this ''full cry'' is exactly what Mr. McCarthy hopes for from his whip team and conference.
On the first night of the retreat, he even presented members of his whip team with sleek new black jackets -- with the ''full cry'' slogan emblazoned on the sleeve in white letters.
To the Stocks
While the House Republicans were treated to colonial festivities (and breakout session after breakout session), the news media were banished to the stocks, confined to a single room in the clubhouse. When several reporters tried to go to an adjoining room to sit by the fire, they were promptly scolded and told they could leave only to eat or use the bathroom.
Meanwhile, a lectern -- with five American flags -- had been set up for the possibility of televised news conferences, but on Friday morning, the official word came: There would be no briefings, the House leadership would not be holding a news conference after all. At that point, the assembled reporters began beating a retreat of their own -- back to the nation's capital for the presidential inauguration.

HEADLINE: In Budget Talks, Getting To 'Yes'

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
The Republican leadership blinked.
They agreed Friday to postpone their showdown with President Obama for three months after initially vowing there would be no deal on raising the debt ceiling without spending cuts. But before they and the Democrats embark on yet another round of contentious and seemingly dysfunctional tax and budget talks, here's a simple suggestion: a crash course in negotiating tactics.
When I broached the idea to Daylian Cain, who teaches a popular class in negotiating at the Yale School of Management, he immediately volunteered to take his course to Washington. ''I'll show up with my PowerPoints and a bottle of Scotch,'' he said.
What might President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, the most vocal participants in the latest standoff, learn? Perhaps that they've been falling into some classic but avoidable pitfalls, and that they could achieve some of their most important goals without subjecting the financial markets, the American people and the global economy to yet another high-stakes and damaging game of chicken. 
''This isn't rocket science,'' William Ury told me this week. Dr. Ury, along with Roger Fisher, who was a law professor at Harvard at the time, wrote the classic work on negotiating, ''Getting to Yes,'' and has been refining his insights at the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. ''It's sad to watch this kind of brinkmanship,'' he said. ''There are plenty of ways to arrive at a good, responsible agreement that's satisfactory to each side and, above all, is good for the country. You could put some high school students together and they could do it.''
Seth Freeman, who teaches negotiation and conflict management at Columbia Business School and N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business, added: ''I'm marveling at the postures each side is taking, given the stakes. It gives you vertigo.''
Mr. Obama and the Republican leaders have shown scant evidence that they've absorbed any of the lessons that are now standard fare in the nation's leading law and business schools. In each successive round of talks, they've expressed mounting anger and frustration, which only creates ''huge and unnecessary obstacles to reaching an agreement,'' Dr. Ury said.
Until the Republicans gave in on Friday, their positions seemed only to have hardened. Mr. Obama said he wouldn't even talk to Republican leaders about raising the debt ceiling, saying at a news conference this week that ''they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy.'' This is a standard negotiating stance, which is refusing to even discuss an issue, coupled with some provocative name-calling, since the use of ''ransom'' suggests that Republicans are pirates or hostage takers.
''That's a very high-risk, high-return approach,'' Professor Freeman said.
''If you can convince the other side you are truly committed to your position and there's no going back, and the other side believes you, you can win. But if not, and they call your bluff, you've got a Dr. Strangelove situation. I see similar rhetoric from the Republican side.''
For their part, the Republicans were taking a similarly hard line, at least until Friday. Mr. Boehner said he wouldn't engage in any more one-on-one negotiations with Mr. Obama, and both he and Mr. McConnell had said they wouldn't support raising the debt ceiling without addressing the deficit with spending cuts. They also refused to discuss further tax increases, saying that Republicans are ''done'' with that after the fiscal cliff deal raised taxes on the wealthy.
Dr. Ury said Thomas Schelling, a former economist at Harvard, compared the standoff to two trucks hurtling toward each other. One driver rips out the steering wheel and throws it out the window.
Professor Cain described the standoff as a ''game of chicken'' where ''each side refuses to swerve.''
Basically, he continued, ''this tactic aims at claiming a large portion of the pie: 'Give me everything or I walk.' That's a very aggressive approach, and doesn't foster creative deal-making at all. There's no communication, so there's little chance for a win-win outcome. So far, this has been a vicious circle. Each round of negotiations has been worse than the last and has begotten hostility. Reputations are on the line. Obama is worried about being too soft, so he's being super firm. Boehner faces a revolt in the House.''
Professor Cain recommended some lower-stress social events, like a bipartisan White House poker game with Congressional leaders.
''Maybe they could build some social capital for cliffs to come,'' he said.
Dr. Ury added, ''So much of what we're seeing is being driven by emotion, anger, frustration and feelings of betrayal.'' In all negotiations, he said, ''a key is to distinguish between the people and the merits. It doesn't have to be so personal. Both sides need to take a deep breath, keep their eyes on the prize, and focus on what will serve their party and the needs of the nation.''
Dr. Ury calls this ''going to the balcony,'' which means to step back, let emotions simmer down and cultivate a more objective view of what the sides have in common.
Professor Freeman agreed that ''you don't have to like each other to get a deal, even a good one.''
He noted that history is filled with examples of successful negotiations between bitter enemies, like the one that resulted in the Arab-Israeli Camp David peace accords.
What dismayed all the experts I spoke to was that the hostile tone was obscuring the fact that both sides agreed on the two most fundamental issues; the debt ceiling needs to be raised and a government default avoided, and the long-term deficit needs to be addressed through some combination of spending cuts and tax increases.
''They have a lot of common ground,'' Professor Cain said. ''At the end of the day, these are patriotic Americans who care about their country and are devoting their professional lives to making America better. They're under partisan pressures, but they're similar. They can surely sympathize with each other, one would think.''
The three experts I consulted agreed that Mr. Obama had the stronger hand. But for any real progress, both sides need a face-saving way to reach a compromise. Each needs to get something to sell to its constituency. ''In any negotiation, you have to think both about how you get what you want and how you help the other side save face.'' Professor Cain said. Professor Freeman added: ''How do Boehner and McConnell deal with Tea Party, talk radio, Fox News, their base? If they can find some way to declare victory, some measure of cover, that may be a way out.''
Dr. Ury offered a possible solution: President Obama could agree to begin longer-term debt and spending negotiations now, and Republicans would drop their objections to raising the debt ceiling, without explicitly linking the two. ''Both sides get something,'' Dr. Ury said. ''The president would strengthen his hand and it would be good for the country. He could convey the message that to get spending cuts, you don't have to hold a gun to the head of the country. The Republicans would be hard-pressed to say no. They can say that spending cuts are back on the table. They could aim for a 'Grand Bargain' or maybe a series of smaller bargains.''
That's pretty close to what the Republicans have now proposed, which is tethering an agreement to raise the debt ceiling to a pledge to engage in long-term deficit reduction.
Lurching from one fiscal cliff to another and the lack of constructive engagement by the nation's leaders seems to have left all three negotiating experts shaking their heads. ''Their behavior seems juvenile, but these are smart people,'' Professor Cain said. ''I guess there can be stupidity at the highest levels, but when I see something so reckless and scary, I wonder, is there something I don't know about the situation? I figure there must be more going on, because otherwise it certainly seems scary to me.''

HEADLINE: Rushing Into a Mortgage Can Prove Costly

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE housing market in the United States is starting to show signs of improvement. Mortgage rates remain low. New construction is picking up. And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued guidelines last week aimed at protecting consumers from the types of mortgages -- like the ones that offered deceptive teaser rates or required no documentation from borrowers -- that contributed to the financial crash.
But there are still many ways that buyers or investors can end up paying more than they should. And the extra costs are so embedded in the mortgage documents -- and the mortgage rate itself -- that consumers have to be vigilant to find them. That is especially true when buyers rush into a deal and do not take the time to make sure they are not paying thousands of dollars extra in closing costs and tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars more over the life of a loan.
''People today are less concerned with pricing,'' said Joe Parsons, a loan officer at PFS Funding in Dublin, Calif. ''They're more concerned about, 'Can you get my deal done?' There are so many more moving parts.'' 
Joseph Wilbur, for instance, signed a contract to buy a co-op apartment in Forest Hills, Queens, in March 2012 and made it clear that he wanted to close quickly because he and his fiancée were getting married in August. Mr. Wilbur said the mortgage broker told him that would not be a problem.
The couple finally had their closing on Dec. 13, after spending the first few months of their marriage living with his parents. A few days before closing, Mr. Wilbur said the broker gave him a good-faith estimate -- the basic information about the terms of the mortgage and the estimated costs of the loan -- that he should have had at the start. Shortly after that, he got the HUD-1 statement, which formalizes the closing costs.
''It became clear early on that the guy wasn't all that knowledgeable about mortgages for co-ops,'' he said. ''He made a whole bunch of mistakes.''
But Mr. Wilbur pressed on because he wanted to close and did not want to lose the apartment. ''As much as I was concerned that I hadn't seen something that was telling me I was paying thousands more than I had expected, I just wanted to get through with this,'' he said. ''The fact that my wife and I were getting married shortly was more of an issue. I didn't have time to start with a new bank and the whole application process.''
Mr. Wilbur's story may be a worst-case situation. But what should buyers be aware of and how can they avoid feeling cheated?
Many buyers think the good-faith estimate is the cornerstone of the mortgage process. It estimates the costs, like inspections and title insurance, buyers pay to close on a mortgage. But Mr. Parsons said the document did more to hide fees than illuminate them.
''It's essentially a useless document for the consumer,'' he said. ''It lumps a lot of costs into the figures that are carried onto the good-faith estimate rather than itemizing them.''
Rick Allen, chief operating officer of MortgageMarvel.com, a Web site that allows consumers to search for different mortgages, ran three sets of closing costs in the first week of January for the same mortgage in the New York area and got three different good-faith estimates.
The estimates for closing costs on a $300,000 house with a 30-year mortgage at a rate of 3.5 percent were between $6,911.78 and $9,742.97. The biggest differences were the origination fee the bank charged, the discount the bank gave -- or did not give -- for the particular interest rate and the cost of title insurance from a third party. The origination fee and the mortgage credit vary because they are one of the ways the lender makes money from the loan.
''The reality is the consumer needs to do lots of homework,'' Mr. Allen said. ''The government would say that you need to apply with multiple lenders and get multiple good-faith estimates. But providing an application is not always a painless process.''
He said MortgageMarvel.com offers a guarantee on the closing costs within $50. But borrowers would still have to compare various lenders to know that they were getting the best estimate.
Of course, most people don't do that. Elizabeth Safran, who owns her own public relations company in New York, said she asked a friend in her apartment building whom he had used.
''My main criteria for refinancing was to bake the closing costs into the loan so there would be no cash out of pocket,'' she said.
Instead, the broker charged her a fee to lower her interest rate, which she hadn't asked about. (She got that deleted.) And a day before the closing, she was told to bring a check for $7,000. ''When I threw a fit, they said I'd have to cancel the closing and I'd be fined $1,000,'' she said. ''I made a choice to pay it out of pocket. But it was all very vague.''
To do away with the annoyance of such surprises for borrowers, many lenders advertise mortgages with no closing costs. While buyers may not pay any extra immediately, they could end up paying a lot more in interest over the life of the mortgage since the lender is going to raise the interest rate to cover the costs, Mr. Parsons, the loan officer, said.
That higher rate makes the mortgage more attractive for the lender who can sell it at a premium if it is going to be packaged with other mortgages and sold. It also increases the profit to the lender. But that rate means the borrower is going to pay more over time than the closing costs in mortgage interest.
So what should a borrower do?
Understanding what the interest rate means is crucial. Mr. Parsons said that if a buyer called him last week and asked for the lowest mortgage rate, he could have said 2.75 percent. But to get to that rate, Mr. Parsons said, the buyer would have to pay three points. A point reduces the mortgage rate by a quarter percentage point, but it costs a half of a percent of the loan value.
Another risk is being drawn in by a low rate that is not locked in. Right before the closing, the lender could say the rate went up, and most people would pay it since they had come so far in the process. ''The best spin I could put on it is to say I thought the loan rate would move the other way,'' Mr. Parsons said. ''It happens more than you'd think.''
Mr. Wilbur said he watched his rate change many times over the nine months it took to close on this apartment. But in his case, the rate went down.
Buying a home, particularly in an environment where borrowers are being asked to provide more and more documentation, is obviously complicated. But it is also emotional.
And the revamped, four-page good-faith estimate, which the Obama administration introduced in 2011, might be worse for consumers than the old, single-sheet estimate. While the new form discloses more information, it may be harder for the average home buyer or even small-time property investor to grasp.
Richard Thaler, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Chicago business school, has thought a lot about this problem. In a column in The New York Times, he suggested that the good-faith estimate be made in electronic form so that borrowers could then turn to Web sites that could alert them to unusually high fees or other potentially bad features.
When I asked Mr. Thaler about this, he said he had come up with a simpler solution: affixing QR codes to the estimate so buyers could use smartphones to scan the code.
Until, or if, Mr. Thaler's suggestion comes to pass, the only real way to avoid paying too much for a mortgage is to take your time and question everything. But that is easier said than done when your dream home sits before you.
And after all he went through, Mr. Wilbur is happy. ''I love the apartment,'' he said. ''I'm happy to be on our own and in our own place.''

HEADLINE: A Performance Pay Model for Doctors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''New York Ties Doctors' Pay to Care Issues'' (front page, Jan. 12):
The performance pay model described in the article breaks the most important rule of performance metrics: the performance result must be in the control of the person being measured.
As a health care and government consultant certified in both performance metrics and quality improvement, I believe that the proposed model will unfairly hold physicians accountable for performance factors outside their control. 
The effect of this approach can be demoralizing because no matter how hard the physician may try, there can be no ''cause-effect'' relationship between the physicians' behaviors and their performance scores.
The physician should not be held accountable for the fact that many patients choose to overeat, drink to excess, smoke and use illegal drugs. The patient is responsible for those poor health habits, not the doctors.

No past professional generation dreamed that the public and private bureaucracies serving finance capital would commandeer the clinical profession under the false flag of wholesome reform.
WILLIAM STEINSMITH San Francisco, Jan. 12, 2013
The writer is an internist.
To the Editor:
I read your article with chagrin and an almost bitter wistfulness. Medicine was once understood as a moral profession, with physicians as paladins against disease. As a profession, we sought mastery over disease, not merely competence. Clinical skills were paramount, and knowledge and experience were the measures sought and rewarded.
The definitions of ''quality'' being discussed will not lead to making an enigmatic diagnosis at an earlier time or a more skillful surgery. The true measures are driven by internal motives of ethics and professionalism.
To many today, medicine is an economic commodity or an industry simply needing to undergo ''organizational'' reform. It never was, nor will disease let it be.
This article implies that some doctors, dripping with venality, will manipulate the system, trying to constrain their rogue behaviors. When will the regulators understand that they do not get up in the middle of the night, attend to the death of a child or fear that they simply did not know enough?
Ask any doc if what is going to be rewarded really reflects on his skills and effort. And stand a bit back for the answer.

To the Editor:
Developers of the pay-for-performance scheme planned by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation should consider potential unintended consequences of their proposal. They will exclude homeless patients and those with developmental disabilities from incentive payments.
But patients like these are most in need of better care delivery: they tend to suffer with more chronic conditions, use more health services and cost the most.
Pay-for-performance schemes that exclude such patients may perversely give physicians an incentive to ignore the most vulnerable patients, while they devote disproportionate attention to less sick patients.
Physicians who practice in city hospitals tend to be among the most mission-driven and altruistic. The Health and Hospitals Corporation should leverage that by including all patients in the incentive and distribute the bonuses to the hospitals themselves to be used to better serve patients.

HEADLINE: Stakes for France Are High as Hollande Continues an Intervention in Mali

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; John F. Burns contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
PARIS -- This was not the war President François Hollande wanted.
In just two hours last Thursday, after a plea for help from Mali's interim president, Dioncounda Traoré, Mr. Hollande decided to send in French warplanes and ground troops.
It was supposed to be a quick and dramatic blow that would send the Islamists scurrying back to their hide-outs in northern Mali, buying time for the deployment of an African force to stabilize the situation. Instead it is turning into what looks like a complex and drawn-out military and diplomatic operation that Mr. Hollande's critics are already calling a desert version of a quagmire, like Vietnam or Afghanistan.
Some here speak of Mr. Hollande's ''Sahelistan.'' Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president, reminded Mr. Hollande of ''the danger of a military operation without a clear enemy, with the risk to civilians that is bound to engender hostility among the citizens.'' He warned of ''neocolonialism.''
Mr. Hollande, who has a reputation for indecisiveness, has certainly taken on a difficult task. The French are fighting to preserve the integrity of a country that is divided in half, of a state that is broken. They are fighting for the survival of an interim government with no democratic legitimacy that took power in the aftermath of a coup. 
But Mr. Traoré, 70, does represent the internationally recognized government of Mali, said a senior French official, shrugging. And then, like every French official on the topic, he asked a questioner to imagine the alternative -- ''another Somalia'' on the western edge of Africa, lawless and dominated by Islamic radicals close to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, who would set about instituting the harshness of Shariah law all over Mali, stoning adulterers and cutting off the hands of thieves, while engaging in the drug and arms smuggling, kidnapping and terrorism that funds their notion of jihad.
That prospect, the officials insist, is why the entire region, including Algeria, has supported the French intervention, which was also backed by the Security Council. The French initiative has also had public support, if provoking quiet concern about overreaching, from allies like the United States and Britain.
It was not supposed to be this way, French officials and experts acknowledge. Sometime in the autumn, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2085, African troops from the Economic Community of West African States, or Ecowas, together with a retrained and reinspired Malian Army, were supposed to take back the north of the country. Those African forces were to be trained with the help of the European Union and guided in their mission by French forces in an advisory capacity, with the United States helping to provide financing and airborne reconnaissance, intelligence, air transport and air-to-air refueling.
France was supposed to have a largely civilian role, not itself engaged in fighting and with no troops on the ground. Ecowas and the Malians were supposed to fight their way into northern Mali and clear it of Islamists.
Just 10 days ago, before Mr. Hollande's sudden action, a senior adviser at the Élysée described how slowly the Mali operation was going. He described the difficulties with Ecowas, with squabbles over financing, training and transporting Ecowas troops, and how hard it had been to get Washington, after the Libyan civil war, to pay attention to a deteriorating situation in Mali and the risks of Islamic terrorism spreading in the Sahel.
The Americans finally started listening to French concerns last September, he said, but had their doubts about how easy it would be to drive the Islamists out of the vastness of northern Mali. And Washington did not consider the Ecowas plan to be well conceived.
The Islamist rebels chose not to wait around, of course, launching their push to the south and prompting French intervention in a singularly leading role. With 1,800 troops now in Mali and a projected total of 2,500, the French do not need help on the ground, officials insist. But they are pushing Washington to move more quickly through the interagency process to provide reconnaissance drones, air transport planes and refueling planes. European and NATO allies like Britain have already moved to help, with the British quickly providing two C-17 transport planes to move troops and equipment.
On Friday, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain gave explicit support to France and an implicit push to Washington and European allies to do more in West Africa to fight radical Islamic terrorism. ''Those who believe that there is a terrorist, extremist Al Qaeda problem in parts of North Africa, but that it is a problem for those places and we can somehow back off and ignore it, are profoundly wrong,'' he told Parliament.
Mr. Cameron called the Algerian drama a warning. ''What we know is that the terrorist threat in the Sahel comes from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which aspires to establish Islamic law across the Sahel and northern Africa, and to attack Western interests in the region and frankly, wherever it can,'' Mr. Cameron said in words that will please Paris. ''Just as we have reduced the scale of the Al Qaeda threat in other parts of the world, including in Pakistan and Afghanistan, so it has grown in other parts of the world. We need to be equally concerned about that, and equally focused on it.''
Most experts think that the French, even if they drive the Islamists out of major populated areas in the north of Mali, will not move in force throughout the vast desert. The French still mean to prepare the ground for Ecowas and Malian troops, to create the stability that can allow new political negotiations on Mali's future.
Mali will only succeed, French officials say, if the state is reconfigured, with significantly more autonomy for the Tuaregs in the north, who have long wanted their independence, and rebuilt governmental institutions and legitimacy. That of course will take some time, even if it is done under the auspices of Ecowas or the United Nations.
Camille Grand, a defense expert and director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, said the French objective is ''to return to the status quo ante, where those Islamist groups are cornered in the gray zones on the borders, with limited ability to act and not controlling population centers, where it is difficult for them to make raids or take hostages.''
Those goals, he said, are ''definitely something that makes sense from a military standpoint. But ''if the ultimate objective is to eradicate the presence of radical Islam in the Sahel,'' he warned, ''it probably won't happen; it's a bridge too far for anyone.''
In all likelihood, Paris is not that ambitious. But Mr. Hollande's critics worry that he may already have gotten himself in deeper than he planned, or even realizes. In a column Friday in Le Monde, Natalie Nougayrède wrote that the French endgame is unclear. ''In launching itself militarily in the front line, France also takes on a responsibility'' for the reconstruction of the state, she said. ''The after-intervention -- we have seen it elsewhere in the world -- is the true headache of interventions. The ultimate test will be there.''

HEADLINE: Cameron Warns That Britain Could Leave European Union

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS and ALAN COWELL; John F. Burns reported from London, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron, who canceled a long-anticipated speech because of a hostage crisis in Algeria involving Britons, planned to deliver an explicit warning that Britain might leave the European Union if changes in its administration were not made, according to excerpts from the speech released Thursday and embargoed until Friday.
According to the excerpts, Mr. Cameron would have said that without changes in the European Union, ''the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift toward the exit'' -- a statement that drew an admonition from President Obama telling Britain not to jeopardize its membership in the European Union, British newspapers reported. 
On Thursday, Mr. Cameron canceled his speech, which was to have been delivered Friday in Amsterdam, citing the need to stay in London to be on hand for developments in the hostage crisis in Algeria, where Britons were among the dozens of captives taken by Islamic militants at a natural gas plant operated partly by BP, the British-based oil giant. In Amsterdam, Mr. Cameron had planned to set out an outline of a plan to renegotiate a pared-down role for Britain in the 27-nation European Union, rebuffing the centralizing momentum in other major European nations as they struggle to save the euro, the common currency that Britain has shunned, and to call a referendum by 2018 on the result.
In advance of the speech, Mr. Cameron placed calls on Thursday to Mr. Obama and President François Hollande of France to set out what he would say, British officials said.
A White House spokesman said Mr. Obama ''underscored our close alliance with the United Kingdom and said that the United States values a strong U.K. in a strong European Union, which makes critical contributions to peace, prosperity and security in Europe and around the world.''
The warning came a week after a senior State Department official, Philip Gordon, the assistant secretary for European affairs, said a continued ''strong British voice'' in an ''outward-looking'' European Union was in America's interests, and warned specifically against the referendum on Europe, which is an important component in Mr. Cameron's plans. ''Referendums,'' Mr. Gordon said, ''have often turned countries inward.''
In the excerpts, Mr. Cameron planned to warn that there was ''a gap between the E.U. and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is -- yes -- felt particularly acutely in Britain.''
''If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift toward the exit,'' Mr. Cameron planned to say. ''I do not want that to happen. I want the European Union to be a success, and I want a relationship between Britain and the E.U. that keeps us in it.''
''People are increasingly frustrated that decisions taken further and further away from them mean their living standards are slashed through enforced austerity, or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the Continent,'' he was to say, according to the excerpts.
''And yes, of course, we are seeing this frustration with the E.U. very dramatically in Britain,'' the excerpts said. ''Europe's leaders have a duty to hear these concerns. And we have a duty to act on them.''
But according to the Press Association news agency in Britain, which published the excerpts, the comments did not reveal whether Mr. Cameron intended to commit himself to a referendum offering Britons a yes-or-no response to continued membership.

HEADLINE: Unexpected Backslide In Consumer Sentiment

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment in the United States unexpectedly declined in January for a second consecutive month to its lowest point in more than a year, a survey released on Friday showed. 
Many consumers in the survey cited the recent negotiations in Washington over spending cuts and tax increases, the so-called fiscal cliff debate, for their negative feelings.
''The handling of the fiscal cliff talks and the realization that paychecks are going to be smaller due to the sunset of the payroll tax holiday are probably weighing on consumer attitudes at the moment,'' said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies & Company in New York.
While most of the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts were avoided when Congress struck a deal on Jan. 1, the take-home pay of most American workers fell when a 2 percentage-point cut in payroll taxes expired.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 71.3, compared with 72.9 the month before. That was its lowest point since December 2011. It was also below the median forecast of 75 from economists polled by Reuters.
''The unique aspect of the early January data was that a record number of consumers -- 35 percent -- negatively referred to the fiscal cliff negotiations,'' Richard Curtin, the survey's director, said in a statement.
''Importantly, the debt ceiling debate is still upcoming and could further weaken confidence,'' he said.
Congressional Republicans said on Friday that they would agree to raise the federal government's borrowing limit to pass a budget and to begin talks on long-term deficit reduction.

HEADLINE: As Dispute Over Islands Escalates, Japan and China Send Fighter Jets to the Scene

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Martin Fackler contributed reporting from Tokyo. Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The action in the skies over the East China Sea started simply enough.
Last week, the Chinese government sent a civilian surveillance plane, a twin propeller aircraft, to fly near the uninhabited islands at the heart of a growing feud between China and Japan. Tokyo, in response, ordered F-15 fighter jets to take a look at what it considered Chinese meddling. The Chinese then sent their own fighters.
It was the first time that supersonic Chinese and Japanese military fighters were in the air together since the dispute over the islands erupted last year, significantly increasing the risk of a mistake that could lead to armed conflict at a time when both countries, despite their mutual economic interests, are going through a period of heightened nationalism that recalls their longstanding regional rivalry. 
The escalation comes amid a blast of belligerent discourse in China and as the Obama administration has delayed a visit to Washington requested by Shinzo Abe, the new prime minister of Japan, the United States' main ally in Asia. After the rebuff, Mr. Abe announced that he would embark on a tour of Southeast Asia intended to counter China's influence in the region. On Friday, as Mr. Abe cut short his trip to return to Tokyo to deal with the hostage crisis in Algeria, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Washington that Mr. Abe would meet with President Obama in the second half of February.
For Japan and China, what began as a seemingly minor dispute is quickly turning into a gathering storm, military analysts and Western diplomatic officials warn, as each country appears determined to force the other to give ground.
''What is really driving things is raw nationalism and fragmented political systems, both on the Japanese and even more so the Chinese sides, that is preventing smart people from making rational decisions,'' said Thomas Berger, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University. ''No Chinese or Japanese leader wants or can afford to be accused of selling out their country.''
The backdrop for the dispute is the changing military and economic dynamic in the region. In Japan, which rose from utter defeat in World War II to become a prosperous global economic power, many experts talk of a nation preparing for an ''elegant'' decline. But Mr. Abe has made clear that he does not subscribe to that idea and hopes to stake out a tough posture on the islands as a way of engineering a Japanese comeback.
In contrast, Beijing brims with confidence, reveling in the belief that the 21st century belongs to China -- with the return of the islands the Chinese call the Diaoyu and the Japanese refer to as the Senkaku as a starting point.
Though Japan is far richer than China on a per-person basis, its economy has been stagnant for years and contracted once again in the second half of 2012. It was hit hard by a slowdown in exports to China after the island dispute erupted in August; Chinese protesters disrupted Japanese plants in China and boycotted Japanese products during the autumn. The value of Japanese exports to China fell by 17 percent between June and November, the World Bank said this week.
China's fast-growing military still lags behind the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in sophistication of weaponry and training, but Japan's edge is diminishing, according to Dr. Berger, an expert on the Japanese military, and other Western defense analysts.
For now the Chinese military wants to avoid armed conflict over the islands, Dr. Berger said, but its longer-term goal is to pressure Japan to give up its administration of the islands. That would give China a break in what is known in China as the ''first island chain,'' a string including the Diaoyu, that prevents China's growing ballistic submarine fleet from having unobserved access to the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan is part of the ''first island chain,'' as are smaller islands controlled by Vietnam and the Philippines.
''The Chinese leadership seems to think that the cards are in their favor, and if they push long and hard enough, the Japanese have to cave,'' Dr. Berger said.
A senior American military official said that Washington considered China's decision to send its fighter jets in response to Japan's to be ''imprudent'' but not a violation of international law. The Chinese jets had entered what is known as Japan's Air Defense Identity Zone, but had not infringed Japan's airspace, the official said.
The United States was watching closely and advising restraint on both sides, because there is no established method of communication -- or hot line -- between Japan and China that can be used in the event of a confrontation. With jet fighters from both countries aloft last week, ''the potential for mistakes that could have broader consequences'' was vastly increased, the official said.
The Chinese state-run news media have stepped up their hawkish tone since the episode. On Mr. Abe's trip to Southeast Asia, which the Chinese say is intended to create a pro-Japan alliance, the overseas edition of The People's Daily newspaper said, ''Even the United States, the world's sole superpower, acknowledged that it cannot encircle and contain China, so why should Japan?''
Chinese experts express similar views. In an interview, Hu Lingyuan, the deputy director of the Center for Japanese Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, described Mr. Abe as a Japanese nationalist who was trying to overextend Japan's reach. ''The Diaoyu conflict keeps escalating,'' he said. ''A solution is not possible.'' And as the commentary became harsher, the Chinese news media stressed reports of training by the military's East China Sea units. Dozens of J-10 fighter jets participated in a live ammunition drill with the Navy's East China Sea Fleet, the state run news agency, Xinhua, reported Thursday.
Before returning to Japan, Mr. Abe spoke to reporters in Jakarta, Indonesia. He said he opposed ''changing the status quo by force,'' and called on China to behave in a responsible manner.
''The seas is a public asset that should not be governed by force but by rule of law that keeps it freely open to all,'' he said. ''We will work with Asean nations to do our utmost to defend this.'' Asean refers to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
With a top United States diplomat, Kurt M. Campbell, in Tokyo this week, Washington is urging both sides to open a dialogue.
But the initial signs are not particularly promising. On Thursday, a former Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama of the opposition Democratic Party, met in Beijing with Jia Qinglin, the chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
The setting looked conciliatory. China, however, used the occasion to make a point that was immediately rejected in Tokyo. Mr. Jia called for talks with Japan over the disputed islands, an idea that Japan has always said was unacceptable. Japanese governments have consistently maintained that the islands rightfully belong to Japan and that there is nothing to discuss.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Most Back Obama, With a Split On Party Lines

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama begins his second term on Sunday with Americans cautiously optimistic about both the years ahead and his stewardship, but more polarized politically than four years ago and with less lofty hopes.
After a first term of both big achievements and disappointments and the economy still struggling to recover from the financial crisis he inherited, Mr. Obama retains the approval of a slim majority of Americans, 51 percent, according to a pre-inauguration survey for The New York Times and CBS News. That is down from 62 percent soon after he took office four years ago, and conceals a sharp divide: 8 in 10 Republicans disapprove of how he is handling the job, while almost 9 in 10 Democrats approve. Independents are split.
The public's approval of Mr. Obama's job performance is similar to George W. Bush's rating at the start of his second term. But it is lower than the standings for the previous two-term presidents, Bill Clinton (60 percent) and Ronald Reagan (62 percent), who served in less polarized times. 
Still, Mr. Obama is in a considerably stronger position as he opens his second term, especially relative to the increasingly unpopular Republicans in Congress. The percentage of Americans who disapprove of Congress -- 82 percent -- is the highest for a new Congress since The Times and CBS News began asking the question regularly two decades ago. While neither party in Congress gets high marks, the public is far more negative toward Republican lawmakers.
That negativity appears to be causing introspection among some top Republicans. After a retreat this week in which they heard bad news from their own pollsters, House Republicans announced that they would agree to an unconditional three-month increase in the nation's debt limit without equal spending cuts immediately -- a tactical retreat that most likely reflects their sense of their disadvantage against Mr. Obama.
Nearly half the public blames Republicans for the partisan impasse that nearly blocked a needed tax agreement over the holidays, compared with almost one-third who blame Mr. Obama. Independents sided with the president by a two-to-one ratio. Almost half of Americans said the episode made them more pessimistic about Washington's ability to resolve other problems in the future.
More broadly, Americans remain deeply concerned about the state of the country. Only 38 percent said it was on the right track, compared with 57 percent calling it on the wrong track. Nearly a decade has passed since more people viewed the country on the right track than the wrong.
As for the next fiscal confrontation -- over a longer-term increase in the nation's debt limit, which is essential for the government to borrow to pay existing obligations -- the poll had some of its only good news for Republicans. Six in 10 Americans say the borrowing limit should not be raised without the White House and Congress also approving cuts in spending -- which had been the Republicans' position before their retreat -- while just 17 percent say the limit should be increased without conditions, which is Mr. Obama's stance.
''Unless the Republicans hold fast and say, 'Come to the table and give us cuts and a budget,' the Democrats will keep saying, 'We'll do it later,' '' said John Asam, 47, an unemployed Republican in Downey, Calif.
While a majority continues to disapprove of Mr. Obama's handling of annual deficits, 54 percent to 37 percent, Americans favor by about two to one his call to both cut spending and increase taxes instead of cutting spending only, as Republicans would.
''I side with the president on social issues, but I do think it's important to be moderate on financial issues,'' said Anna Kroncke, 33, a psychologist and political independent in Denver who voted for Mr. Obama both times. ''That's where it might be really helpful to compromise with the Republicans.''
But the poll holds other signs that the public sees Mr. Obama as having greater leverage than Republicans. Six in 10 say Mr. Obama will have more influence over the next four years, compared with almost 3 in 10 who say Republicans will hold sway.
''I think Barack Obama will have more influence than the Republicans in Congress because the mood of the nation has changed,'' said Sandy Brassard, 52, an independent who is a music teacher in San Francisco. ''I'm not sure what will happen with the budget and the debt, but I am very optimistic about gun control and immigration and gay marriage and even Social Security because of his stance and the mood of the country.''
More Americans say that they trust the president over Republicans in Congress to make the right decisions about the economy, budget deficits and taxes -- the fiscal issues that could dominate Mr. Obama's next term. Half favor him on those issues, while about one-third say they trust Republicans more.
On the more recent issue to join the nation's list of priorities, dealing with gun violence, not quite half say they trust Mr. Obama over Republicans; 47 percent choose the president and 39 percent Republicans.
On illegal immigration, the other issue that Mr. Obama promises to address this year, almost 7 in 10 say they are confident about the president's ability to deal with the matter. And significant majorities, including most Democrats and independents, also express confidence about Mr. Obama's ability to make the right decisions regarding Afghanistan, protecting the United States from a terrorist attack and the economy.
Now a president with a record instead of a newcomer, Mr. Obama has seen his favorability among Americans tarnish a bit. Four years ago, 6 in 10 had a favorable opinion, about 1 in 10 did not and 3 in 10 reserved judgment. Now about one-third of the country has an unfavorable view of him, though a plurality -- 46 percent -- retains a favorable opinion.
Mr. Obama's resilience despite continued high unemployment and partisan battling partly reflects that twice as many Americans continue to blame his predecessor, Mr. Bush, for the state of the economy. More also blame Wall Street, and about the same number fault Congress as Mr. Obama.
By 48 percent to 22 percent, Americans approve of his cabinet picks, despite criticism that he has favored white men, with women no less approving than men. Four years ago, Mr. Obama's cabinet choices were supported 71 percent to 22 percent.
As for much of his presidency, significantly more Americans favor his handling of foreign policy than disapprove. And more continue to disapprove of his record on the economy than approve of it, though the margin has narrowed to a statistically insignificant one as the recovery has picked up. Just 42 percent expect the economy to be better in four years than it is today.
The nationwide poll was conducted Jan. 11-15 with 1,110 adults, using land lines and cellphones, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Obama's Second-Term Options on the Environment

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: What Obama can do to cut climate risk and improve the environment in his second term. 

 BODY:
As President Obama prepares to embark on his second and final term, it's worth exploring what he can do to foster progress on environmental issues and the nation's, and world's, energy and climate challenges. In November, I sought reader input as I reported a piece on this question for Men's Journal. The focus is on steps that can be taken even with tight budgets and polarized politics.
The article was posted online on Friday. Here are some excerpts.
From the introduction: 
The temptation is to focus on issues that inflame the public, like the Keystone XL pipeline, but the president would do better to take a wider perspective. Keystone, for one, would pump only 830,000 barrels of oil from tar sands a day, about a third of the 2.3 million barrels of oil Canada already sends us, and a mere fraction of our heavily subsidized 19-million-barrel-a-day habit. We spoke to scientists, economists, and policy advisers, who recommended the most impactful environmental measures, ones that can be achieved over the course of the next four years. Here's their nine-point plan to protect the planet.
 Speed the shift from coal: 
The best tool Obama has to reduce coal use is to implement the EPA's existing Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which place limits on mercury, arsenic, chromium, nickel, and other toxic emissions associated with coal. But the coal industry has been pressuring the EPA to reconsider the standard, pushing to weaken regulations that could affect dozens of decades-old, heavily-polluting coal plants like Indianapolis' Harding Street Station, which has been in operation for 54 years.
For those who think cutting coal is too expensive in a recession, we must recognize the massive, $60 billion annual health costs associated with burning this fossil fuel - everything from cardiovascular and respiratory illness to premature death. "You could pension off all the 80,000 workers in the coal industry for a tiny fraction of the medical bills due to burning coal," says Burton Richter, a Nobel laureate in physics. [ The rest .]
 Bring more oversight to the gas age . The administration can move forward with planned rules requiring the industry to stem leaks of natural gas into the air (which is easily doable, often at a profit) and can intensify work with China and other gas-rich countries to advance gas extraction without environmental regrets. Here's another move I outlined in the magazine piece:
Seventeen environmental groups have petitioned the EPA to require disclosure of chemicals used in fracking under the Toxics Release Inventory, an effective, decades-old program that already applies to most industries (including the coal industry). Likewise, contaminated water generated in fracking can be tightly regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Toxic Substances Control Act. "Our job isn't to promote natural gas - the market is doing that because the stuff is so cheap and abundant," says Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund and an adviser to the Secretary of Energy. "Our job is to protect air and water supplies." [ The rest .]
 Cut carbon dioxide from power plants: 
President Obama can do for power plants what the administration has done for vehicles: require reductions in CO2. The EPA has proposed a Carbon Pollution Standard for Future Power Plants, which would restrict the emission of greenhouse gases, requiring coal plants, in particular, to be more efficient and cleaner. It's up to the president to move on this proposal and use his executive power to set limits on the amount of carbon pollution new power plants can emit. "There are no indications that the new Congress will be receptive to effective climate legislation," says Daniel Lashof of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But [Obama] can do these things without waiting for Congress." [ The rest. ]
 Getting corn out of gas tanks: 
The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in 2005, may sound like a high-minded environmental program. But pressing U.S. farmers to grow corn for ethanol fuel use is not good green policy. This past year, 40 percent of domestic corn crops have gone into gas tanks, even as a rise in global food prices has hurt the poorest families. And while the idea of growing fuel is a solid one, many scientists argue that turning corn into fuel has proved to be as water- and energy-intensive as drilling for oil. "It is time to take a hard look at the carbon benefits of corn ethanol and its impacts on food prices around the world," says Jonathan Foley, the director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota. [ The rest .]
I also discuss restoring bison, provisions in the farm bill that could benefit the environment, tightening control of offshore oil drilling and pressing forward -- for a host of reasons -- on United States ratification of the Law of the Sea convention. 
Here's the concluding point:
 Stop subsidizing the building boom in danger zones: 
The president and Congress should cut federal subsidies that keep the price of insurance in some high-risk zones (flood plains, coastal areas threatened by rising seas, and regions prone to wildfires) artificially - and disastrously - low. 
"If we had never created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the private market would be charging much higher premiums and it would be much more of a deterrent for people living in these places," says Eileen Fretz, director of flood management at the non-profit, American Rivers. While we're not likely to completely end government-backed insurance, last June Congress passed legislation that cut NFIP funding for businesses, second homes, and repeat beneficiaries (that is, homes that flooded multiple times). This is a good start, but we need to do more: stop giving taxpayer protection, and indirectly encouraging development, to communities behind levees. We also need to actively protect our most valuable flood protection infrastructure - wetlands, barrier islands, and dune beaches. 
Similar opportunities lie in the nation's wildfire "red zones," where the government is spending $3 billion a year on wildfire protection. "We ain't seen nothing yet," says Ray Rasker, an economist and director of Headwaters Economics. Only 16 percent of private wildland now has homes, he says. "Put climate change on top of new development, and you have a crisis." He suggests cutting support for construction of at-risk homes, doing away with breaks like the federal mortgage tax deduction. [ .]
Here's a bit more on this last point that didn't make it into the piece but is worth adding here:
Given the disastrous impact of wildfires on communities from Texas to Colorado, President Obama can order a reexamination of forest management practices on federal lands that have resulted in huge accumulations of fuel for conflagrations. He can insure that federal agencies responsible for developing codes for construction and materials move ahead with plans for national codes and standards for building in what's called the "wildland-urban interface." The standards would tighten depending on level of hazard determined through a "fire exposure severity zoning system."
Finally, Nicholas Pinter, a Southern Illinois University scientist studying flooding disasters, says Obama should consider broader shifts in the budget and bureaucracy at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which still is mainly focused on responding once a disaster has struck - with only 15 percent of its spending in such instances devoted to steps that can cut known vulnerability the next time around.
"The lessons of Katrina have been learned well, at least in terms of disaster response," Pinter says, noting that FEMA was well prepared and acted aggressively after Hurricane Sandy struck. "The same lessons need to be applied to preparing for the next disaster," he says. "Cut away the unbelievable red tape -- typically three to five years of it for approval of even the most meritorious FEMA disaster mitigation project."
There's plenty more he can do, of course, including making the case for boosted investments in basic science, basic research by industry and programs that foster youth and public understanding of science and the environment.
If you had an "Obama moment," what would you say to the president?

HEADLINE: Inequality Is Holding Back The Recovery

BYLINE: JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ


HIGHLIGHT: Our economy won't come back strong unless it also becomes more fair. 

 BODY:
The re-election of President Obama was like a Rorschach test, subject to many interpretations. In this election, each side debated issues that deeply worry me: the long malaise into which the economy seems to be settling, and the growing divide between the 1 percent and the rest - an inequality not only of outcomes but also of opportunity. To me, these problems are two sides of the same coin: with inequality at its highest level since before the Depression, a robust recovery will be difficult in the short term, and the American dream - a good life in exchange for hard work - is slowly dying.
Politicians typically talk about rising inequality and the sluggish recovery as separate phenomena, when they are in fact intertwined. Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back our growth. When even the free-market-oriented magazine The Economist argues - as it did in a special feature in October - that the magnitude and nature of the country's inequality represent a serious threat to America, we should know that something has gone horribly wrong. And yet, after four decades of widening inequality and the greatest economic downturn since the Depression, we haven't done anything about it. 
There are four major reasons inequality is squelching our recovery. The most immediate is that our middle class is too weak to support the consumer spending that has historically driven our economic growth. While the top 1 percent of income earners took home 93 percent of the growth in incomes in 2010, the households in the middle - who are most likely to spend their incomes rather than save them and who are, in a sense, the true job creators - have lower household incomes, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 1996. The growth in the decade before the crisis was unsustainable - it was reliant on the bottom 80 percent consuming about 110 percent of their income.
Second, the hollowing out of the middle class since the 1970s, a phenomenon interrupted only briefly in the 1990s, means that they are unable to invest in their future, by educating themselves and their children and by starting or improving businesses.
Third, the weakness of the middle class is holding back tax receipts, especially because those at the top are so adroit in avoiding taxes and in getting Washington to give them tax breaks. The recent modest agreement to restore Clinton-level marginal income-tax rates for individuals making more than $400,000 and households making more than $450,000 did nothing to change this. Returns from Wall Street speculation are taxed at a far lower rate than other forms of income. Low tax receipts mean that the government cannot make the vital investments in infrastructure, education, research and health that are crucial for restoring long-term economic strength.
Fourth, inequality is associated with more frequent and more severe boom-and-bust cycles that make our economy more volatile and vulnerable. Though inequality did not directly cause the crisis, it is no coincidence that the 1920s - the last time inequality of income and wealth in the United States was so high - ended with the Great Crash and the Depression. The International Monetary Fund has noted the systematic relationship between economic instability and economic inequality, but American leaders haven't absorbed the lesson.
Our skyrocketing inequality - so contrary to our meritocratic ideal of America as a place where anyone with hard work and talent can "make it" - means that those who are born to parents of limited means are likely never to live up to their potential. Children in other rich countries like Canada, France, Germany and Sweden have a better chance of doing better than their parents did than American kids have. More than a fifth of our children live in poverty - the second worst of all the advanced economies, putting us behind countries like Bulgaria, Latvia and Greece.
Our society is squandering its most valuable resource: our young. The dream of a better life that attracted immigrants to our shores is being crushed by an ever-widening chasm of income and wealth. Tocqueville, who in the 1830s found the egalitarian impulse to be the essence of the American character, is rolling in his grave.
Even were we able to ignore the economic imperative of fixing our inequality problem, the damage it is doing to our social fabric and political life should prompt us to worry. Economic inequality leads to political inequality and a broken decision-making process.
Despite Mr. Obama's stated commitment to helping all Americans, the recession and the lingering effects of the way it was handled have made matters much, much worse. While bailout money poured into the banks in 2009, unemployment soared to 10 percent that October. The rate today (7.8 percent) appears better partly because so many people have dropped out of the labor force, or never entered it, or accepted part-time jobs because there was no full-time job for them.
High unemployment, of course, depresses wages. Adjusted for inflation, real wages have stagnated or fallen; a typical male worker's income in 2011 ($32,986) was lower than it was in 1968 ($33,880). Lower tax receipts, in turn, have forced state and local cutbacks in services vital to those at the bottom and middle.
Most Americans' most important asset is their home, and as home prices have plummeted, so has household wealth - especially since so many had borrowed so much on their homes. Large numbers are left with negative net worth, and median household wealth fell nearly 40 percent, to $77,300 in 2010 from $126,400 in 2007, and has rebounded only slightly. Since the Great Recession, most of the increase in the nation's wealth has gone to the very top.
Meanwhile, as incomes have stagnated or fallen, tuition has soared. In the United States now, the principal way to get education - the only sure way to move up - is to borrow. In 2010, student debt, now $1 trillion, exceeded credit-card debt for the first time.
Student debt can almost never be wiped out, even in bankruptcy. A parent who co-signs a loan can't necessarily have the debt discharged even if his child dies. The debt can't be discharged even if the school - operated for profit and owned by exploitative financiers - provided an inadequate education, enticed the student with misleading promises, and failed to get her a decent job.
Instead of pouring money into the banks, we could have tried rebuilding the economy from the bottom up. We could have enabled homeowners who were "underwater" - those who owe more money on their homes than the homes are worth - to get a fresh start, by writing down principal, in exchange for giving banks a share of the gains if and when home prices recovered.
We could have recognized that when young people are jobless, their skills atrophy. We could have made sure that every young person was either in school, in a training program or on a job. Instead, we let youth unemployment rise to twice the national average. The children of the rich can stay in college or attend graduate school, without accumulating enormous debt, or take unpaid internships to beef up their résumés. Not so for those in the middle and bottom. We are sowing the seeds of ever more inequality in the coming years.
The Obama administration does not, of course, bear the sole blame. President George W. Bush's steep tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 and his multitrillion-dollar wars in Iraq and Afghanistan emptied the piggy bank while exacerbating the great divide. His party's newfound commitment to fiscal discipline - in the form of insisting on low taxes for the rich while slashing services for the poor - is the height of hypocrisy.
There are all kinds of excuses for inequality. Some say it's beyond our control, pointing to market forces like globalization, trade liberalization, the technological revolution, the "rise of the rest." Others assert that doing anything about it would make us all worse off, by stifling our already sputtering economic engine. These are self-serving, ignorant falsehoods.
Market forces don't exist in a vacuum - we shape them. Other countries, like fast-growing Brazil, have shaped them in ways that have lowered inequality while creating more opportunity and higher growth. Countries far poorer than ours have decided that all young people should have access to food, education and health care so they can fulfill their aspirations.
Our legal framework and the way we enforce it has provided more scope here for abuses by the financial sector; for perverse compensation for chief executives; for monopolies' ability to take unjust advantage of their concentrated power.
Yes, the market values some skills more highly than others, and those who have those skills will do well. Yes, globalization and technological advances have led to the loss of good manufacturing jobs, which are not likely ever to come back. Global manufacturing employment is shrinking, simply because of enormous increases in productivity, and America is likely to get a shrinking share of the shrinking number of new jobs. If we do succeed in "saving" these jobs, it may be only by converting higher-paid jobs to lower-paid ones - hardly a long-term strategy.
Globalization, and the unbalanced way it has been pursued, has shifted bargaining power away from workers: firms can threaten to move elsewhere, especially when tax laws treat such overseas investments so favorably. This in turn has weakened unions, and though unions have sometimes been a source of rigidity, the countries that responded most effectively to the global financial crisis, like Germany and Sweden, have strong unions and strong systems of social protection.
As Mr. Obama's second term begins, we must all face the fact that our country cannot quickly, meaningfully recover without policies that directly address inequality. What's needed is a comprehensive response that should include, at least, significant investments in education, a more progressive tax system and a tax on financial speculation.
The good news is that our thinking has been reframed: it used to be that we asked how much growth we would be willing to sacrifice for a little more equality and opportunity. Now we realize that we are paying a high price for our inequality and that alleviating it and promoting growth are intertwined, complementary goals. It will be up to all of us - our leaders included - to muster the courage and foresight to finally treat this beleaguering malady.

HEADLINE: The Recession? That's So Yesterday

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Judging by the number of consignments and the turnout of buyers, the annual winter classic car auctions that began here on Tuesday with Barrett-Jackson's sale seem to have been immunized against every strain of economic flu. It's almost as though the lean recession years of 2009-10 never happened. 
Here are some of the particularly interesting high-end collectibles available this weekend:
1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda (Barrett-Jackson) One of 11 426-powered 'Cuda convertibles built that year, it was a tremendously expensive engine option for the day -- nearly $1,300 -- which explains its scarcity. Were this car to break $2 million here, it would be a sign that the market is close to being back to its peak of 2007.
1934 Cadillac V-16 Convertible Sedan (RM Auctions). In the 1930s, there was a race for engine size and number of cylinders. Only Marmon matched Cadillac in introducing an expensive V-16 in the depths of the Depression. This car is expected to bring up to $750,000.
1958 Ferrari 250 GT LWB California Spider (Gooding & Company) The California Spider is the market leader of collectible road Ferraris. There's a definite pecking order, with the short-wheelbase, enclosed-headlight models capable of bringing $10 million or more. This is the slightly less desirable long-wheelbase model, but it may possibly be the weekend's high sale with an estimate of $5.5 million to $7 million.
1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Berlinetta (RM Auctions) This car is likely to go wheel-to-wheel with the California Spider at Gooding for the weekend's top sale. RM declined to publish a presale estimate.
1957 Maserati 150 GT Spider (Gooding & Company) Maserati was once a credible rival to Ferrari on the road and the racetrack. In terms of collectibility, the same cannot be said; this car illustrates that point. A factory prototype for a 4-cylinder sports car, the 150 GT was based on the chassis of a retired competition car. It has a $3 million to $4 million presale estimate.

HEADLINE: A Digital Paradise by the Dashboard Light

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The driver of the first Corvette, in 1953, was welcomed by a lovely fan of numbers -- a sweeping, eye-catching speedometer denominated in 10-mile-per-hour intervals up to 160. The display offered a stark representation of speed.
By contrast, the instrument panel of the next-generation Corvette, which made its public debut here last week at the North American International Auto Show, offers a tachometer formed of seven big numerals surrounding a translucent, ghostly image of the car -- suggesting the 3-D cyberspace world of ''Tron.'' This tachometer emphasizes the 450 horsepower pumped out by a new V-8 engine. But that's just one way of looking at what the car is doing.
The dashboard is ''completely configurable,'' said Ryan Vaughan, who designed the new Corvette's interior. Dials have been banished; an eight-inch screen has taken their place. 
A car's instruments summarize its personality. Every car has two faces, and each expresses character. One is outside, visible to all the world: the grille and headlights that are the car's public face. The other is more intimate, the instrument panel through which the driver interacts with the machine. The speedos and tachs, the knobs and dials, tell a story, and they convey emotion as well as information.
The amount of information is increasing rapidly as digital technology pervades the car. The automobiles displayed this year at the auto show suggest a quiet revolution: digital is chasing the last vestiges of analog from the dashboard. Mechanical instruments are rare. The dial is dying.
Gorden Wagener, design chief for Mercedes-Benz, is among those predicting a complete shift to virtual instruments. ''Honestly, I see hardware dials disappearing -- and I like that,'' he said, standing next to the new small CLA sedan hidden behind curtains near the Mercedes display. ''It's a question of how you do it.''
For years, most cars have offered analog speedometers and tachometers even with the fanciest digital displays. Aside from their nod to tradition, analog gauges offer reassurance, like a windup clock or a mechanical wristwatch that keeps running even if a superstorm knocks out power and blocks access to the Internet. But this year, digital readouts of speed and engine performance are trumping analog needles and numbers. Many of the dials that survive are digital replicas of analog instruments.
The tach is especially endangered. Purists may blanch, but as fewer and fewer cars offer manual transmissions, the more redundant the tach seems. In the battle for prime real estate on the dashboard, it may be doomed.
The most basic traditional layout sets an equal-size speedometer and tachometer side by side. But gauges reflect character: in sports cars, the tach looms larger, sometimes literally overshadowing the speedo. The gauge clusters of the new Porsche Cayman and Boxster are dominated by huge circular tachs larger than the speedometers. These speak of a sports car for the autobahn -- with no speed limit, who needs a speedo?
By contrast, Chevrolet has given the smallest car it sells in the United States, the Spark, instruments that it says are modeled on those of a cheap motorcycle: just two basic dials. The goal is to impart a sporty feel to the tiny economy car.
The graphics of the new Corvette's dash are much more sophisticated than the Spark's. Choosing one of various modes -- including Tour, Sport and Track -- produce very different looks.
The big Cadillac XTS sedan also offers a configurable display, from a traditional layout to one that emphasizes the technological. Analog dials have also vanished.
At the other extreme, the retro look of the Fiat 500 is expressed in instruments with numbers like those on a 1950s table radio. The Mini Cooper's podlike gauges are puffy and cartoonish, like something from the ''Futurama'' cartoon series.
The green credentials of electrics or hybrids are evident in instruments that offer driving guides. Ford's SmartGauge with EcoGuide coaches drivers in the Fusion Hybrid, famously rewarding those who are most efficient with a display of growing leaves and vines. Such nudges, aimed at keeping engine speeds down, suggest that the speedo and tach are not siblings, but rivals. Speed and efficiency battle in our cars, as in our hearts and minds. To meet fuel-efficiency targets, we need to push mileage up and revs down.
If the tach is a relic, what of the volt meter and the oil pressure gauge? Other information is crowding into view: where dials used to be, the driver gets directions to a destination, news alerts or the album cover art of the music that's playing.
The new Corvette offers multiple ways to display information. In Track mode, for instance, a sweeping graphic literally shows the torque band.
The Corvette was one of the first cars with LCDs, in 1984, and with a heads-up display, which projects information onto the windshield. But as time passes, novel interior features can seem dated, like the complex graphic equalizers that rocked audiophiles in cars of the 1970s.
Today's dashboard experiments are likely to quickly grow dated as well. Aaron Betsky, the director of the Cincinnati Art Museum, has been shopping for a car. He is dismayed by the state of instrument design, likening much of it to ''a teenage boy's idea of high-tech heaven.''
''In general, it is amazing how clutter has increased just when we thought everything would become simpler,'' he said, adding that he wished Jonathan Ive, Apple's chief designer, would try his hand at an instrument panel.
Mr. Wagener of Mercedes also insists on a higher standard of design for digital dashboards. He notes that dials have long served as jewelry in car interiors. ''The new S-Class will offer a world where you don't need the real dials,'' he said. ''You will have virtual dials. But they must have the same qualities as real jewelry.''
Today's analog dials, like watches, exist more for decoration than function. Mr. Wagener says he thinks the role of ''eye candy'' will be assumed by air vents. The polished round vents on the CLA, for instance, echo those of the Mercedes 300SL of the mid-1950s and are one of the key themes of the brand's current interior design language. The flow of air -- into a grille, over a fender, through a side vent -- is inherently sexy, in the view of Mr. Wagener. ''Any time you have air handling, it is emotional,'' he said.
Another example was found at the Lincoln display, where the vents inside the MKC evoke the crossover's winged grille -- a clear example of a car's inner face corresponding to its outward face.

HEADLINE: Advice for Obama's Speech

 BODY:
On Monday, President Obama will stand before the United States Capitol to give his second Inaugural speech to the nation.
What issues should he address and what tone should he adopt? Should he channel Lincoln, Martin Luther King or F.D.R.? Should he talk of partisan politics or propose policy initiatives?
Avoid the Lincoln Quote
By William Kristol 
William Kristol is the editor of The Weekly Standard.
I suspect that in his second Inaugural Address President Obama won't be able to resist quoting the only other second Inaugural delivered by a president from Illinois. And proud as he is of getting us out of Iraq and anticipating as he does withdrawing from Afghanistan, President Obama may be particularly tempted to quote Lincoln's famous quatrain:
Fondly do we hope -- Fervently do we pray -- That this mighty scourge of war May speedily pass away.
So do we all hope and pray. But this prayer is preceded in Lincoln's speech by his prosaic citing of "the progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends." That progress, Lincoln says, has been "reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all." It's the progress of arms that makes a just and lasting peace possible. There is no substitute for military strength. There's no substitute for military victory.
President Obama likes to say that "the tide of war is receding." But war doesn't ebb and flow like a tide. Wars are won or lost. President Obama may already have squandered victory in Iraq by failing to secure the peace with a continued deployment of American troops. He would compound this error by squandering the achievements of the surge in Afghanistan -- a surge of troops and of fighting that he ordered -- by insisting on a precipitate and almost complete withdrawal from that theater of conflict. And he would endanger the chances of a broader and more lasting peace, one vouchsafed by American military might (as well, of course, as American economic strength and diplomatic engagement), by presiding over a hollowing-out of the American military.
Fondly do I hope -- fervently do I pray -- that President Obama chooses a better way. And that in his second term he doesn't shrink from the tough-minded and hard-headed policies that could truly achieve a just and lasting peace with all nations.

Renew Faith in the American Dream
By Douglas Brinkley
Douglas Brinkley is a professor of history at Rice University and a commentator for CBS News. He is the author of ''The Wilderness Warrior'' and the editor of ''The Reagan Diaries.''
If Barack Obama's first Inauguration was a paean for increased civic responsibility, his second should be an optimistic romp aimed at renewing faith in the American Dream. Not only will the president be orating on Martin Luther King Day, but 2013 also marks both the 50th anniversary of the ''I Have A Dream'' speech and the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
History, he should remind us, teaches that our own times aren't uniquely oppressive. America, in fact, has an astonishing record of triumph in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity. We've overcome slavery, world wars, financial depression and Jim Crow by believing fully in the tenets of liberty -- inherent in the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence. And now, in the second decade of the 21st century, America must confront a new series of threats to our liberty.
Playing off Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1937 second Inaugural -- a masterpiece of progressive speechcraft -- Obama should remind citizens that comfort and obstructionism and disunity have no useful place in our democracy. The fear index is too high in America today. No parent should have to worry that their child will be murdered by assault weapons when attending school. No Latino should think that a knock-on-the-door means deportation. No worker should fear that Social Security will be raided or health care benefits incrementally stripped away under a desire for a balanced budget. And no citizen in the Age of Climate Change should wonder whether the federal government will help them rebuild if a natural disaster devastates their community.
Everybody will be expecting Obama to quote from Lincoln and King. He should. But he would be wise to squeeze in an uplifting line from Cesar Chavez (Latino rights) or Eleanor Roosevelt (human dignity) or Susan B. Anthony (voting power). It's important to enlarge the pantheon of social justice warriors in America beyond the rote obvious.
Back in 1937, F.D.R. said that, ''The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' I hope the president speaks out fiercely for the 30 million in poverty, the unemployed, the downtrodden and the middle-class families that just can't make ends meet. If one American is hungry, he should say, than we're all hungry.
Striking a bipartisan tone he should remind us that America is a work-in-progress, never complete, as long as social and economic justice remains unattainable for fellow citizens. While the Inauguration is not the forum to lay out a comprehensive plan for tax reform, spending cuts and investments, he should remind us that everybody must pay their fair share for our country to prosper. Bugling a better-days-are-coming message, he should ask for Divine Guidance and, as he did so effectively in 2008, once again chant: Si, se puede (yes we can)!

Acknowledge the Divisions
By Jeff Shesol
Jeff Shesol, a deputy chief speechwriter to President Bill Clinton, is a partner at a communications strategy firm. He is the author of ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court."
The occasion seems less momentous because it is: continuity rather than change, ''let us continue'' instead of ''let us begin.'' A second Inaugural Address -- Lincoln's being the great exception -- tends to be a weak echo of the first (and few of those, in truth, are worth a reprise). President Obama, though, has a chance on Monday to give a speech that is stronger, snappier and ultimately more memorable than the sober summons to ''responsibility'' he delivered four years ago. To do it he will, however, have to forsake Abraham Lincoln, whose ideal of national unity he has repeatedly evoked.
''Unity'' is as consistent a theme as one can find in Inaugural Addresses. And for good reason: we are, in fact, a union, even if we do a pretty imperfect job of showing it. For Barack Obama that ideal has always held a special meaning: when he arrived on the national stage in 2004 and when he ran for president in 2008, he seemed, to many Americans, to embody the notion that we can -- despite all appearances -- come together across lines of division (black and white, red state and blue).
His first Inaugural made the point plainly, asserting a ''unity of purpose'' in the nation and proclaiming an end to "the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long." In fact, it was less an end than an intermission, and within a day or two the Republican Party had picked itself up, dusted itself off and recommenced consuming us with stale political arguments.
Still, for a time -- a troublingly long time -- Barack Obama seemed to be the only person in Washington who held to a belief that the two sides could "do big things" (other than wage big battles) together. It was not until the blown grand bargain of 2011 that he finally abandoned his ''post-partisan'' ideal. In 2012, he ran for re-election not as a uniter but a fighter. And in recent weeks he's maintained that posture -- on guns, on the fiscal cliff, on the debt ceiling.
An Inaugural Address should never be sharp in tone. But it can and should show some steel. Gauzy appeals to national unity would serve in Obama's case to underscore the almost willful naiveté of much of his first term. To make this address meaningful, he needs to acknowledge the very real and deeply felt differences between the parties. This is one of the central and chronic facts of our national existence, and President Obama will do himself no favors by minimizing it as he did four years ago, and for too long thereafter.
The question for Obama now -- not just in this speech but in the course it charts for his second term -- is not what he will do to heal our divisions. It's what he can achieve despite them.

Revive the Spirit of Unity
By Linda Chavez
Linda Chavez was the director of public liaison in the Reagan White House and the G.O.P. Senate nominee from Maryland in 1986. She is the chairwoman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative research group focused on race and ethnicity.
President Obama could do worse in his second Inaugural Address than dust off a copy of the speech he gave to the 2004 Democratic Convention, which arguably got him where he is today. For those of us used to listening to invectives against the opposition at conventions, then-Senator Obama's tone was refreshing.
''There's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America,'' he said. ''The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states: red states for Republicans, blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.''
Whatever happened to that Barack Obama? Some of my conservative friends would say it was all an act -- that he was always a hyper-partisan. Certainly they have ample evidence in recent days to buttress their opinion. In his press conference this week, the president excoriated Republicans. ''If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America's bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans benefits will be delayed,'' he warned. He also suggested, ''some of the House Republicans'' are ''suspicious about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat.''
At the moment it looks like the president's agenda for his second term is to beat the Republicans into submission by demonizing them with the American people. It's a goal unworthy of a president -- and I'd still like to think he's better than that. But it will take humility (not an attribute that comes naturally to him) to admit that he cannot solve the enormous challenges that face a nation buried in debt without working with Republicans.
He once deplored the ''politics of cynicism.'' Let him prove he still does by abandoning his own contempt for those fellow patriots who don't always agree with him.

What I'd Like to Hear, But Won't
By Michael C. Dawson
Michael C. Dawson is the John D. MacArthur professor of political science and the director of the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture at the University of Chicago. He is the author of the forthcoming "Blacks In and Out of the Left."
At Monday's Inauguration, we might hear President Obama announce a new policy outlining a road to citizenship for immigrants to this country. He could call for a return to the dynamic immigration policies that allowed European immigration and that led to the extraordinary economic and intellectual growth during the 19th and early 20th centuries. He could say that we need to correct the racist immigration ideas and policies of that period that led to, for example, the Chinese Exclusion Acts.
He could also remind us that we mistakenly romanticize that period. Jewish, Catholic, Irish, Italian and East European immigrants were viewed with suspicion and considered by many to be inherently corrupting of the American way of life and in need of ''civilizing'' because of their heretical and dangerous ideas and religions. Some of these European populations were not even considered white on arrival.
Yet, somehow we not only survived that foreign ''invasion,'' but prospered economically and intellectually from it. He could call on the country to embrace that spirit which enabled the country to grow and prosper, and welcome this era's populations from around the world that seek to make a better life for themselves and in the process make the country much stronger and more viable.
We might also hear President Obama take a long overdue more combative tone as he pursues a wide range of policy objectives on the domestic front as he has finally done with gun control. He might point to the increasing number of natural disasters as a clarion call for a more aggressive and comprehensive policy on climate change. We might hear some echoes of these concerns in his speech, but probably not to the degree his supporters would wish.
It is unlikely, however, that he will even moderately pursue economic justice and growth as his 2008 supporters thought he would. Unfortunately, I doubt we'll hear him call for the strengthening of the New Deal and Great Society that were the crowning legacies of the 20th century Democratic Party. We will probably not hear about the introduction of economic policies that will lead to full employment and a repair of our social safety net. Nor will we hear him call for Americans to realize that we are responsible for each other and must pay a fair share of taxes to support those who are unable to support themselves. Alarmingly, we will not hear that he will live up to his 2008 pledge to close Guantanamo, or begin to restore the civil liberties that have been under attack now for two administrations within this country, or return to the rule of law in our pursuit of national security.
His supporters will hear some of what they wish to see over the next four years. But the reality is that much of the hope that was generated in 2008 will prove to be unfulfilled.

Talk About the Role of Government
By Drew Westen
Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University. He the author of ''The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.''
For the last 30 years, Americans have heard one primary narrative about government: that government is the problem, not the solution. That was Ronald Reagan's mantra, it has been the mantra of Republicans for over three decades. It is so engrained in political discourse that Democrats have been too afraid to contest it.
President Obama had little to say about government in his first inaugural address. The absence of government regulation over the most influential and least productive sector of the economy -- the financial sector, which manufactures nothing but instability if not kept closely in check -- toppled the economy and decimated the lives of millions of Americans, just as it had done 80 years earlier during the Great Depression. Yet the president was largely silent about the role of government in preventing abuses of power by the few that affect the many, let alone its role in creating the conditions for prosperity and economic growth, by maintaining a modern infrastructure, laws that protect ever-changing ideas, products and industries, and laws and regulations that protect the wages and benefits of working people against unfair labor practices often perpetrated under the name of ''free trade.'' President Obama once spoke with tremendous eloquence about government in an address at the University of Michigan, but otherwise, he has had little to say about good government. The result is that Americans continue to hear only one side of the argument, and they have come to distrust government still further as it has become infested with the interests of big business, which overwhelm policy decisions unless an event so momentous as the Newtown massacre of 20 innocent children allows public opinion a momentary chance of prevailing over the special interests that buy and sell elections like commodities traded in unregulated markets.
If this president wants a legacy, which he does, the time is now to set the stage for it with an address befitting his eloquence, one that dispels the notion that the measure of a government is its size -- and that unlike virtually everything else in the American psyche, smaller is better. The measure of a government is whether it helps create prosperity for the many, security for all, and a better world for our children.

HEADLINE: Secret Ingredient For Success

BYLINE: By CAMILLE SWEENEY and JOSH GOSFIELD. 
The authors of the forthcoming book ''The Art of Doing: How Superachievers Do What They Do and How They Do It So Well.''

 BODY:
WHAT does self-awareness have to do with a restaurant empire? A tennis championship? Or a rock star's dream?
David Chang's experience is instructive.
Mr. Chang is an internationally renowned, award-winning Korean-American chef, restaurateur and owner of the Momofuku restaurant group with eight restaurants from Toronto to Sydney, and other thriving enterprises, including bakeries and bars, a PBS TV show, guest spots on HBO's ''Treme'' and a foodie magazine, Lucky Peach. He says he worked himself to the bone to realize his dream -- to own a humble noodle bar.
He spent years cooking in some of New York City's best restaurants, apprenticed in different noodle shops in Japan and then, finally, worked 18-hour days in his tiny restaurant, Momofuku Noodle Bar. 
Mr. Chang could barely pay himself a salary. He had trouble keeping staff. And he was miserably stressed.
He recalls a low moment when he went with his staff on a night off to eat burgers at a restaurant that was everything his wasn't -- packed, critically acclaimed and financially successful. He could cook better than they did, he thought, so why was his restaurant failing? ''I couldn't figure out what the hell we were doing wrong,'' he told us.
Mr. Chang could have blamed someone else for his troubles, or worked harder (though available evidence suggests that might not have been possible) or he could have made minor tweaks to the menu. Instead he looked inward and subjected himself to brutal self-assessment.
Was the humble noodle bar of his dreams economically viable? Sure, a traditional noodle dish had its charm but wouldn't work as the mainstay of a restaurant if he hoped to pay his bills.
Mr. Chang changed course. Rather than worry about what a noodle bar should serve, he and his cooks stalked the produce at the greenmarket for inspiration. Then they went back to the kitchen and cooked as if it was their last meal, crowding the menu with wild combinations of dishes they'd want to eat -- tripe and sweetbreads, headcheese and flavor-packed culinary mashups like a Korean-style burrito. What happened next Mr. Chang still considers ''kind of ridiculous'' -- the crowds came, rave reviews piled up, awards followed and unimaginable opportunities presented themselves.
During the 1970s, Chris Argyris, a business theorist at Harvard Business School (and now, at 89, a professor emeritus) began to research what happens to organizations and people, like Mr. Chang, when they find obstacles in their paths.
Professor Argyris called the most common response single loop learning -- an insular mental process in which we consider possible external or technical reasons for obstacles.
LESS common but vastly more effective is the cognitive approach that Professor Argyris called double-loop learning. In this mode we -- like Mr. Chang -- question every aspect of our approach, including our methodology, biases and deeply held assumptions. This more psychologically nuanced self-examination requires that we honestly challenge our beliefs and summon the courage to act on that information, which may lead to fresh ways of thinking about our lives and our goals.
In interviews we did with high achievers for a book, we expected to hear that talent, persistence, dedication and luck played crucial roles in their success. Surprisingly, however, self-awareness played an equally strong role.
The successful people we spoke with -- in business, entertainment, sports and the arts -- all had similar responses when faced with obstacles: they subjected themselves to fairly merciless self-examination that prompted reinvention of their goals and the methods by which they endeavored to acheive them.
The tennis champion Martina Navratilova, for example, told us that after a galling loss to Chris Evert in 1981, she questioned her assumption that she could get by on talent and instinct alone. She began a long exploration of every aspect of her game. She adopted a rigorous cross-training practice (common today but essentially unheard of at the time), revamped her diet and her mental and tactical game and ultimately transformed herself into the most successful women's tennis player of her era.
The indie rock band OK Go described how it once operated under the business model of the 20th-century rock band. But when industry record sales collapsed and the band members found themselves creatively hamstrung by their recording company, they questioned their tactics. Rather than depend on their label, they made wildly unconventional music videos, which went viral, and collaborative art projects with companies like Google, State Farm and Range Rover, which financed future creative endeavors. The band now releases albums on its own label.
No one's idea of a good time is to take a brutal assessment of their animating assumptions and to acknowledge that those may have contributed to their failure. It's easy to find pat ways to explain why the world has not adequately rewarded our efforts. But what we learned from conversation with high achievers is that challenging our assumptions, objectives, at times even our goals, may sometimes push us further than we thought possible. Ask David Chang, who never imagined that sweetbreads and duck sausage rice cakes with kohlrabi and mint would find their way beside his humble noodle dishes -- and make him a star.

HEADLINE: A Trendy Turn in Obama's Town

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
SOON after President Obama places his hand on the Lincoln Bible on Monday, he will join lawmakers for a luncheon of steamed lobster, hickory-grilled bison and New England chowder in the Capitol's ornate Statuary Hall.
Meanwhile, in the trendy corridors of this city, the Good Stuff Eatery on Capitol Hill will be serving its signature Prez Obama Burger (with applewood bacon and Roquefort cheese) and its Michelle Melt turkey burger (free range, of course, on a whole wheat bun), the staff at the Boundary Road restaurant on H Street Northeast will be pouring craft beers from Baltimore and Brooklyn, and at the U Street Music Hall, the rock music will be playing long after the swearing-in is over.
None of these places existed before 2008.
That was the year when Barack Obama won his first presidential election and started putting together an administration that would soon replace that of President George W. Bush. And for many of Mr. Obama's young supporters, this second inauguration -- and its revelries -- are symbols of the transformation of the nation's capital into a younger and livelier city. 
Long viewed as a stodgy, early-to-bed town, Washington over the past four years has become a mecca for young professionals who have been drawn to its blooming economy and its revitalized urban core. Once-neglected stretches of the city now bustle with bars, restaurants and coffee shops.
The February edition of Food & Wine magazine heralds the city's ''new food scene'' for its ''innovative restaurants,'' with offerings that range from baked orzo for brunch and dan dan noodles at midnight. In September, Forbes magazine included H Street Northeast, with its bars, music halls and restaurants, in its list of the nation's 20 ''best hipster neighborhoods.'' (H Street ranked sixth, behind the Pearl District in Portland, Ore.)
The city's population boom and heightened hipness quotient cannot be directly attributed to Mr. Obama's appeal among younger voters. (Sorry, Mr. President.) Washington has had a relatively strong economy, compared with other cities. And waves of gentrification and investment have changed the face of the city.
But a census analysis conducted by Susan Weber-Stoger, a demographer at Queens College, suggests that the lure of federal jobs during the Obama years has played a part.
Between 2009 and 2011, the number of college-educated people aged 22 to 34 who live here, but were not enrolled in school, surged by nearly a third to 93,354. The number of people in that age group who work for the federal government jumped even higher, by 61 percent.
It does not hurt that some of Mr. Obama's interests dovetail with those of a younger generation that prefers urban to suburban life, even though the president and his wife are less visible in the city now than they were during their first months in the White House.
Mr. Obama, who says he listens to Nicki Minaj on his iPod, goes out far more regularly than his predecessor and ventures to more diverse corners of the city, said Mark Knoller, a White House reporter for CBS News and an unofficial archivist of the presidential schedule.
''His own sensibilities have intersected with the city's changing sensibilities in a way that resonates with people,'' said Dee Dee Myers, a former press secretary to President Bill Clinton who moved here in 1992.
Every president brings his own feel to the White House and, by extension, to the capital. Sometimes that sensibility is ephemeral and fleeting, historians say. At other times, a president plants the seeds of change.
Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, pointed to the young New Dealers who poured in to Washington during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration in the 1930s.
Many of them moved into Georgetown and began renovating its 18th- and 19th-century town houses in what was then a neglected corner of the city. Their efforts helped lead to the emergence of Georgetown as the home to the city's power elite.
In recent years, President Clinton brought his love of jazz and late-night pizza policy sessions to the White House, while under President Bush, the South Lawn became home to country music and Texas-style barbecue.
At first, the Obamas looked set to emerge as the most out-and-about presidential couple in recent memory, but they have retreated in recent years. Even so, Mr. Obama has gone out far more often for meals and evening outings in Washington than Mr. Bush did, according to Mr. Knoller's records, including to Georgetown's Café Milano on Thursday to celebrate Mrs. Obama's 49th birthday.
''I like a good party,'' the president said at a news conference last week.
Anita McBride, who served as Laura Bush's chief of staff, said the Bushes played host at the White House to many more lawmakers than the Obamas have. But she says the president and first lady are early-to-bed people.
''Going out together, they do a lot more than the Bushes did,'' Ms. McBride said of the Obamas.
Mr. Obama's young staff members also savor city life, living in apartments and group houses on Logan Circle, U Street and near Dupont Circle, and drinking at bars like Stoney's Lounge and Chief Ike's Mambo Room, said Eric Lesser, who worked for David Axelrod, who was the president's senior adviser before moving on to Harvard Law School.
Young people are not the only ones drawn to the city's increasingly vibrant neighbors. When settling on a new home, Justice Sonia Sotomayor decided on a place near U Street in Northwest Washington.
''It has a touch of the East Village in it,'' she said.
To outsiders, the change is palpable. Marcus Samuelsson, the New York chef and restaurateur who has been visiting Washington for years, marvels at the expanded range of ethnic food offerings, midlevel bistros and fine-dining establishments.
Chefs such as Todd Gray of Equinox and José Andrés of Jaleo have also helped to put the city's culinary scene on the map.
''Washington is a really cool city to go to now,'' Mr. Samuelsson said. ''You don't have to move to New York or San Francisco. You can stay in the D.C. area and really do well within the tribe of cooking.''
Not everyone is celebrating. The influx of affluent newcomers has corresponded with a decline in the number black residents, many of whom complain of higher rents, taxes and housing costs. In 2011, Washington's black population slipped below 50 percent for the first time in 51 years, leaving some African-Americans uneasy about their place in the city.
''You kind of get the sense that people are waiting for the rest of us to leave,'' said Natalie Hopkinson, the author of ''Go-Go Live: The Musical Life and Death of a Chocolate City.''
''It is very ironic that at the time we get a chocolate president that it's not the chocolate city,'' she said.
Demographers say that Washington has long been a city where people come and go. It is unclear whether the new generation of 20- and 30-somethings will reverse that trend.
Lauren Yates, a 25-year-old from Chicago who specializes in Web analytics, said she and her husband hoped to stay, at least for a while.
Her husband, who moved here first, initially settled in Georgetown. But after looking around, they moved to H Street in July.
In October, Mr. Obama stopped by H Street's Smith Commons. It was his second visit to the popular corridor.
Ms. Yates said she still was not convinced that the city is truly hip. She is from Chicago, after all. (In fairness, even some longtime Washingtonians are dubious.) But she is thrilled to live in an up-and-coming neighborhood that the president sometimes visits.
''We're just excited to live close enough to a place that he thinks is hip for dinner,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Beyond Debt Ceilings

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Above the Debt Ceiling, Boehner Might Find a Blue Sky,'' (Economic View, Jan. 13), Richard H. Thaler may have the right practical idea about eliminating the debt ceiling, but I don't see how uncapping the debt and encouraging more borrowing will ''likely restore our triple-A credit rating.'' As I see it, that will happen only if we take real steps to rein in spending. 
Unfortunately, neither party is really interested in cutting spending, because spending is what gets our politicians elected. Democrats like to tax and spend. Republicans like to borrow and spend. We might as well start adjusting our expectations to the likelihood that this year's fiscal discussions will result in more taxes and more borrowing (with or without a permanent abolition of the debt ceiling) but few if any net spending cuts. That leaves us vulnerable to another ratings downgrade and higher borrowing costs.
Fortunately, interest expense isn't the budget buster here; it's entitlements, which consume such a massive and growing share of tax revenue. We still have time to reform them, but if we don't use the time wisely, our children will do it for us. Washington budget drama about anything else, meanwhile, is a waste of time.

To the Editor:
The debt-ceiling issue is not about the government stopping paying its existing bills and defaulting on its existing debts -- it is about whether the government will continue on its current path of increasing its debts through spending more than the taxes it receives.
While it is true that Congress passed all the laws that led to the current level of taxes and spending and the resulting deficit, Congress did this is a piecemeal way, tax by tax, appropriation by appropriation and entitlement by entitlement. The debt-ceiling debate offers a rare time to focus on the federal government's overall financial position.

HEADLINE: New Careers, After 50

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Over 50, and Under No Illusions'' (Jan. 13), which described how five people had reinvented their careers in the face of a tough economy: 
I was disheartened to read one observer's suggestion that it's inexcusable not to plan for an alternative career. Is it unreasonable to try to make it through life without constantly being on the lookout for possible new work?
I think it is important to show respect for workers who lost all as others drank Champagne, for those who teach in underfunded schools while others vacation in Aspen, and for those who, in their old age, are trapped in devalued homes, unable to sell or recoup a lifetime of dreams.

To the Editor:
Federal and state governments could help older victims of downsizing by approving legislation giving employers a one-time tax incentive if they hired older workers for new full-time jobs. That would both encourage job creation (as the credit would be given only for new positions) and motivate businesses to take advantage of the vast skills of older workers.
A reinvented approach is needed to help older people who desperately want to continue to work and contribute to society.

Fund Managers' Pay
To the Editor:
Re ''Funds Aren't Wielding Much Power Over Executive Pay'' (Mutual Funds Report, Jan. 13), which described how funds have had little effect on the compensation policies of companies in which they invest:
The article makes some interesting observations, including the idea that if a fund is too militant about a company's executive pay program, it could risk losing its placement in that company's 401(k) plan.
Still, an 800-pound gorilla is lurking about this issue: managers of many large funds have compensation packages that investors would find breathtaking. Of course, portfolio managers have every right to whatever shareholders are willing to pay them. But investors then shouldn't expect the managers' employers to take an aggressive lead in monitoring executive pay.

HEADLINE: Movies In the Age Of Obama

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT and MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, on the historic occasion of Barack Obama's first inauguration, we took a look at the good, bad and outrageous movie characters who helped make his election possible. The road to the White House, we wrote, hadn't just been paved by Mr. Obama's speeches, innovative campaign strategies and the hopefulness of a majority of voters, but also by decades of African-American men in movies. From the class striving of Sidney Poitier's everyman in the classic film ''A Raisin in the Sun'' to Will Smith's messianic loners in recent titles like ''I Am Legend,'' the movies have ennobled, consecrated, glorified, immortalized and, most important, normalized the figure of the black man. 
Now, on the eve of a second Obama term, the images are more complex, and in some ways blurrier. Politically and personally this president functions as a screen onto which different Americans project their fears and fantasies. From the right, the picture is often of a monster whose policies are steps on a scary road to socialism or some other exotic form of tyranny. Many liberals, by contrast, have expressed disappointment at his willingness to compromise with Republicans and his reluctance to fight. At different times and from various angles Mr. Obama is a fiery orator, an aloof intellectual, a policy nerd and a shrewd strategist. He is notoriously resistant to sketch-comedy impersonation and also, perhaps, to simple pop-cultural appropriation.
Last year in The New York Review of Books the critic J. Hoberman wondered when we would see an ''Obama-inflected Hollywood cinema.'' ''The longing for Obama (or an Obama),'' he wrote, ''can be found in two prescient 2008 movies,'' citing ''Wall-E'' and ''Milk'' as releases about creative community organizers, with Harvey Milk also a political symbol of hope. It may be too soon to identify an Obama Cinema, but the president's second inauguration seems like an appropriate time to try. His first term wasn't easy for Hollywood, representationally; the most visible evidence for this seeming paralysis was the whiteout that descended over the 2011 Oscars, where African-Americans were conspicuous only by their absence.
Subsequent Oscar nominations for ''The Help'' partly rectified the color imbalance. This year race is firmly back on the table with movies like ''Lincoln'' and ''Django Unchained.'' Yet much like Mr. Obama, who has rarely made race a topic of conversation, the current nominees for best picture speak to other issues, including war, the economy and just about everything else. Some of the connections between politics and movies are obvious, but we wanted to go beyond the topical resonance of films like ''Zero Dark Thirty'' and enter into the realms of allegory and national mythology. Here is our highly preliminary, wildly speculative thematic guide to American cinema in the Obama Era.
Our current bout of LINCOLNMANIA may have begun that frigid day in 2007 when Mr. Obama announced in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., that he was running for president. Since then Lincoln books have continued to pour in; the Ford Motor Company has taken Honest Abe out of cold storage for its rebranded Lincoln; and he has become an unexpected box-office draw with Steven Spielberg's political procedural, ''Lincoln.'' That Daniel Day-Lewis's grave and wily interpretation of the mature president outperformed a younger, ax-wielding Abe in the gonzo ''Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'' wasn't just a surprise, including at the box office, it was also one of the biggest film stories of 2012.
Literal Lincolns have been few on the big screen, but variations on the Lincolnesque have emerged, from the leadership of Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks, a distant relative of Abe) in ''Toy Story 3'' to Jamie Foxx's avenger in Quentin Tarantino's ''Django Unchained.'' In its virtuous violence ''Django'' at times can be seen as an elaboration on a crucial passage from Lincoln's second inaugural speech: ''Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.' ''
The Lincoln in Mr. Spielberg and Tony Kushner's film represents the triumph of the moral good, achieved through rational discourse, the law and backroom wrangling. In Quentin Tarantino's ''Django,'' by contrast, the salt-and-pepper team played by Christoph Waltz and Mr. Foxx embodies a blood-drenched fantasy of justice achieved through the rule of the gun. It's a fantasy that has deep roots in American history, on screen and off. What these period pictures have in common is a sense that righting our wrongs is a shared burden. Or, as Nick Fury, in describing another battle between good and evil, puts it: ''There came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat.''
''Marvel's The Avengers'' might have been called ''Team of Rivals'' -- the title of the book, by Doris Kearns Goodwin, that was one of the sources for ''Lincoln.'' And Joss Whedon's Marvel costume party is, like Mr. Spielberg's historical costume drama, largely about an urgent response to a political crisis. It is also about COMMUNITY ORGANIZING, as Fury mobilizes a fractious group of individuals whom he must persuade to pursue a set of common interests.
As such, ''The Avengers'' may be the exemplary Obama Era superhero movie, replacing the figure of the solitary, shadowy paladin with a motley assortment of oddballs and, despite the title, focusing less on vengeance than on interplanetary peacekeeping. A similar ethic informs ''X-Men: First Class,'' which takes place around the time of Mr. Obama's birth (at the height of the cold war and the civil rights movement) and which shows how the idealistic pursuit of justice and tolerance can end up tragically divided between radical and conciliatory impulses. (The philosophical split between Magneto and Charles Xavier mirrors that between the moderate mediator Mr. Obama claims to be and the angry militant that Dinesh D'Souza's documentary ''2016: Obama's America'' insists he really is.)
The ideal of community and the threats to its survival are powerful themes in these anxious times, when economic upheaval and environmental catastrophe are ever-present worries, and when the values of comity and neighborliness can seem hard to sustain. ''Beasts of the Southern Wild'' and ''Promised Land,'' both released in 2012, imagine emblematic American landscapes -- the bayous of Louisiana and the green rural towns of the Northeast -- as ecologically and socially fragile places, easily destroyed by hundred-year storms or million-dollar fracking payoffs. Another, ''The Descendants'' (set in Hawaii, the president's birthplace), locates the struggle between the pursuit of profit and the desire to hold onto other values within the conscience of a lawyer played by George Clooney, the president's contemporary and a quintessential Obama Era movie star. An earlier movie, ''The Company Men'' showed the effects of hard times on the less picturesque world of middle-class suburbia.
THE GREAT RECESSION ''officially'' ended in 2009, but that hasn't dramatically thinned unemployment lines or buoyed the global economy. Historically American movies often take on class in ''little micropolitical movies like 'The Postman Always Rings Twice,' '' to borrow an observation from the German filmmaker Christian Petzold. Newer fiction tales like ''Warrior'' (about brothers battling in the lower middle class) and ''Arbitrage'' (about a nose-diving venture capitalist) as well as documentaries like ''Inside Job'' have taken on the economy and its fallout but largely attract more critical love than paying customers. One of the few class-conscious titles recently to hit the top of the box office was Steven Soderbergh's independently produced ''Magic Mike,'' about a stripper whose offstage dreams seem thwarted when he's turned down for a bank loan.
The big studios still shy away from openly taking on class, unless the issue comes swaddled in period rags and a comfortable historical distance, as in ''Les Misérables'' and even the last ''Robin Hood'' was more about the rights of the rich than the privations of the poor. When the big studios do notice bad times, it's often with the cluelessness of people who whine about their money woes while driving a Lexus. That said, glimpses of class conflict emerged amid the shadows of ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' which riffs on the French Revolution, nods at the Occupy movement and glances back at the gangster movies of the 1930s, in which struggles for power and money were accompanied by the rat-a-tat of Tommy guns.
Of course, ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is also a WAR movie, and Mr. Obama has been (to cite his predecessor's self-description) a wartime president. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' imagines a Hobbesian state of social chaos, a more complicated situation than pictured by its prequel, ''The Dark Knight,'' which is in some ways the central movie of the Bush years, with its sharply drawn lines of good and evil. Batman's fight with the Joker was as personal and apocalyptic as Harry Potter's epochal struggle with Voldemort, which came to an on-screen conclusion in the same year that Osama bin Laden, the prime evildoer of the Bush era, met his violent end.
The big movie about that event -- Kathryn Bigelow's ''Zero Dark Thirty'' -- was pre-emptively attacked as a piece of election-year Obama-boosting, and then criticized, for seeming to imply that waterboarding and other brutal forms of interrogation produced some of the intelligence that led to Bin Laden. Mr. Obama appears on screen briefly, but the film's action takes place far from the centers of political power, in Central Asian ''black sites'' and then in the cubicle warrens of C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va. Its mood is hardly triumphant (Ms. Bigelow and the screenwriter, Mark Boal, originally planned to make a film about the failure, during the Bush presidency, to catch Bin Laden), and its message is far more equivocal than some commentators have supposed. The world of ''Zero Dark Thirty'' is one of shadows, ethical compromises and constant danger, and though it ends with victory -- as most American war movies have -- it also ends in tears.
Movie audiences tend to prefer symbolic, fantastical wars, with intergalactic robots (in the subliminally anti-Obama ''Transformer'' movies, the third of which lays waste to the president's adopted hometown, Chicago), alien life forms and futuristic settings. But those films have nuances of their own. Both James Cameron's ''Avatar'' and Rupert Wyatt's ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' scramble the usual good guy/bad guy dichotomy, suggesting that, as Pogo once observed, the enemy is us.
That surely is one lesson of ''The Help,'' ''Lincoln'' and ''Django Unchained.'' The passionate arguments over these movies partly confirmed that the postracial utopia in ''Avatar'' remains as much a dream deferred as mind-tripping in someone else's body. Yet even as pundits and the public wrestle over representations of America's torturously segregated past, some filmmakers are imagining a present that looks like America, where 15 percent of all new marriages are now interracial. The historic uptick in such relationships is reflected in recent movies in which RACE matters, as it always does, but is not necessarily the topic of on-screen conversation, as in ''The Social Network,'' ''Flight,'' ''Celeste and Jesse Forever,'' ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes,'' ''The Words'' and ''Yelling to the Sky.''
There is progress in movies like these, as well as in youth-bait franchises like ''The Fast and the Furious'' and a winning comedy like ''Bridesmaids,'' another movie in which interracial couples are an unremarkable given. Even so, big studios overwhelmingly remain reluctant to incorporate interracial couples as the main narrative event. Seen in the larger context of such romantic homogeneity, the heartthrob figure of Jacob the wolf boy, played by Taylor Lautner, in ''The Twilight'' series feels unexpectedly, well, important. Putting aside Mr. Lautner's own heritage (he has said that he's part American Indian), the fact is that millions of girls, women and gay men have united in a rainbow coalition of lust to transform Jacob into a wildly popular pinup. A gross of $1 billion and counting signals progress of a kind.
The year 2012 culminated with a sigh of relief for believers in supposed Maya end-of-the-world prophecies. But intimations of apocalypse have figured heavily in the popular imagination of the past four years. Real-world disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, wars) have been mirrored in movies about rampant zombies, planetary collisions, killer epidemics and other harbingers of human extinction. The future -- as depicted in ''The Hunger Games,'' ''The Book of Eli,'' ''Contagion'' and ''Cloud Atlas,'' among others -- looks very scary indeed. These outsize fears may be the flip side of the extravagant hope of 2008, or exaggerated versions of the real challenges that we will face over the next four years.

HEADLINE: A Sneaky Peek at Obama's Speech

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT. 
Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S Second Inaugural Address, revised for maximum honesty:
My fellow Americans, I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.
[long pause] 
Hey, no, just kidding: That's from George W. Bush's second inaugural. I just wanted to see if you could tell the difference.
I'm going to keep this brief, because we're all cold and there's always a chance that the House Republicans might start imitating the Donner Party if we stay out here too long.
[broad wink at Eric Cantor]
You already know how the better angels of our nature are going to make hope and history rhyme, and all the usual fluff. So I'll skip that part. But before my second term gets under way, I do have a few people from the last four years I want to acknowledge.
First, my dear friends in the press and on the professional left (but I repeat myself). It's so nice to have you back on the bandwagon, guys! I've been surfing the Interwebs, reading the tweets, and it feels like old times. The Obama realignment is all the rage again. The thrill is back on MSNBC. Newsweek's comparing me to Jesus. All I need is a will.i.am video to really take me back.
But don't think I've forgotten that when the going got tough, you guys went weak at the knees. I always knew my fellow liberal elites were self-involved, self-dramatizing and out of touch: I was in academia, remember? But the kind of mood swings I've had to put up with have been absolutely ridiculous.
The fact is, I've been your dream president; you've just spent four years coming up with reasons not to notice. I spend a gazillion dollars on stimulus, and the next day I wake up and it's all, ''Why didn't he spend two gazillion dollars?'' I pass universal health care -- your goal for what, a thousand years or so? -- and it takes all of five seconds before you start whining about how I didn't cure cancer too. I suffer a few setbacks -- that midterm business, a bad debate -- and you start panicking about how some stuffed-suit corporate raider who stepped out of an Eisenhower-era time capsule is going to beat cool, multiracial, 21st-century ME.
Please. Please.
Next, a big, big shout-out to my opponents on the right -- I really couldn't have done it without you. Sure, you won a few battles here and there: Scott Brown versus Martha Coakley, cap-and-trade, and yes, again, that midterm business. But in the larger war, has any president ever been so lucky in his enemies?
Every time I needed to paint the American right as paranoid and out-of-touch, misogynistic and mindless, you were there for me. Thanks for making Sandra Fluke a martyr, Rush. Thanks for Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, Mr. Ailes. Thanks for everything, Donald Trump. Todd Akin -- I love you, man.
And that parade of lightweights you put up against Romney in the primaries? A godsend. Bless you, Herman Cain. Never change, Michele Bachmann. Oh -- and hope you enjoy being president of Purdue, Mitch Daniels.
Of course, my friends in right-wing media have been lucky in me as well. I kept your ratings stellar, your book sales booming, your page views sky-high. You got the income stream, I kept the power. So here's to another flush four years for you.
Finally, to all the centrist wise men and reasonable-sounding conservatives -- how do you like me now? You said I couldn't get re-elected unless I was more bipartisan, more moderate, more Clintonian. You blamed me for Washington's gridlock and assumed the country would as well. You said I should campaign on Simpson-Bowles, of all things, instead of social issues.
Well, guess what? I did it my way, and it worked. I got tax increases without entitlement cuts, I flipped the script on the culture war, and now Marco Rubio is going to help me pass an immigration bill. I'm still up for a grand bargain, but I don't need one: The economy's limping back, the deficit should stabilize in the short run, and the long term -- well, that's my successor's problem. I'd like to win on gun control and climate change, but I'll settle for making the case and seeing whether a Biden administration (you only think I'm kidding) can finish the job.
Sure, second terms can be dicey propositions. But as long as I don't get impeached or start a land war in Asia, I'm feeling pretty good about my legacy.
And oh, you centrist chin-strokers who kept saying I was no Clinton? You were absolutely right.
I'm the liberal Reagan. Deal with it.

HEADLINE: The French Way of War

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER. 
The Paris bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
PARIS
IN 1966, the French president, Charles de Gaulle, war hero and general nuisance in Allied eyes, wrote President Lyndon B. Johnson to announce that France was pulling out of full membership in NATO and would expel NATO headquarters from France.
''France is determined to regain on her whole territory the full exercise of her sovereignty, at present diminished by the permanent presence of allied military elements or by the use which is made of her airspace; to cease her participation in the integrated commands; and no longer to place her forces at the disposal of NATO,'' de Gaulle wrote. 
After the humiliating capitulation to the Nazis, a tremendous shock to a prideful and martial France, it was not especially surprising that de Gaulle should seek to restore France to a place at the top table of nations, capable of defending its own interests with its own means at its own pace and pleasure.
Even today, as French troops intervene in Mali, the French take pride in their military capacity and in their independence of action. French forces still march every year down the Champs-Élysées on Bastille Day, a military celebration unparalleled in the West. France has nuclear weapons and is the only country, other than the United States, with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. And even as Paris has slowly reconciled itself to full NATO membership, France has maintained its ability to send troops and equipment quickly to large parts of the globe, and it should soon overtake an austerity-minded Britain as the world's fourth largest military spender, after the United States, China and Russia.
''The French, who are so gloomy and pessimistic about the situation in the country and the economy, have at least one reason to be proud of what their country can achieve,'' Jean-David Levitte, the diplomatic adviser to former President Nicolas Sarkozy and the former ambassador to both the United States and the United Nations, told me. ''We still have a foreign policy, a capacity to act beyond our borders, a capacity to make a difference.''
France cannot do everything on its own, Mr. Levitte freely acknowledges. ''But if you don't have the military means to act, you don't have a foreign policy,'' he said.
The French are willing to intervene militarily, but on the basis of new conditions, which differ, French officials argue, from the old colonial habits and traditions known as ''Françafrique.''
In Mali, as they did in 2011 in Libya and in Ivory Coast, the French have intervened on the basis of a direct request for help from a legitimate government, the support of regional African groupings like the African Union and a resolution from the United Nations Security Council.
Even in Mali, France means to act multilaterally, even if it is leading from the front, as it did in Libya, in the name of saving an ally and helping the Sahel region combat the spread of radical Islamists, some of them foreign jihadists, strongly connected to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
So far, the decisive intervention by the French president, François Hollande, has been popular. A survey published on Wednesday by BVA for Le Parisien found that 75 percent of the French supported Mr. Hollande's decision to take rapid military action against Islamist rebels in Mali, despite the risks, compared with 66 percent support for intervention in Libya last year and 55 percent for Afghanistan in 2001. An earlier poll on Monday for IFOP found that 63 percent backed Mr. Hollande's decision.
More striking, perhaps, the consensus among the political elite has been unanimously supportive, says Bruno Tertrais, a defense analyst at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. ''The French people are ready to support a military operation as long as the objectives are clear and seem legitimate,'' he told me. While stopping the Islamist advance on Bamako, Mali's capital, is such a goal, he went on to say, ''if it were a matter of an operation to reconquer the north of Mali, the perception would have been different.''
The French have an all-volunteer military, which distances the population further from the cost of war and makes soldiers ''less visible to the populace at large,'' notes Sébastien Jakubowski, a sociologist at the University of Lille who studies the army. It has also made the army more popular, with an approval rating of between 80 and 90 percent, he says.
But in another change from the past, the French expect that a decision to use the military will be based on clear moral criteria, Mr. Jakubowski said. And the French take some pride in playing a leading role from a moral foundation, even if French national interests are also at play, pushing other allies to act.
Mr. Jakubowski cited an interview in Le Figaro on Jan. 3 with the American neoconservative historian Robert Kagan, whose study of American and European attitudes toward the use of force, comparing America to Mars and Europe to Venus, was much caricatured but highly influential.
In the interview, and later to me, Mr. Kagan praised the French for their willingness to use force in the pursuit of legitimate goals, even if they may not always have sufficient means to accomplish them. ''Nobody asks France to be at the forefront of military interventions, but the willingness of the French to take the initiative is positive,'' he said. ''I have a new philosophy: If the French are ready to go, we should go.''
But the French also understand that their military limitations are real, and they are far better off acting with others, even if not always with Washington. Paris has been a constant prod to other European countries, and to the European Union itself, to develop better military capacities.
''We think it is absolutely necessary for other European countries to do what we do,'' Mr. Levitte said. ''Otherwise there will be a kind of strategic irrelevance of Europe as a whole.'' It should be obvious, he said, that the United States has other priorities and is concentrating on Asia, and need not act everywhere. ''So if we are both independent and true allies of the United States we should be in a position to act when need be.''

HEADLINE: Africa Must Take Lead In Mali, France Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- With French officials saying confidently on Saturday that an advance by Islamist militants on Bamako, Mali's capital, had been halted, France's foreign minister told African leaders that ''our African friends need to take the lead'' in a multilateral military intervention in Mali.
The foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, spoke in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, at a summit meeting to discuss how to accelerate the involvement of West African troops in Mali, although he acknowledged that it could be weeks before they were there in force. 
''Step by step, I think it's a question from what I heard this morning of some days, some weeks,'' said Mr. Fabius, referring to the time frame when the bulk of troops from the Economic Community of West African States, the regional group known as Ecowas, would arrive.
France intervened militarily on Jan. 11 after the Malian government said it was afraid that Islamist militants, who control the north, could continue their push south and take over Bamako with little opposition from a dispirited army.
Once the situation is more stable, France wants African troops to do most of the work to wrest the north from the Islamists, as called for under a United Nations Security Council resolution passed in December.
French officials conceded, however, that there were disputes over how African participation would be financed and about the best way to transport troops to Mali. In Paris, French officials said the United States, while willing to help ferry African troops, wanted to bill France for the use of transport aircraft, which officials said would not go down well with the French. The Pentagon favors providing rapid help with transport and even with air-to-air refueling, but the White House is more reluctant, the officials said.
But the officials said France and that the United States were sharing intelligence about Mali and the Sahel region of North Africa that was garnered from drones and other means, and that discussions with Washington continued amicably.
The African troops also need equipment and training, and Mr. Fabius pointed to a donors' meeting in Ethiopia scheduled for Jan. 29 as ''a key moment.''
The French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said Saturday that France now had 2,000 troops in Mali, with more in the region, and that France was likely to add to its forces there. He said the Mali operation could involve at least 4,000 soldiers in the region, and French officials said they would put no fixed limit on the number of troops that might be required to restore the territorial integrity of Mali and drive back the Islamist fighters, who have ties to Al Qaeda.
The French officials emphasized that the targets of the mission were the Islamists, not the Tuaregs or other Malians fighting for more autonomy or independence in the north. They also said Islamist terrorists in Mali had made four or five efforts to carry out operations in France in the last few years.
Despite reports of French forces fighting on the ground in and around the village of Diabaly, Mr. Le Drian said that ''there has been no ground combat'' there, only airstrikes. He dismissed reports from Malian Army sources that French troops were fighting or even in the town. ''I think someone is hallucinating,'' he said. Residents have told local news agencies that the Islamists have left Diabaly, which they seized as an important way station on the road to the administrative capital, Ségou, north of Bamako.
In the Islamist-controlled northern town of Gao on Saturday, young residents lynched an Islamist police commissioner in retaliation for the killing of a local radio journalist earlier in the day, according to a Twitter post from the office of Mali's president, Dioncounda Traoré. The journalist had been suspected of working with foreign radio stations, Reuters reported.
French airstrikes have halted the Islamist advance toward Mopti and nearby Sévaré, French officials said, while they confirmed that the village of Konna, north of Mopti, was now back in the hands of Mali's government.
Also on Saturday, Human Rights Watch said it had received what it called credible reports of abuses being committed by Malian security forces against Tuareg and Arab civilians.

HEADLINE: Medicaid Expansion Is Delicate Maneuver for Arizona's Republican Governor

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Gov. Jan Brewer called it ''one of the most difficult decisions'' of her 30 years in public service.
If she chose to expand Medicaid, the federal and state program that provides health care to poor and disabled people, she risked antagonizing her conservative base, steadfast opponents of President Obama's health care law. If she did not, she risked missing a solid chance of shifting the way she is viewed by a Latino population of increasing political influence, beyond her stern positions on immigration.
Ms. Brewer, who has become something of a conservative icon for her aggressive opposition to Mr. Obama's policies, surprised many Legislature watchers at her State of the State address last week by saying she wanted to expand the state's Medicaid program to include anyone who makes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $14,856 for an individual. The risk if Arizona does otherwise, she said, is losing the federal funds and the health care jobs that come with the changes. 
It could be simply a case of math trumping ideology: In 2014, the first full year of the expansion, Arizona stands to gain $1.6 billion in federal matching funds, Ms. Brewer said. (The federal government would cover the full cost of the new beneficiaries in the early years and 90 percent of the cost after 2020.)
Her fellow Republican governors in the Southwest, Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada, used a similar argument to justify their decisions to do the same thing. But it was Ms. Brewer whom National Review Online, the conservative publication, singled out for criticism in an editorial, saying she exemplified ''that unfortunately common strain of Republican leadership that is uncompromising in rhetoric but opportunistic in reality.'' Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group, also circulated a paragraph-by-paragraph rebuttal of the arguments she used to support her choice.
Expanding Medicaid is a central element in Mr. Obama's plan to provide health coverage for virtually every American, as it could add as many as 17 million people to the rolls. Last month, his administration made it an all-or-nothing proposition, saying it would not cover partial expansions, a move that left many Republican governors who were hoping for such a middle-of-the-way option looking for a different way.
Both demography and geography are playing a role in which governors are choosing to expand Medicaid and which are not, observers said. Republican governors bucked the party line in the Southwest, where Latinos are at once a significant slice of the poor population and a powerful voting bloc. But in the South, Republican governors have stayed in unwavering opposition to expanding Medicaid or embracing any of the voluntary aspects of Mr. Obama's health care law.
''The South is Republican, and it's getting more Republican, so there is very little political risk there in letting the hard-right Republican philosophy take over'' despite the region's substantial number of poor residents without health insurance, said Richard White, a professor of history at Stanford University.
The expansion in Arizona, which requires state legislative approval, is popular among Latino voters, who lean heavily Democratic, and among Latinos in general, who stand to gain the most from it. A report by NCLR, a Latino advocacy organization also known as the National Council of La Raza, said the national expansion of Medicaid would account for about half of the Latinos newly insured under the health care law across the country, with about 3.1 million additional Latinos covered by the program.
Gabriel Sanchez, the research director at Latino Decisions, a polling group, said the future of politics in the West ''is largely connected to expansion of the Latino electorate,'' so siding with issues that matter to them ''is sometimes a matter of survival'' in politics.
In Nevada, where the expansion is projected to enroll 78,000 people and bring in more than $700 million in federal funds over the first three years, Mr. Sandoval immediately received the support of the Republican leadership in the State Senate. In New Mexico, where the expansion would add 208,000 people to the program and bring in roughly $5 billion through 2022, no one was surprised that Ms. Martinez decided to go the way she did.
Ms. Martinez and Mr. Sandoval walk a fine line: They are Republican governors in increasingly Democratic states that voted for Mr. Obama twice. The argument they used to defend their decisions, that expanding Medicaid could bring more money and more jobs, is an easy sell in New Mexico and Nevada, which continue to battle the effects of the economic downturn.
As of last week, the only other Republican governor to back the Medicaid expansion was Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota.
Ms. Brewer, though, casts a different profile. She is the finger-wagging governor respected in conservative circles for her outspoken criticism of Mr. Obama and unfaltering support of Arizona's strict immigration legislation, which she fought for all the way to the Supreme Court.
But on Wednesday, as she stood surrounded by health care executives at a news conference that seemed more like a pep rally, she was repeatedly called ''compassionate,'' not a word often used to describe her. The health care industry had lobbied hard for her support of the Medicaid expansion, hiring her former budget director, Peter Burns, and Chuck Coughlin, her campaign strategist, to guide their efforts.
Ms. Brewer's plan includes a ''circuit breaker'' to automatically freeze coverage for childless adults if the federal government drops its share of matching funds below 80 percent.
When first announcing her decision on Monday, she said, ''I will not allow Obamacare to become a bait and switch.'' By Wednesday, she had a more benign assessment, ''There's no way you can look at this issue and say this is not the right thing for Arizona at this time.''
Under the expansion, Arizona is expected to add about 240,000 people to its Medicaid rolls.
Barrett Marson, a public relations consultant who has worked for several Arizona Republicans, said Ms. Brewer's decision was, in part, ''about saying, 'I want to show America who I really am,' and that person is a compassionate conservative who thinks there should be a safety net for people in the bottom rung.''
She wants to prove she is ''not all about immigration,'' he said.
Several hard-line Republicans decided not to seek re-election for the Arizona Legislature or were voted out of office last year. One was Russell K. Pearce, a senator who was the sponsor and chief champion of the state's immigration bill. That, and the fact that there are several Republican legislators whose positions are vulnerable, may also have weighed in the governor's calculation.
''In the South, you can continue to flog the immigration horse,'' said Professor White of Stanford, ''but no longer in the Southwest.''

HEADLINE: Loans for Fixer-Uppers

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
BARGAIN hunters ought not to overlook properties in need of extensive repairs. A federally backed lending program enables buyers to roll the cost of necessary fixes into their mortgage, which can sometimes yield a quick return on their investment.
The Federal Housing Administration's 203(k) program provides for loans that cover purchase and renovation costs for single-family homes and multifamilies with up to four units. The total loan amount is based on the property's appraised value once the repairs are completed. The down-payment requirement is just 3.5 percent.
Using this program, someone who buys a run-down home at a low price, and chooses the renovations wisely, can immediately come out on top, according to 203(k) loan specialists. 
''When people are buying the houses correctly, they're actually generating instant equity,'' said Jeff Onofrio, the director of renovation lending at AnnieMac Home Mortgage in Mount Laurel, N.J. ''It's a matter of getting the right house at the right deal.''
Matt Perillie, a loan specialist at Campbell Mortgage in North Haven, Conn., had a similar reaction. ''The properties that are going to give the instant equity are the bank-owned houses with no heat or a failing roof, and those shortcomings are accounted for in the sales price,'' he said.
Although the 203(k) program has been around since 1978, said Paul Welden, the director of the 203(k) Contractor Program in Tempe, Ariz., which trains contractors, ''it was not widely used until this foreclosure mess started almost a decade ago, because there was never a big need for it.'' When that changed, ''it became a necessary tool to be able to sell or buy distressed properties in poor condition.'' Although 203(k) volume is low over all, usage has gone up. About 22,500 loans were endorsed by the housing administration in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2012, compared with about 3,400 in the 2007 fiscal year, government data shows.
The loans are not available to investors -- borrowers must live in the properties. But Mr. Onofrio said he had seen borrowers use a 203(k) loan to buy and renovate a multifamily property, live there a year or so, refinance into a conventional loan, and move on.
The loans are more expensive than conventional financing, because the interest rates are slightly higher (the average 30-year fixed rate is now around 3.75 to 4 percent) and private mortgage insurance is required.
In addition, borrowers must pay a building consultant, who writes the initial estimate of the cost of planned repairs. (Fees range from $400 to $1,000, depending on the extent of repairs.) The consultant also ensures that the repairs will bring the house up to government health and safety standards.
The loans do not cover the addition of a luxury item like a pool. But allowances are made toward the cost of repairing or removing a pool, as well as for the addition of solar panels.
Renovations must be completed within six months after closing. The contractor is paid in intervals after periodic inspections of how the work is progressing. Borrowers should make sure they hire experienced contractors who understand that they won't be paid upfront and must adhere to strict timelines, Mr. Welden advised.
About 60 percent of Mr. Onofrio's clients use 203(k) loans to buy bank-owned houses or short sales. Others use them to buy and update older homes, or refinance and redo their homes.
Loan limits depend on where the property is. For a single-family property, the limit ranges from $271,050 to $729,750.
Although 203(k) loans have had a bad reputation among some real estate brokers as too slow to get to closing, delays are often the fault of mortgage representatives who don't really know all that's involved, said Mr. Perillie of Campbell Mortgage.
''Now, the agents are more apt to do them,'' he said, ''a lot of times because it's the only way to get financing on a property that has no plumbing.''

HEADLINE: First-Term Promises Made, Kept and Broken

 BODY:
Inequality
President Obama has changed the tax code significantly, with the aim of fighting inequality. He and Congressional Democrats eliminated the Bush tax cuts on couples' income above $450,000 (compromising from their preferred $250,000 threshold). The health care overhaul also raises taxes on the affluent. Still, he has been unable to accomplish all of his goals, and tax rates on top incomes remain far below their levels from the 1940s through 1980.
''We have to disaggregate tax policy between the wealthy and the working class or middle class. We have to be able to say that we are going to at once raise taxes on some people and lower taxes on others.'' --February 2008 interview with The New York Times 
Wars
Mr. Obama has wound down the war in Iraq, as promised. In Afghanistan, he initially sent more troops, before later reversing course and settling on a much smaller presence there. In the process, he has frustrated critics on both sides: those who believe the United States should still have a stronger presence in Afghanistan and those who believe Mr. Obama should have withdrawn more quickly. In a signature accomplishment, he ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.
''We should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases ... We cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.'' --September 2008 presidential debate in Oxford, Miss.
Climate
Despite promising to make climate a central part of his presidency, Mr. Obama failed to persuade the Senate to pass a sweeping bill, and some Congressional Democrats were frustrated he did not push harder. The administration has financed alternative-energy programs and tightened automobile and other energy standards, contributing to a slowdown in carbon emissions.
''I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment ... when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.'' --June 2008 Democratic nomination acceptance speech in St. Paul
Recession
Nonpartisan economists credit Mr. Obama's 2009 stimulus, along with moves by the Federal Reserve, with playing a central role in preventing the financial crisis from turning into another depression. But the president and his advisers consistently underestimated the economy's lingering problems in 2010 and 2011. Although Republicans blocked many steps Mr. Obama wanted to take, the administration also chose to do less than it might have in several areas, especially housing.
''We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle class ... provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S.'' --May 2008 interview with Jorge Ramos of Univision
Immigration
Mr. Obama has cracked down on illegal immigration, deporting more than 1.5 million people during his first term. In 2012, he took executive action to allow young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children to remain. After promising -- and failing -- to deliver an overhaul of the immigration laws early in his first term, Mr. Obama said the issue would be a top priority in the first year of his second term.
''I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days. But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.'' --May 2008 interview with Jorge Ramos of Univision
Healthcare
In his most significant domestic accomplishment, Mr. Obama and his allies succeeded where previous presidents and Congressional leaders had failed and passed a sweeping health care bill. The legislation is projected to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by tens of millions, largely by subsidizing poor and middle-class families. The law also tries to reduce the growth rate of health costs, the main cause of future budget deficits. But the cost-control measures do not go as far as many experts advocate and their efficacy remains unclear.
''If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.'' --October 2008 presidential debate in Nashville

HEADLINE: A Nod to Film Music, A Changeable Band And a Swedish Poet

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
Petra Haden
The expansive interiority of a great film score -- as properly experienced, in the flickering dark -- might seem like strange territory for a vocalist working unaccompanied. But then Petra Haden happens to thrive best in strange territory. ''Petra Goes to the Movies'' (Anti-), due out on Tuesday, features her a cappella versions of more than a dozen movie themes, with her vocals meticulously multitracked. The arrangements are ingenious, emphasizing Ms. Haden's gift for mimesis: she can suggest the swoon of a string section as handily as the blare of a solitary bugle. Her ''Carlotta's Galop,'' from Fellini's ''8 ½,'' has just the right jolt of Nino Rota circus mania; her ''Psycho'' has all the spikiness and stealth grandeur of Bernard Hermann's famous title theme. Ms. Haden takes a more conventional turn on several tracks with accompanists -- the pianist Brad Mehldau, the guitarist Bill Frisell and her father, the bassist Charlie Haden -- but she does her truest work here as a one-woman studio orchestra, her obsessive attentions clearing a fresh vantage on the music.
Ibrahim Maalouf 
Born in Beirut but raised in Paris, where he still lives, Ibrahim Maalouf has in some ways carried the mantle of his father, Nassim: both have made a specialty of playing Arabic music on the four-valve quarter-tone trumpet, with classical precision. But the younger Mr. Maalouf is more of a jazz musician, as he shows with ''Wind'' (Mi'ster), featuring the German pianist Frank Woeste and a few adaptable Americans: the saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Clarence Penn. The album's melancholy gleam is no accident. It was commissioned as a complement to the 1927 silent movie ''La Proie du Vent'' (''The Prey in the Wind'') and inspired by Miles Davis's shadowy music for another French film, Louis Malle's ''Ascenseur Pour l'Échafaud'' (''Elevator to the Gallows''). The moods range from poignant calm (''Surprises'') to loping menace (''Suspicions'') to watchful languor (''Waiting''), and the band sounds alert and supple at every turn.
Ra Ra Riot
On its face ''Beta Love'' (Barsuk) is the sound of a band finally plugging into the matrix. Ra Ra Riot's previous two albums proposed a flowery, chamber-esque take on indie-rock, self-conscious sometimes to a fault. The new album, due out on Tuesday, plunges deep into synth pop, with Wes Miles's tenor soaring sweetly over a range of mechanized textures. The band still has its violinist but not its cellist, and it got a vital assist from the producer Dennis Herring and the session drummer Josh Freese. Naturally there's a concept, involving the cyberpunk sage William Gibson and the futurist-inventor Ray Kurzweil. Best to ignore all that. When Mr. Miles gets too literal, as on ''Binary Mind,'' you can begin to feel cornered. Far better is his bittersweet keen on ''Angel, Please'' and ''For Once'' and ''Is It Too Much,'' songs of direct melodic and emotional thrust.
Jack DeJohnette's Special Edition
The brilliant jazz drummer Jack DeJohnette has made something like three dozen albums as a leader; he's a generous collaborator, which can make the issue of leadership a little nebulous. But his best work feels flush with anticipation, as if he were stepping to the plate for the first time. Special Edition, a changeable band most active in the 1980s, captured that feeling especially well on the four albums it released on ECM: ''Special Edition,'' ''Tin Can Alley,'' ''Inflation Blues'' and ''Album Album.'' Now packaged as a boxed set (''Special Edition,'' four CDs, $30.99), these recordings exude toughness and exuberance, along with a limber equilibrium. Working with two or three saxophonists (including David Murray and Chico Freeman, at different times), and doubling himself on piano or melodica, Mr. DeJohnette combined avant-garde combustion with a cool lyrical instinct. ''Inflation Blues,'' an album previously unavailable on CD, features slashing work by the trumpeter Baikida Carroll -- and an effective vocal performance by Mr. DeJohnette, on the plaintive, reggae-slanted title track.
Colin Stetson & Mats Gustafsson
The saxophonists Colin Stetson and Mats Gustafsson share a hard-nosed fascination with pure sound, along with a wariness of genre convention. Both have earned the loyalty of indie-rock obscurantists as well as avant-garde jazz partisans, partly by refusing to fit in. They hadn't ever played together before the 2011 Vancouver Jazz Festival concert that yielded ''Stones'' (Rune Grammofon), with Mr. Stetson on bass and alto saxophones and Mr. Gustafsson on baritone and tenor. It's a rangy, spontaneous dialogue, an eventful 35 minutes parsed into four tracks. At times, as in the tongue-slapping staccato portion of ''Stones That Can Only Be,'' they land on the same strategy in rough tandem. Elsewhere, as on ''Stones That Only Have,'' they root around like a couple of grumbling wildebeests. (The titles are a nod to the Swedish poet Gunnar Ekelof.) Whatever the effect, their rapport is capacious; this shouldn't be the end of it.

HEADLINE: Smith and Boldin Give the Ravens Dynamic Bookends at Wide Receiver

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- The transformation was subtle, imperceptible to the Denver Broncos, to the 76,732 fans cramming Sports Authority Field at Mile High, to the millions of viewers tuning in around the country -- to everyone, it seemed, but a lone man standing along the Baltimore Ravens' sideline.
When the pass took flight, with 41 seconds remaining before halftime, that man, Jim Hostler, watched it. He watched Torrey Smith morph into Anquan Boldin. His relentlessness, his superior coordination in midair, his eyes and hands working in concert as he soared above Denver cornerback Champ Bailey -- it was as if Smith had incorporated all of Boldin's instructions these last two seasons on a single magnificent play, a 32-yard touchdown.
''That's how Q plays the game,'' said Hostler, the Ravens' receivers coach, referring to Boldin by a nickname. ''And now, Torrey can, too.'' 
Smith, who turns 24 next Saturday, cites Boldin's tutelage as a major factor in his development, but theirs is a symbiotic relationship. Boldin mentors Smith, who leaned on him last summer when he ''couldn't really walk and chew gum at the same time'' and has since emerged as a speedy big-play threat. Smith, in turn, stretches the defense, which creates opportunities for Boldin underneath and on intermediate routes.
Together they have tormented opponents in Baltimore's surge to Sunday's A.F.C. championship rematch at New England, alternately taking star turns. In the Ravens' victory against Indianapolis, Boldin set the franchise's postseason receiving record with 145 yards, on five catches that showcased his array of skills: over the shoulder, in double coverage, with an arm in his face. In their double-overtime upset of top-seeded Denver, Smith burned Bailey, one of the league's most decorated cornerbacks, for two deep touchdown passes.
Their personalities contrast as starkly as their styles -- Smith is genial and expressive, Boldin private and intense -- but they are bonded by their past, by adversity that shaped them then, that influences them now.
For Smith, his electrifying performance in Denver was his most complete game since Sept. 23, when he carved up the Patriots with 6 catches for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 31-30 victory. On Wednesday, he explained his success by saying, ''I just happened to play well against them.''
Receiver Jacoby Jones offered a different reaction.
''I told him, 'Man, I look up to you,' '' Jones said. ''I couldn't have done what you did.''
Just before midnight on Sept. 22, Smith's younger brother Tevin Jones, 19, crashed his motorcycle into a utility pole in their native Virginia. He died at the scene. Smith left the Ravens' hotel about 2 a.m. and raced home to grieve with his family. About 12 hours later, after barely sleeping, he rejoined his teammates. Kevin Glover, the longtime N.F.L. center who became a confidant of Smith's while working in Maryland's athletic department, attended the funeral. There, Smith presented his family with two footballs, from his touchdown catches against the Patriots.
That he had the courage to play -- and the focus to play well -- did not surprise those who know Smith best, those who know the details of a turbulent childhood that left him caring for his six younger siblings.
''He is so mentally tough, and I imagine it's because he's had to compartmentalize his entire life,'' said Vanderbilt Coach James Franklin, who was Smith's offensive coordinator at Maryland for three seasons. ''He's used that energy and passion and emotion for his benefit.''
From an early age, Smith did his siblings' laundry. He changed their diapers. He fed them; his proficiency in the kitchen earned him the nickname the Microwave King, from his mother, Monica Jenkins. She worked two jobs, and for a while she was involved in an abusive relationship with a man who was not Smith's father.
That humble upbringing produced a young man with no ego, said friends and coaches. Roger Pierce, Smith's coach for three years at Stafford High School in Virginia, remembers the day Tom Brattan, a coach at Maryland at the time, came to visit, and Smith transported a special-needs student down a congested hallway.
''That's just who Torrey is,'' Pierce said. ''Always responsible for other people.''
At Maryland, Smith shuttled between campus and his family whenever time allowed. He never missed class, practice, a team function. Once, he asked Dwight Galt, the strength and conditioning coach, who was then unaware of Smith's family circumstances, if he could work out early on Fridays so he could go home. Told no, Smith lifted with his group, then bolted to Virginia.
''It went on like this for about a year before he finally told me that he was going there to help out his brothers and sisters,'' Galt said. ''He wasn't embarrassed by anything. It was that it was part of his life, and he took care of it like he takes care of everything.''
When asked whether he has always considered football an escape, Smith spoke specifically about his brother's death. He called escape a weird term.
''I feel like these guys are my brothers,'' he said. ''I'm in here the same as when I was home. Even after my brother passed, I left home and came up here and the love was still the same.''
Players speak about the team's closeness, forged by leaders like Ray Lewis and Ed Reed and Matt Birk, by coaches who say, ''iron sharpens iron.'' They protect their own, which might be why Smith -- and Boldin, for that matter -- fits in so well. Boldin arrived in a trade with Arizona in March 2010. The deal did more than furnish Joe Flacco with a No. 1 receiver. It added one of the toughest players in the sport.
Boldin, 32, grew up in Pahokee, a South Florida town afflicted by unemployment and poverty but a place where, Ravens defensive end Pernell McPhee said, ''you come out of the womb ready to play football.'' Boldin's parents divorced when he was 9, and his mother, Brenda Banks, worked late hours, including as a day care teacher in West Palm Beach, an hour's drive away. He saw football as a means to leave Pahokee, but he returns often, to donate turkeys or outfit a team with new equipment.
''He uses football to express his anger,'' said D. J. Boldin, his younger brother. ''When he's on the field, he just has that dominant spirit.''
Had it at Pahokee High School, where an assistant coach, Blaze Thompson, recalled Boldin's running into a pile of five or so defenders and coming out the other end, ''just dragging guys.'' Had it at Florida State, where he began a stellar career by scoring two touchdowns in his first game. Has it in the N.F.L., where few are better, Hostler said, at catching contested balls.
''If you continue to come at a guy during a game, mentally he's going to break down,'' said the longtime N.F.L. receiver Derrick Mason, who played with Baltimore in 2010. ''Anquan uses that to his advantage -- his big body, his physical presence, not giving up. Guys get tired covering him.''
One play has come to define his toughness. On Sept. 28, 2008, when Boldin was playing for the Arizona Cardinals, Eric Smith of the Jets drilled him with a helmet-to-helmet hit. Boldin's head snapped back. His body crashed to the turf. His sinus membrane was fractured, requiring 7 plates and 40 screws to fix. Boldin came back a month later, missing only two games. D. J. was in the stands for his brother's return, at Carolina. On the Cardinals' first drive, Boldin gained 30 yards on an end-around. Rather than veer out of bounds to avoid contact, Boldin lowered his shoulder and drove into the defender.
''I was like, 'He just broke his face,' '' said D. J., his voice rising. ''He didn't just come back. He came back fearless.''
In that area, Boldin and Smith have much experience. Jacoby Jones calls Boldin ''Quan the Bully'' because of his physical, unyielding style. Smith recently printed for his teammates purple T-shirts that read, ''FINAO -- Failure Is Not an Option.'' It is not. Not for either of them. Not for both of them.

HEADLINE: Rift Widens Over Mining Of Uranium in Virginia

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
CHATHAM, Va. -- In a landscape of rolling pastures and grazing cattle, Stewart East stepped from his pickup truck with a Geiger counter. He pointed it at a puddle filled by recent rains, and the instrument erupted in scratchy feedback.
''This is the top of the deposit,'' said Mr. East, an employee of a company that wants to mine one of the largest lodes of uranium in the United States, which happens to be found here in southern Virginia.
A fight over whether to drill beneath the oak hedgerows, an undertaking that would yield 1,000 jobs and a bounty of tax revenue in addition to nuclear fuel, has divided the region. The bitterness is reflected in competing lawn signs that read ''No Uranium Mining'' and, on the other side of the road, ''Stop whining. Start mining.''
Now, after years of government reports and hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations that included a trip to France for state lawmakers, the issue has reached the crucible of Virginia's General Assembly. 
Bills introduced last week would lift a moratorium on uranium mining at the site here, known as Coles Hill. Political supporters say that the mining would bring economic benefits and that risks from radioactive wastes, or tailings, can be safely managed. Opponents fear the contamination of drinking water in case of an accident, and a stigma from uranium that would deter people and businesses from moving to the area.
The politics of the issue do not divide neatly along party lines. Opponents include most state lawmakers from the region, all of whom are Republicans. A prominent supporter is the minority leader of the State Senate, Richard L. Saslaw, a Democrat, who lives in the northern suburbs. Asked about buried uranium tailings that remain a risk for hundreds of years, Mr. Saslaw, who is known for unguarded statements, said in a radio interview, ''I'm not going to be here.''
Many lawmakers in the Republican-controlled General Assembly seem to be looking to Gov. Bob McDonnell for guidance.
But Mr. McDonnell, also a Republican, pointedly indicated on Tuesday, when the last research report he requested arrived, that he might not take a position at all. The governor will review the findings ''before deciding whether or not to take any recommendation on uranium mining,'' said Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for Mr. McDonnell, who is thought to be considering a run for the presidency in 2016.
Proponents of extracting Virginia's uranium, worth an estimated $7 billion, argue that national security demands more domestic mining, because 92 percent is imported. Mr. McDonnell used that same argument to push drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's coast (now blocked by the Obama administration).
Supporters are disappointed and perplexed by Mr. McDonnell's cautious stance so far, given that he once vowed to make Virginia ''the energy capital of the East Coast.''
A spokesman denied that the governor was motivated by a political calculus over his national reputation. ''He's focused on public health and safety and smart public policy. That's it,'' said J. Tucker Martin, Mr. McDonnell's communications director.
A National Academy of Sciences report in 2011 stopped the momentum in last year's General Assembly for lifting the ban, imposed three decades earlier in the wake of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant accident. The report warned of ''steep hurdles'' to safe mining and ''significant human health'' dangers if a capped tailings pile leaks because of the state's ''frequent storms.''
After a follow-up report ordered by the governor, the Virginia Commission on Coal and Energy, a group of 13 legislators, voted to clear the way last month for lifting the ban in the legislature.
Patrick Wales, the project manager for Virginia Uranium, the mine developer, said he shared in the concerns for safety. ''My son plays in these creeks,'' Mr. Wales said. He said improvements in tailings storage have ''largely eliminated'' the environmental hazards associated with reckless uranium mining in the West through the 1970s.
To influence lawmakers, Virginia Uranium has poured more than $600,000 into campaign contributions and lobbying since 2008, according to public records. For the current 45-day legislative session in Richmond, it has retained 20 lobbyists.
The opposition, made up of a coalition of environmental groups, the Virginia Farm Bureau and cities downstream from the mine site, has also spent generously on lobbyists.
''By now, members are running and hiding'' in the Capitol when they spot a lobbyist, a legislative aide said.
In 2010 and 2011, Virginia Uranium paid $122,000 total to fly about two dozen members of the General Assembly to France to visit a tailings storage site, which critics quickly labeled a junket. The sponsor of the Senate bill that would lift the uranium ban, John C. Watkins, was among those traveling.
''There is nothing in life that is 100 percent guaranteed,'' Mr. Watkins said of the safety concerns of opponents, adding that he respected those concerns. His bill would direct the state to write regulations for mining, including protecting groundwater, a process that could take several years. ''We are going to employ the best engineering, the best technology, the best science'' to prevent contamination, he said.
In south-central Virginia, many officials have come out in opposition, most recently the Chamber of Commerce of Danville and Pittsylvania County, where Chatham is.
Delegate James E. Edmunds II, a Republican, said that in the event that radiation leaked into the groundwater, his district would be one of the first affected. ''There's no waiting for a big rain to clean it up,'' he said. ''I'm not going to have that as my legacy.''
The issue has turned many of the region's elected Republicans, the party of ''drill, baby, drill'' and property rights, into mining opponents.
Officials described wrestling with their desire to bring jobs to an area facing high unemployment and whose tobacco and textile industries have collapsed. ''It's been very divisive, very difficult,'' said Delegate Donald W. Merricks, who represents Chatham and opposes the mine.
In Chatham, a quaint town anchored by an 1853 courthouse with fat white columns, the nerves of many residents are so frayed that they would not say which side they were on for fear of angering neighbors.
But at Pat's Place, a lunch counter on South Main Street, Jason Hicks, the 38-year-old owner, was not so shy. ''I think it would be a good thing,'' said Mr. Hicks, whose business has not fully recovered from the recession. ''The county is starving for jobs. With that coming in, it would pick up the town a whole lot.''
Wanda Doss, 56, a clerical worker leaving Pat's, said: ''I'm afraid of cancer down the road and polluted water. You have a flood, and it's going to get in the water system.''
Informal vote counters in the General Assembly said the House, where Republicans hold a supermajority, is inclined to say yes to mining. The State Senate, with Democrats and Republicans each holding 20 seats, is considered too close to call.
Even if Mr. McDonnell does not weigh in, his lieutenant governor, William T. Bolling, a Republican, may exert an influence; he casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie in the Senate. Thwarted by his party in his quest to become its nominee to replace Mr. McDonnell this year, Mr. Bolling has hinted that he might run as an independent.
He recently said he opposes uranium mining.

HEADLINE: The Fed Drives Best At Higher Speeds

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA D. ROMER. 
Christina D. Romer is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.

 BODY:
WITH all the drama about fiscal policy in Congress and at the White House, it's easy to miss the quiet policy evolution taking place nearby, at the Federal Reserve. The central bank has adopted a more aggressive monetary policy that could be very helpful to the recovering economy. But internal debate at the Fed may weaken the program before it really gets off the ground.
First, what has the Fed done recently? Until September, its bond-buying program was explicitly limited in size and duration. Fed policy makers then replaced it with an open-ended program, whose pace was to be determined by progress in healing the labor market. And they adopted simpler, more positive explanations for their actions -- jettisoning the gloomy, expectations-killing language that cited wretched economic prospects to justify every expansionary move.
Then, in December, the Fed surprised markets by replacing its somewhat confusing predictions for interest rates with numerical guidelines. It said it would keep the rate it controls -- the federal funds rate -- near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent or inflation rose above 2.5 percent. 
Under the circumstances, it was significant that the policy makers took these actions at all. The economic data that came out before the September meeting were actually better than expected. And, based on forecasts released after the meeting, members of the Fed's policy-making committee were slightly more optimistic about prospects for employment and output growth than they had been three months before. That they nevertheless adopted a more expansionary policy can be read as an admission that they hadn't been doing enough earlier.
The pledge to keep rates low, even if inflation edged above 2 percent, is particularly consequential. For the last several years, the Fed has acted as if 2 percent were not just a target but a ceiling that should never be breached. But coming out of a terrible recession, with unemployment excruciatingly high, a period of very rapid growth is needed to repair the damage -- and it wouldn't be surprising for such growth to push inflation a bit over 2 percent. A Fed acknowledgment that 2.5 percent inflation would be tolerable for a short while isn't a sign that it has lost its commitment to price stability. Instead, it's a strong statement that it is committed to ensuring a faster recovery.
The more positive language, along with the ''we'll do whatever it takes'' approach to bond buying, seems designed to reassure Americans that conditions will improve. This, too, is important. With short-term rates close to zero, the Fed's main tool is expectations management. If it can persuade people to expect more growth -- and yes, a little more inflation -- it may help encourage companies to stop sitting on cash and start investing again.
The new policies are improvements, but I don't want to oversell them. As I suggested in a previous column, a more definitive policy shift -- like adopting a new target for monetary policy -- would likely have a greater impact on expectations and in stimulating the recovery.
And the new policy's numerical parameters are too conservative. According to the Fed's own assessments, normal unemployment over the longer run is well below 6.5 percent. If inflation remains low and unemployment gets down to 6.5 percent, there's no reason to rush to raise interest rates.
The most pressing problem, though, is that the Fed's commitment to its new policies appears shaky. Soon after the December meeting, some members of the policy-making committee spoke out against the action -- killing some of the positive buzz created by the policy statement and by a spirited news conference by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Also, the minutes of the December meeting showed that some who had voted for the new guidance on the fed funds rate were skeptical about the complementary action on bond-buying.
No one of the Fed's recent actions is particularly powerful on its own, but together they create a sense of aggressive expansion and commitment to recovery. If the Fed now stops some of them, giving the public a mixed message, the positive effect on expectations could easily evaporate.
So why has the Fed moved slowly, and why are some policy makers threatening to undo the recent actions? In a recent paper, Prof. David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley (my husband), and I found that pessimistic views about the effectiveness and costs of expansionary actions have played a major role in limiting Fed moves over the last few years. Policy makers worry that such actions will do little good and that they could cause inflation, distortions in financial markets and losses on the Fed's portfolio.
I can't say for sure that those views are wrong today. We just don't have enough experience with situations like the current one to have conclusive evidence one way or the other.
But our paper shows that in two periods when the Fed made terrible errors, the same kinds of pessimistic views were present. Faced with the Great Depression of the early 1930s and the high inflation of the early and late 1970s, monetary policy makers did little because they were convinced that action would be ineffective.
Subsequent events proved both decisions wrong. In the 1930s, a propitious gold inflow allowed the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt to conduct monetary expansion without the Fed. Real interest rates plummeted, expectations improved and investment spending and consumer purchases of durable goods took off -- jump-starting the recovery. At the end of the 1970s, a new Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, concluded that monetary policy absolutely could reduce inflation, and he led the Fed to raise interest rates to historic highs. The recession that followed was painful, but inflation did come down -- and it has been low ever since.
WHEN monetary policy makers meet again at the end of this month, they should keep these historical lessons in mind. At the very least, the Cassandras on the committee might want to reread the policy record from the 1930s. The degree to which some of them sound like their Depression-era counterparts might shock them -- and give them pause.
The Fed's new more aggressive policy shows every sign of being helpful, and there are no indications that the feared costs are materializing. So rather than trimming the policy before it can bear fruit, why not give it a chance?
Even better, why not give it some extra oomph? Rather than just continuing the bond-buying program, accelerate it somewhat. Instead of just reiterating the numerical guidelines on the funds rate, policy makers could follow the suggestion of Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, that they lower to 5.5 percent the unemployment level at which the Fed starts to consider raising interest rates. And if Mr. Bernanke wanted to be truly aggressive, he could broach the idea that in a weak economy, a strong dollar isn't necessarily desirable.
The important thing is that hypothetical fears shouldn't stop the Fed's evolution. History is on the side of doing more, not standing on the sidelines.

HEADLINE: Inequality Is Holding Back The Recovery

BYLINE: By JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ. 
Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, a professor at Columbia and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist for the World Bank, is the author of ''The Price of Inequality.''

 BODY:
THE re-election of President Obama was like a Rorschach test, subject to many interpretations. In this election, each side debated issues that deeply worry me: the long malaise into which the economy seems to be settling, and the growing divide between the 1 percent and the rest -- an inequality not only of outcomes but also of opportunity. To me, these problems are two sides of the same coin: with inequality at its highest level since before the Depression, a robust recovery will be difficult in the short term, and the American dream -- a good life in exchange for hard work -- is slowly dying.
Politicians typically talk about rising inequality and the sluggish recovery as separate phenomena, when they are in fact intertwined. Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back our growth. When even the free-market-oriented magazine The Economist argues -- as it did in a special feature in October -- that the magnitude and nature of the country's inequality represent a serious threat to America, we should know that something has gone horribly wrong. And yet, after four decades of widening inequality and the greatest economic downturn since the Depression, we haven't done anything about it. 
There are four major reasons inequality is squelching our recovery. The most immediate is that our middle class is too weak to support the consumer spending that has historically driven our economic growth. While the top 1 percent of income earners took home 93 percent of the growth in incomes in 2010, the households in the middle -- who are most likely to spend their incomes rather than save them and who are, in a sense, the true job creators -- have lower household incomes, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 1996. The growth in the decade before the crisis was unsustainable -- it was reliant on the bottom 80 percent consuming about 110 percent of their income.
Second, the hollowing out of the middle class since the 1970s, a phenomenon interrupted only briefly in the 1990s, means that they are unable to invest in their future, by educating themselves and their children and by starting or improving businesses.
Third, the weakness of the middle class is holding back tax receipts, especially because those at the top are so adroit in avoiding taxes and in getting Washington to give them tax breaks. The recent modest agreement to restore Clinton-level marginal income-tax rates for individuals making more than $400,000 and households making more than $450,000 did nothing to change this. Returns from Wall Street speculation are taxed at a far lower rate than other forms of income. Low tax receipts mean that the government cannot make the vital investments in infrastructure, education, research and health that are crucial for restoring long-term economic strength.
Fourth, inequality is associated with more frequent and more severe boom-and-bust cycles that make our economy more volatile and vulnerable. Though inequality did not directly cause the crisis, it is no coincidence that the 1920s -- the last time inequality of income and wealth in the United States was so high -- ended with the Great Crash and the Depression. The International Monetary Fund has noted the systematic relationship between economic instability and economic inequality, but American leaders haven't absorbed the lesson.
Our skyrocketing inequality -- so contrary to our meritocratic ideal of America as a place where anyone with hard work and talent can ''make it'' -- means that those who are born to parents of limited means are likely never to live up to their potential. Children in other rich countries like Canada, France, Germany and Sweden have a better chance of doing better than their parents did than American kids have. More than a fifth of our children live in poverty -- the second worst of all the advanced economies, putting us behind countries like Bulgaria, Latvia and Greece.
Our society is squandering its most valuable resource: our young. The dream of a better life that attracted immigrants to our shores is being crushed by an ever-widening chasm of income and wealth. Tocqueville, who in the 1830s found the egalitarian impulse to be the essence of the American character, is rolling in his grave.
Even were we able to ignore the economic imperative of fixing our inequality problem, the damage it is doing to our social fabric and political life should prompt us to worry. Economic inequality leads to political inequality and a broken decision-making process.
Despite Mr. Obama's stated commitment to helping all Americans, the recession and the lingering effects of the way it was handled have made matters much, much worse. While bailout money poured into the banks in 2009, unemployment soared to 10 percent that October. The rate today (7.8 percent) appears better partly because so many people have dropped out of the labor force, or never entered it, or accepted part-time jobs because there was no full-time job for them.
High unemployment, of course, depresses wages. Adjusted for inflation, real wages have stagnated or fallen; a typical male worker's income in 2011 ($32,986) was lower than it was in 1968 ($33,880). Lower tax receipts, in turn, have forced state and local cutbacks in services vital to those at the bottom and middle.
Most Americans' most important asset is their home, and as home prices have plummeted, so has household wealth -- especially since so many had borrowed so much on their homes. Large numbers are left with negative net worth, and median household wealth fell nearly 40 percent, to $77,300 in 2010 from $126,400 in 2007, and has rebounded only slightly. Since the Great Recession, most of the increase in the nation's wealth has gone to the very top.
Meanwhile, as incomes have stagnated or fallen, tuition has soared. In the United States now, the principal way to get education -- the only sure way to move up -- is to borrow. In 2010, student debt, now $1 trillion, exceeded credit-card debt for the first time.
Student debt can almost never be wiped out, even in bankruptcy. A parent who co-signs a loan can't necessarily have the debt discharged even if his child dies. The debt can't be discharged even if the school -- operated for profit and owned by exploitative financiers -- provided an inadequate education, enticed the student with misleading promises, and failed to get her a decent job.
Instead of pouring money into the banks, we could have tried rebuilding the economy from the bottom up. We could have enabled homeowners who were ''underwater'' -- those who owe more money on their homes than the homes are worth -- to get a fresh start, by writing down principal, in exchange for giving banks a share of the gains if and when home prices recovered.
We could have recognized that when young people are jobless, their skills atrophy. We could have made sure that every young person was either in school, in a training program or on a job. Instead, we let youth unemployment rise to twice the national average. The children of the rich can stay in college or attend graduate school, without accumulating enormous debt, or take unpaid internships to beef up their résumés. Not so for those in the middle and bottom. We are sowing the seeds of ever more inequality in the coming years.
The Obama administration does not, of course, bear the sole blame. President George W. Bush's steep tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 and his multitrillion-dollar wars in Iraq and Afghanistan emptied the piggy bank while exacerbating the great divide. His party's newfound commitment to fiscal discipline -- in the form of insisting on low taxes for the rich while slashing services for the poor -- is the height of hypocrisy.
THERE are all kinds of excuses for inequality. Some say it's beyond our control, pointing to market forces like globalization, trade liberalization, the technological revolution, the ''rise of the rest.'' Others assert that doing anything about it would make us all worse off, by stifling our already sputtering economic engine. These are self-serving, ignorant falsehoods.
Market forces don't exist in a vacuum -- we shape them. Other countries, like fast-growing Brazil, have shaped them in ways that have lowered inequality while creating more opportunity and higher growth. Countries far poorer than ours have decided that all young people should have access to food, education and health care so they can fulfill their aspirations.
Our legal framework and the way we enforce it has provided more scope here for abuses by the financial sector; for perverse compensation for chief executives; for monopolies' ability to take unjust advantage of their concentrated power.
Yes, the market values some skills more highly than others, and those who have those skills will do well. Yes, globalization and technological advances have led to the loss of good manufacturing jobs, which are not likely ever to come back. Global manufacturing employment is shrinking, simply because of enormous increases in productivity, and America is likely to get a shrinking share of the shrinking number of new jobs. If we do succeed in ''saving'' these jobs, it may be only by converting higher-paid jobs to lower-paid ones -- hardly a long-term strategy.
Globalization, and the unbalanced way it has been pursued, has shifted bargaining power away from workers: firms can threaten to move elsewhere, especially when tax laws treat such overseas investments so favorably. This in turn has weakened unions, and though unions have sometimes been a source of rigidity, the countries that responded most effectively to the global financial crisis, like Germany and Sweden, have strong unions and strong systems of social protection.
As Mr. Obama's second term begins, we must all face the fact that our country cannot quickly, meaningfully recover without policies that directly address inequality. What's needed is a comprehensive response that should include, at least, significant investments in education, a more progressive tax system and a tax on financial speculation.
The good news is that our thinking has been reframed: it used to be that we asked how much growth we would be willing to sacrifice for a little more equality and opportunity. Now we realize that we are paying a high price for our inequality and that alleviating it and promoting growth are intertwined, complementary goals. It will be up to all of us -- our leaders included -- to muster the courage and foresight to finally treat this beleaguering malady.

FAREWELL, FRED VOODOOA Letter From Haiti
By Amy Wilentz329 pp. Simon & Schuster. $27.
What if conventional wisdom has it exactly wrong? What if Haiti, instead of being mired in retrograde customs and superstitions the developed world cast off centuries ago, is in fact ahead of the curve? What if, as Amy Wilentz posits in her excellent ''Farewell, Fred Voodoo,'' Haiti has always been the most modern of nations, at the forefront of every major historical trend since Columbus dropped anchor off the Hispaniolan coast? 
Wilentz, the author of ''The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier,'' makes a good case with her catalog of Haitian ''firsts.'' The first genocide of indigenous people (the Arawaks); the first truly globalized economy (ships from Europe, slaves from Africa, and products -- chiefly sugar -- from Haiti back to Europe); the earliest Third World liberation movement, resulting in the first (and so far only) successful slave revolution, and the world's first black republic; the prototype for American invasion and ''nation building,'' with the attendant insurgency and guerrilla warfare (1915-34); and now, in our own time, a window into what may well be the future for all of us, a ''postapocalyptic dystopia'' of environmental desolation, government dysfunction, broken cities, dwindling resources and raging epidemics.
Wilentz is good at these twists that turn received ideas inside out. Her relationship with Haiti dates to 1986 and the fall of the Duvalier regime, tumultuous days she spent traversing Port-au-Prince and interviewing, by her own account, ''anyone who had anything to say: . . . this priest and that general, . . . this guy I met in the street, and a market lady, and some man who said he was a tailor.'' In other words, she was interviewing ''Fred Voodoo,'' the politically incorrect label by which an older generation of journalists referred to the Haitian man on the street.
Fred Voodoo is, of course, a stereotype, the generic Haitian ''other'' into which outsiders conveniently pour their agendas, misconceptions and prejudices by way of explaining a place that seems so maddeningly inexplicable. Watching the earthquake coverage from her home in Los Angeles, Wilentz saw all of the old Fred Voodoo tropes being breathlessly recycled by khaki-clad reporters standing atop the rubble. Within two weeks of the quake, Wilentz was back in Haiti, trying, as she says, ''to put Haiti back together again for myself, . . . to stack the pieces flung apart by the earthquake back up into some semblance of the real country.'' This book, then, is Wilentz's attempt to be done with Fred Voodoo -- to see, as clearly as possible, Haitians and Haiti for who and what they are.
Not just Haitians. ''I had added white men to my list of things to think about in Haiti. I was continuing my study of us: What did we think we were doing here?'' These outsiders -- blans in Haitian Creole -- are variously described by Wilentz as the crisis caravan, the innocent army, mobile sovereigns, disaster junkies, aid groupies or simply ''stupid white people.'' Thanks to her long experience with Haiti, Wilentz describes herself as only ''fairly stupid,'' and at all times she's very much part of the narrative, her own confusions, feelings and memories restlessly informing the larger story. It's a tricky approach, and a natural for narcissists; Wilentz addresses one such instance in a chapter entitled ''The Violent-Sex Cure,'' in which she dissects a young American journalist's self-publicized ''fake-rape'' therapy. But in the right hands -- in Wilentz's hands, or Joan Didion's, say, a writer whom Wilentz matches for note-perfect prose and unflinching inquiry -- it becomes almost an act of humility, this open acknowledgment of the self who's telling the story, with all her flaws and shifting moods, her own set of agendas.
Wilentz takes nothing for granted, not even the luxury of presuming her presence in Haiti is useful and worthy. Especially not that. Given the history of outsiders in Haiti, from the foundational dynamic of genocide and slavery to the economic and political manipulations -- the ''soft imperialism'' -- of our own time, Wilentz's self-doubt might be the only sane position from which to operate. She's distrustful of all outsiders, a stance that her accounts of blundering, well-meaning blans (herself included) support. What does basic human decency require us to do? There's so much need and suffering in Haiti that we think the answer should be simple, yet the particulars of the place make it anything but.
There is, for starters, Haiti's bloody history, and how the ''habits of masquerade'' that were survival methods during slavery play out today in complex and obscure ways. Wilentz finds patterns of masquerade in voodoo ritual, in politics (''la politique de doublure''), even in the slippery grammar of Haitian Creole. Outsiders must negotiate a culture where paranoia has historically been a healthy state of mind, due in no small part to Haiti's long tradition of kleptocratic government, perpetually aided and abetted, if not directly imposed, by outsiders. Factor in the self-interest of even genuinely altruistic organizations, and the growing body of research that shows ''development'' often exacerbates the very conditions it's intended to relieve, and you get, well, a world-class mess.
Wilentz is an artful guide through this morass. She can be waspish, sometimes overly so -- her takedown of a foreign-sponsored Haitian sitcom for its irrelevance and insipidity comes across as heavy-handed (it's a sitcom, for God's sake) -- but wading into the swamp of N.G.O.'s, politics and financial machinations, she finds material fit for all the venom she can muster. American households donated $1.4 billion for earthquake relief, with almost $11 billion more pledged by countries and institutions for reconstruction. Add to that the significant private investment currently flowing into the country, and the result is a modern-day gold rush, complete with a global rogues' gallery of hustlers, pols, con artists, capitalists big and small (and there is, incidentally, a literal gold rush under way in the northeast part of the country). Résumés -- mostly foreign -- are being enhanced, and pockets -- ditto -- filled, whereas for most Haitians the trickle-down effect seems to be their best hope, though there's scant evidence that even this will happen anytime soon.
As much as she eviscerates governments and the development industry, Wilentz is alert to competent, dedicated individuals working within the established system. And then there are the miracles, the outsiders who actually manage to do good. The American physician Paul Farmer is one such miracle, his Partners in Health a venerable institution by now, but Wilentz is more interested in the relative newcomers. Why do these people succeed where so many others fail? Wilentz is especially perceptive here, piecing together that rare alchemy of practical skills, stubbornness, flexibility and long-term commitment that enables outsiders to do useful work. As Wilentz says of the American doctor Megan Coffee, ''She lets Haiti teach her how to deal with Haiti.'' The Dr. Coffees of the world never stop learning; it's this ''continuous engagement'' that makes decency possible, the commitment demonstrated by Dr. Coffee's spaghetti rounds, Sabina Carlson's long residence in the Cité Soleil shantytown and Sean Penn's fund-raising travels through Latin America on behalf of the Haitian government.
''There's always hope, whatever that means,'' Wilentz sarcastically comments as she deconstructs a coffee-table book of earthquake photos. Hope's not a given, not in a place as hard as Haiti. Hope is a grind. Hope is a work in progress, emphasis on work. For hope to be real, for it to be more than a feel-good cliché, it has to be earned. That is just one of the many valuable lessons to be found in this intimate, honest, bracingly unsentimental book.

HEADLINE: The Great Divergence

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Earlier this month, Larry Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, stood at a lectern in a small hotel conference room in San Diego and fiddled with a computer until his PowerPoint presentation flashed on the screen. Mishel then composed himself, paid tribute to his intellectual opponent sitting in the front row and began a speech that, he hopes, will reorient the U.S. economy away from the 1 percent or the 0.1 percent and toward the rest of us.
Mishel's session at this year's meeting of the American Economic Association, titled ''Inequality in America,'' tellingly coincided with other sessions called ''Extreme Wage Inequality'' and ''Taxes, Transfers and Inequality.'' As the financial crisis wanes, economists are shifting their attention toward a more subtle, possibly more upsetting crisis in the United States: the significant increase in income inequality. 
Much of what we consider the American way of life is rooted in the period of remarkably broad, shared economic growth, from around 1900 to about 1978. Back then, each generation of Americans did better than the one that preceded it. Even those who lived through the Depression made up what was lost. By the 1950s, America had entered an era that economists call the Great Compression, in which workers -- through unions and Social Security, among other factors -- captured a solid share of the economy's growth.
These days, there's a lot of disagreement about what actually happened during these years. Was it a golden age in which the U.S. government guided an economy toward fairness? Or was it a period defined by high taxes (until the early '60s, the top marginal tax rate was 90 percent) and bureaucratic meddling? Either way, the Great Compression gave way to a Great Divergence. Since 1979, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bottom 80 percent of American families had their share of the country's income fall, while the top 20 percent had modest gains. Of course, the top 1 percent -- and, more so, the top 0.1 percent -- has seen income rise stratospherically. That tiny elite takes in nearly a quarter of the nation's income and controls nearly half its wealth.
The standard explanation of this unhinging, repeated in graduate-school classrooms and in advice to politicians, is technological change. The rise of networked laptops and smartphones and their countless iterations and spawn have helped highly educated professionals create more and more value just as they have created barriers to entry and rendered irrelevant millions of less-educated workers, in places like factory production lines and typing pools. This explanation, known as skill-biased technical change, is so common that economists just call it S.B.T.C. They use it to explain why everyone from the extremely rich to the just-kind-of rich are doing so much better than everyone else.
For two decades, Mishel has been a critic of the S.B.T.C. theory, and that morning in San Diego, he argued that broad technological innovation has been taking place so steadily for so long that the rise of computers simply can't explain the recent explosion in inequality. After all, when economists talk about technological innovation, they are thinking beyond smartphones; they're usually considering innovations that affect production. Business innovations -- like the railroads, telegraph, Henry Ford's conveyor belt and the plastic extruders of the 1960s -- have occurred for more than a century. Computers and the Internet, Mishel argued, are just new examples on the continuum and cannot explain a development like extreme inequality, which is so recent. So what happened?
The change came around 1978, Mishel said, when politicians from both parties began to think of America as a nation of consumers, not of workers. President Jimmy Carter deregulated the airline, trucking and railroad industries in order to help lower consumer prices. Congress chose to ignore organized labor's call for laws strengthening union protections. Ever since, Mishel said, each administration and Congress have made choices -- expanding trade, deregulating finance and weakening welfare -- that helped the rich and hurt everyone else. Inequality didn't just happen, Mishel argued. The government created it.
After Mishel finished his presentation, David Autor, one of the country's most celebrated labor economists, took the stage, fumbled for his own PowerPoint presentation and then explained that there was plenty of evidence showing that technological change explained a great deal about the rise of income inequality. Computers, Autor says, are fundamentally different. Conveyor belts and massive steel furnaces made blue-collar workers comparatively wealthier and hurt more highly skilled craftspeople, like blacksmiths and master carpenters, whose talents were disrupted by mass production. The computer revolution, however, displaced millions of workers from clerical and production occupations, forcing them to compete in lower-paying jobs in the retail, fast-food and home health sectors. Meanwhile, computers and the Internet disproportionately helped people like doctors, engineers and bankers in information-intensive jobs. Inequality was merely a side effect of the digital revolution, Autor said; it didn't begin and end in Washington.
For all their disagreements, Autor and Mishel are allies of sorts. Both are Democrats who have advised President Barack Obama, and both agree that rampant inequality can undermine democracy and economic growth by fostering despair among workers and corruption among the wealthy. This places them in opposition to some right-leaning economists like Gary Becker, a Nobel Prize-winning professor at the University of Chicago, who told me a few years ago that ''inequality in earnings has been mainly the good kind,'' meaning it rewards those people with the education and skills most needed, helping the economy.
How are we to make sense of these competing claims? I asked Frank Levy, the M.I.T. labor economist who hasn't fully committed to any one particular view. Levy suggested seeing how inequality has played out in other countries. In Germany, the average worker might make less than an American, but the government has established an impressive apprenticeship system to keep blue-collar workers' skills competitive. For decades, the Finnish government has offered free education all the way through college. It may have led to high taxes, but many believe it also turned a fairly poor fishing economy into a high-income, technological nation. On the other hand, Greece, Spain and Portugal have so thoroughly protected their workers that they are increasingly unable to compete in the global economy.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a sort of global club for the world's richest nations, has carefully studied the relationship between inequality and growth. The fastest-growing industrialized economies (South Korea, Estonia and Poland) have remarkably low inequality. A few low-growth countries (notably Mexico and Turkey) have high inequality. The rest of the world is all over the place, with no obvious connection between a country's level of inequality and its economic growth.
Yet the scattershot nature of the data does provide some guidance. Inequality has risen almost everywhere, which, Levy says, means that Autor is right that inequality is not just a result of American-government decisions. But the fact that inequality has risen unusually quickly in the United States suggests that government does have an impact. Still, economists certainly cannot tell us which policy is the right one. What do we value more: growth or fairness? That's a value judgment. And for better or worse, it's up to us.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Inequality is the real financial crisis.
2. Many argue over what caused it.
3. And even whether or not it's a bad thing.
4. But there is still hope for the 99 percent.

HEADLINE: The Kale King

BYLINE: Interview by ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
In your new book, ''Conscious Capitalism,'' you write that Whole Foods sees its customers as its ''most important stakeholders'' and that the company is obsessed with their happiness. The biggest complaint I hear about Whole Foods is how expensive it is. Why not drop prices to make your customers happier? People always complain about prices being too high. Whole Foods prices have dropped every year as we get to be larger and we have economies of scale. Also, people are not historically well informed about food prices. We're only spending about 7 percent of our disposable personal income on food. Fifty years ago, it was nearly 16 percent.
A paper from Stanford last year concluded that there is little evidence of greater health benefits from eating organic. If it were ever definitively proved that organic foods offered no health benefits, would you still be a proponent? Oh, absolutely. I've always thought the main argument for organic was more environmental than a health argument. I just don't think spraying a lot of pesticides into the environment on a routine basis is a good thing. 
As I understand it, you're on an organic vegan diet, and you don't eat vegetable oil, sugar or processed food. That is certainly the goal. I travel a lot, so can I always avoid oil and sugar and salt? Not to the degree I would like.
Oh, man. Salt too? I don't completely avoid salt, I'm just trying to minimize it. In America, we're addicted to sugar, fat and salt, and restaurants put all three of those in in abundance.
I'm having a hard time imagining your diet being tasty. Give me an example of a delicious meal. What did I cook for dinner last night? A salad, with my own walnut-cashew-based dressing, a stir-fry that I made without any oil, because you can do that with just water. It had kale and chard, onions, mushrooms and tomatoes in it, and mashed potatoes without salt or dairy, but I added some almond milk.
Considering your health consciousness, would you prefer Whole Foods not hire overweight people or smokers? In some cases we don't hire smokers, but it's hard not to hire people in America who are overweight, because 69 percent of adults are. We're not discriminating against workers, but we are incentivizing them. Healthier team members get a bigger food discount. We give our sickest team members an option to go through what we call the Total Health Immersion, where we take them off for a week, and we do intensive diet-and-lifestyle education. Our regional president in the Southwest, Mark Dixon, was overweight. I got Mark to go. One year later he's lost 95 pounds, and he's biking over 180 miles a week.
How did you get him to go? I nagged him. He didn't have to go.
Any thoughts about those stories in 2007 that you were active on a finance message board, anonymously saying negative things about a Whole Foods' competitor? People make a big deal that I was hiding my identity. But message boards are like going to a Halloween masquerade party. Everybody has a screen name. I had a screen name too. So what? Now I have to be much more careful in what I say.
In 2009, some Whole Foods customers organized boycotts after you wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal expressing opposition to Obama's health care proposals. Do you wish you hadn't written it? No, I don't. I regret that a lot of people didn't actually read it and it got taken out of context. President Obama asked for ideas about health care reform, and I put my ideas out there. Whole Foods has a good health care plan. It's not a solution to America's health care problems, but it's part of the solution.
So did you vote for Romney? I did.
I imagine a certain percentage of Whole Foods customers will also boycott because of this. I don't know what to say except that I'm a capitalist, first. There are many things I don't like about Romney, but more things I don't like about Obama. This is America, and people disagree on things.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Flexible Work Hours

 BODY:
Readers discuss how to make workplaces more family-friendly.
To the Editor:
The United States lags behind most of the world's developed nations in rankings of the best places for mothers, especially working mothers. One reason is that the careers of many Americans demand schedules incompatible with the requirements of parenthood. Having no available middle ground, some primary caregivers (mostly mothers) leave their careers. If they do later return, they nearly always do so at salaries and positions well behind peers who did not interrupt their careers.
This problem can't be remedied simply by extending maternity and paternity leaves. Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France have shown us a solution. By law, employers there cannot unreasonably refuse an employee's request for a part-time or nonstandard schedule. Employers in Britain must ''seriously consider'' such requests, and not discriminate against those who ask. As their needs change, employees can also seek to return to full time. 
Legislation modeled after the modest British law and introduced six years ago by Representative Carolyn Maloney, with co-sponsorship by Senators Barack Obama, Edward M. Kennedy and Hillary Rodham Clinton, is stalled in Congress. By increasing access to part-time schedules, the Working Families Flexibility Act would end or diminish the practice of assigning less important work to part-time workers and lessen their career stigma. Full-time workers taking reduced schedules might create jobs for those unemployed.
Workplace flexibility is not just for the benefit of parents. Significant numbers of men and women would gladly reduce their hours and pay to have more time for other pursuits. (Improving the circumstances of unskilled workers involuntarily on unpredictable part-time schedules is an important but different concern.)
More than a century ago, the labor movement introduced the then radical 40-hour workweek and the vacation to improve Americans' lives. Passage of the Working Families Flexibility Act by Congress would be another important step.
ROBERT WARING Redwood City, Calif., Jan. 14, 2013
The writer is the author of ''Upside Down: The Paradoxes of Gender in the Twenty-First Century.''
Readers React
As a scholar who has studied the economics of work and family for more than 40 years, I applaud Mr. Waring's suggestion that Congress once again take up (and this time pass) the Working Families Flexibility Act.
But we need to recognize that as things stand now, taking advantage of flexible work arrangements is often a double-edged sword. Because of the stigma associated with part-time employment (allegations that those who work part time are not seriously committed to their jobs and therefore don't deserve serious consideration for promotion), employees who take a part-time option often suffer later when they wish to resume full-time work and move up in their organization.
We see this stigma operating in exactly those countries that Mr. Waring cites as being leaders in offering work-family flexibility, because those countries generally have less economic opportunity for women and fewer women in leadership positions.
Legislation by itself cannot remove the stigma of part-time work. Only organizations and the people who make promotion decisions can do that. Organizations could benefit by studying and emulating the flexibility model at Deloitte, which allows employees to move off and on career ladders without prejudice as their family and personal needs change. This model not only increases employee satisfaction, but also positively affects a company's bottom line.
MYRA H. STROBER Stanford, Calif., Jan. 17, 2013
The writer is professor emerita at Stanford University.
Mr. Waring brings up a critical concern for a 21st-century work force -- the dual demands on individuals and families to care for young children and/or older relatives while also managing job requirements. Study after study has shown that flexible work arrangements are key to meeting America's diverse work force needs.
That's why I will reintroduce the Working Families Flexibility Act in the new Congress. The bill gives employees the right to request flexible work options in terms of hours, schedules, work location and notice of scheduled assignments. For employees, these options help boost satisfaction and morale for themselves and their families.
For businesses, flexible work arrangements help increase employee retention and productivity while reducing absenteeism.
Given demographic and work force changes in the last 50 years, it makes sense to promote policies that are a win-win for the work force and the bottom line of businesses.
CAROLYN B. MALONEY Washington, Jan. 17, 2013
The writer, a Democrat, represents the 12th Congressional District in New York.
As the co-founder of a Web site whose mission is to connect flexible job seekers with local businesses, I think that the time for the passage of this bill has come and gone. Six years ago when the Working Families Flexibility Act was first proposed, the employment landscape was very different from what it is today. With unemployment at 4.6 percent and a competitive labor market, individuals had the ability to request flexibility in their schedule and have these demands met to keep morale high and retain talent.
Compare that with today, when not only are layoffs the norm, but also workers increasingly are seeing their hours trimmed by employers, not to offer them flexibility, but to manage the bottom line. This trend is likely to continue, with 58 percent of businesses reporting that they will hire more part-time and hourly workers in the years ahead, regardless of improvements in the market.
It is this group that needs increased consideration, not only for jobs, but also for having access to insurance and payment protections. Flexibility is not the problem. Instead it is the need to offer increased protection when working independently.
LYNN DIXON New York, Jan. 17, 2013
I have a 9-month-old baby and just returned to work as a teacher. The public believes that teachers have ideal schedules for raising children, and for older children that is mostly true. But flexibility in work hours is almost impossible for teachers. There is no way to work from home, and rarely a way to teach part time. I truly believe I should still be home with my baby. I don't think she's getting what is best for her by my being gone from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day.
This is such an important issue. The United States is far too far behind the rest of the Western world.
LATASHA WEBB Washington, Jan. 16, 2013
I am a strong fan of workplace flexibility -- not only for the benefits that the employee receives, but for the employer's benefit as well. Loyal employees are the backbone of any solid corporation.
Being flexible with work schedules, work locations, time off without pay, job sharing and so forth has helped the companies I have worked with develop a solid corps of competent, dedicated employees who would never leave. Whether their needs are long term or short term, many employees value flexibility in the workplace over anything else. This is particularly true for women, who often find themselves taking care of children, parents and even in-laws.
ELENOR DENKER Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Jan. 16, 2013
The writer is a human resources consultant.
From my reading of the legislation, an employer is required to listen to, and to not retaliate for, a request for shorter or flexible hours. But it is not required to grant a request, at least as long as it can reasonably claim it would cost more to do so.
Two things that should happen to encourage part-time or flexible work arrangements:
First, exemptions from paying overtime pay should be tightened. Merely using one's brain on the job, or occasionally telling another employee what to do, should not prevent extra pay for more than 40 hours worked in a week. If employers had to pay their employees overtime for extra work, having part-time or flexible workers available would be an advantage, not a liability.
Second, this problem is directly affected by our employer-based health care system. As long as hiring a new employee involves a large fixed cost for health care benefits, employers will naturally avoid adding workers to fill in for those who would want to work fewer hours. This is yet another advantage of a single-payer health care system.
JIM STAHL Orange Village, Ohio, Jan. 16, 2013
Mr. Waring's views about part-time work and flexible schedules apply to the needs of an ever-growing demographic: the family caregiver. By some estimates, there are nearly 66 million caregivers in the United States who provide care to someone who is ill, disabled or old. About two-thirds of these caregivers are women. The average caregiver is 49 years old, and works. As boomers age and face multiple chronic health conditions, the need for caregivers will escalate.
Creating workplace policies that attend to the needs of family caregivers are essential if we are to be the kind of society we aim to be: one that values, respects and supports families and communities. Giving caregivers the flexibility they need to respond to their loved one's changing circumstances can alleviate some of the stress and anxiety that make caregiving work so hard. Allowing people to move in and out of the full-time work force offers them opportunities to balance work and family life. In an increasingly virtual world, such schedules are not that difficult to imagine or set up.
My own employer's willingness to try such measures enabled me to help care for my father when he was ill. Thanks to Wi-Fi and a laptop, I could sit with my dad, keeping an eye out for him, while logging in to my workplace, keeping up with my duties there. It was not a perfect arrangement, but it worked for us.
JANICE LYNCH SCHUSTER Riva, Md., Jan. 16, 2013
The writer is senior writer for the Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness at Altarum Institute.
The Working Families Flexibility Act could be, as Mr. Waring notes, a step that improves the quality of part-time jobs. It would give a nation of workers the right to ask for schedule changes (but not an automatic right to get them). A little noted but intriguing aspect of the act could nudge a workplace culture shift: The employee who requests the change must put on a manager's hat and recommend how the company could adapt.
Whether the act moves us faster toward sustainable work environments would only be known in the test of time. It is worth a shot.
Our economy needs not just jobs but jobs that sustain our work force over time. While most employers readily tout that their most valuable asset is their workers, too many say one thing and do another. About 40 percent of private sector workers do not have paid sick days, so wages get docked, or employees come in with the flu, or they lose their jobs. The Healthy Families Act, which would set a national floor for sick days, has also been stalled in Congress.
Work is also not sustainable when jobs provide too few and erratic hours.
We have a lot of workplace housekeeping to do; it's a full-time job.
JODIE LEVIN-EPSTEIN Washington, Jan. 16, 2013
The writer is deputy director of CLASP: Policy Solutions That Work for Low-Income People.
The Writer Responds
Professor Strober identifies why some countries have chosen to lead in offering workplace flexibility: to counter longstanding stigma against women in male workplace roles by increasing women's participation. As new situations become normalized and familiar, they are more accepted. Legislation alone will not change hearts and minds, but it's been the catalyst for greatly reducing other forms of discrimination.
That America's skilled workers often cannot negotiate nonstandard schedules, as noted by Ms. Dixon, demonstrates the need for this legislation.
Business can be quick to reject any proposed regulation, but women's greater work force participation over the past 40 years -- made possible in part by anti-discrimination laws -- helped the gross domestic product grow by 25 percent. How much more could it grow if flexible schedules unleashed the full potential of caregivers now sidelined or underused?
Are there costs? Sure. There would be time spent rejecting unreasonable requests and frivolous discrimination claims. But a 2005 British study found that employers accepted 80 percent of flexible scheduling requests.
In larger companies, more employees may mean hiring more managers. Some employers might provide full benefits to part-timers, as some law firms do, while in other workplaces those on reduced schedules might pay more for benefits.
As Ms. Denker observes, workplace flexibility engenders great loyalty, an invaluable corporate asset. Loyal employees are more productive and don't take their skills and experience to competing firms.
To strengthen our national commitment to families, readers should contact their members of Congress to support Representative Maloney's leadership on behalf of the Working Families Flexibility Act.

HEADLINE: The Woman Who Dresses America

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
IT'S hard to miss Jenna Lyons. About nine feet tall and slim as a mink, often eccentrically dressed and wearing the boxy, geek-chic eyewear that has become the most identifiable signature in fashion since Anna Wintour's bob, the 44-year-old executive creative director of J. Crew was an instantly recognizable presence at the many parties, runway shows and red carpet events she attended during 2012.
There she was at the Costume Institute gala in May, dressed in a blue-collarish denim jacket with a formal duchesse silk skirt in Schiaparelli pink. There she was during Fashion Week, dancing away at the Alexander Wang after-party, her shirt unbuttoned down to the Netherlands. There she was at the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund dinner in early November, in a matching silver paisley top and pants reminiscent of 1950s men's pajamas, huddled for much of the evening with Seth Meyers of ''Saturday Night Live.'' And there she was on Nov. 12 on the stage of Carnegie Hall, where, along with notables like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the architect Zaha Hadid and five Olympic gold-winning athletes, she was named one of Glamour magazine's Women of the Year. 
As she stood on stage in a man's tuxedo shirt, form-fitting black pants and emerald-and-diamond chandelier earrings from Bulgari, grasping the unwieldy award that had been presented to her by Lauren Hutton, Ms. Lyons spoke movingly of her long path from storklike teenager to fashion swan. ''I know what it's like not to feel beautiful,'' she told the audience, which included hundreds of young girls invited by the magazine. ''I remember that feeling.''
There was another moment of significance in the speech, at least for those in the fashion world who had been buzzing about Ms. Lyons's private life for the last year: when she made eye contact with an attractive young woman sitting about a dozen rows from the stage and thanked, along with her young son and her boss, ''Courtney, who has shown me new love.''
Like Jodie Foster's coming-out (sort of) speech at the Golden Globes last Sunday, Ms. Lyons's acceptance speech was a public acknowledgment of her relationship with Courtney Crangi, the sister and business partner of the jeweler Philip Crangi, and the woman whom she starting dating after separating from her husband of nine years, the artist Vincent Mazeau. The couple's breakup at the end of 2011 and the subsequent romance had been avidly covered by The New York Post, People magazine and hordes of fashion bloggers, but Ms. Lyons had stayed mum on the subject until that night.
''Jenna Lyons Comes Out?'' read the headline on The Huffington Post the next morning. ''Did J. Crew Style Guru Jenna Lyons Just Come Out of the Closet?'' asked Jezebel. ''Jenna Lyons Thanks Her Son and Girlfriend in Inspiring Acceptance Speech,'' announced Fashionista.
Scrutiny on a gossip site is rarely welcome, but there is no denying that Ms. Lyons's growing celebrity has been good for her and J. Crew, whether she is quoted in the press when Michelle Obama appears at a public event dressed in J. Crew, or she is lending her face and style to the hugely popular ''Jenna's Picks'' feature in the J. Crew catalog and on its Web site. From time to time, the company has even winked at her growing status as a style icon, as when, at the fall presentation, a long line of models were decked out in those signature eyeglasses, or when the catalog showed Ms. Lyons painting her son's toenails hot pink.
But with fame came a level of intrusiveness, and paparazzi interest that Ms. Lyons was not prepared for. Page Six exhaustively covered the breakup with her husband and the emotionally fraught sale of their Park Slope town house (which sold in February to Vincent Martin of Depeche Mode for $4 million). A Fox News commentator pronounced the toenail-painting no less than ''an attack on masculinity.'' ''It may be fun and games now, Jenna,'' Keith Ablow wrote on the Fox Web site, ''but at least put some money aside for psychotherapy for the kid -- and maybe a little for others who'll be affected by your 'innocent' pleasure.'' (On ''The Daily Show,'' Jon Stewart mocked the hullabaloo with a segment he called ''Toemageddon.'')
Ms. Lyons concedes that she is not immune to the joys that fame has brought her. ''Do I like the attention?'' she said over drinks at Locanda Verde, around the corner from the TriBeCa loft where she lives with her 6-year-old son, Beckett. ''Well, of course the narcissist in me will say 'Yes.' In all honesty, there is nothing more sweet and moving than when someone comes up to me and says: 'You're Jenna Lyons, aren't you? I love J. Crew.' That is so nice. I love that. It is amazing.''
But, as with the Page Six dissection of her love life, not all publicity is welcome publicity.
''It has been challenging this past year,'' she said dryly. ''I've been sort of shocked with the level of interest in my personal life.'' Traveling under the radar of the paparazzi, it seems, is increasingly not an option.
''I keep my sunglasses on,'' she said. ''Too bad I'm six feet tall.''
Millard S. Drexler, J. Crew's chief executive and Ms. Lyons's mentor at the company (''She is, in my opinion, one of the most talented, trained, intuitive and commercial designers I have ever met''), sees something of an upside to the challenges Ms. Lyons has had to face.
''She went through this public period that was, let's call it, maybe slightly scandalous,'' he said. ''And I think that made her, in a perverse way, very appealing, because who in the world doesn't deal with issues? I saw her grow dramatically from having suffered that adversity -- grow in her own confidence, in her own appeal. And it wasn't like she hired a bunch of public relations people to cover anything over. She handled it with a great amount of dignity.''
DECEMBER was the 22nd anniversary of Jenna Lyons's arrival at J. Crew -- she has spent exactly half her life there. She started as an assistant designer in men's wear, fresh out of Parsons, and over the next two decades worked her way to the top. Now, as the company's president, she oversees every visible part of the company, from the clothes themselves to the look of the stores, the catalogs and the Web site. One might call her today's answer to Tom Ford, who almost two decades ago undertook the reinvention of another swamped brand, Gucci.
Ms. Lyons is like Tom Ford in many ways: articulate, intelligent, charismatic, controlling and very talented. But she is also the anti-Tom Ford. Mr. Ford, a former model, courted fame with a cool, almost macho sense of self-assurance. By contrast, Ms. Lyons is down-to-earth, approachable and almost comically self-effacing. And whereas Mr. Ford was fastidious about his public image, from his uniform of a dark, unbuttoned dress shirt and flat-front trousers to the angle from which he could be photographed, Ms. Lyons is surprisingly unconcerned about how she is seen and depicted. She takes chances with different looks (though almost everything she wears is from J. Crew). She has fun getting dressed. She makes mistakes and laughs at herself.
''Jenna is remarkably astute and intelligent, and she's open about herself,'' said Mark Holgate, the fashion news director of Vogue, who used to live in the garden apartment of Ms. Lyons's Park Slope town house and who has worked with her on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. (He also introduced her to Ms. Crangi.) ''Nothing ever feels forced or contrived or rehearsed with her,'' he said. ''There's a kind of vulnerability and unguardedness that is rare in that level of designer.''
That is no understatement. Ms. Lyons does indeed come across as her unvarnished self, whether she is squealing with delight over a sparkly bit of jewelry or crisply reeling off the elements, ideas and merits of a new collection in a business meeting.
When it is suggested that she could be described as equal parts fashion insider and outsider, she scoffed.
''I am totally an outsider,'' she said. ''I am so not an insider, and that is O.K. I might feel like one in very particular moments. But I don't feel the same pressure I did when I was young to be part of the club. I'm not one of the cool kids, and that is totally fine.''
THAT sensibility springs from sensitivity. Ms. Lyons grew up in Palos Verdes, Calif., on the coast south of Los Angeles. She was not Malibu Barbie. Her awkward height was compounded by a genetic disorder, incontinentia pigmenti, that scarred her skin and caused her hair to fall out in patches and her teeth to be malformed. (She has worn dentures ever since, she freely pointed out.)
Then, in her seventh grade home economics class, she learned how to sew, and sew she did. It worked better than she could have hoped. The popular girls liked what she made. Style gave her not only armor; it gave her cachet.
Though some people might be eager to leave such ugly-duckling baggage in the past, Ms. Lyons was able to integrate the experience into her look, her work and the philosophy behind J. Crew itself.
''It is not like you have to prescribe to a certain identity or idea to be a part of the brand,'' she said, adding that one of the things she and Mr. Drexler bonded over early on was that they didn't want to see any visible logos on any of the clothes. ''I think that has more integrity than something that makes you feel like if you don't look a certain way, you cannot be part of it. I don't appreciate that. I grew up not feeling like part of the group, and I hate that feeling and hate making anyone feel that way.''
Ms. Lyons may dismiss the idea of herself as a fashion insider, but she has been selected as one of the 10 judges voting on the winners of the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, along with Anna Wintour and Diane von Furstenberg, and she was recently named to the CFDA board of directors, signaling the opening of a once-closed door.
''That shows how much the CFDA has changed,'' said Steven Kolb, the chief executive of the council. ''Twenty years ago, the CFDA was focused so narrowly on ready-to-wear designers with their name on the label. I don't know if Jenna would have even gotten in. She's really redefined what we think of fashion designers.''
Ms. Lyons would say she had not set out to do any such thing. If anything, she has simply focused on reinventing herself and J. Crew's offerings -- if there's a difference between the two, and after 22 years she is not sure there is -- season after season.
WHILE there is little question that the trials of the last year have vaulted her into that special fashion rank of controversial-but-brilliant talents like Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein or Halston, Ms. Lyons is looking forward to perhaps a wee bit less exposure. Pathologically modest, she waves off comparisons to other designers. If she feels a kinship to anyone, she suggested, it might be Claire McCardell, the midcentury American designer known for simplifying European fashion trends and adapting them pragmatically, cleverly and with her own style for American women.
So yes, there she was at Carnegie Hall, at the Glamour Awards, thanking Ms. Crangi, but she didn't intend to cause a stir, she said. She just felt it was time to acknowledge her relationship.
And fittingly for someone for whom recognition has come slowly, she is able to look at the tumult of the last year through the lens of experience.
''When I was young and people judged me for things I had no control over, that was really hard, so I'm incredibly open to people doing whatever works for them,'' she said. ''It's just as surprising to me as it probably is to everyone else. It certainly is strange to wake up, at 44, and look at the person next to you and think: 'Oh! This wasn't what I expected.' But I don't think love works that way, and I am O.K. with that.''

HEADLINE: What Is Middle-Class in Manhattan?

BYLINE: By AMY O'LEARY

 BODY:
DRIVE through almost any neighborhood around the country, and class divisions are as clear as the gate around one community or the grittiness of another. From the footprint of the house to the gleam on the car in the driveway, it is not hard to guess the economic status of the people who live there.
Even the landscape is carved up by class. From 15,000 feet up, you can stare down at subdivisions and tract houses, and America's class lines will stare right back up at you.
Manhattan, however, is not like most places. Its 1.6 million residents hide in a forest of tall buildings, and even the city's elite take the subway. Sure, there are obvious brand-name buildings and tony ZIP codes where the price of entry clearly demands a certain amount of wealth, but middle-class neighborhoods do not really exist in Manhattan -- probably the only place in the United States where a $5.5 million condo with a teak closet and mother-of-pearl wall tile shares a block with a public housing project. 
In TriBeCa, Karen Azeez feels squeezed. A fund-raising consultant, Ms. Azeez has lived in the city for more than 20 years. Her husband, a retired police sergeant, bought their one-bedroom apartment in the low $200,000 range in 1997.
''When we got here, I didn't feel so out of place, I didn't have this awareness of being middle class,'' she said. But in the last 5 or 10 years an array of high-rises brought ''uberwealthy'' neighbors, she said, the kind of people who discuss winter trips to St. Barts at the dog run, and buy $700 Moncler ski jackets for their children.
Even the local restaurants give Ms. Azeez the sense that she is now living as an economic minority in her own neighborhood.
''There's McDonald's, Mexican and Nobu,'' she said, and nothing in between.
In a city like New York, where everything is superlative, who exactly is middle class? What kind of salary are we talking about? Where does a middle-class person live? And could the relentless rise in real estate prices push the middle class to extinction?
''A lot of people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth,'' said Cheryl King, an acting coach who lives and works in a combined apartment and performance space that she rents out for screenings, video shoots and workshops to help offset her own high rent.
''My niece just bought a home in Atlanta for $85,000,'' she said. ''I almost spend that on rent and utilities in a year. To them, making $250,000 a year is wealthy. To us, it's maybe the upper edge of middle class.''
''It's horrifying,'' she added.
Her horror, of course, is Manhattan's high cost of living, which has for decades shocked transplants from Kansas and elsewhere, and threatened natives with the specter of an economic apocalypse that will empty the city of all but a few hardy plutocrats.
And yet the middle class stubbornly hangs on, trading economic pain for the emotional gain of hot restaurants, the High Line and the feeling of being in the center of everything. The price tag for life's basic necessities -- everything from milk to haircuts to Lipitor to electricity, and especially housing -- is more than twice the national average.
''It's overwhelmingly housing -- that's the big distortion relative to other places,'' said Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the New York City comptroller's office. ''Virtually everything costs more, but not to the degree that housing does.''
The average Manhattan apartment, at $3,973 a month, costs almost $2,800 more than the average rental nationwide. The average sale price of a home in Manhattan last year was $1.46 million, according to a recent Douglas Elliman report, while the average sale price for a new home in the United States was just under $230,000. The middle class makes up a smaller proportion of the population in New York than elsewhere in the nation. New Yorkers also live in a notably unequal place. Household incomes in Manhattan are about as evenly distributed as they are in Bolivia or Sierra Leone -- the wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites make 40 times more than the lowest fifth, according to 2010 census data.
Ask people around the country, ''Are you middle class?'' and the answer is likely to be yes. But ask the same question in Manhattan, and people often pause in confusion, unsure exactly what you mean.
There is no single, formal definition of class status in this country. Statisticians and demographers all use slightly different methods to divvy up the great American whole into quintiles and median ranges. Complicating things, most people like to think of themselves as middle class. It feels good, after all, and more egalitarian than proclaiming yourself to be rich or poor. A $70,000 annual income is middle class for a family of four, according to the median response in a recent Pew Research Center survey, and yet people at a wide range of income levels, including those making less than $30,000 and more than $100,000 a year, said they, too, belonged to the middle.
''You could still go into a bar in Manhattan and virtually everyone will tell you they're middle class,'' said Daniel J. Walkowitz, an urban historian at New York University. ''Housing has always been one of the ways the middle class has defined itself, by the ability to own your own home. But in New York, you didn't have to own.''
There is no stigma, he said, to renting a place you can afford only because it is rent-regulated; such a situation is even considered enviable.
Without the clear badge of middle-class membership -- a home mortgage -- it is hard to say where a person fits on the class continuum. So let's consider the definition of ''middle class'' through five different lenses.
The Money You Make
We'll start with an obvious marker: If the money you live on is coming from any kind of investment or dividend, you are probably not middle class, according to Mr. Braconi.
If you live in Manhattan and you are making more than $790,000 a year, then congratulations, you are the 1 percent.
Most researchers define the middle class by calculating the median income for a place, and grouping people into certain percentages above or below the absolute middle.
By one measure, in cities like Houston or Phoenix -- places considered by statisticians to be more typical of average United States incomes than New York -- a solidly middle-class life can be had for wages that fall between $33,000 and $100,000 a year.
By the same formula -- measuring by who sits in the middle of the income spectrum -- Manhattan's middle class exists somewhere between $45,000 and $134,000.
But if you are defining middle class by lifestyle, to accommodate the cost of living in Manhattan, that salary would have to fall between $80,000 and $235,000. This means someone making $70,000 a year in other parts of the country would need to make $166,000 in Manhattan to enjoy the same purchasing power.
Using the rule of thumb that buyers should expect to spend two and a half times their annual salary on a home purchase, the properties in Manhattan that could be said to be middle class would run between $200,000 and $588,000.
On the low end, the pickings are slim. The least expensive properties are mostly uptown, in neighborhoods like Yorkville, Washington Heights and Inwood. The most pleasing options in this range, however, are one-bedroom apartments not designed for children or families.
It is not surprising, then, that a family of four with an annual income of $68,700 or less qualifies to apply for the New York City Housing Authority's public housing.
What You Do
''There's no room for the earlier version of the middle class,'' Mr. Walkowitz said. Firefighter, police officer, teacher and manufacturing worker all used to be professions that could lift a family into its ranks. But those kinds of jobs have long left people unable to keep up with soaring real estate prices.
A police officer with five years' experience in New York makes about $69,000 a year. A teacher with the same number of years in the city's public school system makes between $50,812 and $63,534.
The shift toward a knowledge-based and service economy has created a new set of middle-class jobs, like graphic designer, publishing professional and health care administrator. Positions that would nudge a family into the upper class elsewhere -- say, vice president or director of strategy -- and professions like psychologist are solidly middle class in Manhattan.
The same holds true for jobs in higher education, a growth sector for the city.
The average tenured university professor at New York University or Columbia makes more than $180,000 a year, according to a 2012 survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Sweetening the deal for those looking to buy, N.Y.U. has offered mortgage assistance and discounted loans, while qualified Columbia faculty are eligible for a subsidy of up to $40,000 a year. Some faculty members benefit from university housing that rents well below the market rate, in prime locations on the Upper West Side and in Greenwich Village.
Maya Tolstoy, an associate professor at Columbia and a marine geophysicist who studies seafloor earthquakes, lives with her 9-year-old son in a small two-bedroom apartment in a doorman building on Riverside Drive. Because her building is owned by Columbia, her rent, about $1,800 a month, is manageable on an associate professor's salary, which averages about $125,000. A similar market-rate apartment on the Upper West Side costs about $6,000 a month, according to a monthly report compiled by MNS, a brokerage firm.
''I think it's much tougher for people with my income to survive in Manhattan without subsidized housing,'' she said. ''I am very lucky to have it.''
Are Children the Last Straw?
One way to stay in Manhattan as a member of the middle class is to be in a relationship. Couples can split the cost of a one-bedroom apartment, along with utilities and takeout meals. But adding small roommates, especially the kind that do not contribute to rent, creates perhaps the single greatest obstacle to staying in the city.
Only 17 percent of Manhattan households have children, according to census data. That is almost half the national average, making little ones the ultimate deal-breaker for otherwise die-hard middle-class Manhattanites.
Not only do children strain the wallet as that one-bedroom becomes infeasible, but many middle-class families have little confidence in public education. Tuition fees at private schools can reach $40,000 a year. So families decamp to the suburbs or hope that their offspring will test well enough to get into the public school system's gifted-and-talented program, which offers a more challenging education free of charge.
''The trauma of kindergarten I still have not forgotten,'' said Ms. Tolstoy, who beyond hitting a jackpot of sorts with subsidized Columbia housing, struck gold again when her son was accepted into a gifted-and-talented program.
But to get her son that far, she found it necessary to hire a consultant, costing about $800 for two sessions.
When Did You Get Here?
More than 280,000 units -- nearly half of Manhattan's apartment stock -- is rent-regulated in some fashion. These apartments are either godsends to those who occupy them, or daggers that twist in the hearts of everyone else, left to pay market rate or compete for the borough's remaining vacancies -- 2.8 percent of the housing stock, as measured in 2011. But 30 percent of the residents of rent-stabilized apartments moved in more than 20 years ago.
An intriguing definition of what helps a person gain entry to the Manhattan middle class was ventured by Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, who issued an in-depth report in 2009 that examined the city's changing class dynamics. ''Understanding who is middle class, in New York, but especially Manhattan, is all about when you got into the real estate market,'' he said. ''If you bought an apartment prior to 2000, or have long been in a rent-stabilized apartment, you could probably be a teacher in Manhattan and be solidly middle class. But if you bought or started renting in a market-rate apartment over the last 5 or 10 years, you could probably be a management consultant and barely have any savings.''
Sabrina Dent was born and raised in Manhattan thinking she was middle class. Ms. Dent grew up attending a private school on the Upper East Side. She did not realize what normal life was until she left Manhattan to attend a public university in Rhode Island, where she paid less in rent than her father had been paying for a 12-by-6-foot parking space in the city.
''That radically readjusted my barometer,'' she said. Now Ms. Dent is a Web designer in Cork, Ireland, living a regular middle-class life, and unable to imagine why anyone would want to stick it out in Manhattan on a moderate income.
''The only artists I know now who are still in Manhattan,'' she said, ''either made it big and bought, or are still in the rent-controlled studios they landed in 1976, and will leave in a coffin.''
Values That Define You
People define class as much by association and culture as they do by raw numbers -- a sense, more than anything, of baseline financial security garnished by an occasional luxury like a vacation, and a belief that things can get better through hard work and determination.
''Middle class, to me, is having a pretty good job, enough money to pay bills and rent, and then a little extra,'' said Desiree Gaitan, 29, a manager of social media for Shairporter, a tech start-up that arranges shared taxi rides to New York airports. She says she feels middle class even though she makes about $40,000 a year (equivalent to about $17,900 a year in a more typical part of the country).
Ms. Gaitan stays afloat by shopping at thrift stores, picking up baby-sitting gigs when she can, and hanging onto a great deal: she pays $600 a month to share a rent-regulated two-bedroom apartment near Columbus Circle -- a place her roommate's parents found years ago.
''It's tough,'' she said. ''I have a good work ethic, and I think I would like to stay as long as possible, as long as I'm enjoying my career. All of that is worth it at the end of the day, for some psychotic reason.''
Are They Dying Out?
''Manhattan has serious affordability problems,'' said Mr. Braconi, the economist. In the last decade, the percentage of people who are paying ''unaffordable rents'' (defined as more than 30 percent of their income) has increased significantly, according to a report issued in September by the city's comptroller.
If that trend continues, it will feed the perennial panic that Manhattan's middle class is on the brink of extinction, no longer able to cope with the city's prices and fast retreating to its natural habitat, the suburbs.
It is true that the middle class here is smaller than anywhere else in the country. It is true that price pressures from both real estate and the cost of living are not slowing down anytime soon. But it is also true that calamity has been forecast for over a century now.
''Soon, there will be no New Yorkers,'' proclaimed the Sunday magazine of The New York Times in 1907, in an article that detailed how families making $1,000 to $3,000 a year -- $24,000 to $72,000 a year in today's dollars -- were being pushed out because of increasing rents, and servants' wages, as well as the crushing cost of ice and coal. Adjusted for inflation, laundry alone for a family cost $115 a week. A pound of chicken? $8.08. Rent, on the other hand, for a ''small, middle-class flat in a decent, but unfashionable locality,'' would seem to be a bargain in today's market, at the price of $272 per room per month.
In 1968, New York magazine documented the mad scramble for affordable apartments in a cover article detailing the extreme lengths to which average people went to secure one. ''Surgeons have postponed operations, housewives have gone back to work, hippies have cut their hair and families have destroyed their pets,'' the magazine reported. ''Little hope is held out for the middle-income ($15-20,000 a year) people, career girls who do not want roommates and couples with more than one drawer-sized infant.'' Brownstones that had sold for $125,000 in 1958, according to the article, were selling 10 years later for twice that much (in today's dollars, a jump from $827,000 to $1.65 million).
Reports of the middle class's demise also appeared in 1978, 1998, 2006 and 2009, when The New York Observer chimed in with ''City to Middle Class: Just Not That Into You.''
But members of the middle class remain, scattered among the elite and the growing numbers of the working poor, in that place where lucky deals and tiny kitchens converge, wondering, just as they did in 1910 and 1968, how long they'll be able to stay put.
Ms. Azeez in TriBeCa is pondering the question. The only young people she sees moving in around her are often buoyed by parental support, given an apartment at graduation the way she was given a Seiko watch. As her own friends and neighbors age or die out, she wonders, ''who is going to take our place?''

HEADLINE: How to Cut Megabanks Down to Size

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IT is a prevailing myth in Washington: big bailouts are over for good. Never again, the line goes, could giant financial institutions imperil the nation's economy.
This is nonsense, of course. Whatever regulators and lawmakers say, the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul lacks any guarantee that taxpayers won't have to come to the rescue again.
So it was refreshing to hear a Federal Reserve System official debunk the bailouts-are-gone theory last week. 
The official was Richard W. Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a longstanding truth-teller about too-big-to-fail banks. On Wednesday, in a speech in Washington, Mr. Fisher laid out a compelling proposal for shrinking financial giants in order to protect taxpayers. He suggested that megabanks be chopped into pieces, so that no one of them could endanger the financial system if it ran into trouble.
That may sound like a return to the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that separated investment banking and commercial banking until it was dismantled in 1999. But Mr. Fisher's plan is more sophisticated than Glass-Steagall, in that it recognizes how complex big financial institutions have become. Glass-Steagall concerned only old-school banking businesses, like making loans, and Wall Street businesses, like trading stocks. Today's financial behemoths are in so many different businesses that a top-to-bottom restructuring is required.
Why? Mr. Fisher argued that megabanks not only threaten taxpayers with bailouts, but that their continuing failure to lend is also thwarting the Fed's efforts to jump-start the economy by keeping interest rates low. ''I submit that these institutions, as a result of their privileged status, exact an unfair tax upon the American people,'' he told his audience. ''Moreover, they interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and inhibit the advancement of our nation's economic prosperity.''
Smaller institutions, by contrast, have continued to lend in the post-crisis years, especially to the kinds of modest-size businesses that create so many jobs across the country. According to figures compiled by Mr. Fisher's colleagues at the Dallas Fed, community banks -- defined as those with no more than $10 billion in assets -- hold less than one-fifth of the nation's banking assets. Nevertheless, they hold more than half of the industry's small-business loans.
Huge banks must be restructured and their access to the safety net scaled back, Mr. Fisher said, because neither regulators nor market participants have proved effective in monitoring risks at these institutions.
The manic years before the credit crisis proved that regulators can't police financial institutions appropriately. And while market discipline has worked to keep smaller institutions on the straight and narrow, it has been ineffective with megabanks, Mr. Fisher said. He noted, for example, that community banks typically have a few large shareholders scrutinizing the risks in their operations. But too-big-to-fail institutions, with millions of disparate shareholders, don't benefit from this kind of concentrated policing mechanism.
Big banks' creditors -- like bond holders -- don't impose discipline, either. They know they will be protected by a taxpayer rescue should a large institution teeter.
Fairness is at the heart of Mr. Fisher's argument. Large institutions, he said, are ''financial firms whose owners, managers and customers believe themselves to be exempt from the processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction.'' In other words, small institutions must submit to the rigors of the free market. Those too big to fail do not.
There are roughly 5,600 commercial banking institutions in the country, Mr. Fisher noted. Some 5,500 of them are community banks. While these organizations account for 98.6 percent of all banks, they hold only 12 percent of total industry assets. They are routinely allowed to fail if they get into trouble. Few of them did during the crisis.
Contrast these figures with those of the nation's 12 largest banks, whose assets range from $250 billion to $2.3 trillion. They account for 0.2 percent of all banks but hold 69 percent of industry assets. These are the banks that enjoy all the perquisites of the federal safety net: significantly lower borrowing costs and a taxpayer backstop, for example.
Understanding that it will be a tough battle to break up the megabanks, Mr. Fisher suggests that in the meantime, only commercial banking operations receive protection from the federal safety net in the form of federal deposit insurance. An institution's other activities -- securities trading, insurance operations and real estate, for example -- should fall outside any backstop. Furthermore, he recommends that these banks require customers and trading partners to sign an agreement stating that they understand the business they are conducting is not covered by any federal protection or guarantees. That would begin to reduce the perception that all of these institutions' counterparties would be protected in a disaster.
''Financial stability rests on a level playing field that rewards sound judgment and integrity and penalizes excessive risk and complexity financed by taxpayer dollars,'' Mr. Fisher said in his speech. ''Government must retain its role as the financial system's watchdog, but it should render no institution immune to market discipline.''
IN an interview after the speech, Mr. Fisher said he believed his plan could appeal to both liberals and conservatives. ''It's politically palatable on both sides of the aisle,'' he said. ''This is one thing that both Republicans and Democrats can agree on.''
Or, as he said more pointedly in his speech: ''If the administration and the Congress could agree as recently as two weeks ago on legislation that affects 1 percent of taxpayers, surely it can process a solution that affects 0.2 percent of the nation's banks and is less complex and far more effective than Dodd-Frank.''
The response to Mr. Fisher's proposal has been resoundingly positive, he said. Immediately after the speech was posted Wednesday evening on the Dallas Fed's Web site, heavy traffic caused the site to shut down.
''I do think that this is something that can actually bring people on Capitol Hill together,'' he said.
Wouldn't that be nice?

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA's critics and supporters tend to agree: the first four years of the Obama administration have included plenty of disappointment and frustration.
Some of the that can be attributed to inherited challenges like the financial crisis. Some were caused by unexpected developments overseas. Some are the result of a dysfunctional Congress better known for logjams, corruption and ideological intransigence than action. (So much so that a recent poll showed that Americans like Congress less than cockroaches, colonoscopies and root canals.)
But Mr. Obama and his team would benefit, as they begin the second term, by acknowledging that many of the biggest problems facing the administration flow directly from the man at the top. Mr. Obama is a lousy manager. As chief executive he gets a ''C'' -- and then only if graded on a curve that takes into account his predecessor's managerial weaknesses.
For all of the notable achievements of Mr. Obama's first term -- getting troops out of Iraq, passing health care and financial services reform, signing legislation that guarantees that women get equal pay for equal work, removing Osama bin Laden -- many of the administration's shortcomings are traceable, at least in part, to troubles connected to the way Mr. Obama has chosen to run the government. 
The administration has not done a good job of delegating to and empowering cabinet officials. Nor does it seem to have built necessary teams and coalitions or anticipated and planned for likely challenges. The Obama team's failure to make the most of stimulus funding, to make progress on climate change, react swiftly to international crises in Egypt, Libya and Syria, and to maintain good relations with allies on Capitol Hill and beyond stem from lack of managerial skill.
A predicate problem is that the president's team has focused so intently on presenting Mr. Obama's strengths that they, like many senior managers, seem to have begun to believe their own news releases.
Consider what is, perhaps, the iconic image of the Obama presidency: the photo of Mr. Obama, in the Situation Room, with Hillary Rodham Clinton and other members of his national security team, awaiting news of the raid on Osama bin Laden. The May 2011 photo depicts an engaged leader, in the center of a closely knit team, willing to take calculated risks but viscerally aware of the human stakes involved.
Like many official photos, this one said much about the president without revealing the full truth. Seemingly united in that moment, the president's team is, in fact, a fractious group whose members are often at odds with one another, and Mr. Obama may be the most aloof president since Richard M. Nixon. Shot in the Situation Room, the nerve center of our government, the photo gives no indication that many of the president's appointees see it and the rest of the West Wing as kinds of fortresses far removed from other government agencies.
There is no single template for the effective exercise of presidential power. In the modern era, Dwight D. Eisenhower applied the skills he mastered as a general, Lyndon B. Johnson horse-traded his way to legislative triumphs, Ronald Reagan managed with a light touch as if he were a congenial ''chairman of the board,'' the elder George Bush oversaw what was arguably the most disciplined and inclusive national security process in recent history and Bill Clinton was able to strike a balance between master politician and wonk in chief.
Each of these presidents understood the danger of personalizing the presidency, of making it too much about one man; each took care to harness resources within his cabinet and among his deputies.
Successful modern presidents share an experience that Barack Obama does not have: before becoming president, each played an executive or leadership role that provided insight as to how to run an effective government.
The management troubles that have dogged the Obama administration are not unique to Mr. Obama or his team. One of the biggest problems facing America today is that in Washington, the ability to effectively run complex organizations is among the skill sets that is least valued in our leaders.
Often people with no management experience -- academics, writers or politicians who have never run an office with more than a handful of people -- are put in charge of giant, complicated government agencies or processes. In part this is because so many people in government mistakenly believe that being able to articulate ideas is the same as being able to put ideas into action.
This administration provides an object lesson in how, when too many staffers have excessive influence, political calculations often trump good policy choices. When an inner circle maintains too tight a stranglehold over the president's time and attention, too few views come into play. If isolated by an inner circle, the president will have a harder time fostering cooperation in his administration. During his first term, Mr. Obama's inner circle included Michelle Obama, Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, David Plouffe and Pete Rouse. Even top administration officials believe these gatekeepers held power too closely. Staff casualties resulted.
When Obama campaign insiders on the National Security Council staff were thought to have more access to the president than their boss, Gen. James L. Jones, the general reportedly felt undermined and left the administration. Ms. Jarrett is said to be seen as so powerful that hardly anyone dares to cross her.
Despite constant behind-the-scenes grumbling from top officials, few appear to have successfully challenged her. Acknowledging how much the president values her opinion, staffers complain about her involvement in matters outside her competence. Battles with Ms. Jarrett reportedly played a role in at least one top official's decision to leave the administration.
Mr. Obama's top advisers say they often feel alienated from the president. There is a sense in the White House that ''Barack Obama's theory of government is he is the government.''
Mr. Obama's perceived aloofness didn't help his relations with Congress. Many Hill Democrats resent the fact that the president essentially did not consult with them during the last campaign, regularly keeping them away from him during his campaign appearances.
CHIEF executives who have visited the White House for much publicized consultations with the president and senior staff report that Mr. Obama appears to be more interested in delivering his message than in listening to others. This, too, speaks to Mr. Obama's management weakness. Selecting a diverse team, creating a system in which ideas surface, listening to those ideas and then empowering others to put them into action are the cornerstones of good management -- and of effective leadership.
The fact that Mr. Obama is not a good manager does not mean Americans were unwise to have elected him rather than Mitt Romney, who presented himself as an experienced business leader. There is no shortage of successful businessmen who flopped in government; Paul H. O'Neill, John W. Snow or John E. Bryson are examples. Public sector management poses its own unique challenges. Great business leaders and great governmental leaders require different personalities, skill sets, tactics and backgrounds.
The challenge here extends beyond Mr. Obama. The American electorate doesn't ask questions about management skills. Congress rarely raises the issue of management when considering nominees for large, complicated cabinet agencies, many of which are larger than big corporations. Establishing a culture in which the metrics of successful governance are valued, discussed and evaluated is a vital step toward addressing a problem of which the current president's management troubles is but a symptom. It would be helpful to have a permanent professional bureaucracy with continuing management responsibilities, as do many other nations. It would also be useful to consider salaries for top officials that provide incentives to the most qualified (much could be learned here from Singapore, which has blazed an important trail in this regard).
In the end, the success of our constitutional system depends primarily on how the occupant of the Oval Office governs. No president can succeed unless he views his job as collaborative, as requiring the motivation and empowerment of a vast United States executive branch bureaucracy, as being in partnership with Congress, as benefiting from a broad and diverse group of advisers, as being the kind of undertaking that promotes creativity even if it means embracing unpopular or even unsuccessful ideas. We know that for the next four years we will have a much more experienced president than the one who occupied it during the term just past. But if Barack Obama is to be a successful president -- if he is to lead our country toward economic recovery, climate health and increased security -- he must master the day-to-day management of government.

HEADLINE: A White House Aware of Second-Term Perils

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As he tucked into a salad and a beef pastry, President Obama looked around the family dining room in the White House and stared into his future. By some forecasts, it may not be a pretty sight.
Gathered with him that evening were several of the nation's leading historians, who reminded him of the sorry litany of second terms -- the cascade of scandal, war, recession, political defeat and other calamities that afflicted past presidents after the heady crescendo of re-election.
For Mr. Obama, who will be sworn in for another four years in a quiet ceremony on Sunday and then again in more public fashion on Monday, the lessons were familiar if daunting. Embarking on the next half of his presidency, he and his advisers are developing a second-term strategy intended to avoid the pitfalls of his predecessors with a robust agenda focused on the economy, gun control, immigration and energy.
''We've talked a lot about this,'' said David Plouffe, the president's senior adviser who is leaving the White House at the end of the week. ''We have spent a lot of time trying to figure out both what to pursue but also these issues of making sure you're bringing the same sort of energy and same sort of focus as the first term.'' 
After studying the past, the president's team concluded that it was important to make the most of the first year of his second term and stick rigorously to issues he articulated on the campaign trail. ''If you stay in that zone,'' Mr. Plouffe said, ''I think you avoid a lot of those potential dangers.''
But of course, this is not the first re-elected president to think that. Others arrived at this point with similar confidence, only to be hobbled by developments. Some past second-term troubles stemmed from hubris, exhaustion or miscalculation; others arrived out of the blue.
Franklin D. Roosevelt found the economy relapsing and lost a fight to pack the Supreme Court. Richard M. Nixon was forced to resign by the Watergate scandal. Ronald Reagan was caught up in the Iran-contra affair. Bill Clinton was impeached, though not convicted, for lying under oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. George W. Bush was damaged by the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and a financial crash.
At the same time, as the historians made clear to Mr. Obama at their dinner this month, there were still second-term opportunities. Reagan overhauled the tax code and signed a new arms control treaty with the Soviet Union. Mr. Clinton balanced the budget and successfully led the Kosovo war. Mr. Bush turned the Iraq war around with a surge of troops and a strategy change and forestalled a new depression in his final weeks in office.
''In general, the historical record is not one of great hope,'' said Robert Dallek, one of the historians at the dinner. ''He's fully aware of the circumstances he confronts, but he's also upbeat about the fact that he won, and won convincingly. It wasn't a landslide, but it certainly was a convincing victory.''
Indeed, during the course of a free-ranging two-and-a-half-hour conversation, the historians were struck by how much Mr. Obama had thought about his second term in the context of his predecessors. He was focused particularly on Dwight D. Eisenhower, another president who ended a war and tried to curb military spending. ''His knowledge of what other presidents did in their second terms, what happened in their second terms, it's very impressive,'' said Robert A. Caro, the Lyndon B. Johnson biographer.
Mr. Obama has made clear in public settings as well how attuned he is to the opportunities and challenges confronting him, including history's warning signs. ''I'm more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms,'' he said shortly after his re-election. ''We are very cautious about that. On the other hand, I didn't get re-elected just to bask in re-election. I got elected to do work on behalf of American families and small businesses all across the country.''
Mr. Obama has the unusual distinction of being the third president in a row to win two terms; the last time that happened was when James Monroe followed Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Monroe, however, was re-elected effectively without opposition and presided over what was called the Era of Good Feelings. Mr. Obama, it seems safe to say, is presiding over the opposite.
With the House in Republican hands, Mr. Obama has an uphill struggle simply to deal with various spending deadlines, much less advance a proactive agenda. Within the White House, advisers debate just how much time he has to push through big legislative initiatives before he invariably loses political capital. They noted that Mr. Clinton had a year before scandal erupted, while Mr. Bush had just seven months before Hurricane Katrina sapped his public standing.
''You hope for a year and a half. You understand it could be half that,'' said Robert Gibbs, the former White House press secretary who worked on the re-election campaign. ''You've got to have a really, really good plan for 12 months in hopes it lasts for 16 or 18. But you have to be mindful that every day the window gets a little narrower and you've got to seize the moment.''
Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, said Mr. Obama would tap public opinion to maintain clout. ''One way of keeping Congress accountable is this constant engagement with the American people, and I know that's something he's committed to doing even more so in a second term,'' she said.
Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University historian who was at the dinner with Mr. Obama, said that the notion of a second-term curse was overstated, but that the president would have to be assertive to remain relevant. ''You have to be willing to be a strong executive-power president in your second term; otherwise, you become a lame duck,'' he said.
Mr. Obama's first term was in its own way cursed as much as anyone else's second term, or at least replete with the sorts of crises that would challenge any presidency: the Great Recession, the collapsing auto industry, the biggest offshore oil spill in American history and two wars. Much of the worst, his advisers hope, may now be behind him.
''The advantage now is he's not facing almost unprecedented economic trouble, which really colored his first year,'' said Phil Schiliro, his former legislative director. ''This is really the first time in his presidency when he's not facing a crisis like that. The wars are winding down, the economy's getting better. That gives him more breathing room.''
Some presidential second-term troubles were really manifestations of first-term actions, including the Watergate burglary under Nixon, the secret arms sales to Iran under Reagan, the liaisons by Mr. Clinton and the invasion of Iraq by Mr. Bush. While there have been flaps during Mr. Obama's first term over investments in a failed clean energy company, a bungled anti-gun operation and the attack in Benghazi, Libya, nothing of historic magnitude is evident at the moment. But Mr. Obama's staff worries that the biggest risks would be not effectively carrying out the health care program coming into full force in the second term or the economy's not bouncing back more strongly by the time he leaves office.
Still, as he prepared to take the oath again, Mr. Obama struck the historians as relaxed and engaged, especially compared with their last dinner with him before the election, when they sensed the tension that gripped him. For now, the path for the next four years is open and he has a chance to shape it.
''You don't have anything to run for anymore,'' Mr. Caro said. ''You're running for a place in history.''

HEADLINE: Advice for Obama's Speech

BYLINE: By

 BODY:
On Monday, President Obama will give his second Inaugural Address. What issues should he address and what tone should he adopt?
Renew the American Dream
President Obama should give us an optimistic romp aimed at renewing faith in the American dream.
Playing off Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1937 second Inaugural, President Obama should remind citizens that obstructionism and disunity have no useful place in our democracy. The fear index is too high in America today. No parent should have to worry that their child will be murdered by assault weapons when attending school. No Latino should think that a knock on the door means deportation. No worker should fear that Social Security will be raided or health care benefits stripped away under a desire for a balanced budget. And no citizen in the Age of Climate Change should wonder whether the federal government will help rebuild if a natural disaster strikes.
Everybody will be expecting Obama to quote from Lincoln and King. He should. But he would be wise to squeeze in an uplifting line from Cesar Chavez or Eleanor Roosevelt or Susan B. Anthony. It's important to enlarge the pantheon of social justice warriors. 
Striking a bipartisan tone, he should remind us that America is a work in progress as long as social and economic justice remains unattainable for many citizens. And that everybody must pay their fair share for our country to prosper. Bugling a better-days-are-coming message, he should once again chant: Si, se puede (yes we can)!
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY is a history professor at Rice University and a commentator for CBS News.
Acknowledge the Divisions
President Obama's first Inaugural proclaimed an end to ''the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long.'' In fact, it was less an end than an intermission; within a day or two the Republican Party had consumed us again with stale political arguments.
Still, for a time, Barack Obama seemed to be the only person in Washington who believed that the two sides could ''do big things'' (other than wage big battles) together. It was not until the blown grand bargain of 2011 that he finally abandoned his ''postpartisan'' ideal. He ran for re-election not as a uniter but as a fighter. And in recent weeks, he's maintained that posture.
To make this address meaningful, the president needs to acknowledge the very real and deeply felt differences between the parties. Then he must do what he can despite the divisions.
JEFF SHESOL, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, is the author of ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court.''
Revive the Spirit of Unity
President Obama could do worse in his second Inaugural Address than dust off a copy of the speech he gave at the 2004 Democratic Convention, which arguably got him where he is today. For those of us used to listening to invectives against the opposition at conventions, then-Senator Obama's tone was refreshing.
Whatever happened to that Barack Obama? Some of my conservative friends would say it was all an act.
I'd like to think he's better than that. But it will take humility (not an attribute that comes naturally to him) to admit that he cannot solve the enormous challenges that face a nation buried in debt without working with Republicans.
He once deplored the ''politics of cynicism.'' Let him prove he still does by abandoning his contempt for fellow patriots who don't always agree with him.
LINDA CHAVEZ, a former Reagan administration official, is the chairwoman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative research group focused on race and ethnicity.
Recall the Warrior Lincoln
I suspect that President Obama won't be able to resist quoting the only other second Inaugural delivered by a president from Illinois. And proud as he is of getting us out of Iraq and anticipating the withdrawal from Afghanistan, he may be tempted to quote Lincoln's famous quatrain: ''Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.''
But this prayer is preceded in Lincoln's speech by his prosaic citing of ''the progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends.'' And it's the progress of arms that makes a just and lasting peace possible.
President Obama likes to say that ''the tide of war is receding.'' But war doesn't ebb and flow. Wars are won or lost. President Obama may already have squandered victory in Iraq by failing to secure the peace with a continued deployment of American troops. He would compound this error by squandering the achievements of the surge in Afghanistan by insisting on a precipitate withdrawal. And he would endanger the chances of a broader and more lasting peace by presiding over a hollowing-out of the military.
Fondly do I hope -- and fervently do I pray -- that President Obama chooses a better way, and embraces the tough-minded and hardheaded policies that could truly achieve a just and lasting peace.
WILLIAM KRISTOL is the editor of The Weekly Standard.
What I'd Like to Hear
On Monday, we might hear President Obama announce a new road to citizenship for immigrants. He could call for a return to the policies that let European immigration flourish during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
He could remind America that we not only survived that foreign ''invasion,'' but prospered economically and intellectually from it. He could welcome this era's populations from around the world, seeking a better life for themselves and in the process making the country stronger.
Unfortunately, I doubt we'll hear him call for the strengthening of the New Deal and Great Society that were the crowning legacies of the 20th-century Democratic Party. We will probably not hear about economic policies that will lead to full employment and repair our social safety net. Nor will we hear him call for Americans to pay a fair share of taxes to support those who are unable to support themselves. And we will not hear that he will live up to his 2008 pledge to close Guantánamo, or restore the civil liberties that have been under attack now for two administrations.
His supporters will hear some of what they wish for over the next four years. But the reality is that much of the hope that was generated in 2008 will prove to be unfulfilled.
MICHAEL C. DAWSON, a political science professor and the director of the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture at the University of Chicago, is the author of the forthcoming book ''Blacks In and Out of the Left.''
Talk About Government
For the last 30 years, Americans have heard one primary narrative about government: that it is the problem, not the solution. That was Ronald Reagan's mantra, and it has been the mantra of Republicans for over three decades. It is so ingrained in political discourse that Democrats have been too afraid to contest it.
President Obama had little to say about government in his first Inaugural Address. The absence of government regulation over the most influential and least productive sector of the economy -- the financial sector -- toppled the economy and decimated lives. Yet the president was largely silent about the role of government in preventing abuses of power and creating the conditions for prosperity and economic growth, by maintaining laws that protect ideas, products and industries, and regulations that protect the wages and benefits of working people. The result of this silence is that Americans continue to hear only one side of the argument, and they have come to distrust government still further as it has become infested with the interests of big business. If this president wants a legacy, he needs to set the stage for it with an address that dispels the notion that the measure of a government is its size. The measure of a government is whether it creates prosperity for the many, security for all and a better world for our children.

HEADLINE: One Helluva Time

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
Four years ago, on the eve of Barack Obama's inauguration, this magazine devoted nearly an entire issue to a photo essay, ''Obama's People.'' The photographs, 52 of them, depicted a team arriving on a wave of hope despite inheriting an economy in trouble, a collapsing auto industry, two wars and a continuing terrorist threat.
Four years later, they have met some of those challenges, been daunted by others and created new ones of their own. The economy is better but still anemic. Osama bin Laden is dead and the Iraq war over, but Afghanistan remains a morass and the prison at Guantánamo Bay remains open. The auto industry has been saved and health care expanded, but national debt has soared. A dictator in Libya has been toppled, but a dictator in Syria slaughters his own people undeterred. 
Roughly half of the people in the photo essay are now gone, some embittered by realities they did not anticipate or cast aside by a president cutting losses. The gauzy hope of 2009 has faded into the starker realism of 2013. The Washington they promised to transform is as divided as ever. As the president prepares to take the oath of office for a second term, his team looks back at the four years that brought them to this point. Told in their own voices, the story is, unsurprisingly and perhaps out of necessity, a romantic one.
Melody Barnes, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council (2009-11): I remember coming out of the transition office the day before the inauguration, and it was like walking into a street festival. It was sunny, and people were happy, and there were tons of people, and it was very, very festive.
Desirée Rogers, White House social secretary (2009-10): We had a certain amount of time to prepare the home for the first family. Someone asked me, ''What side of the bed does the president sleep on?'' I'm like, Yikes, I don't know if I know that. For people that look like me, for my race, to be there and to have witnessed that -- I just kept thinking about my grandfather and how he would feel had he lived to see this day, because in so many instances the gentlemen that served the president looked like my grandfather.
During the swearing in of the president, Chief Justice John Roberts mangles the words in the oath. Gregory Craig, White House counsel (2009-10): This opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel says that if the president does not say all the words of the oath, then he is not president of the United States. I said, ''Is there anybody over there that really thinks he's not president?'' David [Barron, acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel] said: ''No, no, no, we all think he is president. But there may be a judge somewhere, or some hearing could be called on this, or it could be a problem in the future.'' I thought, We gotta fix this. There was a long line of people waiting to shake hands with the president in the residence. We said, ''Mr. President, can we talk to you a second?'' There was a little bit of, ''You gotta be kidding.'' I said, ''I'll call the chief justice's chambers and see if he can come down.'' The chief justice carried his robes, and the president arrived. The chief justice goes into the corner and says, ''This is a ceremonial occasion, I'm going to put on my robe.'' The chief justice is doing it from memory again, and I thought to myself, Would it be wrong for me to go forward and say something? At which point, the president says, ''Now, let's keep this real slow.'' They did it, and that was it.
Shortly after taking office, Obama decides to sign a large spending bill with thousands of earmarks to avoid undercutting Congressional support for his $800 billion stimulus package. In doing so, he helps establish an image of himself as a big spender. David Axelrod, White House senior adviser (2009-11): He was very much of a mind to veto the bill. We were in the midst of trying to pass the Recovery Act, and some of his legislative folks said, ''Mr. President, you can veto the bill, but if you do, you jeopardize our ability to pass the Recovery Act.'' He was very frustrated. He just kind of glared, and he ultimately sort of nodded. I'm not sure he even said anything. But I know in retrospect that was probably one of the decisions he regretted the most.
In March 2009, after a sharp debate among his advisers, Obama decides to bail out the auto industry. Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff (2009-10): All the advisers were divided, the public was absolutely against it. Nobody is giving you consensus, there is no consensus. Nobody had ever done what we were about to do. And he picks the hardest option.
Justice David Souter resigns from the Supreme Court in June. Obama chooses Sonia Sotomayor as a replacement. Axelrod: It was late in the day, and many people weren't in the White House, and the Senate had just confirmed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. The president came walking down the hall just looking for people. He saw me and gives me a fist bump and says: ''We just put the first Latina on the Supreme Court. Pretty cool, huh?'' But he was frustrated because there weren't enough of us around. He was seeking out people to celebrate with.
By summer, Obama's health care proposal has generated opposition among many voters. After a special election in Massachusetts costs the Democrats their filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate, Rahm Emanuel recommends ratcheting back the health care plan to a ''skinny bill'' with more modest aims. Emanuel: People forget how close we were to that thing falling apart. To his credit, he wanted honest advice, and I told him: ''Look, it's going to take you extra amounts of time. That means a lot of this other stuff is going to get sidelined in the process.''
Dan Pfeiffer, White House communications director (2009-present): We had a meeting with his senior advisers in the process of preparing for the State of the Union. That was the meeting where we argued it out: big or small. And he said that big was a risk worth taking, and he wasn't going to back away. It was a decision of massive political risk. Some believe -- I don't know if this true or not -- his entire presidency was at stake.
Valerie Jarrett, White House senior adviser (2009-present): We're sitting in the Oval Office, and the president asked [the legislative director] Phil Schiliro -- who always could figure out what's that third way -- ''Phil, what's the third way?'' Phil said, ''Mr. President, unless you're feeling lucky, I don't know what the third way is.'' And so the president gets up from his chair and he walks over and he looks out the window, and he says, ''Phil, where are you?'' Phil says, ''I'm in the Oval Office.'' He goes, ''What's my name?'' Phil says, ''President Obama.'' He goes, ''Of course I'm feeling lucky.''
Barnes: When the votes were over, we were gathering in the Roosevelt Room. I remember Phil Schiliro and Nancy-Ann DeParle [the health care adviser] coming in, and people cheering and clapping for them, two amazing people. And then we later went to the residence to celebrate, and it was a beautiful night, unusually warm for March. We were out on the Truman Balcony, and there's the monument, and the president's sense that this is better than Election Day because this is why we're here -- we came here to do something important.
Facing Congressional opposition, Obama fails to keep his promise to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Craig: As late as September, we thought it was still possible, but the president and the senior staff were totally focused on what was happening to the economy. All attention and all energy and all political resources were focused on a single set of problems that were way at the top of the agenda, and everything else, understandably, was in a lesser location. And this may have been naïve on our part, but we had thought that the Republicans supported closing Guantánamo. [Senator John] McCain had been for closing Guantánamo, and President Bush in the last two years had been for closing Guantánamo.
By the end of the first year, many supporters feel disillusioned. They complain that Obama did not do enough to create jobs, reverse President George W. Bush's terror policies, tackle climate change, revise immigration policies, crack down on Wall Street or build bipartisan consensus in Washington. Barnes: There was the sense that he could kind of wish it so and being frustrated because people then turned that into, ''You just don't want to, you don't care enough.'' The desire was in no short supply.
Pete Rouse, White House counselor, former senior adviser (2009-present): We were struggling with the challenge of trying to reconcile our promise to change Washington with the reality of working with established institutions in a crisis situation, and I guess history will judge how well we did that. I think our record is strong, but obviously maybe the public perception is not what we would like it to be.
A week after announcing a troop surge in Afghanistan, Obama flies to Norway to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, which many deemed premature. He uses the speech to talk about just wars. Jon Favreau, White House director of speechwriting (2009-present): The morning we leave for Oslo, he comes to us with an entirely new draft that is not finished yet, that he stayed up until 3 in the morning doing. He gives it to us and says: ''This is kind of rough, but this is the general idea of what I want.'' Everyone goes to bed on the plane and the only people up are Ben [Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser] and the president and myself and Samantha [Power, a national security aide], and we're just still working on this thing. It was so last-minute that as the president was taking the elevator down from his room to go to the speech, he handed us the last page of edits, and we put those into the prompter as he was walking up to the stage to give the speech.
Gregory Craig, one of the early campaign advisers, departs in January 2010 after clashing with Rahm Emanuel over various issues. Rogers resigns after gate crashers slip into a state dinner. Craig: White House counsel was not my first choice of a job in the new administration.
Rogers: That's politics. That's just the way it is. I don't feel any remorse. It's unfortunate that at a time when we needed to be talking about so many other things, we were focused on this. For the rest of my life I'm going to be that girl. People have made whatever judgments they need to make. It's over.
A series of crises confronts Obama in his second year, including the largest offshore oil spill in American history. The White House promises a ''recovery summer'' only to see the economy sputter again. Rouse: None of us were really prepared for something like Deepwater Horizon, Arab Spring -- all these things that kept coming out of nowhere all the time.
Emanuel: I refer to that spring of 2010 as the G-force. The well in the gulf explodes, Greece comes undone, you have the Gaza conflict, Germany won't help Greece. Then the market gyration, where it dropped like 700 or 800 points in one day. You felt like you were finally getting everything moving and then, boom.
In November 2010, voters upset about the economy and the expansion of government sweep Republicans to power in the House in midterm elections. Rouse: We didn't realize how deep the loss was going to be. The president felt for a number of House Democrats, in particular, who lost in part because of sticking with him on some tough votes, and how many of them, had they voted differently, might have still been there. That was really weighing heavily on him.
Axelrod: The next day he came into the office and said, ''We got our butts kicked, but we've got a lame-duck session here, and I've got a lot I want to get done.'' He recited a lengthy list. And everybody kind of looked at each other and thought, What disaster does he not get?
During the lame-duck session, Obama wins passage of a temporary payroll-tax cut, ratification of the New Start treaty with Russia and legislation reversing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell limits on gays in the military. But he fails to push through the Dream Act, allowing illegal immigrants to stay if they arrived in America as children and graduated from high school. Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council, former director of White House intergovernmental affairs (2009-present): When the Dream Act went down an hour after Don't Ask, Don't Tell passed -- I invited everybody to watch the votes in my office, and so there was an hour of cheering and then an hour of tears. The president came up the stairs, and obviously there was a lot of emotion in that room, and he reminded us that the Don't Ask, Don't Tell victory was 17 years in the making, that it was important to savor the fact that change is possible and remember that there were a lot of defeats along that path.
Jarrett: I said, ''Oh, my gosh, can you believe we got everything done except for the Dream Act?'' -- which was a huge disappointment for him -- and he said, ''I'm worried about that debt ceiling.'' At that point, it was six months off, and I was like, ''Come on, can't we just enjoy the moment?'' And he said, ''The debt ceiling is going to be a problem.''
Just before the midterm election, Rahm Emanuel resigns to run for mayor of Chicago. Obama, convinced that the White House needs a shake-up, taps Pete Rouse as interim chief of staff. Rouse: After the first two years and what happened in the midterm election, he felt that now we ought to try to focus more on process and try to get thing working better internally.
Even before the struggle over the debt ceiling, Obama and the newly ascendant Republicans engage in the first of multiple showdowns over spending. Joseph R. Biden Jr., vice president (2009-present): I thought we should have let them shut the government down, let them have a taste of what it was. I think we would have been in a stronger position. I was in the minority on that. If we could take a position back -- I don't know, the president might agree with me. I know he wondered about it. I think it would have been better to have them face the music right then and there.
Biden advises against a May 2011 raid on a house in Pakistan suspected to be Osama bin Laden's hideaway. Biden: I remember walking up to his office and saying, ''Look, follow your instincts, follow your instincts,'' and him coming down the next morning to say, ''Go.''
Pfeiffer: I went to see ''Fast and Furious 5.'' In the middle of the movie, I check my BlackBerry, and I have an e-mail from someone on the national security staff inviting me to a meeting. So I leave the movie to get back to the White House. As I'm coming in, the cast of ''True Blood'' is outside the gate trying to figure out why their tour has been canceled. We decided we're going to do [the announcement] in the East Room and [the senior adviser David] Plouffe and I walk over to look at the setup. There's just two guys slowly moving chairs. Plouffe and I are like, We better go get people so we can do this ourselves. We may have killed bin Laden, but we don't have a room to speak in.
Biden: As I got out of the car at [the vice-presidential residence], my wife was sitting in her bathrobe on the steps. She gave me a big hug, and we could hear people at our gate singing ''God Bless America.''
In the summer of 2011, the president and the Republican House collide over raising the debt ceiling, and an effort to forge a ''grand bargain'' with Speaker John Boehner collapses. Rouse: Maybe it was naïve, but I really think he thought, given the nature of the issues we faced -- he was surprised by the reaction to his call to reach across the aisle.
Pfeiffer: That was the first time we had ever fallen below 40 percent. We were at a crossroads. Are we going to head into re-election like Bill Clinton and George W. Bush or head into re-election like Jimmy Carter or George H. W. Bush?
Obama pulls the final American troops out of Iraq in December after almost nine years of war. Biden travels to Baghdad to preside. Biden: It's not a particularly great job, this job, but I called him and said, ''All I've said about this job, I take it back.'' And I said, ''Thank you for giving me the chance to end this goddamn war.'' When I say that, I didn't end it, but to be able to stand there and be the guy who says, ''That's it.''
In a television interview in May 2012, Biden endorses same-sex marriage, forcing Obama to announce his own support. Obama aides are angry at the vice president for going off message. Biden: There was a little apoplexy around here. I answered as antiseptically as I could. But I was going to sit there and not say what I believe at this point in my career? They can have the goddamn job. The president walked in, and he started laughing. He said, ''Well, Joe, the thing I've always loved about you is you say what you believe.'' I mean it. I give you my word. He gave me a hug, and he started laughing.
The surge in Afghanistan produces mixed results. More American soldiers die in the country during Obama's four years than the seven previous years under Bush. Obama decides to withdraw most troops by the end of 2014. Traveling to Afghanistan to sign a strategic agreement, he visits a unit. Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser (2009-present): They had been hit that day, and the president was visiting with one of the guys who had been hurt. You could not hear what he was saying because they were talking very close to one another. At the end of the conversation, the soldier lifted up his hand after the president presented his Purple Heart. He wanted to shake the president's hand. It was very profound. You can't walk away from an event like that and not be struck as he was. These are our guys, and they're all there because of his decisions.
The president spends election night in Chicago. Pfeiffer: We would get these very detailed data reports that come in every couple of hours, and the very first one showed in some states a very jacked-up Republican turnout relative to what we thought it would be, and youth and African-American and Latino turnout down from where we had thought it would be. It was a holy-crap moment.
Jarrett: He was watching it on television, and so I think MSNBC was one of the first [to call the race], and so everyone was very excited. He said, ''Well, let's wait and see when Fox calls it.'' And just moments later Fox called it, too, and he's like, ''All right.''
The massacre of children in December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., leaves Obama personally distraught. Favreau: I had never seen him like that as long as I've known him. He was sitting at his desk, and he was looking down at the statement, and he was making some edits, and he was barely looking up at us. His voice was the most somber and the most halted that I had ever heard it.
Obama faces another showdown with Republicans over spending and taxes and again fails to strike a grand bargain. They avoid a so-called fiscal cliff with a more-limited measure that leaves Bush-era tax cuts in place for all but the wealthiest Americans. Rouse: He has been criticized in the past -- and in fact I felt that we went too far on this -- for chasing this big deal too far. He's more realistic today than he may have been a couple of years ago about who's he negotiating with.
Pfeiffer: He is certainly hardened by the battles he's had to fight.
Muñoz: We all have more scar tissue.

HEADLINE: The Big Board, in One Big Gulp

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
WHEN nearly all else had failed, Jeffrey C. Sprecher flew to New York City and crashed at his sisters' apartment, a cramped walk-up on the Upper West Side, one flight above a noisy bar.
It was January 2000, and Mr. Sprecher had been cold-calling Wall Street for weeks. He was searching desperately for someone to back his small company in Atlanta, a business that was eating up his money and years of his life.
That's when a black limousine pulled up in front of the bar, Jake's Dilemma. The limo had been sent by the mighty Goldman Sachs to fetch Mr. Sprecher, and as he sank into the back seat that winter day, he set off on an improbable journey that has since taken him to the pinnacle of American finance.
Today Mr. Sprecher, a man virtually unknown outside of financial circles, is poised to buy the New York Stock Exchange. Not one of the 2,300 or so stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (combined value of those shares: about $20.1 trillion). No, Jeff Sprecher is buying the entire New York Stock Exchange. 
It sounds preposterous. A businessman from Atlanta blows into New York and walks off with the colonnaded high temple of American capitalism. But if all goes according to plan, his $8.2 billion acquisition, announced a few days before Christmas, will close later this year. And with that, 221 years of Wall Street history will come to an end. No more will New York be the master of the New York Stock Exchange. Instead, from its bland headquarters 750 miles from Wall Street, Mr. Sprecher's young company, IntercontinentalExchange, will run the largest stock exchange in the nation and the world.
Mr. Sprecher, 57, certainly plays the role of a wily upstart. He may wear power suits and a Patek Philippe watch, but he comes across as unusually casual and self-deprecating for a man in his position. He pokes fun at himself for his shortcomings -- ''I don't know how to manage people,'' he says -- and his love of obscure documentaries.
How the New York Stock Exchange fell into Mr. Sprecher's hands is, at heart, a story of the disruptive power of innovation. ICE, as IntercontinentalExchange is known, did not even exist 13 years ago. It has no cavernous trading floor, no gilded halls, no sweaty brokers braying for money on the financial markets. What it has is technology.
Like many young companies that are upending the old order in business, ICE has used computer power to do things faster and cheaper, if not always better, than people can. Its rapid ascent reflects a new Wall Street where high-speed computers now dominate trading, sometimes with alarming consequences. New, electronic trading systems have greatly reduced the cost of buying and selling stocks, thus saving mutual funds -- and, by extension, ordinary investors -- countless millions. But they have also helped usher in a period of hair-raising volatility.
Mr. Sprecher (pronounced SPRECK-er) has probably done more than anyone else to dismantle the trading floors of old and replace human brokers with machines. Along the way, he and ICE have traced an arc through some of the defining business stories of our time -- from the rise and fall of Enron, to the transformation of old-school investment banks into vast trading operations, to the Wall Street excesses that not long ago helped derail the entire economy. Now, after a series of bold acquisitions, he is about to become the big boss of the Big Board.
Does it really matter who owns the New York Stock Exchange and its parent company, NYSE Euronext? For most people, stock exchanges are probably a bit like plumbing. Most of us don't think much about them -- until something goes wrong. But lately, some things have gone spectacularly wrong.
One sign of trouble came in 2010, when an errant trade ricocheted through computer networks and touched off one of the most harrowing moments in stock market history. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 900 points in a matter of minutes, and a new phrase entered the lexicon: flash crash.
Since then, flash crashes in individual stocks have been remarkably common, as the centuries-old system of central exchanges has given way to a field of competing electronic systems.
ICE wasn't involved in any of these problems. In fact, it has been praised as one of the first exchanges to put limits on lightning-quick, high-frequency trading. This points to Mr. Sprecher's deftness in piloting his company through periods of regulation, deregulation and now re-regulation.
While many banking executives have clashed with Washington, Mr. Sprecher has sensed the changing winds and tacked accordingly. He also stays close -- some say too close -- to the powerful Wall Street firms that are his customers.
It is perhaps unsurprising that some of the people who make their living on the Big Board's floor are a bit nervous about the exchange's new boss. But Mr. Sprecher says they have nothing to fear. His friends and business associates say he could actually turn out to be the best hope for restoring trust in the stock market. After all, he has beaten the odds before.
''There were a number of times when the odds were long, but he wasn't deterred from stepping in,'' says James Newsome, who was Mr. Sprecher's regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before becoming his competitor as chief executive of the New York Mercantile Exchange. ''A lot of people, if they don't think they will win, they won't participate. Jeff doesn't operate like that.''
For now, Mr. Sprecher is still spending much of his time at ICE's headquarters in suburban Atlanta. The contrast with the New York Stock Exchange is striking. Behind its neoclassical face, the Big Board is a sprawling labyrinth of historic oil paintings, gilded leather chairs, stained wood and elegant dining rooms -- all set amid crowds of gawking tourists.
ICE, meanwhile, occupies a few floors of an anodyne black-glass cube surrounded by trees and parking lots. The employees share their cafeteria with the building's other tenants. The walls are lined with dry-erase boards.
On a recent weekday, the whiteboard in Mr. Sprecher's modest corner office was filled with columns of scribbled numbers. They were leftovers from the all-night sessions that led to the deal for the Big Board.
One column was labeled ''Yankees,'' ICE's code name for the New York Stock Exchange. Another was labeled ''Braves,'' a shorthand for ICE. On the margins was a doodle of a tree with a cat hanging from one of the branches, in a hang-in-there-baby vein. It was done, Mr. Sprecher says, by his wife, Kelly Loeffler, who also happens to be his director of investor relations.
''This negotiation had fits and starts,'' Mr. Sprecher says. ''There were days when we just wanted to throw each other out of the window.''
But Mr. Sprecher didn't blink, not even at the billions of dollars lined up under the Yankees column.
''It's not about the value of what you paid for, because you are going to change the underlying business to begin with,'' he says. ''You acquire companies at moments in time when there's an inflection point and you can change the trajectory of the company and the industry.''
THE New York taxi driver asked: ''What brings you to this concrete hellhole?''
He was talking to Mr. Sprecher, then a young man visiting New York for the first time from his home in Wisconsin.
''I was terrified,'' Mr. Sprecher recalls of that visit, in the 1970s.
At the time, Mr. Sprecher was still a small-town kid, the son of an insurance salesman and a medical technician in Madison, Wis. It was decades before ICE existed, before it owned exchanges on three continents and before it became a venue to trade everything from Midwestern wheat to Brazilian coffee to Scandinavian oil.
Back then, he stayed with his sister Jill Sprecher, who had come to New York to study filmmaking. According to her, Mr. Sprecher was the archetype of the older brother: confident, competent and protective, the type whom all the teachers remember and judge younger siblings against. His most distinguishing trait was his knack for taking things apart and putting them back together -- and for making money.
''Everything he touched always made money, where everything I touched lost money,'' says Ms. Sprecher, who writes and directs independent films with their sister, Karen.
But not even Jill Sprecher would have guessed that her brother would one day stand atop the New York Stock Exchange.
''What has happened to him since 2000 is beyond my comprehension,'' she says.
Mr. Sprecher's first job after college was as a salesman for the industrial company Trane, a job he says he got thanks to good grades and a reputation for being the life of the party at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He accepted the job because it took him to Southern California.
''It was the ticket to the beach and palm trees and girls on roller skates, and I was like, 'That's what I want to do in life,' '' he recalls.
While at Trane, he made an early sales pitch to William Prentice, an entrepreneur who was developing power plants. It was 1983, and the nation's electricity market had just been deregulated, allowing entrepreneurs to start their own power plants, which only utilities had been allowed to do in the past. Mr. Prentice, impressed that Mr. Sprecher recognized the industry was in the middle of big changes, almost immediately offered him a job at his new company, the Western Power Group.
''He had already internalized the whole concept of creative destruction,'' Mr. Prentice says.
Western Power got off to a rocky start. It almost failed when a Canadian company threatened to corner its local energy supply: cow manure. Others at the Western Power Group grew despondent. Mr. Sprecher and Mr. Prentice spent weeks in a motel in California's Imperial Valley, trying to persuade the suppliers to change their minds.
''We called it 'the manure wars,' '' Mr. Prentice says. ''Neither myself nor Jeff questioned the need to go and fight. There was never any second-guessing -- it was just go do it and win.''
Win they did. After Mr. Prentice sold his stake in the company a few years later, Mr. Sprecher continued building the Western Power Group until another round of electricity deregulation occurred in 1996. Then he pounced.
Previously, power plant owners who wanted to buy and sell surplus electricity had to call one another and agree on a price. Mr. Sprecher saw opportunity in an Atlanta company that provided an electronic trading network. He bought that company, the Continental Power Exchange, with his own money; he ended up putting $4 million into it.
Although Mr. Sprecher kept his company in California and his house in Beverly Hills, he spent every spare hour trying aggressively to sign up utility companies for the Atlanta exchange. His team made many visits to Enron, where they met with top executives like Jeffrey Skilling, who is now serving time in prison. Those meetings ended one day when the Enron executives began asking a number of technical questions about Mr. Sprecher's system.
''We sat there in the meeting and we realized, these guys are building this themselves, and we are educating them,'' Mr. Sprecher recalls.
Shortly thereafter, Enron started its own electricity trading platform, which quickly came to dominate the industry. It looked as if the Continental Power Exchange was done. But Enron made one big mistake. Rather than providing a place for buyers and sellers to meet, Enron itself bought from every seller and sold to every buyer.
This angered Wall Street banks that were among the biggest traders of energy products. When Mr. Sprecher showed up in New York to stay with his two sisters in 2000, nearly ready to give up on his own system, he didn't know that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been looking for someone just like him, who could provide an alternative to Enron.
As Mr. Sprecher shuttled between meetings at the two banks, the bankers were trading phone calls and buzzing.
''We were all thinking, 'This is the guy we want,' '' recalls John A. Shapiro, who was involved in the talks at Morgan Stanley. ''We had already talked to a number of people, and the difference was night and day.''
The difference wasn't the Atlanta exchange's technology, say people who were involved. It was Mr. Sprecher himself.
''At some point, you said: 'O.K., this guy has got something going for him. Maybe it's hard to put your finger on it. But you know it when you see it,' '' Mr. Shapiro recalls.
On the other side, it was the perfect time to be hooking up with Wall Street, as banks were focusing increasingly on trading. In the negotiations that followed, Mr. Sprecher used what would become a trademark strategy: giving up part of the ownership of his company in exchange for a promise that the recipients would use his platform. In this case, he gave up 80 percent of the ownership to the two banks. The banks soon turned around and gave part of their own stakes to several of the largest power companies, including Shell, Total and British Petroleum, which committed to using what was soon rechristened as IntercontinentalExchange.
When Enron collapsed in scandal, the business began pouring in.
BY their own account, Mr. Sprecher and his wife, Ms. Loeffler, live for ICE. He has some hobbies, and his sister Jill wonders how he finds the time to watch cooking shows and reality television. But he and his wife have no children. Ms. Loeffler, the more serious of the two, says the thing that brought them together was their willingness, and desire, to do their jobs around the clock.
''We both just work all the time and enjoy work,'' Ms. Loeffler says.
Both revel in the brinkmanship that has marked ICE's climb. Two days before Mr. Sprecher and his Wall Street backers announced the creation of ICE in 2000, they offered the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex, a 10 percent stake in the new business if Nymex would share some of its back-office services.
While Mr. Sprecher was giving his presentation to the board, a director said, ''Who the hell brought this guy into our board meeting?''
Mr. Sprecher recalled, ''Then the room went silent.'' The next thing he knew, a guard was escorting him out of the building.
ICE was confronting a trading world that had ossified into an almost ritualistic society. The exchanges were owned by their traders, who made the rules. The traders themselves were rough-and-tumble men who used their fists as computers. From the beginning of ICE, Mr. Sprecher was seen by the old-time traders as a tool of Wall Street banks that wanted to supplant local traders at the exchanges -- a reputation he has never managed to shake fully.
For his part, Mr. Sprecher rarely showed deference to traditional powers.When Nymex was bidding for the International Petroleum Exchange in London in 2001, ICE doubled Nymex's offer and won. Within a few years, ICE had shut down the historic trading pits at the London exchange in favor of computerized trading.
Next up in 2006 was the New York Board of Trade, where financial contracts tied to agricultural products like sugar and cocoa were bought and sold. Mr. Sprecher says people looked askance at him when he offered a billion dollars for it. ''I really believed there was a fundamental change going on in the globalization of commodities,'' he says.
People involved in the deal say Mr. Sprecher was initially attentive to the concerns of the floor traders.
''He had the capability to disarm people -- you might even say charm people -- into accepting his soft-spoken demeanor,'' says Frederick W. Schoenhut, who was the chairman of the New York Board of Trade.
But as soon as the deal went through, Mr. Sprecher was seldom seen. What's more, he put a manager in his 30s in charge of the New York operations. Mr. Sprecher says that was intentional.
''I wanted to show that market that there was a much younger, aggressive guy here who really wanted to fundamentally change that company,'' he says.
ICE didn't have to do much to initiate that change. It allowed customers to choose between trading on the floor or on ICE's electronic system. Within months, most customers had migrated to the screen. The situation caused so much job loss and unhappiness that when ICE made its next takeover bid, for the Chicago Board of Trade, a crew of New York Board of Trade traders took out newspaper ads warning the Chicago traders to ''watch their backs.'' ICE ultimately lost that battle, but only after almost derailing a rival bid by slipping an offer under a hotel room door.
ICE also attracted the ire of a number of Democratic senators, who said it was encouraging speculation that caused fluctuations in the price of essential commodities like oil. But Mr. Sprecher proved adept at defanging his political opponents by bending to their will.
''Tell me what the rules are and I'll figure out how we can make money around them,'' is one of his common lines when talking to regulators in Washington.
Since the financial crisis, Mr. Sprecher has used that attitude to position himself to take advantage of changes being brought by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Soon, Wall Street firms will have to move trading in many opaque financial products to exchanges, and ICE is in a perfect position to profit.
THE clear attraction of the deal for NYSE Euronext is that it will create a global force in futures trading, an area set to benefit from Dodd-Frank reforms. In the United States, ICE is now the second-most-important futures trading company, after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. NYSE Euronext owns one of the most important futures exchanges in Europe.
The future of the New York Stock Exchange, on the other hand, is less clear. For someone who is buying a stock exchange, Mr. Sprecher is very critical of the state of stock markets.
''There are so many places where you say, fundamentally something does not feel good to the average investor on what used to be the greatest capital markets in the world,'' he says. But all of this is what makes stock trading an attractive industry for him -- it is one that is ripe for change. He is already speaking out about a need to reform the rules governing stock markets.
At the exchange itself last Wednesday, the 900-some men and women who work on the Big Board's floor filed through the doors at 11 Wall Street in trading jackets of blue, red and green. Over the years, their number has dwindled steadily as computerized trading put many out of work.
Even before ICE swooped in, some wondered how long the Big Board's floor, the scene of so many triumphs and failures, could endure.
Mr. Sprecher says the floor will survive. The American stock market, and the nation, need it.
''The pendulum of electronification of markets went too far in the case of U.S. equities -- to the point that people want to know there's a human being watching over their trades,'' he says.
But that's now. And Jeff Sprecher hasn't gotten to where he is by keeping things as they are.

If all goes according to plan, the 221-year-old New York Stock Exchange will soon be run by IntercontinentalExchange, based in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: A Parade of Positive Thinking, Paced by a New Corvette

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Cobo Center has 723,000 square feet of exhibition space, enough to spotlight hundreds of new cars. Mysteriously, as journalists gathered here last week for press previews of the North American International Auto Show, it seemed as if there was room for only one vehicle: the 2014 Corvette.
Chevrolet's 2014 Corvette Stingray revived a storied sports car name, ruling the show the way it hopes to rule the street. And General Motors hopes the 450-horsepower Stingray -- powerfully reloaded for a post-recession comeback -- can help to revive the company in both symbolic and sales terms.
The 'Vette, that most aspirational dream car for heartland buyers, may be a bellwether for America's recovering car industry and economy: when middle-class strivers feel flush enough to splurge on Corvettes again, the good times may be about to roll. 
G.M. grabbed more attention as its Cadillac ATS won the North American Car of the Year award, chosen by a jury of auto journalists. Cadillac also unveiled the swoopy ELR, a plug-in hybrid coupe based on the Chevy Volt.
Of course, buyers have mostly shunned today's crop of electrified cars. After years of E.V. frenzy, Detroit's show saw a dearth of electric models.
Instead, automakers poured out creamy luxury models, especially in entry- and midprice territory that's prized for sales volumes and attendant profits. Seemingly unprecedented in blue-collar Detroit, if not at any American auto show: only two nonluxury, truly all-new showroom models were introduced. They were Nissan's Versa Note hatchback and the Kia Cadenza, itself aspiring to luxury with a price well over $30,000.
Emboldened Lexus IS and Infiniti Q50 luxury sport sedans represented the latest attempts to go mano a mano with the BMW 3 Series. BMW kept pace with its alluring 4 Series coupe.
Mercedes-Benz will look to conquer $30,000 territory with the curvy, compact CLA sedan, which it introduced to the press on the eve of the show's opening but chose not to display during the public show. It also delighted showgoers with a handsomely refreshed E-Class lineup, years before those cars were due for full redesigns.
The space-age Nissan Resonance crossover was one bravura concept that had journalists buzzing. And the subtly contoured Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept -- imagine a minimalist German take on a Jeep Grand Cherokee -- seemed a prime candidate to continue VW's remarkable turnaround in the United States.
Highlighting the industry's tussle between power and fuel economy, Detroit's luxury gave way to, well, Lutzery. Robert A. Lutz, the retired G.M. vice chairman who championed the Chevy Volt, was up to his old green-tweaking tricks. His new company, VL Automotive, showed the Destino, a doppelgänger of the Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid sedan with the hybrid system rudely replaced by 638 horses worth of CO2-spewing Corvette V-8.
If Fisker -- whose production has been on hold for months -- can't survive, and Mr. Lutz delivers a handful of six-figure Destinos, Detroit's 2013 show may have produced a future collectible on the order of a Tucker. As an auctioneer might intone in 2043: ''This primitive plug-in hybrid has a Corvette V-8 under the hood and is actually the last Fisker-bodied car ever made. And as you older folks might remember, Fisker and G.M. both owed their existence to government aid.''
Enough fantasy; here are some high points from the 2013 Detroit show:
ACURA The exterior of the MDX design study is a near-clone for the production version that goes on sale in summer. The big news for Acura's midsize crossover is likely to be a front-drive version, with all models powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 of roughly 310 horsepower. Sharing the spotlight in Acura's display was the breathtaking NSX concept, now moving closer to reality with an actual interior. The NSX is some three years away from showrooms; it will be built in Ohio and powered by a midmounted V-6 assisted by electric motors.
AUDI Seemingly answering Mercedes-Benz's power-mad AMG unit, Audi cranked up the RS7 and SQ5. The former is a 560-horsepower version of the sparkling A7 hatch, with a twin-turbo 4-liter V-8. Starting from the Q5 crossover, the SQ5 adds a 354-horse supercharged 3-liter V-6. Both models go on sale by September.
BENTLEY Perhaps counterintuitively, Bentley sales are booming again. The handcrafted $238,000 Continental GTC Speed convertible follows suit with a 616-horsepower twin-turbo W-12 engine that booms to 60 m.p.h. in 4.1 seconds, to 100 in 9.7 seconds and continues on to 202 m.p.h.
BMW Longer, lower and wider than the 3 Series sedan that it's based on, the new 4 Series is an opulent coupe that BMW will hoist up the price ladder to meet the likes of the Audi S5. Engine choices are likely to include BMW's 2-liter turbo 4 and 3-liter in-line 6 when the car reaches showrooms later this year. With the 4 Series moving up to a richer neighborhood, the 320i sedan takes the brand in the opposite direction. On sale in April for $33,445 to start ($35,445 with all-wheel drive) the most affordable 3 Series gets a 180-horsepower version of the 2-liter turbo 4 that drives the more expensive 328i.
CADILLAC To go on sale a year from now, the Chevy Volt-based ELR coupe will cover 35 miles on battery power before its 4-cylinder gasoline engine starts, generating electricity to keep the car moving down the road. The lavish Caddy should deliver a sportier driving experience than the Volt, but at a price that may approach $60,000.
CHEVROLET The seventh-generation 'Vette rolls into showrooms this summer with an expected starting price around $56,000. It's faster and newly refined to measure up with more costly rivals like the Porsche 911. Highlights include a lightweight aluminum chassis, carbon-fiber and carbon-composite body panels and a 7-speed manual transmission. A 450-horsepower 6.2-liter V-8 spurs the Stingray from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in less than four seconds, Chevy says, and it will exceed 1 g in lateral acceleration.
FORD Chrysler's big cowpoke, the Ram 1500, may have been named North American Truck of the Year, but Ford's Atlas design study looked strong enough to hoist the world onto its pickup bed. The Tonka-like Atlas previews the crucial 2015 F-Series. Show observers couldn't avoid noticing how the Ford and Dodge tag-team made Chevy's conservative new Silverado look about as gutsy as a Toyota Camry.
HONDA Honda's riposte to the Nissan Juke will be a cautious effort, judging from the styling of the Urban SUV Concept shown here. Set to go on sale next year, this subcompact crossover, nine inches shorter than a Honda CR-V, is based on the Fit.
HYUNDAI Styled in Hyundai's Irvine, Calif., studio, the HCD-14 Genesis Concept suggests the direction of premium Hyundai sedans to come. An optical system recognizes the driver to start the car, and 3-D hand gestures operate controls.
INFINITI The Q50, a replacement for the G37 sedan, goes on sale this summer with the world's first steer-by-wire system; electronic controls replace the mechanical link between the steering wheel and turning wheels. The shapely Infiniti will offer rear- or all-wheel drive, and the choice of a 328-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 or a 354-horse hybrid V-6 powertrain.
JEEP The midlife upgrade of the Grand Cherokee gets Chrysler's new 3-liter diesel, with 240 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque. Chrysler's seamless 8-speed automatic transmission will help it achieve fuel economy as high as 30 m.p.g. in highway driving, Jeep says.
KIA Appropriately, Kia used the luxury-heavy Detroit show to introduce the richest sedan in its history, the Cadenza. A sister to the front-drive Hyundai Azera, the Cadenza adopts Hyundai's 293-horsepower V-6 and should hew closely to its $33,000 base price when it goes on sale this summer.
LEXUS With a glowering front end that's one part Predator and one part Kabuki mask, the Lexus IS elicits love-it-or-hate-it reactions. But no one will overlook Lexus' sport sedan again. Consumer reaction will be tested in June, when the IS 250 and 350 models go on sale with a choice of two V-6 engines and rear- or all-wheel drive.
LINCOLN Based on the Ford Escape compact crossover, Lincoln's close-to-production preview of its upcoming MKC looked sharp. But to compete against Audi, BMW and Land Rover, the newly renamed Lincoln Motor Company will also need sharp performance.
MASERATI This Italian greyhound has been the underdog of big luxury sedans. The new version grows 10 inches longer, while the price shrinks to around $100,000 or less for a version with a 410-horsepower, 3-liter twin-turbo V-6. A 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-8 model will have 530 Italian ponies, more than any standard V-8 competitor.
MERCEDES-BENZ Mercedes plans an onslaught of more affordable models in America, led late this year by the roughly $30,000 CLA250 sedan. Looking like a baby CLS, the CLA gets a 208-horsepower turbo 4 with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. The hyperaggressive E63 Benz sedan and wagon amass 550 horsepower (or 577 in S-Model guise) from a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8. On sale in summer, the Benzes, complete with Lamborghini-scale air inlets and jetlike exhaust outlets, explode from 0-60 m.p.h. in 3.6 seconds.
MINI The John Cooper Works Paceman concept is a British bulldog, a two-door version of the chunky Countryman crossover. It goes on sale in March with a 208-horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder.
NISSAN On sale in June for $13,990, Nissan's subcompact Versa Note hatchback trades power for economy, scaling back to a 1.6-liter, 109-horsepower 4 that delivers up to 40 highway m.p.g. The Resonance, an imaginative vision for a future Murano crossover designed by Nissan's California design studio, is an out-there concept that actually works. It features a futuristic V.I.P. lounge interior and dazzling details, including carbon-fiber wheel trim that recalls a Dale Chihuly sculpture.
TOYOTA The Corolla may be a bland econobox, but that hasn't kept Toyota from selling nine million of them in the United States since 1968. Still, Toyota wants more emotion in a coming 2014 model, and the Furia design study teasingly suggests the hottest Corolla ever. But many show-car elements, including carbon-fiber trim and full-width LED front lighting that recalls RoboCop's visor, seem bound for the cutting room floor.
VOLKSWAGEN The CrossBlue concept's powerful plug-in diesel hybrid unit is said to deliver 89 m.p.g.e. and a 661-mile driving range. But VW isn't ready to introduce such costly technology in a production version. More significantly, the CrossBlue smartly melds S.U.V. tradition with VW's new, space-efficient modular construction. The six-passenger midsize model would also fill a big hole in VW's ambitious, expanding lineup. Expect this handsome S.U.V. to reach showrooms in about two years, but with conventional gas, diesel or hybrid powertrains.
The North American International Auto show runs through Sunday, Jan. 27, at Cobo Center in downtown Detroit. Tickets are $12 for adults, $6 for seniors and children. More information can be found at naias.com.

HEADLINE: Clowns of the Blimey School

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
WE often hear that comedy is universal -- that laughter is the common language, transcending cultural barriers -- but in fact it may be the most difficult genre to export. A pratfall is a pratfall, but anything more advanced requires a sense of cultural context and an instinctive understanding of local norms. Hence a film like Dany Boon's ''Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis,'' a comedy that broke box office records in France when it was released in 2008, barely made a ripple elsewhere. (Its humor focused on cultural differences between the sunny south of the Midi and the leaden-skied economic devastation of northern France.) An announced American remake with Will Smith appears to have vanished into the turnaround ether.
I'm reminded of this by the appearance, thanks to the enterprising Oklahoma independent distributor VCI Entertainment, of two volumes announcing a series of classic British comedies starring two of England's most beloved performers, Will Hay (1888-49) and Norman Wisdom (1915-2010). These are not names to conjure with in the United States, and never really have been (although Wisdom did appear in Broadway shows). 
It's suggestive that most of the British comics who have prospered here come from the upper-class, Oxbridge tradition -- performers like the original ''Beyond the Fringe'' troupe (Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller), the long-running team of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, the Rowan Atkinson of ''Blackadder'' (if not of ''Mr. Bean''), most members of Monty Python and most recently the actor-provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen. It's also suggestive that they found their American success largely through PBS, which has long specialized in marketing British class distinctions to American audiences.
In PBS terms, if the Pythons are the ultimate ''Upstairs'' comedians, Hay and Wisdom (as well as other homegrown favorites like Arthur Askey, George Formby and Tommy Trinder) are definitely ''Downstairs'' -- the working class of British popular culture. These were personalities, forged not on the playing fields of Eton but in the rough-and-tumble world of the music hall. It's not as if Americans lack proletarian comics of our own, thanks to our parallel tradition of vaudeville and burlesque. But Hay and Wisdom definitely deserve another look, as strongly defined personalities who assumed creative control of the films in which they appeared.
At first it's difficult to warm to Hay, whose character was that of a prickly, small-time authoritarian, sputtering and stammering as he tries to bluff his way out of situations that have escaped his minimal control, his aspirations represented by the fussy pince-nez glasses that never seem to sit quite straight on his nose. The first of the VCI volumes of Hay's films (two more are set to follow next month) contains the 1935 ''Boys Will Be Boys,'' in which he reprises the blustery schoolmaster role that had made his music hall reputation, and the 1936 ''Where There's a Will,'' with Hays as a small-time lawyer who unwittingly provides cover for an attempted robbery.
Hay's closest American analogue is probably W. C. Fields, and it is said that Hay, who had trained as an engineer (and maintained a lifelong interest in aviation and astronomy), was inspired to try his hand at show business when he saw Fields's famous comic juggling act in a London theater. Both ''Boys'' and ''Will'' were directed by William Beaudine (as were several other Hay films), who had directed Fields in ''The Old Fashioned Way'' in 1934.
If Hay is ultimately sympathetic, it's because, like Fields, he never quite succeeds in disguising his essentially childish nature. There's always a part of him that would rather be playing gambling games with his students, or sneaking down to the pub with his subordinates. His films are a continuous revelation of the elaborate deception that is adulthood, and in his greatest works (not here, but in later movies like ''Oh, Mr. Porter!'' and ''Where's That Fire?'' -- both directed by Marcel Varnel -- there is a drunken delight in the breakdown of order that is about as far from PBS's imperial view of Britain as it is possible to get.
Where Hay cultivated his abrasiveness, Wisdom -- whose emergence as a star coincided with the coronation of Elizabeth II, and Britain's emergence from a postwar culture of shortages and rationing -- exhibits a need to be loved that approaches the intensity of Jerry Lewis. Himself the victim of a miserable childhood (abused by his alcoholic father, his mother abandoned the family, leaving Norman to raise himself on the streets), Wisdom developed a character he called the Gump -- a little man in an ill-fitting suit, with a boyish cloth cap always cocked to one side -- that seems an explicit homage to Chaplin (who returned the compliment by calling Wisdom his ''favorite clown'').
Where Hay dramatized his conflict with authority as an interior struggle (his best self versus his worst), Wisdom confronted the bosses of Britain's emerging entrepreneurial class: the department store manager of ''Trouble in Store'' (Wisdom's first starring feature, from 1953), or the ruthless real estate developer who wants to displace an orphanage in ''One Good Turn'' (1955), both directed by John Paddy Carstairs and both in the first volume of Wisdom films from VCI.
A natural athlete (he had been a boxing champion in the British Navy), Wisdom brought a balletic grace and control to his vocabulary of pratfalls and stumbles, the shyness of his character masking (as in Mr. Lewis) the self-assurance of a complete professional. He was also possessed of a beautifully soft, sweet singing voice, which in ''Trouble in Store'' he uses to serenade the leading lady (Moira Lister, who he loves but she does not love him) with a ballad he partly wrote, ''Don't Laugh at Me 'Cause I'm a Fool.''
The moment is a naked play for pathos, but resistance is futile in the face of Wisdom's precisely calculated delivery, as when he drops, for the space of two or three bars, from a singing to a speaking voice to convey the personal dimension of his declaration. No Oxbridge irony here: this is a direct expression of needfulness and vulnerability, deeply embarrassing and pretty wonderful because of it. (VCI Entertainment, $14.99 each, not rated)

HEADLINE: In Davos, Atmosphere for Bankers Improves

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: Among the government overseers who will be in attendance at the World Economic Forum, there appears to be a growing sentiment that banks have taken enough abuse. 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told an audience in Davos, Switzerland, that people should stop picking on bankers. Mr. Dimon is still waiting for his wish to come true.
Bankers, always a big presence at the World Economic Forum in Davos, will arrive this year under less regulatory pressure and with better profits than in past years. But they are still on the defensive.
Mr. Dimon, scheduled to appear on one of the first panels when the Davos forum opens on Wednesday, is again embroiled in controversy. Last week, JPMorgan's board cut his pay for 2012 in half, to $11.5 million, holding him accountable for a multibillion-dollar loss on derivatives trading.
International bankers are under pressure from the law enforcement authorities as well, and examples can be found near Davos. 
UBS, based in Zurich, agreed to pay a $1.5 billion fine to the global authorities after admitting this month that it had helped manipulate a benchmark rate used to set mortgage and other interest rates.
And Wegelin & Company, a private bank based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, shut down this month after admitting it had helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank, founded in 1741, was the oldest in Switzerland.
At a news conference last week in Washington, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, lamented a "waning commitment" to tougher financial regulation and called upon the banking authorities to finish the job of fixing the world's banks.
For all that, though, bankers may find the atmosphere in Davos a bit more congenial than in some recent years. Among the government overseers who will also be in attendance, there appears to be a growing sentiment that the banks have taken enough abuse.
This month in Basel, Switzerland, for instance, an international gathering of central bankers and bank supervisors relaxed new rules that were intended to ensure that banks would be able to survive an event like the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The rules, which are not binding but serve as a benchmark for national regulators, would require banks to maintain a 30-day supply of cash or liquid assets that are easy to convert into cash. But after the decision in Basel this month, banks would have until 2019 to accumulate the additional cash and assets, instead of 2015.
The regulators also broadened the types of assets that could be used to include even some mortgage-backed securities - the same general class of security that was at the heart of the crisis.
Many analysts see the decision as a gift to the banking industry, which had insisted that planned new regulations would lead banks to curtail lending. Bank stocks in Europe rose after the decision.
"Most bankers I talked to breathed a huge sigh of relief," said Cornelius K. Hurley, a professor at the Boston University School of Law and former assistant general counsel to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve.
Gavan Nolan, a credit analyst at Markit, a data provider in London, agreed that changes in the rules "went further than many had presumed, and in a direction that seems to favor the banks." Still, he wrote in a note to clients, "the effects shouldn't be overstated," adding that the rules "will still make it more difficult to make money, in comparison to the previous era."
The discussions at Davos may offer clues about whether the Basel decisions foreshadow other concessions.
There is a risk that efforts to rein in financial risk could lose momentum as the trauma of Lehman's collapse fades, Mr. Hurley said.
"We said to ourselves back in 2008, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste," he said. "It seems the farther away we get, the evidence is that we are wasting it."
The World Economic Forum tends to be a place for talk rather than action, but it is one of the few events that reliably brings central bankers, regulators, economists, legislators and bankers under one snow-laden roof.
The discussions have sometimes been contentious, as in 2010 when American policy makers like Representative Barney Frank met behind closed doors with top bankers including Brian T. Moynihan, then the chief executive of Bank of America.
Mr. Frank left the meeting fuming about bankers' unwillingness to accept more safeguards and vowed to impose them anyway. Six months later, Congress passed the sweeping financial regulation bill known as Dodd-Frank.
But Mr. Frank has retired, and there are signs that the officials who set the tone for global regulation of banks have become more worried about a credit squeeze in Europe than about the risk of another banking crisis.
Some of the most influential people in the regulation debate are sounding more conciliatory.
"We welcome these rules, we think they are important," Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank and a member of the group that met in Basel, said this month. "We also welcome their gradual phasing in."
At least some banks have had a profit rebound recently, including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, whose chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, is scheduled to take part in a panel on competitiveness at Davos on Friday.
European banks are still ailing, though, which threatens the fragile calm that has prevailed in financial markets. Whereas the euro zone debt crisis has fallen most heavily on southern European countries like Spain, weakness in the banking system is a problem even in healthier countries like Germany.
Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, is profitable but faces official investigations in Germany and the United States, mostly related to its activities before the financial crisis.
In December, police officers surrounded the bank's headquarters in Frankfurt and seized documents as part of a tax-evasion inquiry that involves one of the bank's co-chief executives, Jürgen Fitschen.
Other large German banks like Commerzbank and several of the state-owned landesbanks are still hobbled by bad investments they made before Lehman collapsed.
Belgium, France and Austria also have troubled banks, even though they are not considered to be countries in crisis.
"The bottom line is that I don't think the banking system is in good condition, and I don't expect it to come back to good condition soon," said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.
Mr. Véron said he did not have reservations about the decision in Basel to ease new regulations on liquid assets, noting that previously there were no rules at all on liquidity.
"I think the big headline remains that liquidity regulations have been introduced," he said. "When you look at what has happened in the crisis, that is a good thing."
But he sounded less optimistic that policy makers meeting in Davos or elsewhere were making progress on other important banking issues, like how to close down terminally ill banks at no cost to taxpayers.
"We have not had the systemwide restructuring process I believe is necessary to get back to sound conditions," he said.

HEADLINE: China's 'Lamborghini' Coefficient: Who's Getting Richer and Who Poorer?

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: China's first figures of income inequality, the Gini coefficient, in over a decade, have been greeted with skepticism as they show the rich-poor gap shrinking, not growing, as many believe. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Search the word Gini, or "jini," for Gini coefficient, the well-known measure of income inequality, on China's biggest microblogging site and the first result today was for Lamborghini, the Italian luxury sports car (in Chinese, the two words share a similar sound in the last part of the car's name.)
That is very ironic because the Gini coefficient measures income inequality and the Lamborghini, which can set a buyer back $300,000, is not an uncommon sight on the streets of big Chinese cities, an object of resentment among ordinary people who view it as a symbol of how a few people are amassing tremendous wealth as many struggle with low incomes, low bank deposit rates, high property prices and persistent inflation. 
In other words, income inequality in China is politically sensitive.
(The Gini index is a measure of household income inequality; zero represents perfect income equality and one, perfect inequality, a situation where one person would own all the wealth, as the World Bank explains.)
So last Friday, when the government announced China's Gini coefficient figures for the first time in over a decade, there was excitement - and quite a bit of scorn - expressed online and in media reports as well as private conversations. Why?
According to the figures, China today is actually more equal than in 2003, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
From 2003, the Gini coefficient did indeed rise, the bureau said, from 0.479 to a high in 2008 of 0.491. But by 2012 the figure had dropped to 0.474, meaning China is a more equal society today than a decade ago - despite all those Lamborghinis on the street. 
At a news conference, Ma Jiantang, the bureau director, called the rate nevertheless "relatively high," Xinhua reported. "China must accelerate its income distribution reform to narrow the rich-poor gap," Xinhua said.
Yet the government's "effective measures" to "bring benefits for its people" after the gobal financial crisis began in 2008 had brought down the measure, it quoted Mr. Ma as saying. 
To compare with the United States: In 2011, the Gini coefficient there was also high, at 0.477, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Xinhua quoted the United Nations as putting the "warning level" on the rich-poor gap at 0.4.
Yet in China this weekend, few believed the new figures.
Here are two lively reactions from microblogs, from a journalist and an economist who together have over six million followers: 
"Please choose one: 1. Really, thank you Fatherland; 2. That's a myth; 3. Not sure, but hurry up and increase my salary," Shi Shusi, a journalist and social commentator, the director of the state-run Worker's Daily Weekly, said on his Sina Weibo account to nearly 875,000 followers.
Xu Xiaonian, a professor of finance and economics at the China Europe International Business School, wrote on his Weibo account (5.5 million followers): "A journalist rang to ask me to comment on today's macroeconomic figures. I'd have to be crazy to truthfully comment on false figures. That Gini coefficient, to use the words of Zheng Yuanjie," a popular children's story writer, "'no-one would even dare to write a fairytale like that.'"
A different report, in December, by researchers at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in the city of Chengdu, put China's Gini at 0.61 for 2010.
While people are by and large glad to see the government once again measuring the figure after a decade-long hiatus (which Mr. Ma explained last year was due to the fact that the government did not actually know what people in the cities were earning, as I explored in a Letter from China,) a major problem facing the government is the scale of people's "hidden income," estimated by the Beijing-based economist Wang Xiaolu several years ago to be about 9.3 trillion renminbi (nearly $1.5 trillion).

HEADLINE: Just One Sale Away From Redemption

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
A bright, encouraging smile almost never leaves the face of Crystal, the embattled heroine of the fine new drama ''Bethany,'' by Laura Marks, which opened on Sunday night at City Center. Portrayed by America Ferrera (''Ugly Betty'') with a warm poise that smoothly masks profound anxiety, Crystal cannot really afford to let doubt or vulnerability cloud her features. She's a saleswoman, after all, and the key to selling is keeping up a shiny veneer of confidence, even when there's a silent screech of desperation threatening to leap into your throat.
Ms. Marks's trenchant, economical drama is surprisingly (dismayingly) rare among new American plays in the clear, compassionate attention it pays to the corrosive effects of the economic downturn on the battered middle class. In this expertly turned Women's Project production, directed by Gaye Taylor Upchurch, the focus is on the rough waters being negotiated by a single mother living in an unnamed exurb of a small American city. 
As the play opens Crystal arrives with a small carry-on bag and a few essentials in her new home: a rather beaten-up-looking, recently foreclosed house that still at least has water and electricity. Crystal has no legal right to be there, so she turns on that welcoming smile when she discovers she's not the only squatter. Gary (Tobias Segal), scruffy and possibly emotionally disturbed, has already moved into the bedroom upstairs.
Gary's tendency to rant about the toxins of the ''military-industrial complex'' and about how the downfall of capitalism will lead to a new, nomadic culture would normally have a sensible young woman like Crystal sprinting for the nearest Comfort Inn. But Crystal has no money and nowhere to go, and more important a pressing need to establish some sort of convincingly stable domicile. A job loss led to Crystal's becoming homeless, which in turn led to the placement of her daughter, Bethany, in foster care.
As played with twitchy, molelike menace by Mr. Segal, Gary definitely reeks of potential danger, but he seems friendly enough. He mostly sticks to himself and is perfectly willing to help out by posing as a plumber when Crystal receives a visit from the social worker (the fine Myra Lucretia Taylor) she hopes will help her get Bethany back. Aside from the false nature of her domestic situation, Crystal must also hide the dispiriting news she has just received: that her new job selling Saturns will soon be going away when the dealership closes. (Emily Ackerman brings some welcome, mordant humor to the play as Crystal's dryly dour boss, Shannon.)
Ms. Marks, a recent graduate from the Juilliard playwriting program, draws a stark, increasingly disturbing picture of the vulnerability of single women (and single mothers) in an economy in which the threads of the safety net have frayed to the point of invisibility. Crystal's enforced cohabitation with the unbalanced Gary is not the only way she finds herself uncomfortably dependent on, well, the kindness of strangers.
At work she is desperate to make one last sale, and she thinks she has found a solid buyer in Charlie (the excellent Ken Marks, the playwright's husband), a motivational speaker who's eyeing one of the higher-end models but can't quite bring himself to sign on the dotted line. In monologues that make for grimly funny listening, Charlie gives us a taste of two of his spiels about achieving financial prosperity, offering comforting, specious platitudes like ''the hardest part of making your dreams come true is simply believing that you deserve it.''
The smarmy pep talk, with its generous doses of magical thinking, isn't the only dubious line of goods Charlie is peddling. Mr. Marks's genial every-guy exterior hides something far more sinister. In perhaps the play's most chilling scene, Charlie drives Crystal home after taking her to dinner ostensibly to discuss buying the car. Without quite making the terms of the transaction explicit, Charlie suggests that one of ''the secret laws of prosperity,'' as he puts it in his inspirational-speak, is the ''law of compensation'': the quid pro quo.
As Crystal finds herself under increasing pressure from all sides, ''Bethany'' takes a turn toward the gothic in its depiction of the lengths to which this intelligent, well-meaning and morally centered woman will go to secure a chance at getting her daughter back. But there's a sad, dark logic to even the most outlandish turns the story takes.
And Ms. Ferrera's performance is beautifully modulated. Pushed to the edge but still determined to keep the pilot light of hope flickering in her increasingly darkened life, Crystal knows she must keep a firm grip on her emotional responses at every moment. This means burying her humane impulses when she feels her future is at stake, and even, at one point, keeping her wits about her -- where's that Formula 409? -- after a brutal (and literal) fight for her life.
Without stepping over the line into moralizing -- or editorializing -- Ms. Marks's disturbing, incisive drama suggests that the bruising exigencies of our depressed economy are scraping away at the surface civilities of American life, making it harder for people to heed their moral compasses. Self-reliance may be a celebrated American virtue, but ''Bethany'' reminds us that the distance between self-preservation and pure ruthlessness can be collapsed with alarming ease.

HEADLINE: Cameron to Reschedule Europe Speech Soon

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL and JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who postponed a much-awaited address on his country's future relations with Europe because of the Algeria hostage crisis, will deliver the speech in the next few days, Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday. 
''It will happen this week,'' Mr. Hague told the BBC, but he said the date and location would not be announced until Monday.
His remarks coincided with one more sign of American public displeasure that Mr. Cameron may move Britain closer to leaving the 27-nation European Union when he gives the address, which was initially scheduled for Friday in the Netherlands.
Last week a White House spokesman quoted President Obama as telling Mr. Cameron in a telephone call that ''the United States values a strong U.K. in a strong European Union, which makes critical contributions to peace, prosperity and security in Europe and around the world.''
That theme resurfaced Sunday when the American ambassador in London, Louis B. Susman, told Sky News that ''we cannot imagine a strong E.U. without a vibrant partner in the U.K.''
''That is what we hope will come about, but it is up to the British people to decide what they want,'' Mr. Susman said, according to the Press Association news agency.
On Friday, after Mr. Cameron postponed the speech, his office released excerpts suggesting that he had planned to deliver an explicit warning that Britain might leave the European Union unless the bloc changed the way it is run.
Mr. Cameron planned to say that there was ''a gap between the E.U. and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is -- yes -- felt particularly acutely in Britain.''
''If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift toward the exit,'' Mr. Cameron planned to say. ''I do not want that to happen. I want the European Union to be a success, and I want a relationship between Britain and the E.U. that keeps us in it.''
Mr. Cameron is under pressure from members of his own Conservative Party to promise a referendum on Europe, and he has signaled his readiness to hold one, although the precise question to be asked has not been made clear.
Mr. Hague, the foreign secretary, said Sunday that there was a strong case for seeking ''fresh consent'' about the relationship between the European Union and Britain, which held a referendum approving membership in 1975.
''We want to succeed in the European Union -- we want an outward-looking E.U. to succeed in the world, and for the United Kingdom to succeed in that,'' he said.
''But we have to recognize that the European Union has changed a lot since the referendum of 1975, and that there have been not only great achievements to the E.U.'s name but some things that have gone badly wrong, such as the euro,'' Mr. Hague said, referring to the protracted crisis over the bloc's single currency. Britain does not participate in the single currency.

HEADLINE: Mixed Response to Comcast in Expanding Net Access

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- At the cramped downtown office of the Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County, a line of older residents waited to apply for a federal program that helps pay for heat and other utilities. On the walls, next to posters advertising Head Start and other public services, hung posters for something called Internet Essentials.
''Is the Internet on your back to school list?'' read one leaflet being handed out along with information about the Women, Infants and Children program, a Health Department initiative that offers nutritional and breast-feeding support to low-income families.
Internet Essentials is not a government program, although that would be difficult to tell from the poster. Instead, it is a two-year-old program run by Comcast, the country's largest Internet and cable provider, meant to bring affordable broadband to low-income homes. 
Any family that qualifies for the National School Lunch Program is eligible for Internet service at home for $9.95 a month. The families also receive a voucher from Comcast to buy a computer for as little as $150.
The program is not charity: Comcast started Internet Essentials in order to satisfy a regulatory requirement to provide Internet access to the poor, which also happens to be one of the few remaining areas for growth for cable companies across the country. More than 100,000 households in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and other major markets have signed up for Internet Essentials.
But as the program gains popularity, the company has come under criticism, accused of overreaching in its interactions with local communities -- handing out brochures with the company logo during parent-teacher nights at public schools, for instance, or enlisting teachers and pastors to spread the word to students and congregations.
''A company like Comcast doesn't do it out of the goodness of their heart,'' said Joe Karaganis, vice president of the American Assembly, a nonprofit public affairs forum affiliated with Columbia University.
The Obama administration has been pushing private-public partnerships as a way to make high-speed home Internet access available to the 100 million Americans who lack it.
The digital divide has traditionally been regarded as one between urban and rural areas of the United States. But only about 7 percent of households without broadband are in rural areas without the necessary infrastructure; the bulk of the rest are low-income families who cannot afford the monthly bill, or do not feel it is a necessity, according to government statistics.
''The broadband divide is a real threat to the American dream,'' Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in an interview. ''The costs of digital exclusion are getting higher and higher.''
Comcast set up shop in Chicago in May 2011, a few months after its $13.75 billion takeover of NBC Universal. As part of its approval for the deal, the F.C.C. required the company to devise a plan to make broadband available to the poor. Comcast reluctantly agreed, according to a person involved in the merger who could not speak publicly about private conversations. A Comcast spokesman said the company had volunteered the plan. Broadband subscriptions represent the main driver of Comcast's $55.8 billion in annual revenue. The company and its competitors have largely reached saturation among households that can afford high-speed Internet. That leaves the poor as one of the industry's main areas of growth.
''In the long, long run, yes, I hope we're creating future Comcast customers,'' said David L. Cohen, executive vice president of the Comcast Corporation. He added: ''There's no bait and switch here. This is a community investment.''
Before he became Comcast's chief lobbyist and the overseer of Internet Essentials, Mr. Cohen was a prominent Democratic political consultant and aide to Edward G. Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor.
He regularly consults with local political leaders, including his friend Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, who has assisted Mr. Cohen in making the city an important market for Internet Essentials. Comcast has made donations to Mr. Emanuel's campaigns in the past. The company spent $12.4 million on lobbying last year and contributed $4.8 million to mostly Democratic candidates.
On Saturday, the United States Conference of Mayors gave Comcast and Mr. Emanuel an award for the Internet Essentials collaboration.
Rather than sell Internet Essentials in its normal bundle, Comcast has established a separate sales team that works directly with community leaders. The company has enlisted hundreds of Internet Essentials volunteers who spread the word about the program.
One of those volunteers is Gale Woods, who, after a long shift at Walmart, used to walk her son, Austin, more than a mile to the public library so he could get access to a computer to do his homework.
The situation was not ideal, but Ms. Woods could not afford a computer, much less the monthly Internet fee. Then she heard Mayor Emanuel talking about Internet Essentials during a news conference for $10 a month, less than one-fourth what the service typically costs.
''I thought, wow, that's a deal,'' Ms. Woods, 47, said in the living room of her apartment on the city's South Side. ''It's usually at least $40 just for the basics.''
After using the service for over a year, Ms. Woods serves as a volunteer. She tells neighbors in her Bronzeville apartment complex how to sign up and drops off brochures at the library.
As she talked about the benefits of having the Internet at home, including sending out résumés and taking classes at Northeastern Illinois University, 10-year-old Austin gently interrupted his mother. ''It's pretty slow, Mom, I have to load it three times,'' he said. (Internet Essentials provides broadband with speeds of 3 megabits per second, compared with the 12 megabits per second that many higher-priced packages provide.)
At Morton High School in Cicero, a heavily Hispanic suburb of Chicago, teenagers wearing uniforms of khaki pants and white-collared shirts flooded the hallways. Near an honor roll poster and a mural of the ancient Aztecs, Michael Kuzniewski, superintendent of J. Sterling Morton High School District (known among students as ''Dr. K'') said nearly 90 percent of the school's 3,600 students qualified for the federal lunch program, making it a prime target for Internet Essentials.
Comcast sets up kiosks at open houses, handing out Internet Essentials brochures to parents. Teachers and counselors send students home with brochures. Dr. Kuzniewski said private companies approach them almost daily on ideas ''to save public education,'' helping him develop a healthy sense of skepticism. But when he realized how deeply a lack of broadband access put Cicero's students at a disadvantage, any doubts he had about Internet Essentials were erased.
''We just saw them falling further and further behind,'' he said.
But many advocacy groups argue that broadband has become so crucial to success in school and the work force that it should be treated like a public utility paid in part by government subsidies.
Broadband service is ''a natural monopoly'' controlled by a handful of private companies, said Mr. Karaganis, of the American Assembly, adding that Internet Essentials gave Comcast access to people in community settings where it could use the lure of low prices to tap into a new consumer base.
Comcast said an intimate grass-roots approach was necessary to explain to low-income customers why they need the Internet and that the monthly price cannot increase for at least three years. Skepticism about the Web often tops affordability as an obstacle to getting broadband into poor and immigrant households, the company said. ''When a child comes home with information about the school lunch program, we want an Internet Essentials brochure in that packet,'' said Cathy Avgiris, executive vice president and general manager of Comcast Cable's communications and data services.
Marsha Belcher, director of marketing and resource development at the Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County, said that her office's relationship with Comcast was ''a matter of trust.'' She added, ''All of our staffers have worked with Comcast volunteers. If they want to sign up for triple play, they can, but we trust Comcast when they say they won't be pitched'' costly packages of phone, cable and Internet services.
In September the F.C.C. helped set up Connect2Compete, an independent nonprofit group that compiles pledges from Internet and software companies to get computers and Internet access to the underserved. Connect2Compete serves as a middleman between communities and companies. Comcast's major competitors, including Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and others, have signed on to offer discounted broadband to low-income customers through Connect2Compete.
That setup is intended to create a buffer between corporations and communities to avoid the kind of murky territory that private-public partnerships like Internet Essentials must navigate, said Zach Leverenz, chief executive at Connect2Compete.
''It's important to have a trusted intermediary,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Uneasy in the Political Climate, Mickelson Talks Like Someone Ready to Step Away

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
LA QUINTA, Calif. -- After a middle-of-the-pack finish in his 2013 debut, Phil Mickelson stood off the 18th green at the Palmer Private course at PGA West on Sunday and talked about having to make, in his own words, ''drastic changes.''
He was not referring to his equipment. Mickelson, already one of the highest-earning athletes on the planet, is not considering switching the clubs in his bag or the clothes on his back, the way the world No. 1, Rory McIlroy, did last week after signing a lucrative endorsement deal with Nike. 
On the day President Obama was sworn in for his second term, Mickelson sent shock waves through the Humana Challenge when he said the political landscape in the United States was causing him to seriously contemplate his future in golf. Mickelson, who will turn 43 in June, has 40 PGA Tour victories, including four majors, and was inducted last year into the World Golf Hall of Fame.
''I'm not going to jump the gun and do it right away,'' he said after carding a six-under-par 66 to finish in a 10-way tie for 37th, ''but there are going to be some drastic changes for me because I happen to be in that zone that has been targeted both federally and by the state. And, you know, it doesn't work for me right now. So I'm going to have to make some changes.''
As Mickelson spoke, the tournament was winding down to a scintillating conclusion. Brian Gay, who began the final round six strokes off the lead, closed with a nine-under 63 to end regulation tied with David Lingmerth (62) and Charles Howell III (64). He won with a 5-foot birdie on the second hole of the sudden-death playoff.
Scott Stallings, the 54-hole leader, made his first bogey of the tournament on his seventh hole and finished with a 70 to tie for fourth with James Hahn, who capped his 62 with an eagle-3 at the 18th.
Finishing eight strokes out of the playoff was Mickelson, who played the final three rounds in 17 under par but could not climb out of the hole he dug for himself with a par 72 start at La Quinta Country Club.
''I played better as the week wore on,'' Mickelson said. He added: ''I feel like I'm starting to play some pretty good golf. So hopefully I'll be able to make a run on the weekend next week, because that's what's exciting is having a chance to win.''
Mickelson, the reigning champion at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, has more than $67 million in career earnings since turning professional in 1992. Last year, he was ranked by Forbes magazine as the seventh highest-paid athlete, with $47.8 million in earnings, including $43 million in endorsements.
''If you add up all the federal and you look at the disability and the unemployment and the Social Security and state, my tax rate is 62, 63 percent,'' Mickelson said. ''So I've got to make some decisions on what to do.''
Mickelson, who lives with his wife, Amy, and their three children outside San Diego, his hometown, said he planned to elaborate on his comments in more detail this week when the tour stopped in his backyard, at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, Calif.
''It's been an interesting off-season,'' said Mickelson, who cracked open a window into his thought process last week during a teleconference. Asked if he has considered following his United States Ryder Cup teammate Steve Stricker, another 40-something golfer, into semiretirement, Mickelson replied: ''You know, I think that we're all going to have our own way of handling things, handling time in our career, our family, handling what's going on the last couple of months politically. I think we're all going to have to find things that work for us.''
In December, Mickelson, who was part of a group that had bought the San Diego Padres four months earlier, abruptly announced that he was no longer involved in the business deal. His reversal came shortly after California voters approved Proposition 30, which imposed a 13.3 percent tax rate on incomes of more than $1 million.
Asked Sunday if the election results played a role in his decision to sever his ties with the Padres' ownership group, Mickelson replied, ''Yeah, absolutely.''
In vowing to discuss his thinking in more detail at Torrey Pines, Mickelson said: ''I'll probably be a little more open to it because San Diego is where I live, it's where the Padre thing was a possibility and it's where my family is. And it just seems like a better fit than right here off of 18 in Palm Springs.''

HEADLINE: France Proposes an Internet Tax

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- France, seeking fresh ways to raise funds and frustrated that American technology companies that dominate its digital economy are largely beyond the reach of French fiscal authorities, has proposed a new levy: an Internet tax on the collection of personal data. 
The idea surfaced Friday in a report commissioned by President François Hollande, which described various measures his government was taking to address what the French see as tax avoidance by Internet companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook.
These companies gather vast reams of information about their users, harnessing it to tailor their services to individuals' interests or to direct customized advertising to them. So extensive is the collection of personal details, and so promising the business opportunities linked to it, that the report described data as the ''raw material'' of the digital economy.
''They have a distinct value, poorly reflected in economic science or official statistics,'' the report said.
Google generates more than $30 billion a year in advertising revenue, including an estimated &#x20ac;1.5 billion, or $2 billion, in France. Yet, like other American Internet companies, it pays almost no taxes in France. That state of affairs upsets France's policy makers, as public finances have been stretched thin and French Internet companies struggle to gain traction.
''We want to work to ensure that Europe is not a tax haven for a certain number of Internet giants,'' the digital economy minister, Fleur Pellerin, told reporters in Paris on Friday.
But getting Google and other U.S. technology companies to pay more corporate taxes on their profits in France could take a long time, the report acknowledges, because this will require international cooperation.
In the meantime, France has discussed a variety of other taxes. Under the predecessor to Mr. Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, the government proposed a levy on Internet advertising. But that idea languished after local companies complained that it would affect them more than Google. Mr. Hollande's government is also overseeing talks between Google and French online publishers, who want the search engine to pay them for linking to their content.
The report published Friday said a tax on data collection was justified on grounds that users of services like Google and Facebook are, in effect, working for these companies without pay by providing the personal information that lets them sell advertising.
The report says tax rates would be based on the number of users an Internet firm tracked, to be verified by outside auditors. The authors did not recommend tax rates or estimate how much money such a levy could raise.
Google said in a statement that it was reviewing the nearly 200-page report.
''The Internet offers huge opportunities for economic growth and employment in Europe, and we believe public policies should encourage that growth,'' the company said.
The new tax would require legislation, which the government said could be introduced by the end of the year. But other revenue-generating proposals championed by Mr. Hollande have encountered difficulty. A plan for a 75 percent income tax rate on earnings of more than &#x20ac;1 million a year was rejected by the highest court in France, which called it discriminatory.
Any proposal to generate taxes from the gathering of personal information could also draw scrutiny from the French privacy regulator, which has raised concerns about the amount of data that companies like Google and Facebook collect.

HEADLINE: In Davos, Atmosphere For Bankers Improves

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Two years ago, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told an audience in Davos that people should stop picking on bankers. Mr. Dimon is still waiting for his wish to come true.
Bankers, always a big presence at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss city of Davos, arrive this year under less regulatory pressure and with better profits than in past years. But they are still on the defensive.
Mr. Dimon, scheduled to appear on one of the first panels when the Davos forum opens Wednesday, is again embroiled in controversy. Last week JPMorgan's board cut his pay for 2012 in half, to $11.5 million, holding him accountable for a multibillion dollar loss in derivatives trading.
International bankers are under fire from the law enforcement authorities as well, and one does not have to go far from Davos to find examples. 
UBS, based in Zurich, agreed to pay a $1.5 billion fine to the global authorities after admitting this month that it had helped manipulate a key benchmark rate used to set mortgage and other interest rates. Wegelin, a private bank based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, shut down earlier this month after admitting it had helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank, founded in 1741, was the oldest in Switzerland.
And at a news conference last week in Washington, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, lamented a ''waning commitment'' to tougher financial regulation and called upon the banking authorities to finish the job of fixing the world's banks.
For all that, though, bankers may find the atmosphere in Davos a bit more congenial than in some recent years. Among the government overseers who will also be flocking to the Swiss town, there seems to be a growing feeling that the banks have taken enough bashing.
Earlier this month, for instance, an international conclave of central bankers and bank supervisors, meeting in Basel, Switzerland, relaxed new rules that were intended to ensure that banks would be able to survive an event like the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The rules, which are not binding but serve as a benchmark for national regulators, would require banks to maintain a 30-day supply of cash or liquid assets that are easy to convert into cash. But after the decision in Basel this month banks would have until 2019 to accumulate the additional cash and assets, instead of 2015. The regulators also broadened the kinds of assets that qualify, so that now they can include even some mortgage-backed securities--the same general class of security that was at the heart of the crisis.
Many analysts see the decision as a gift to the banking industry, which had insisted that planned new regulations will force them to curtail lending. Bank stocks in Europe rose after the decision.
''Most bankers I talked to breathed a huge sigh of relief,'' said Cornelius Hurley, a professor at the Boston University School of Law and former counsel to the U.S. Federal Reserve board of governors.
Gavan Nolan, a credit analyst at Markit, a data provider in London, agreed that changes in the rules ''went further than many had presumed, and in a direction that seems to favor the banks.'' Still, in a note to clients he added, ''the effects shouldn't be overstated.'' The rules ''will still make it more difficult to make money, in comparison to the previous era.''
The discussions at Davos may offer clues about whether the Basel decisions foreshadow other concessions..
There is a risk that efforts to rein in financial risk could lose momentum as the Lehman trauma fades, Mr. Hurley said.
''We said to ourselves back in 2008, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste,'' he said. ''It seems the farther away we get the evidence is that we are wasting it.''
The World Economic Forum tends to be a place for talk rather than action, but it is one of the few events that reliably brings central bankers, regulators, economists, legislators and bankers under one snow-laden roof.
The discussions sometimes have been contentious, as in 2010 when U.S. policy makers like Representative Barney Frank met behind closed doors with top bankers including Brian T. Moynihan, then the chief executive of Bank of America.
Mr. Frank left the meeting fuming about bankers' unwillingness to accept more safeguards and vowed to impose them anyway. Six months later Congress passed the sweeping financial regulation bill known as Dodd-Frank.
But Mr. Frank himself has retired, and there are signs that the officials who set the tone for global bank regulation have become more worried about a credit crunch in Europe than about the risk of another banking crisis.
Some of the people most influential in the regulation debate are sounding more conciliatory.
''We welcome these rules, we think they are important,'' Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank and a member of the group that met in Basel, said earlier this month. ''We also welcome their gradual phasing in.''
At least some banks have had a rebound in profits recently, including the U.S. institutions JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, whose chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, is scheduled to take part in a panel at Davos on Friday about competitiveness.
European banks are still ailing, though, which threatens the fragile calm that has prevailed in financial markets.
Whereas the euro zone debt crisis has fallen most heavily on countries in southern Europe like Spain, weakness in the banking system is a problem even in healthier countries like Germany.
Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Germany, is profitable but faces official investigations in Germany and the United States, mostly related to its activities before the financial crisis.
In December, police officers surrounded the bank's headquarters in Frankfurt and seized documents as part of a tax-evasion inquiry that involves one of the bank's co-chief executives, Jürgen Fitschen.
Other large banks like Commerzbank and several of the publicly owned landesbanks are still coping with bad investments they made before Lehman collapsed.
Belgium, France and Austria also have troubled banks, even though they are not considered to be countries in crisis.
''The bottom line is that I don't think the banking system is in good condition, and I don't expect it to come back to good condition soon,'' said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.
Mr. Véron said he did not have reservations about the decision in Basel to ease new regulations on liquid assets, noting that previously there were no rules on liquidity at all. ''I think the big headline remains that liquidity regulations have been introduced,'' Mr. Véron said. ''When you look at what has happened in the crisis that is a good thing.''
But he sounded less optimistic that policy makers meeting in Davos or elsewhere were making progress on other important banking issues, like how to close down terminally ill banks at no cost to taxpayers.
''We have not had the systemwide restructuring process I believe is necessary to get back to sound conditions,'' Mr. Véron said.

HEADLINE: A 'Plastic Juncture' in World Affairs

BYLINE: By MARTIN INDYK and ROBERT KAGAN

 BODY:
AS President Barack Obama enters his second term, the state of the world is unsettled. The leading powers are beset with economic crises or are in various states of political transition or gridlock. The Middle East is undergoing political upheaval. Tensions are rising in Asia. The world's institutions -- whether the United Nations, the Group of 20 or the European Union -- are weakened and dysfunctional. The liberal world order established after World War II is fraying at the edges.
This time of uncertainty and instability is a moment of opportunity for Obama. When the United States entered World War I, the philosopher John Dewey observed that the world was at a ''plastic juncture.'' Many progressives believed the unsettled world of their day offered the United States a chance to remold the international system into something better. Americans walked away from that challenge and would embrace it only after a second catastrophic breakdown of world order. Today, we are at another plastic juncture and the president has a unique opportunity to strengthen and extend the liberal world order from which Americans and so many others around the world have benefited. 
There is not a lot to show for Obama's first four years. In fairness, the economic crisis that he inherited made steady concentration on foreign policy more challenging. His predecessor badly bungled the two wars Obama inherited in the Greater Middle East, at great cost in lives and treasure and to America's reputation. Obama began to restore that reputation, raising America's profile and deepening its engagement in East Asia.
But most of the major challenges are much as Obama found them when he took office -- or worse: from the stalled Middle East peace process and turmoil in the Arab world to Iran's continuing march toward a nuclear weapons capability to China's increasing assertiveness. The president's recent preoccupation with re-election has left much of the world wondering, where is the United States?
For all the talk of American decline, Obama is actually well-positioned to assert global leadership. If he can strike the necessary compromise with the U.S. Congress to address America's fiscal crisis, the United States could well emerge as one of the world's most successful and dynamic economies. America enjoys unique advantages: a natural gas revolution that promises soon to make it a net exporter of energy, a superior university system, and an open and innovative economy. The United States remains the only world power with global reach, uniquely capable of organizing concerted international action and serving as a source of security and stability to nations facing threatening neighbors.
How then to take advantage of this plastic moment?
In the security realm, Obama's primary ''big bet'' must be to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability. The collapse of the nonproliferation regime that would follow Iran's successful acquisition of nuclear weapons would strike a devastating blow to the international security order. Conversely, if Obama can succeed in achieving meaningful curbs on Iran's nuclear weapons aspirations, he will do much to strengthen nonproliferation as a fundamental pillar of the new liberal global order.
In East Asia, the president's primary big bet should be on promoting a regional order that encourages China's new leadership to take a peaceful and productive direction, away from greater reliance on military power in favor of continued economic and political development at home and increasing integration abroad. This will also require deepening America's Asian alliances and playing a major role in supporting regional cooperation. With India, the world's largest democracy and the other major rising power in Asia, the next four years will be critical in building a partnership that can serve as another pillar of a new liberal order.
Obama needs to do more to strengthen the liberal economic order. Concluding free-trade agreements with the Asia-Pacific region and Europe would boost U.S. exports and global economic recovery while promoting a broader consensus on the necessary standards to promote free trade and investment. Encouraging the export of American natural gas to key allies and partners in Europe and Asia will help reduce their dependence on Russia and Iran. Leveraging America's hydrocarbon bonanza to encourage more effective efforts to counter climate change will help promote a greener global order.
Strengthening the liberal political order will require increased efforts to enlist the support of emerging democracies. Nations like Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey and Mexico have become increasingly influential economically. But they are struggling to find their identity as democratic powers on the international stage. Some are drifting toward a worldview that actually undermines the liberal nature of the global order. At the same time, powerful autocracies like Russia have staked out positions that are antithetical to liberal values -- on Syria, for instance. They need to understand that the democratic international community is ready to move on without them.
With revolutions in the Arab world and change afoot in Myanmar, it is time to place the United States again at the vanguard of the global democracy movement. This is not only because democracy is consonant with American values. Across the globe, the United States has strategic, political and economic interests in the spread of stable, liberal democracies. Although democracies in transition can be fractious and unstable, in the end they are more reliable supporters of the liberal world order that Americans seek.
Obama should do more to support the difficult struggle for democracy in the Arab world, including holding the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood government to democratic standards and more actively leading the effort to bring about a peaceful democratic outcome in Syria. America's relationship with Russia should be shaped not only by arms agreements but also by respect for the desires and aspirations of the Russian people. The president should work to strengthen those forces in Russian society that favor economic and political modernization.
Finally, the United States needs a global strategy. It cannot focus on one critical region to the detriment of others. While Obama was right to increase American attention to the vital Asia-Pacific region, there is no safe alternative to continuing to play the key security role in the Middle East and Europe. In the Middle East, many nations look to the United States for protection and assistance. But Europe too deserves continued American attention. Everything the United States wants to accomplish in the world can be better accomplished with the help and cooperation of our European allies.
At the end of World War II, the United States led the way in shaping an international order that, for all its flaws, served the American people, and much of the world, remarkably well. With sustained attention, personal engagement, and a clear vision of a multilateral global order that reflects American liberal values and progressive ideals, President Obama now has the opportunity once again to shape world affairs to the benefit of the United States and mankind.

HEADLINE: London College Steps Up to University Level

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
LONDON -- Looking out the window of his book-lined office, it is easy to imagine Aldwyn Cooper as the president of a small liberal arts college somewhere in the wilds of New England. There is the snow falling gently on the leafy campus outside, amid the bustle of students walking between classes.
With his bow tie and neatly trimmed white beard, Mr. Cooper looks the part -- even the British accent does little to dispel the impression of a comfortable academic backwater. Only the steady procession of cars driving on the left side of the road indicates that these woods are actually in the center of London.
Last July, Regent's College was granted degree-awarding powers by the British government. Next month, the school, which has about 3,700 full-time students, expects to receive university status, which would make it only the second private university in Britain. (The University of Buckingham, founded in 1976, was the first.) 
A nonprofit company registered as a charity, Regent's receives no funding from the central government. Ever since David Willetts, the British minister for higher education, announced the coalition government's eagerness for private providers to enter the sector, Regent's, which was founded in 1984 as an outpost of Rockford College in Illinois, has been working toward university status.
''Part of the reason it's taken so long is that we're helping the government make up the rules as it goes along,'' said Mr. Cooper, the school's principal. ''They've never had to deal with an institution that offers both British and American degrees before,'' he said. Formerly known as the British American College London, Regent's is made up of seven specialist schools, which include the London School of Film, Media and Performance; the School of Psychotherapy and Counseling Psychology; the European Business School; and Regent's American College London, which offers a four-year undergraduate liberal arts degree through Webster University, based in St. Louis, Missouri.
Until this year, undergraduates who opted for a three-year European-style program had their degrees validated by the Open University, whose annual fees, at £5,000, or about $8,000, for both domestic and foreign students, have long been the cheapest in Britain.
''Because we're not state-funded, there are no controls on our fees or on the number of students. So we can charge what we think is correct,'' Mr. Cooper said. Regent's charges both domestic and foreign undergraduates £14,000 a year.
Asked to justify such high fees, Mr. Cooper pointed to a faculty-student ratio of 14 to 1 -- ''and those 14 are all actually teaching students,'' he said. With no classes larger than 25 students, most of the teaching is done in seminars or tutorials. Foreign language study is also emphasized, with ''10 economically important languages'' taught on campus.
''We are the most internationally focused educational institution in this country,'' he said. The largest single group of students, 15 percent, comes from Britain. An additional 10 percent are American. The rest come from everywhere else. ''There are 130 nationalities on campus, but no enormous number from anywhere,'' he said.
''We have classes with Serbian students, Croatian students and Bosnians sitting alongside one another in ways they didn't think they could,'' said Lawrence Phillips, who heads Regent's American College.
''They have made a career decision to do an American liberal arts degree,'' said Sophie Laws, director of the college's humanities program. ''It sets them apart because it is so portable,'' she said.
Mr. Phillips said he found the broader focus of liberal arts teaching more rewarding. ''I came here out of specific concerns about the narrowness of British universities, producing business graduates who can't write and historians who can't count,'' he said.
The school's cosmopolitan atmosphere was an important factor for Martha Gausdal, now in her second year studying for a bachelor's degree in international relations and human rights.
''I'm from Alesund, an island in Norway. It's a small place,'' she said. ''Here my classmates speak German, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese. I get to sit next to people brought up in Afghan society and people brought up in French society.''
''It makes you more capable of understanding other cultures -- you get less suspicious,'' said Ms. Gausdal, who is president of the undergraduate student union.
Her friend, Lisa Marie Nyvoll, who is also from Alesund, is in her third year studying international business and French. She said she had also considered the London School of Economics and Cass Business School.
''I knew I wanted to be in London,'' Ms. Nyvoll said. ''In Norway you only study a single subject, and I wanted something more flexible. But I also wanted small classes, and a lot of attention from the professors, which you get here.''
''All my professors know my name,'' Ms. Gausdal said. She also liked the way the American curriculum, unlike the British or Norwegian ones, gave credit for class participation. ''It's important for me to be able to be vocal in class -- if you study politics you need to have debates and conversations,'' she said. ''I'm not so good when it all comes down to just one exam at the end of the year.''
Because their country is not a member of the European Union, Norwegian students would have to pay the international student rate for any British university.
At the London School of Economics, British and other E.U. students who start undergraduate degrees next autumn will pay tuition of £8,500, while overseas students pay £15,700. Cass Business School charges £9,000 for British and other E.U. students, and £12,500 for those from overseas.
''Regent's is a bit more, but it seemed worth it,'' Ms. Nyvoll said, adding that the Norwegian government gave students who attended overseas institutions a combination of scholarships and loans to cover the costs -- with 40 percent of the loan amount forgiven for students who pass their final exams.
British and other E.U. students are eligible for government loans covering as much as £6,000 of tuition. For the remaining £8,000, the school offers as many as 50 full scholarships a year to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
''Yet we find it difficult to fill those bursaries,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''Even though at least 1,300 of our students would be eligible for government loans, only about 90 apply. The majority of students who come here are from relatively comfortable families, ranging from comfortably middle-class to staggeringly wealthy.''
''The students generally are from privileged families,'' Ms. Nyvoll said. ''A lot of them come from business families. And much as you might like to think the world is really fair, when it comes time to look for a job or an internship, the contacts you make here can be really helpful.''
Regent's has ''a long-term aspiration to become completely needs blind,'' Mr. Cooper said. However, in the short term, the ability to admit students regardless of their ability to pay will have to contend with other aims, including a projected doubling of student enrollment in the next seven years, the opening of overseas campuses in Hong Kong, Eastern Europe and South America, and the acquisition of a design school and a law school.
Like awarding its own degrees, gaining university status is crucial to the school's plans for expansion. ''We do a lot of work with the Russians -- they love us to bits,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''But the government in Russia hasn't been able to recognize us. Same with the Saudis. Now they can. And of course it's also important for employers -- and for our graduates.''

HEADLINE: From Farm Girl to College President

BYLINE: By JOYCE LAU

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Rebecca Chopp is the president of Swarthmore College. The institution, founded in 1864 outside Philadelphia, was ranked the third-best liberal arts college in the United States by U.S. News and World Report. Dr. Chopp recently finished a tour of Asia that included Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai and Suzhou, China.
You were the first woman to hold each of your last four posts: provost at Emory University in Atlanta, dean at Yale Divinity School, president at Colgate University in New York State, and now president at Swarthmore. How significant is that?
I'm of that generation where that happened a lot. My being a woman has become less significant with each post, as more women head other universities. 
Q. How did you balance being a working mother?
A. I was 25 when I had my son and 27 when I went to graduate school. I had a very supportive spouse, so it was difficult, but not impossible. I wrote my dissertation from 5 to 7 every morning, and then got my son off to school. Having a child in graduate school helped keep me grounded.
Lotte Bailyn, a professor at M.I.T.'s business school, says that one of our top economic issues is how to allow people to raise their families and still be productive.
You've held events for students who, like you, were the first in their families to go to college. How were you brought up?
My father had a farm in Kansas and worked in construction. My mother taught me to read, but my parents didn't think that girls should go to college.
I ended up at a big state university, the kind with 600 kids in the Chemistry 101 class, and I was a student who had had no pre-college preparation. In high school, I studied home economics and sewing. I dropped out my first year.
I later went to a small liberal arts college, thanks to financial aid and working several part-time jobs.
Q. So a college drop-out went on to be a college president. Do you have advice for those who may have stumbled early on in their academic careers?
A. Here's a story: I applied to two places for my Ph.D. Southern Methodist University sent me a letter saying, well, basically saying I should stay on the farm. But the University of Chicago must have seen something -- in my essay, in my letters of recommendation -- and gave me a fellowship.
Q. There are many parents who believe that if children are not put on an early path of elite kindergartens and private tutors, that they will not get into top colleges and universities.
A. We worry about that in our admissions office. America has a long tradition of taking people based on their promise. Sometimes someone without perfect test scores will show a special spark. Success is not just about intelligence, but diligence and passion.
Q. How hard is it to get into Swarthmore? Is there a minimum academic requirement?
A. We had over 6,000 applicants for a class that has only about 380 spots. So we're very selective. We don't have a defined cut-off point for grades and test scores -- though, of course, we look at them. Our average SAT scores are probably in the 720 range.
Swarthmore is extremely academically rigorous. So if you're struggling with math and analytical skills, you're not going be a good fit.
We say, ''Is this a student who will fit? Is this a student whom we can help?'' Maybe it's a soccer player who is interested in politics and works in student theater.
There are reports of many Asian students cheating when they apply to study in the West. They use falsified transcripts, letters of recommendations written by parents, and essays written by paid agents. How do you deal with that?
A. Our applicants tend to self-select. It's still relatively rare for a student who is not interested in academics to find Swarthmore. We don't have the same problem as enormous state schools.
We know how 18-year-olds write. It's not impossible to guess an authentic essay and one written by an agent. Admissions people have a good sense of these things. And our alumni serve as admissions interviewers, also.
We're also looking for a coherence between the test scores, essays and interviews.
Q. U.S. schools, particularly smaller colleges, have been hit hard by the economic crisis. The first thing you did in your new job was cut the budget. Can you still deliver a top education?
A. We were in the middle of the Great Recession when I became president. We made a decision that we would not cut student financial aid and that we would not fire anyone. But we found many inefficiencies, froze salaries, and reduced infrastructure maintenance. We weathered the crisis.
Now, we have a master plan that will keep Swarthmore fresh and relevant.
We recently received a $50 million donation that will go to new engineering, biology and psychology facilities. We are one of the few liberal arts colleges to have an engineering program.
Q. The concept of a liberal arts education is still reasonably foreign outside the United States. Many people equate it, inaccurately, with fields of studies that are not seen to lead to lucrative careers. Can you explain its benefits?
A. You might be interested to know that we have a very high acceptance rate -- 81 percent -- among our graduates who apply to medical school.
Liberal arts is founded on a whole person, developing a person athletically and academically. Liberal arts is going international.
The 21st century is one of entrepreneurship and innovation. There will not be fixed careers. The liberal arts teaches you to think outside the box.
When you talk to employers, they aren't really focused on skills that can be easily taught, and might be outdated in five years. They want people with critical thinking skills, people who can work in diverse teams and solve problems.
But we do need to do a better job of discussing how our education translates into the workplace, and teach students how to communicate that also.
Q. How international is your school?
A. About 14 percent of our students come from overseas. The largest portion of our international students are from Asia, particularly from South Korea and China. We also have students from Japan, Hong Kong and India.
Q. Swarthmore's tuition is more than $43,000. Are elite private colleges for the rich?
A. About half our students -- both domestic and foreign -- are on financial aid. Our domestic admissions are needs blind, meaning that we do not take a student's ability to pay into account at all.
Our international admissions are not needs blind. We'd love for them to be, but we also believe that if we were, we would not be able to afford it. That does not mean that an excellent foreign student needs to be rich. About half of them also get financial aid.
Q. What are the advantages of going to a smaller school?
A. It's hard to fall through the cracks at a small liberal arts college. If you don't show up for class, someone is going to call or e-mail you. We educate students to look out for each other.
I think it would be hard to get through four years at Swarthmore without getting to know one of our faculty members very well. They have an open-door policy to students.

HEADLINE: The Move Online Is Hurting Europe's Music Retailers

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- Across Europe, music is once again fueling protests, strikes and sit-ins. In a twist on the 1960s, it is the music sellers, rather than the listeners, who are up in arms.
Employees of two HMV record stores in Limerick, Ireland, started sit-ins last week, demanding unpaid wages after the chain, based in Britain, filed for bankruptcy protection.
In France, workers at Virgin Megastore music and video shops went on strike this month after that chain, too, was declared insolvent and placed under a court-appointed administrator, threatening the stores with closure.
In Italy, workers at Fnac, which sells compact discs, DVDs, books and consumer electronics, took similar action last autumn after the Italian division of the French chain was sold to private equity investors, who are expected to shut stores and cut jobs. 
Faced with the possible demise of a broad swath of its retail infrastructure for music, movies and other media, Europe is, in some ways, merely catching up with the United States -- and with the technological and economic forces that have swept through the entertainment industry. Tower Records, the U.S. equivalent of HMV or Virgin Megastore, shut down in 2006, unable to compete with online retailers like Amazon.com and iTunes, from Apple, as well as digital pirates. Tower Records in Japan, which split from the U.S. company about 10 years ago, continues to operate.
But the threat to bricks-and-mortar shops selling music and movies is being seen as a broader economic and cultural calamity for Europe. Not only are thousands of jobs at stake; these chains, European owned, also play important roles in disseminating locally produced media. Waiting in the wings to replace them are mostly American-owned Internet giants, whose growing presence and smaller contributions to European fiscal coffers worry policy makers.
''The physical cultural businesses are threatened today because of the emergence of large online sites that completely avoid fair competition, since they do not pay the same taxes as others, being based outside France,'' the French culture minister, Aurélie Filippetti, said in a radio interview with Europe 1.
In addition to the potential economic fallout, there is nostalgia. HMV, for example, is an iconic British retailer, in business since 1921, when the composer Edward Elgar attended the opening of the first shop in London. HMV stands for ''His Master's Voice,'' the title of a painting by Francis Barraud that became the basis for a widely used music industry trademark, in which a dog is mesmerized by the sound emanating from a phonograph.
The owner of that first store, called the Gramophone Co., was a precursor to the British record company EMI, which recently passed into foreign hands when it was sold to Universal Music Group, controlled by the French media conglomerate Vivendi.
''People feel very emotional about all this. They feel very sad about it,'' said Neil Saunders, an analyst at Conlumino, a retail consulting firm in London. ''They say, 'HMV is a part of my youth.' And then you ask them when they last went into an HMV store, and they say, 'Um, three years ago?'''
Digital music is making significant inroads in Europe, several years after it did so in the United States, where it already accounts for more than half the market. In Britain, digital outlets accounted for 32 percent of music industry revenue of $1.4 billion in 2011, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, up from 19 percent two years earlier.
Counting compact discs sold by Internet mail-order businesses like Amazon.com, as well as digital services like iTunes, online distribution accounted for 73.5 percent of music and video sales in Britain last year, according to Conlumino. That could rise to 90 percent by the end of 2015, the firm forecasts.
The problems at HMV, Virgin and Fnac have heightened the scrutiny of online retailers like Amazon, with politicians in France and Britain accusing the company of unfair competition because of the strategies it employs to reduce its taxes in Europe. Amazon routes its European sales through Luxembourg, where corporate taxes are lower than in France or Britain.
Amazon has insisted that the practice complies with E.U. law, and analysts say that in any case the difference in tax rates is a relatively minor factor in the decline of physical retailers like HMV, Virgin and Fnac. A bigger difference is rent; it is much cheaper to operate a mail-order warehouse in an industrial park than a megastore on the Champs-Élysées in Paris or Oxford Street in London.
''There has been a structural change in the way we shop, and the business models of the physical retailers no longer add up,'' Mr. Saunders said.
The retail crisis has engulfed two other British chains: the local arm of Blockbuster, the video-rental business, and Jessops, a camera and video chain, which collapsed last week. In both cases, court-appointed administrators were named to oversee sales or shutdowns.
With 4,500 jobs at risk at more than 200 HMV stores, the company's chief executive, Trevor Moore, has pledged to try to save as much of the chain as possible. Several potential bidders have expressed an interest, even though accountants from Deloitte have taken over day-to-day oversight.
HMV has already been bailed out by one of its suppliers, EMI, which is paying the rent on 16 of HMV's stores to keep an important sales channel alive. But analysts said it would be difficult for EMI's new owner, Universal, to take over HMV, as E.U. regulators had already required Universal to make significant divestitures to complete the deal.
In Italy, the eight Fnac stores -- in Florence, Milan, Naples, Rome, Turin and other major cities -- were sold last year to a private equity firm, Orlando Italy Management, by their French owner, the retail conglomerate PPR, after losing money for years.
An employees' group says it expects the new owners to announce a restructuring plan Tuesday, including the closing of Fnac stores and the elimination of more than half of the 550 jobs in Italy.
Fnac is also struggling at home in France, where it operates under a public pledge to support local music. Sales at Fnac, which also has stores scattered outside the country, declined a further 3.2 percent in 2011, prompting PPR to announce last year that it was exploring a public offering of the chain. The spinoff of Fnac, formed in 1954 as a buyers' club, caused the news site Mediapart to lament ''the end of a cultural exception.''
Fnac is at least doing better than the French Virgin Megastores, one of the last remnants of a once sprawling international retail empire built by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson. Mr. Branson's company, Virgin Group, has sold those stores, and outside France, many of them have been shut; a handful are still operating in the Middle East, as well as in airports and train stations.
As with HMV, several potential buyers have expressed an interest in the French Virgin Megastores, which are owned by a private equity firm, Butler Capital Partners.
The more than 1,000 workers at the 26 Virgin Megastores in France are not sitting around silently, waiting to learn their futures. During a demonstration outside the store on the Champs-Élysées, which has witnessed an influx of American fashion chains and motorcycle supply shops, one employee told the French newspaper Libération: ''Do we want the most beautiful avenue in the world to have nothing but garages and apparel boutiques, or do we want it to show what France can do in terms of culture?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Oath, Beginning 2nd Term: An Intimate White House Ceremony -- Traditional Pomp Is Set for Today

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With only his family beside him, Barack Hussein Obama was sworn into office for a second term on Sunday in advance of Monday's public pomp, facing a bitterly divided government at home and persistent threats abroad that inhibit his effort to redefine America's use of power.
It was a brief and intimate moment in the White House, held because of a quirk of the calendar that placed the constitutionally mandated start of the new term on a Sunday.
But the low-key event seemed to capture tempered expectations after four years of economic troubles and near-constant partisan confrontation. And it presaged a formal inauguration on Monday that will be less of a spectacle than the first one, when the nation's first black president embodied hope and change for many Americans at a time of financial struggle and war. 
For Monday's festivities, with the traditional parade, balls and not least the re-enacted swearing-in outside the Capitol, there will be fewer parties and fewer people swarming the National Mall; organizers expect less than half the 1.8 million people who flocked to the city last time.
Once the parties end, Mr. Obama's second-term challenges are formidable, not least given his ambitious priorities of addressing the national debt, illegal immigration and gun violence.
The economy, while recovering steadily, remains fragile. The unemployment rate is as high as it was in January 2009, though it is down from the 10 percent peak reached late that year, and there is no consensus with Republicans about additional stimulus measures -- or virtually anything else.
And as the terrorist attack in Algeria last week illustrated, Mr. Obama continues to confront threats around the globe, both from state actors like Iran and North Korea and from Qaeda-inspired extremists seeking to exploit power vacuums in the Mideast and across Africa and Asia.
At home, the emphasis is on reducing the deficits that piled up because of the economic downturn and the soaring costs of caring for an aging population. Yet Mr. Obama and Republicans in Congress, divided by opposing views on the role of government, are no closer to a budget agreement that would overhaul taxes and costly, fast-growing entitlement programs like Medicare. The next showdown in what has seemed a never-ending loop of fiscal brinkmanship and half-measures is likely to come as soon as next month over spending cuts.
The persistent partisan battles underscore Mr. Obama's inability to make good on an original promise -- that he would open a bipartisan era of problem solving. While Mr. Obama's words have become less soaring and more confrontational toward Republicans after four years in which they sought to foil him, David Plouffe, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' on Sunday that the president had written a ''hopeful'' inaugural address for Monday's ceremony.
But Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said on the same program, ''The president seems so fixated on demonizing Republicans that he is blinded to the opportunities as well as the obligations that he has to deal with the big problems of this country on debt and the entitlements.''
Mr. Obama draws approval from just over half of Americans -- down 11 percentage points from his popularity in a New York Times/CBS News survey just after his first inauguration -- with Republicans united in opposition and independents split. If history is a guide, he has a limited time to act before his post-election leverage fades.
The official swearing-in of Mr. Obama, 51, was just the seventh time in history that a president was sworn in privately before the public ceremony, and the first since President Ronald Reagan's second inauguration. Each instance since 1821 occurred because the constitutionally mandated date for the inauguration fell on a Sunday.
The simplicity of Mr. Obama's minute-long taking of the oath of office suggested a marriage before a justice of the peace, with a big ceremony and party planned for later.
Only Michelle Obama, holding her family Bible for the ceremony, and the Obamas's daughters, Malia and Sasha, stood beside Mr. Obama in the grand Blue Room as he recited the 35-word oath in the Constitution that was administered, as it was four years ago, by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. About a dozen relatives of the Obamas and Jane Roberts, the justice's wife, watched out of camera range.
By contrast, the swearing-in hours earlier of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the vice-presidential mansion, while simple, was large enough to suggest that Mr. Biden is indeed looking beyond the next four years to the 2016 election. Among the 120 guests who watched Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor swear in Mr. Biden were Democratic dignitaries from the early presidential-nominating states, including Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. On Saturday evening, Mr. Biden attended a party of Democrats from Iowa, the first presidential caucus state.
The private ceremonies were held because, under the Constitution, the two men's first terms ended at noon on Sunday. In between their events, Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden went together to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. And they prayed, separately: the Obamas attended services at the 175-year-old Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, where the enthusiastic congregation engaged in a call-and-response with the pastor evoking the president's ''Forward'' campaign slogan; the Bidens and their guests celebrated a Mass in the vice-presidential mansion.
In the evening, Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden and their wives attended a gala for donors to both the 2012 campaign and the inaugural expenses, where performers included Stevie Wonder.
For Mr. Obama, the solemnity of his swearing-in was broken by his younger daughter, Sasha, who seemed to recall the problem four years earlier, when a garbling of the oath by both her father and Chief Justice Roberts at the Capitol forced them to repeat the oath at the White House the next day.
With warmth that belied their political differences, especially over campaign spending law, Justice Roberts congratulated Mr. Obama, and the president thanked him twice as they shook hands. Mr. Obama then embraced his wife and daughters in turn. ''Good job, Daddy,'' Sasha said. ''I did it!'' he replied, only to have her quip, ''You didn't mess up'' -- leaving the president chuckling and rolling his eyes as he pivoted to thank the small group of witnesses and exit the room.
Elsewhere on a sunny winter Sunday, the streets of Washington were snarled with traffic, and hotels and homes were filling with the tens of thousands of visitors who, along with area residents, began partying through the weekend in bars and at receptions hosted by corporations and political groups.
Democratic women especially were feted. At a party sponsored by Emily's List, which helps elect Democratic women who favor abortion rights, the talk was of 2016 -- and whether Hillary Rodham Clinton, the departing secretary of state, might run for president.
Flags, bunting and red, white and blue lights festooned streets, buildings and grounds, but as usual for such events, also ubiquitous were cement and metal security barriers, along with police and troops on downtown blocks.
Much is changed since January 2009, and much of it not in the way Mr. Obama planned. His challenges ahead are perhaps not so great as then -- 779,000 people lost their jobs that January, a one-month record, the financial and auto industries were teetering and millions of Americans were losing homes and savings -- but they are nonetheless daunting.
While Democrats controlled Congress for his first two years, when Mr. Obama passed his signature laws for economic stimulus, expanded health insurance and financial industry regulation, Republicans captured the House majority in a conservative backlash at his midterm and are expected to keep it for his second term, given their success in drawing districts to keep them safe for Republicans. That means Mr. Obama's other priorities for a second term -- chiefly addressing illegal immigration and gun violence -- likewise will hardly come easy, if at all.

HEADLINE: The Big Deal

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On the day President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, an exuberant Vice President Biden famously pronounced the reform a ''big something deal'' -- except that he didn't use the word ''something.'' And he was right.
In fact, I'd suggest using this phrase to describe the Obama administration as a whole. F.D.R. had his New Deal; well, Mr. Obama has his Big Deal. He hasn't delivered everything his supporters wanted, and at times the survival of his achievements seemed very much in doubt. But if progressives look at where we are as the second term begins, they'll find grounds for a lot of (qualified) satisfaction. 
Consider, in particular, three areas: health care, inequality and financial reform.
Health reform is, as Mr. Biden suggested, the centerpiece of the Big Deal. Progressives have been trying to get some form of universal health insurance since the days of Harry Truman; they've finally succeeded.
True, this wasn't the health reform many were looking for. Rather than simply providing health insurance to everyone by extending Medicare to cover the whole population, we've constructed a Rube Goldberg device of regulations and subsidies that will cost more than single-payer and have many more cracks for people to fall through.
But this was what was possible given the political reality -- the power of the insurance industry, the general reluctance of voters with good insurance to accept change. And experience with Romneycare in Massachusetts -- hey, this is a great age for irony -- shows that such a system is indeed workable, and it can provide Americans with a huge improvement in medical and financial security.
What about inequality? On that front, sad to say, the Big Deal falls very far short of the New Deal. Like F.D.R., Mr. Obama took office in a nation marked by huge disparities in income and wealth. But where the New Deal had a revolutionary impact, empowering workers and creating a middle-class society that lasted for 40 years, the Big Deal has been limited to equalizing policies at the margin.
That said, health reform will provide substantial aid to the bottom half of the income distribution, paid for largely through new taxes targeted on the top 1 percent, and the ''fiscal cliff'' deal further raises taxes on the affluent. Over all, 1-percenters will see their after-tax income fall around 6 percent; for the top tenth of a percent, the hit rises to around 9 percent. This will reverse only a fraction of the huge upward redistribution that has taken place since 1980, but it's not trivial.
Finally, there's financial reform. The Dodd-Frank reform bill is often disparaged as toothless, and it's certainly not the kind of dramatic regime change one might have hoped for after runaway bankers brought the world economy to its knees.
Still, if plutocratic rage is any indication, the reform isn't as toothless as all that. And Wall Street put its money where its mouth is. For example, hedge funds strongly favored Mr. Obama in 2008 -- but in 2012 they gave three-quarters of their money to Republicans (and lost).
All in all, then, the Big Deal has been, well, a pretty big deal. But will its achievements last?
Mr. Obama overcame the biggest threat to his legacy simply by winning re-election. But George W. Bush also won re-election, a victory widely heralded as signaling the coming of a permanent conservative majority. So will Mr. Obama's moment of glory prove equally fleeting? I don't think so.
For one thing, the Big Deal's main policy initiatives are already law. This is a contrast with Mr. Bush, who didn't try to privatize Social Security until his second term -- and it turned out that a ''khaki'' election won by posing as the nation's defender against terrorists didn't give him a mandate to dismantle a highly popular program.
And there's another contrast: the Big Deal agenda is, in fact, fairly popular -- and will become more popular once Obamacare goes into effect and people see both its real benefits and the fact that it won't send Grandma to the death panels.
Finally, progressives have the demographic and cultural wind at their backs. Right-wingers flourished for decades by exploiting racial and social divisions -- but that strategy has now turned against them as we become an increasingly diverse, socially liberal nation.
Now, none of what I've just said should be taken as grounds for progressive complacency. The plutocrats may have lost a round, but their wealth and the influence it gives them in a money-driven political system remain. Meanwhile, the deficit scolds (largely financed by those same plutocrats) are still trying to bully Mr. Obama into slashing social programs.
So the story is far from over. Still, maybe progressives -- an ever-worried group -- might want to take a brief break from anxiety and savor their real, if limited, victories.

HEADLINE: Africa Must Take Lead in Mali, France Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
PARIS -- With French officials saying confidently on Saturday that an advance by Islamist militants on Bamako, Mali's capital, had been halted, France's foreign minister told African leaders that ''our African friends need to take the lead'' in a multilateral military intervention in Mali.
The foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, spoke in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, at a summit meeting to discuss how to accelerate the involvement of West African troops in Mali, although he acknowledged that it could be weeks before they were there in force. 
''Step by step, I think it's a question from what I heard this morning of some days, some weeks,'' said Mr. Fabius, referring to the time frame when the bulk of troops from the Economic Community of West African States, the regional group known as Ecowas, would arrive.
On Sunday, Mr. Fabius told Europe 1 radio that Russia, which has previously remained on the sidelines of the conflict, had suggested helping France transport soldiers and equipment to Mali. He did not say whether France had accepted the offer.
He also said African forces would be transported in part with European and Canadian logistical support.
France intervened militarily on Jan. 11 after the Malian government said it was afraid that Islamist militants, who control the north, could continue their push south and take over Bamako with little opposition from a dispirited army.
Once the situation is more stable, France wants African troops to do most of the work to wrest the north from the Islamists, as called for under a United Nations Security Council resolution passed in December.
French officials conceded, however, that there were disputes over how African participation would be financed and about the best way to transport troops to Mali. In Paris, French officials said the United States, while willing to help ferry African troops, wanted to bill France for the use of transport aircraft, which officials said would not go down well with the French. The Pentagon favors providing rapid help with transport and even with air-to-air refueling, but the White House is more reluctant, the officials said.
But the officials said France and that the United States were sharing intelligence about Mali and the Sahel region of North Africa that was garnered from drones and other means, and that discussions with Washington continued amicably.
The African troops also need equipment and training, and Mr. Fabius pointed to a donors' meeting in Ethiopia scheduled for Jan. 29 as ''a key moment.''
The French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said Saturday that France now had 2,000 troops in Mali, with more in the region, and that France was likely to add to its forces there. He said that the Mali operation could involve at least 4,000 soldiers in the region, and French officials said they would put no fixed limit on the number of troops that might be required to restore the territorial integrity of Mali and drive back the Islamist fighters, who have ties to Al Qaeda.
The French officials emphasized that the targets of the mission were the Islamists, not the Tuaregs or other Malians fighting for more autonomy or independence in the north. They also said Islamist terrorists in Mali had made four or five efforts to carry out operations in France in the last few years.
Despite reports of French forces fighting on the ground in and around the village of Diabaly, Mr. Le Drian said that ''there has been no ground combat'' there, only airstrikes. He dismissed reports from Malian Army sources that French troops were fighting or even in the town. ''I think someone is hallucinating,'' he said. Residents have told local news agencies that the Islamists have left Diabaly, which they seized as an important way station on the road to the administrative capital, Ségou, north of Bamako.
The Associated Press reported on Sunday that it had obtained video filmed by a resident of Diabaly showing a street dotted with burned-out vehicles and scattered bullets. The town remained calm on Sunday, The A.P. said. The video showed residents inspecting vehicles and charred weaponry destroyed by French airstrikes.
In the Islamist-controlled northern town of Gao on Saturday, young residents lynched an Islamist police commissioner in retaliation for the killing of a local radio journalist earlier in the day, according to a Twitter post from the office of Mali's president, Dioncounda Traoré. The journalist had been suspected of working with foreign radio stations, Reuters reported.
French airstrikes have halted the Islamist advance toward Mopti and nearby Sévaré, French officials said, while they confirmed that the village of Konna, north of Mopti, was now back in the hands of Mali's government.
Also on Saturday, Human Rights Watch said it had received what it called credible reports of abuses being committed by Malian security forces against Tuareg and Arab civilians.

HEADLINE: The Syrian Refugee Crisis

 BODY:
More than 60,000 innocent civilians have been slaughtered in President Bashar al-Assad's desperate bid to retain power in Syria. In the two-year reign of terror, he has also forced staggering numbers of Syrians to relocate within the country or flee across the border, creating a disaster that is threatening to destabilize the region. The international community has an obligation to do more to ease the suffering. 
Some 650,000 Syrians are now registered as refugees by the United Nations or awaiting registration, an increase of almost 100,000 in the past month alone. That includes about 155,000 in Turkey, 148,000 in Lebanon, 142,000 in Jordan, 73,000 in Iraq and 14,000 in Egypt. Thousands more are not registered. The total could reach one million this year. Many Syrians have fled because of bombings by army troops, still others because of sexual violence. According to the International Rescue Committee, refugees identified rape -- including gang rapes in front of family members -- as a ''primary reason'' for fleeing.
Women and children still face sexual and other violence in the camps, and a lack of medical care and counseling to help them recover. Neighboring countries have opened borders and set up camps, clinics and schools. But the need is bigger than any host government can handle. The situation has been made worse by a harsh winter.
Complicating matters, the vast majority of refugees have settled not in camps but in towns and cities. A few have been taken in by families but most live in ''wretched conditions,'' packed in small rented rooms and dilapidated apartments, says the I.R.C. Most international aid goes to the camps.
The main task facing the international community is to assist the countries that have welcomed the refugees and now confront political and economic pressures as a result. It is in no one's interest to see these countries destabilized by this humanitarian emergency. The United Nations' refugee agency has requested $1 billion from the international community to meet the needs of refugees and $500 million more to aid Syrians inside the country. Pledges have been slow.
The United States and the 27-member European Union have been the two top donors so far, with Washington giving $210 million and the E.U. giving $477 million. The laggards have been the wealthy Persian Gulf states, which have a direct interest in regional stability but whose scattershot contributions totaling $155 million have sometimes bypassed the United Nations and other agencies seeking to coordinate the response. More is also required of Russia and China, which have enabled Mr. Assad in his brutal war but done little to help his victims.

HEADLINE: A Downsized Boston Globe Opens Its Space for Community Uses

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Among the many changes that Christopher M. Mayer wanted to make when he became publisher of The Boston Globe in 2010 was to transform a particularly unattractive section of the newsroom.
Mr. Mayer wanted to fill in what he called ''the center of the doughnut'' on the second floor -- acres of abandoned desks once occupied by more than 100 workers in the payroll, classified and advertising departments. 
Those jobs have largely disappeared in recent years from The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Company, and Mr. Mayer faces a situation familiar to many publishers around the country as their staffs shrink. While most newspapers lack cash, employees and a clear strategy for finding greater profits in the digital age, they do not lack for office space. Mr. Mayer embarked on a search for creative ways to use that space. As a result, The Globe has turned its empty offices into a public community space, bringing in start-up technology companies, bands visiting to perform for the company's Internet station RadioBDC and special events like the programming code marathon it held for technology enthusiasts. The projects occupy what looks like a re-created living room, where a colorful mix of young entrepreneurs, gray-haired journalists and bands with names like the Street Dogs and Animal Kingdom pass through. Steps away, Globe reporters and editors pore over articles.
''You don't want to underutilize an asset,'' Mr. Mayer said in an interview in his roomy office. ''I have a building here that we can use for a variety of things. Bringing bands in, bringing events here, it reminds us and folks in the community what we do.'' While it is unclear how much revenue these new ventures will bring in, he said the new relationships help energize the workplace. It also helps the readers The Globe is trying to retain feel more engaged and connected with the newspaper.
The Globe is not the only newspaper to make creative use of empty space. Newspapers have been converting their old printing plants for decades, like the former Daily News plant in Brooklyn that was turned into condominiums.
The Los Angeles Times has signed long-term leases for office space with companies like the Los Angeles City Employees' Retirement System and VXI Global Solutions, an information technology company.
The Los Angeles Times has also sought out more glamorous options. Over the last several years its has rented its offices for use in the films ''Argo,'' ''Moneyball,'' ''Frost/Nixon,'' ''Dreamgirls'' and ''The Soloist.'' Hillary Manning, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, said it was part of a strategy ''to maximize the value of our real estate assets and diversify our revenue streams to best support The Times's core journalistic mission.''
At The Globe, Mr. Mayer has followed The Los Angeles Times's example and rented some space to a production crew filming a television pilot.
Other industries also have sought ways to use empty space, especially since the recession began. Airports are trying to turn abandoned terminals into office space. The Chicago Merchandise Mart, once occupied mostly by the furniture and fabric industries, is now trying to attract more technology companies. Even churches have advertised their extra space, offering local groups a meeting place.
The Globe moved in its digital team to the unused space about 18 months ago, then invited technology companies to occupy the empty desks. On a recent morning, flocks of scruffily dressed young entrepreneurs crouched before computer screens. Above them hung outdated LED screens that used to tell workers in the classified department how many calls waited to be answered.
Jeff Moriarty, The Globe's vice president for digital products, strolled through the space and rattled off the names of the dozen start-ups that have passed through, like Supermechanical, a start-up that makes wireless sensors that connect to the Web. The Globe is also lending space to TapWalk, which builds apps for performance stages and large events like universities and music festivals.
The leasing agreements between these start-ups and The Globe are flexible; the paper generally does not charge rent but is looking for synergistic opportunities with some of the fledgling companies. ''The only cost is we're trying to find ways to work together,'' Mr. Moriarty said.
These partnerships have formed quickly. Michael Morisy, co-founder of MuckRock, which tries to help make filing Freedom of Information Act requests easier, moved his start-up into The Globe's temporary space in September 2011.
Mr. Morisy needed a mailroom to accept all of the correspondence his company was receiving. A year later, The Globe hired him to help track down public records for some of its reporting projects.
TapWalk is creating an app for The Globe's travel show in February.
Mr. Moriarty said that most projects have been worked on ''for mutual benefit with no money exchanged, other times we've paid for specific projects unique to us.''
In August, a noisier neighbor was thrown into the mix when The Globe started Radio BDC on the second floor and invited in bands to perform. Tech workers were encouraged to listen to the bands or to wear headphones during performances. Seventeen bands, including the Lumineers, California Wives and Minus the Bear, have performed there, attracting listeners from throughout the building.
On a recent morning, workers from the radio station were setting up a beer tasting in conjunction with the Publick House, a restaurant in Brookline, Mass., as employees of the tech start-ups typed feverishly a few feet away.
The space has become inviting enough that some reporters and editors have started to trickle in to sit on sofas and watch its huge television screen, reporting on events like the Golden Globes awards ceremony.
''It makes us look like a tech company,'' said Shirley Leung, the business editor, who has held meetings there. ''That space represents the modern Globe.''
Some people using The Globe's incubator space expressed mixed feelings. John Kestner, who worked temporarily for Supermechanical, called the space ''a bit musty and dark for our taste.'' But he said it was preferable to working at home and gave him a chance to network and socialize.
Last fall, ABC Family shot a pilot called ''Terminales'' about a young reporter who writes for the fictitious Boston Post. Meredith Goldstein, an entertainment reporter for The Globe, covered the filming. As she showed off the prop elevator that the production company built in the newsroom, she said she could see the benefits of having a television crew fill out The Globe's empty corners, creating a Hollywood version of what a newsroom should be.
''Everything got nicer,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Pursuing Ambitious Global Goals, but With a More Modest Strategy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Not quite nine months into his presidency, Barack Obama woke to the news that he had won the Nobel Peace Prize -- not for anything yet accomplished, but for the promise that he would end the Iraq war, win the ''war of necessity'' in Afghanistan, move toward the elimination of nuclear weapons, tackle climate change and engage America's adversaries.
Yet beyond Iraq, his first-term accomplishments from that list are sparse. In a fractured world, President Obama struggled to define a grand strategy for America's role, apart from preserving its pre-eminence while relying increasingly on a changing cast of partners.
As Mr. Obama begins his second term, aides and confidants say he is acutely aware that his ambitious agenda to restore America's influence and image in the world stalled almost as soon as the prize was awarded. But the president has indicated that he plans to return to his original agenda, though he has hinted it may be in a different, less overtly ambitious way. 
Bitter experience -- from getting the most modest arms control agreement through the Senate his first year, trying and failing to engage leaders in Iran and North Korea, discovering his lack of leverage over Egypt, Pakistan and Israel, and finding Afghanistan to be a costly waste of American lives and resources -- is driving him to a strategy reminiscent of one of his Republican predecessors, President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
It is a strategy in which Mr. Obama will try to redirect world events subtly, rather than turning to big treaties, big military interventions and big aid packages.
''The appeal of the Eisenhower approach is that it had a big element of turning inward, of looking to rebuilding strength at home, of conserving American power,'' said one of Mr. Obama's senior national security advisers, who would not agree to be quoted by name. ''But there's also the reality that some of the initiatives that seemed so hopeful four years ago -- whether it's driving down the number of nuclear weapons or helping Afghanistan remake itself -- look so much harder now.''
Whether this approach can work is very much an open question. His early forays into covert action and lightning-quick strikes -- like the fast war in Libya or the cyberwar against Iran -- have set back adversaries, but the satisfactions of striking with a ''light footprint'' have usually been temporary at best.
His promises of transformative change are now viewed around the world with more suspicion. There was the student in Cairo who cornered a reporter a year ago and demanded to know why the prison at Guantánamo Bay was still open, and the European foreign minister who, at a diplomatic dinner in Washington, asked whether ''the pivot to Asia is another phrase for ignoring the rest of the world.''
Mr. Obama's questions during Situation Room sessions, some of his current and former aides say, seem to reflect a concern that his first term was spent putting out fires, rather than building lasting institutions.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt and President Harry S. Truman solidified America's post-World War II role by helping create the United Nations, the international financial institutions and the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe; President John F. Kennedy emerged from the Cuban Missile Crisis with treaties limiting the spread of nuclear weapons; the first President George Bush lured new allies from the ruins of the Soviet Union.
By comparison, Mr. Obama's biggest accomplishments have been largely defensive: a full withdrawal from Iraq and devastating strikes against the core leadership of Al Qaeda. (When President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan visited the White House last week, he was presented a scorecard: of the ''20 most wanted'' Qaeda leaders when Mr. Obama was first inaugurated, 13 were dead, along with many of their successors.)
The president's national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, has argued in speeches since Mr. Obama's re-election that in the first term the president built a broader alliance against Iran than any of his predecessors; that is true, but so far it has not moved the Iranians to limit their nuclear drive.
The United States has variously offered to increase aid to Egypt or restrict it if the country heads off on an illiberal path. So far neither approach has given Mr. Obama leverage in influencing the new government led by the Muslim Brotherhood. A promising start in building an economic and political partnership with China has devolved into an argument over whether the United States is seeking to contain China's ambitions.
''He wants to be something more than a pure manager for the next four years,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, a longtime diplomat who was one of the White House architects of the ''rebalancing'' toward Asia. He added that Mr. Obama ''understands that being a transformative president on a global stage is about more than good intentions and good plans. It's about finding places where you are not dependent on adversaries who refuse to budge, or who benefit from demonstrating their hostility to the U.S.''
If there is a big strategic bet in Mr. Obama's second term, it may be that Asia is that place. The huge, unexpected burst in oil and gas production in the United States has bolstered Mr. Obama's conviction that the United States has an opportunity to extract itself from an overdependence on events in the Middle East. In Asia, he has found a region more welcoming to American influence, largely because a greater American presence -- meaning more naval ships and more investment -- can quietly counterbalance China's rising power.
Mr. Obama's focus on Asia has reinforced his interest in the Eisenhower era. After the Korean War, Americans simply wanted to bring the troops home and focus on growth. Eisenhower had publicly committed to both balancing the budget and containing growing threats around the world, while in secret he began a broad rethinking of American national security called Project Solarium.
Just as Mr. Obama has privately worried about being manipulated by generals who were trying to lengthen the American involvement in Afghanistan, Eisenhower left office warning of the ''military-industrial complex'' that he feared would dominate American decision making.
At the same time, those who work with Mr. Obama, and parse his questions in Situation Room debates over the ability of the United States to influence events in places like Syria or Mali or North Korea, say they sense in him a greater awareness than he had four years ago of the limits of American influence.
He asks more detailed questions about how sending 100 troops, or 10,000, might influence long-term outcomes. Paraphrasing the president, one aide said he is more likely to ask, ''So if we put troops into Syria to stabilize the chemical weapons, what can they accomplish in a year that they couldn't accomplish in a week?''
That is a product of Mr. Obama's bitter experience in 2009, when he yielded to advice from the military to send a surge of tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. He regretted it almost instantly. The move to an ''Afghan good enough'' strategy followed, with minimal goals and a quicker withdrawal of troops. Ever since, he has been hesitant to use traditional power in traditional ways.
''He has got to find the happy medium between not committing us to a decade-long ground war and choosing not to do anything,'' said Anne-Marie Slaughter, who was the head of the State Department's policy planning operation for Mr. Obama's first two years in office and has urged him to intervene more strongly in humanitarian disasters.
Mr. Obama's caution has incurred a cost. To much of the world, his presidency thus far looks unlike what they expected. He promised ''direct engagement'' with longtime adversaries, including Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea and Venezuela. He is one for five: only the generals running Myanmar responded to his letters, economic incentives and offers of a new relationship.
In what Mr. Obama once called the ''war of necessity,'' in Afghanistan, the complaint heard more often is that Mr. Obama has abandoned any pretense of accomplishment in favor of accelerating the withdrawal.
''The situation is obviously not very confidence-inspiring,'' Hina Rabbani Khar, Pakistan's foreign minister, said in an interview last week. ''A responsible transition means that you have achieved your objectives and then you leave. It's not 'We leave in January.' It's 'We leave when the objectives are achieved.' ''
And what of the grand initiatives?
A proposal for a very large reduction in deployed nuclear weapons has been in the hands of the White House for months, but the president has not acted on it. Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. promised a new push to win passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was defeated during the Clinton administration. They have never submitted it to the Senate.
''We were assured by President Obama when he was elected that the U.S. would ratify this C.T.B.T.,'' Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, said on Friday. ''But somehow, it has not happened.''
Given the composition of the Senate, it is not likely to happen in a second term, either. So Mr. Obama, his aides say, will have to find another way; like Eisenhower, he will have to redirect American policy quietly, from the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: In New Pubs, Good Cheer And Good Works

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Ask a bartender exactly how much profit was collected from that pint of beer you just drank, and the answer is likely to be as murky as a barrel-aged bourbon stout. The economics of alcohol, like the calorie count, are usually about the last things purveyors want their customers focused on.
But now a new generation of beer halls dedicated to something beyond the cash register is cropping up around the nation and the world, with proceeds going not into an owner's wallet but to charity, and bending elbows may never be the same. 
''More people will want to support your business than if you're just doing it to pay for your second home,'' said Ryan Saari, a minister and a board member of the Oregon Public House, which is preparing to open here as soon as next month in a residential neighborhood, pledged by its charter to donating all profits to charity.
The place already has a slogan outside on the century-old red brick facade, ''Have a pint, change the world,'' and a painting on the back wall of St. Nicholas, the patron saint of giving.
The beer-for-charity movement, like the microbrew phenomenon that preceded it, is different depending on where you look. In Houston, for example, where a group of giving-minded bar owners opened a place called the Okra Charity Saloon last month, patrons get a vote with every drink as to which charity should receive the next month's profits. A project in Melbourne, Australia, plans to put geography into the equation -- sale of a beer from Africa, for example, will be linked to microloans or charities in the country of the beer's origin.
Other projects are in some stage of development, in cities from Hyderabad, India, to San Francisco.
People who track philanthropic trends said the number of upstarts going full tilt toward a charity-driven business model, especially in the viciously competitive food and beverage industry, remained small. But in the post-recession landscape, they say, a ferment of experimentation is clearly in the air, as many private charities continue to struggle for funds.
Giving by individual Americans, while up from the nadir reached in 2009 during the recession, was still lower in 2011 than in 2000, according to the most recent figures from Giving USA.
''It's a clever idea and certainly a noble ambition,'' said Patrick Rooney, the associate dean at Indiana University's School of Philanthropy, referring to the charity pub concept. His advice for drinkers? Ask questions like an accountant, about a place's overhead and expenses, and who actually receives the money. ''Frankly, there are some charities I would support and some I would not,'' he said.
Mr. Saari at the Oregon Public House agreed that success or failure would hinge on the transparency of the economics. If customers suspect, even for a moment, that what smells like good works is really just a clever business model to attract customers, the effort is doomed, he said.
''In our cynical society, people will immediately say, 'O.K., how much is the president making?' '' he said. So the pub's books will be open for the checking, he said, and customers will be able to choose from a menu on the wall exactly where they want their contribution to go as part of the order itself. About a dollar on a locally brewed draft costing $4.50 to $5 a pint is profit, as it turns out.
The Public House's charter prohibits any member of the board, including Mr. Saari, from drawing a salary, he said, though it will have a paid staff for the bar and kitchen of perhaps seven or eight. Through grants from the city and private donations -- about 30 people have given between $1,500 to $2,500, support levels that come with a free beer a day, or a week, for life, and their own mug -- the bar will also open with no loans or capital to pay back, Mr. Saari said.
In Washington, D.C., supporters of Cause, which calls itself a ''philanthropub,'' in the trendy U Street Corridor, said their business model is based on research that says young people give less to charity than their elders -- busy with careers and maybe burdened by college debt -- but are still willing to chip in under the right circumstances.
''Everything is competing for their attention, and this is another way for people to combine charitable giving with something they're doing anyway,'' said Raj Ratwani, a cognitive psychologist and a founder of Cause, which opened last fall, describing the young professional the bar is aiming for. ''They're going to find time to go out and drink no matter how busy they are.''
Here in Portland, which prides itself on its variety of local brews and a culture of social consciousness, the Oregon Public House -- which Mr. Saari believes was a speakeasy in Prohibition days based on the latched peepholes on some of the upstairs doors -- is expected to be the first local bar departing from the traditional commercial form, but not the last.
Another group here is considering opening a worker-run, collectively managed brew pub for ''people who resist patriarchy and oppression on all levels, unrepresented and unwaged workers,'' and ''people who face and are against police brutality,'' said Stephanie Phillips, one of the organizers, in an e-mail.
The city's economic development arm, the Portland Development Commission, which also works with traditional companies like Nike, has backed the Oregon Public House with more than $50,000 in grants, about a quarter of the start-up costs. Stephen Green, a business analyst with the commission and an adviser to the bar, said he fantasizes about a national chain of public houses based on the Oregon model that raises money for local charities.
Mr. Saari said his next step, once the bar is open, is an in-house brewery. Eventually, he hopes to see bottled Oregon Public House beers in local stores, with each type of beer dedicated to a specific cause, so that someone buying a six-pack of say, Oregon Public House Education Ale, a tentative name and product, would know the proceeds were going to an education charity supported by the pub.
But as so many failed entrepreneurs can attest, operating a small food and drink business has never been an easy road to riches -- or now, donations. ''The failure rate is about as high as any business you could start,'' said Daniel Borochoff, the president of Charitywatch, a nonprofit watchdog and information service in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Oath, Beginning 2nd Term: Among Blacks, Pride Is Mixed With Expectations for Obama

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Reporting was contributed by Malia Wollan from Oakland, Calif.; Dan Frosch from Denver; Kim Severson and Robbie Brown from Atlanta; Ian Lovett from Los Angeles; and Karen Ann Culotta from Chicago.

 BODY:
The Rev. Greggory L. Brown, a 59-year-old pastor of a small Lutheran church, committed himself to ministry and a life pursuing social justice on April 4, 1968 -- the day the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was slain by an assassin's bullet.
And four years ago, like so many African-Americans around the country, he saw Barack Obama's rise to the presidency as nothing short of a shocking validation of Dr. King's vision of a more perfect union, where the content of character trumps the color of skin. ''I was so excited when he was giving that first inauguration speech,'' said Mr. Brown, of Oakland, Calif. ''I could feel it in my bones.''
On Monday, when President Obama places his hand on Dr. King's personal Bible to take a second, ceremonial oath of office, he will be symbolically linking himself to the civil rights hero. But Mr. Brown, along with other African-Americans interviewed recently, said their excitement would be laced with a new expectation, that Mr. Obama move to the forefront of his agenda the issues that Dr. King championed: civil rights and racial and economic equality. 
In interviews with experts and black leaders, some, like Mr. Brown, say they have been disappointed by the slow pace of change for African-Americans, whose children, for instance, are still more likely to live in poverty than those of any other race.
''The hope for Obama's presidency was that there would be more help for places like Oakland and other urban areas that need support, safety and jobs,'' Mr. Brown said. ''He made people feel like anything is possible.''
African-Americans remain overwhelmingly supportive of the president, as evidenced by their enthusiastic turnout on Election Day and for the inauguration festivities and Monday's holiday celebrating Dr. King's birthday. Thousands of black Americans have descended on Washington from across the nation for the many parties and observances and visits to the King memorial.
They have developed a protective stance toward Mr. Obama, acknowledging the limits of his power and the voraciousness of his critics. Many cite the power of representation, the visual message of a prosperous, cohesive black family being beamed around the country and the world, and the untold aspirations that vision inspires.
But African-Americans roundly reject the notion that Mr. Obama's election has eased racial tensions or delivered the nation to a new post-racial reality.
''I think the great mass of black people have shown tremendous patience, discipline and understanding, recognizing the dilemma that he faces,'' said Randall L. Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of ''The Persistence of the Color Line: Racial Politics and the Obama Presidency.''
Still, Professor Kennedy said Mr. Obama had been ''somewhat diffident'' about issues that would be of special significance to African-Americans, like the disproportionate number of blacks in prison or urban poverty. Blacks understand, he added, that that perceived hesitation ''was probably a virtual requirement'' for him to be elected in the first place.
''Everyone agrees that you wish more was done the first term,'' said Debra Lee, the chief executive of Black Entertainment Television. ''But you look at politics and realize that the president can't wave a wand and get things done by himself.''
''That's one of the things we learned in the first term,'' she added. ''This is important and symbolic, but it's not the end-all.''
As much as many people may have hoped that the impact of race would decline over time, one of the larger surveys on the issue, a poll by The Associated Press released in October, showed that racial attitudes had not improved in the four years since Mr. Obama took office.
It also suggested that prejudice had slightly increased. In a survey by the Pew Research Center conducted in April, a majority of Americans, some 61 percent, disagreed with the statement ''Discrimination against blacks is rare today.''
Charlene Flynn, a dental assistant in Denver, said she had not noticed any meaningful change in race relations in her own life, but felt that there was a common understanding within the black community that Mr. Obama faced racism on the job. She said she strongly believed that Congress had been defiant toward the president, largely because he is black.
''I really think a lot of it has to do with his race, to tell the truth,'' said Ms. Flynn, 51.
Mr. Brown, the pastor in Oakland, agreed. Each week, he prays aloud for the president. ''I believe in my heart he wants to make a difference,'' he said. ''But every time he tries, people put up a big rock wall.''
Others are not so understanding, finding Mr. Obama too cautious on the subject of race.
The activist and academic Cornel West says he is outraged that Mr. Obama would use Dr. King's personal Bible at the inauguration without endorsing Dr. King's ''black freedom struggle.''
''Martin went to jail talking about carpet bombing in Vietnam and trying to organize poor people, fighting for civil liberties,'' Mr. West said. The president, he said, ''has a compromising kind of temperament.''
But others in the civil rights movement say the president has a broader role.
''I told this president early on that I'll be the head of the N.A.A.C.P., he can be head of the country,'' said Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the civil rights organization.
He and others credit Mr. Obama's cool temperament.
''Obama very effectively used positive messages to bring the racial and ethnic groups together, not divide them,'' said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist and the author of ''More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City.''
''In terms of race and ethnic relations,'' Dr. Wilson said, ''he is the right president during these hard economic times because social tensions are indeed high.''
He said that one need only look back to the death of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager who was shot last year by a Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., to see the potential volatility of any presidential statement about race, even one where the president asked for ''soul-searching.''
When Mr. Obama tenderly lamented, ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,'' he was attacked by critics like the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh for using the teenager's death as a ''political opportunity.''
Blaine Sergew, 43, an immigrant from Ethiopia who lives in Atlanta, said she felt disappointed that ''the little things'' the president said got blown out of proportion. ''It was a very true statement, but the immaturity of the conversation about race in this country wouldn't allow that to stand as a simple, true statement,'' she said.
As valuable as any presidential statement, Ms. Sergew added, was the effect of Mr. Obama's election in 2008. Cradling her toddler son on Election Day then, ''I so distinctly remember holding him and just weeping at the possibility that my son could grow up to just assume this is normal,'' she said. ''Seeing images of an African-American family that is so dedicated to its members and so full of love and respect is significant for many black families. It's like Black Camelot.''
Still, aspirations are one thing. In Mr. Obama's second term, more African-Americans will be looking for action.
''I think there is overwhelming joy and pride that Barack Obama has been re-elected, but every community wishes for more,'' said Roslyn M. Brock, the chairwoman of the board of the N.A.A.C.P. ''I am hopeful and prayerful that in his second term, he will get to the social issues that continue to plague us, and leave his legacy, his mark, on them.''

HEADLINE: North Brooklyn Start-Ups Find Office Space Is Scarce

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
At Secret Clubhouse, a communal working space near Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, the co-founders of the digital marketing company Small Girls PR never have to worry about paying the electric bill. They did not have to buy the long white desks they share with other young entrepreneurs. If they want coffee, the machine downstairs is always stocked. And there is always someone else to talk to.
For the founders, Mallory Blair, 24, and Bianca Caampued, 28, working at Secret Clubhouse -- one of several communal, or ''co-working,'' spaces that house the budding technology and new media community in north Brooklyn -- has freed them to expand their business. But with four part-time employees and more on the way, they are starting to think about finding a space of their own. 
''We want to stay in this area for sure,'' said Ms. Blair, who like Ms. Caampued also lives in the neighborhood. ''We could be anywhere, but we choose to be in Brooklyn because that's where everything's happening.''
They may find the search for a bigger office rough going. Though there are plenty of start-ups that favor Williamsburg and Greenpoint, developers, local officials and real estate brokers say there is a dearth of office space. Most landlords, lured by the promise of building lucrative apartments in the increasingly popular residential area, are reluctant to devote space to commercial tenants who can pay little and might wither as quickly as they bloom.
For some longtime residents and younger champions of north Brooklyn, the shortage raises the specter of a creative, economically diverse neighborhood turning into just another bedroom community. Will entrepreneurs follow the lead of Kickstarter, which is renovating an old factory in Greenpoint to serve as its long-term headquarters, or will the area's booming residential market squeeze out everything but wealthy commuters?
''Ultimately, it's another 100,000 people on the Bedford L train, and are these people contributing to the culture and community of Williamsburg in a way that a start-up like Kickstarter will contribute to the culture and community of the neighborhood?'' asked Andy Smith, the events and curriculum coordinator at the Yard, a co-working space on the border of Greenpoint and Williamsburg. ''It's a really interesting time. I see it leaning one way, and I get a little worried.''
Although many buildings have retail space on the first floor, upper-floor offices are hard to come by, according to several people who have recently looked; one broker, Drew Conner of the commercial real estate company Cushman & Wakefield, said he had had three start-up clients turn to Dumbo or Lower Manhattan in the past year.
There is space, of course. But not much of it meets the needs of fast-changing start-ups, which typically cannot afford to outfit raw industrial rooms with wiring, lighting and carpeting, and require flexible leases and reliable Internet and telephone service.
Filling that gap, for now, are communal offices. Rick Webb, the proprietor of Secret Clubhouse, opened the space last summer after hearing from several friends and acquaintances that they needed desks. He and a broker scoured the neighborhood for four months, finally locating a storefront that landlords were not looking to fill with a bar or a restaurant.
Politicians have begun to take note. Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a Democrat from Brooklyn, is trying to attract support for a bill that would establish a creative economic zone in north Brooklyn, with incentives for mixed-use developments and a mentorship program for young entrepreneurs.
The idea was hatched after Mr. Lentol's office interviewed young business owners involved in music, film production, technology and media, who said they wanted to be able to both live and work in the neighborhood.
''Our goal is to stimulate a live-work, idea-driven economy in north Brooklyn,'' Mr. Lentol said.
That idea has also found a champion in William Harvey, an artist and designer who moved to Greenpoint in the mid-1980s. ''There's the presumption, 'Oh, Williamsburg, that's where all the cool stuff is going to happen,' and it should be,'' he said. ''But if we just look forward in terms of how things will be built, it'll be very difficult to have a sustainable new economy here.''
Part of the problem is zoning: though parts of Williamsburg and Greenpoint are zoned for mixed commercial and residential use, the zoning tilts residential. The bigger issue is supply, or as developers might see it, demand.
''The retail market's been incredibly strong, the residential market's been incredibly strong, so unless the site is restricted from doing residential, it's not a good economic deal to build an office building,'' said Jeremiah Kane, a senior adviser to Rubenstein Partners, a commercial real estate investment firm, who said he saw enough companies looking for space in the area to make it a priority for the firm.
He said it was not uncommon for the owners of old factories or warehouses -- the kind of industrial building every developer wants -- to refuse to sell because they are holding out for their properties to be rezoned for residential use.
''For a lot of tech start-ups, so much of it is about recruiting the right people,'' he said, ''and as those right people live over in Brooklyn or live over in Williamsburg, being close to them is a real advantage.''At last count, 87 percent of the tenants of the Yard -- a sleek co-working space overlooking McCarren Park -- lived within a mile of the office.
''The companies that are in Williamsburg are cool -- a lot of the ones I know hug the intersection of art and music and technology,'' said Cody Brown, 24, who helped create scroll kit, an application that allows those with no coding skills to create Web sites, in a Bushwick apartment where he and his co-founder, Kate Ray, still live. With a round of financing under their belt, Mr. Brown and Ms. Ray, 25, decided they had outgrown their living room. Finding nothing suitable in Williamsburg, their first choice, they landed in a co-working space in SoHo. They said they hoped to come back to Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: An Overture From China Is Yet to Win Hollywood

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY. 
David Carr, whose Media Equation column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- In September, Wang Jianlin, the chairman and president of China's Dalian Wanda Group, told a news conference here of his plans to invest at least $10 billion in both entertainment and commercial properties in the United States.
To judge from the pace of the deal-making so far, it may take a while. 
Wanda has been talking with some studios, as Mr. Wang promised when Wanda completed its $2.6 billion acquisition of AMC Entertainment with a flashy presentation in early September. But any progress has come in halting steps, according to people briefed on the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with the principals.
And that probably carries an overall message about the film industry's current rush to do business in China: The promise is great, but much is still being lost in translation.
''Hollywood would prefer to accept what they commonly call 'dumb money' and not give very much back in return,'' said Stanley Rosen, a University of Southern California political science professor who has written extensively about China. ''China is now pushing back.''
Both sides are likely to continue pressing their efforts; Hollywood is eager to have a partner that can help it tap into China's fast-growing film market, and Wanda wants to strengthen its foothold in the lucrative North American market. But the slow going underscores the disconnect inherent in negotiations between parties whose goals reflect their own, more narrow interests.
Wanda is looking to be involved in potentially lucrative Hollywood projects. But big studios are extremely wary of sharing the pie with partners who do not want to settle for less than the very best the studios have to offer.
At 20th Century Fox, where Mr. Wang paid a call in late summer, the studio was quickly reported in The Los Angeles Times to be completing a deal under which it would co-produce films with Wanda in China.
Five months later, according to one person briefed on the dealings, the discussions continue over the possible coproduction of some Chinese language projects, and the relationship is cordial. But there is, so far, no Fox-Wanda pact, partly because Wanda would prefer to get involved with some mainstream Hollywood productions, and Fox has not been ready to discuss that.
A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on any dealings with Wanda. And Wanda representatives did not respond to queries that were relayed through Fleishman-Hillard, an American-based public relations firm that has represented the Chinese company in the past.
At Sony Pictures Entertainment, another stop on Mr. Wang's summer itinerary, talks have centered on the possibility that Wanda would provide financing of $300 million to $600 million for a slate of Hollywood films, according to people who were briefed on the talks.
One of those people said a deal appeared close. But another said it has been hung up over financial terms -- Sony is said to be demanding a higher fee as the distributor of the films than Wanda, which would be paying for them, would like. There are also questions about what movies would be included. Sony would prefer to exclude its valuable sequels and prequels to movies like the Spider-Man series, for instance; Wanda would prefer to see everything on the table.
A spokesman for Sony declined to comment, adding that the studio generally does not discuss its financing.
One clear step taken since Mr. Wang's trip has been in a reverse direction.
A few months after Wanda's acquisition of AMC Entertainment was completed, according to a December report in the Santa Monica Daily Press, the theater company informed the city of Santa Monica that it was terminating talks -- which had been going on for more than three years -- about plans to build a new entertainment complex near a central promenade, where AMC operates three smaller, and aging, theaters.
Santa Monica officials had viewed the new complex, which was to cost about $33 million, as a centerpiece in the renewal of its downtown. That area will soon be served by a new rail line connecting it with Culver City and downtown Los Angeles.
But the city, which is known for its elaborate development agreements and close attention to things like public art and spaces, was notified, shortly after completing an environmental impact report, that AMC and its team had decided the project was not cost-effective.
Sun Dee Larson, a spokeswoman for AMC Entertainment, now a Wanda unit, said in an e-mail last week that she was traveling in China and could not immediately discuss the Santa Monica project. Ms. Larson also said she could not provide a Wanda contact who might discuss the film financing talks.
But Jason Harris, Santa Monica's economic development manager, said city officials had thought the project, which had been slowed while AMC negotiated its own sale to Wanda, would benefit from new capital that came with the new owner. Instead, he said, it bogged down, partly over the theater company's reluctance to commit to amenities like reserved seating.
Now, however, other potential theater developers are taking a look. ''You wouldn't believe the level of interest,'' said Mr. Harris.

HEADLINE: Four Years Later, Checking In With Those He Sought to Help

BYLINE: By EMMARIE HUETTEMAN, ASHLEY SOUTHALL and JADA F. SMITH; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
During his first year in office, President Obama highlighted his initiatives by talking about the troubles of everyday Americans whose lives he wanted to change for the better. As he begins his second term, some of the faces of the president's policies share a glimpse of their lives four years later and their hopes for his second term.
ED NEUFELDT of Elkhart, Ind.
Even though he admits to voting for the other guy -- twice -- Ed Neufeldt will not deny that his town is better off than it was four years ago. 
''We had a bunch of empty buildings all over town, but they're filled up again,'' he said. ''Most of my friends are back to work.''
Much has changed since Mr. Neufeldt introduced Mr. Obama before a speech in August 2009 at Monaco Coach, a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid him off after 32 years. Once called ''the R.V. capital of the world,'' Elkhart was experiencing the highest unemployment rate in the country after sales began to plummet throughout the automotive industry.
Though he was offered his job back, Mr. Neufeldt instead was hired by a company to speak to businesses about green energy and biofuels.
''They thought we'd be the electric car capital of the world,'' he said.
The company is now gone, and with it his spokesman job. He now delivers bread and cleans office buildings part time. But part time, he says, is better than no time.
-- Jada F. Smith
PAUL MONTI of Raynham, Mass.
Less than three months after Sgt. First Class Jared C. Monti received the Medal of Honor for the courage he demonstrated during the firefight in Afghanistan that took his life, Mr. Obama announced his plan to send an additional 30,000 troops there as part of the surge. For Sergeant Monti's father, Paul, there was no question that it was the right thing to do.
But the mission in Afghanistan has changed, Mr. Monti said. He supports Mr. Obama's decision to draw down United States forces over the next two years.
''We've lost enough,'' he said.
When asked about his hopes for the president's second term, Mr. Monti grew quiet for a moment. He expressed deep frustration with Congress, which is so gridlocked, he said, that some legislation does not even make it to a vote.
''That just sticks really badly with me, because that's what my son died for,'' he said. ''He died for this type of government we have.''
-- Emmarie Huetteman
RILEEN SECREST of Martinsville, Va.
When Mr. Obama took the first step toward expanding health care coverage by reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program in February 2009, Gregory Secrest of Martinsville, Va., was there with his sons, who benefited from the program after he lost his job.
''Neither one of us had health insurance, but we had to be sure the kids were taken care of,'' said Rileen Secrest, his wife.
Three years later, Mr. Secrest, 43, died of a heart attack. He was employed again but still uninsured.
Mr. Secrest, whose county had the highest unemployment rate in Virginia, earned a business degree from a community college in 2011 and found a job as an assistant manager at a restaurant. Although Ms. Secrest thought her husband was healthy, they worried about what could happen without health insurance, she said.
Ms. Secrest said that her husband's older son joined the Marines, which offers insurance, and that she thought his younger son was still covered by CHIP. But she is still uninsured, and she worries about health care and unemployment.
-- Emmarie Huetteman
RICHARD MULBROOK of Newton, Iowa
With the specter of empty Maytag factories still lingering, the town of Newton, Iowa, welcomed Mr. Obama with cautious hope in April 2009. Trinity Structural Towers, which builds parts for wind turbines, had moved in and started hiring. Richard Mulbrook, who had worked for Maytag and had been hired by Trinity, introduced the president for a speech about energy policy.
Like others in the renewable energy business, Trinity benefited from government support. Mr. Mulbrook, who now works for another company after two years at Trinity, said it felt as if the subsidies helped.
But Trinity hired only a fraction of the former Maytag work force and, like the rest of the wind industry, faces an uncertain market. Mr. Mulbrook said the town had not fully recovered, with many houses still on the market and people commuting to jobs outside Newton. But he said he remained hopeful that Mr. Obama could repair the damage.
''It's just going to take time to get the economy back going, but I'm pretty sure he can do it,'' he said.
-- Emmarie Huetteman
MAXINE GIVEN of Baltimore
The White House invited Maxine Given to meet Mr. Obama in October 2009 after she sued M&T Bank over its overdraft policy.
Mrs. Given was overdrawn twice in 18 months and paid $370 in overdraft fees. A visit to the local branch resulted in the reversal of some of the fees, but Mrs. Given said the situation left her flustered.
Her lawsuit, which is now part of a larger class action, said she could have avoided the fees if the bank had processed her transactions in the order they were made, instead of from largest to smallest -- a common industry practice at the time that critics derided as a scheme to trigger more fees.
Mrs. Given said she supported the consumer protections enacted under Mr. Obama and would like to see him do more on behalf of ''regular Americans.''
''They're really necessary,'' she said of the protections, ''because you have to give people knowledge about the financial agreements they're getting into and a voice against big financial institutions.''
-- Ashley Southall
SUSAN CHAPMAN of Staten Island, N.Y.
Susan Chapman was struggling to undo a bad mortgage in October 2009 when she met Mr. Obama, who at the time was calling for the creation of an agency to protect consumers from predatory financial practices. She had been trying to get a loan modification for two years but was turned down for the third time two days earlier.
Hours after Ms. Chapman met with the president, she was approved for a trial modification.
''I absolutely believe it was because of the president that I was able to keep my house,'' she said.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was formed in 2011. But to Ms. Chapman's chagrin, the Senate has not confirmed its director because Republicans say the agency encroaches on the free market.
''We have free enterprise here, but at some point, you have to look out for the people,'' she said.
-- Ashley Southall
JOE INCARNATO of Landover, Md.
Joe Incarnato introduced Mr. Obama in October 2009 before a speech on small business initiatives, having bought half of the building that houses his company with the help of a small-business loan.
Mr. Incarnato's records storage company, Metropolitan Archives, was one that Mr. Obama said would benefit if the Small Business Administration could lend more than $2 million to businesses under its 504 loan program. It provides loans to small companies to buy assets for expansion or modernization.
Since Congress approved expanding the lending authority for the 504 program to $5.5 million, Mr. Incarnato is considering an S.B.A. loan to finance the purchase of the rest of the space.
''We're fortunate enough that our business is continuing to grow, so we're in a position where we can utilize more space,'' he said.
Mr. Incarnato said he hoped the persistent gridlock gripping the Capitol would come to end.
''There's a lot of indicators that say the economy is turning in the right direction,'' he said. ''Why can't these guys get together and try to move the country forward?''
-- Ashley Southall
CHRISTINE LARDNER of Albuquerque
When Christine Lardner became fed up with Chase Bank's refusal to reverse a fee and an interest rate increase triggered by a mistaken charge that put her credit card balance over the limit, she expressed her frustration in an e-mail to Mr. Obama.
She introduced Mr. Obama when he went to her hometown in May 2009 to promote the Credit Card Act, which included a bill of rights for credit card users, and she sat with Michelle Obama at the State of the Union address in 2010.
After Mrs. Lardner appeared with Mr. Obama, the bank reversed the fee and returned her interest rate to 6.5 percent from 21 percent. It had jumped after her daughter's school accidentally charged a tuition payment to her credit card.
Mrs. Lardner said she hoped the economy would continue to improve in Mr. Obama's second term.
''I just look at the number of people without jobs and really hope that there's some kind of recovery there,'' she said.
-- Ashley Southall
DR. MONA MANGAT of St. Petersburg, Fla.
When Dr. Mona Mangat traveled the country with Doctors for America promoting Mr. Obama's health care plan, ''I would get booed and jeered and made fun of,'' she said. ''Now, I did a health care panel for what doctors see coming down the pipeline, and not one person had anything negative to say.''
Her advocacy caught the attention of the White House in October 2009, when she was invited to stand with Mr. Obama as he pressed for solidarity between his administration and health care professionals on the bill's proposals.
Even though she is excited about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Dr. Mangat has seen the political process up close now and knows that the fight is far from over. The next step in Florida is setting up an insurance exchange under a Republican governor.
''Actually we're very insistent that our state not create an exchange, because they have been dragging their feet for several years now,'' she said. Instead, she wants the federal government to run the state's health insurance market.
-- Jada F. Smith
NATHAN WILKES of Englewood, Colo.
After Nathan Wilkes's son, Thomas, was born with hemophilia, his health care expenses quickly reached the insurance policy's $1 million cap, leaving Thomas virtually uninsured and Mr. Wilkes on the hook for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. The cost for Thomas's care became so exorbitant that a social worker recommended that Mr. Wilkes and his wife divorce so she could qualify for Medicaid.
Mr. Wilkes shared his story while introducing Mr. Obama at an event in Grand Junction, Colo., in August 2009. Though struggles with insurance companies have barely subsided since the passage of the health care law, Mr. Wilkes said it had been crucial in the battle for Thomas's health coverage, especially with the elimination of lifetime caps on benefits.
''His standard care is usually closer to a million a year and will never change, so that was huge for us,'' he said.
Mr. Wilkes was appointed to the Colorado Health Benefit Exchange Board in 2011. The board hopes to run pilot programs this summer and begin the early enrollment process by October.

HEADLINE: A Young Publisher Takes Marx Into the Mainstream

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
When Bhaskar Sunkara was growing up in Westchester County, he likes to say, he dreamed of being a professional basketball player.
But the height gods, among others, didn't smile in his favor. So in 2009, during a medical leave from his sophomore year at George Washington University, Mr. Sunkara turned to Plan B: creating a magazine dedicated to bringing jargon-free neo-Marxist thinking to the masses.
If that hardly seems less of a long shot at fame, let alone fortune, he's the first to agree.
''I had no right to start a print publication when I was 21,'' he said in an interview in a cafe near his apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. ''Looking back, I see it as a moment of creative ignorance. You have to have enough intelligence to execute something like this but be stupid enough to think it could be successful.'' 
The resulting magazine, Jacobin, whose ninth issue just landed, has certainly been an improbable hit, buoyed by the radical stirrings of the Occupy movement and a bitingly satirical but serious-minded style. Since its debut in September 2010 it has attracted nearly 2,000 print and digital subscribers, some 250,000 Web hits a month, regular name-checks from prominent bloggers, and book deals from two New York publishers.
It has also earned Mr. Sunkara, now a ripe 23, extravagant praise from members of a (slightly) older guard who see his success as heartening sign that the socialist ''brand'' -- to use a word he throws around with un-self-conscious ease -- hasn't been totally killed off by Tea Party invective.
''Bhaskar's a really remarkable -- I want to say kid, but that sounds condescending,'' said the MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who gave Jacobin a shout-out in Rolling Stone last June before inviting Mr. Sunkara onto his show. (Mr. Sunkara skipped part of his college graduation to appear.) ''He's got the combination of boastful assurance and competence of a very good young rapper.''
And the praise doesn't come only from the left-hand side of the spectrum. The National Review blogger Reihan Salam, who has linked to numerous Jacobin articles, called Mr. Sunkara ''an almost hilariously savvy character who knows how to deploy mockery and flattery to great effect.''
The magazine's injection of a ''vital left-of-left-of-center'' viewpoint into the conversation, he added, ''has been very fun to watch.''
In writing Mr. Sunkara can come on like a one-man insult-comedy squad, whether the target is regular whipping boys like the Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein (''a young liberal with a lust for properly punctuated policy memos'') or the capitalist vampire squid itself.
But in person he's more straightforwardly earnest and quick to emphasize that the magazine he founded in his dorm room has evolved into a collective endeavor. Jacobin's success, he said, springs from the highly cohesive politics of the four co-editors he has recruited and their shared commitment to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or ''cheap hooks.''
Not that Mr. Sunkara, who is also the magazine's publisher, dismisses the value of pop-culture come-ons (the new issue includes a radical analysis of the Onion's online reality-television satire ''Sex House'') or good visuals. The sleek design by Remeike Forbes, an M.F.A. student from the Rhode Island School of Design who e-mailed Mr. Sunkara out of the blue in 2011 offering to design a Jacobin T-shirt, has been essential to getting people to take the magazine seriously, he said.
And when Seth Ackerman, a graduate student at Cornell University, turned in a scathing analysis of the Constitution's inherent conservatism for the second issue, Mr. Sunkara knew it needed something to really pop.
''Seth had a title with nine words and a semicolon,'' he recalled. ''I crossed it out and wrote 'Burn the Constitution.' ''
That article, along with ''Zombie Marx,'' a critique of chapter-and-verse Marxist economics by Mike Beggs, a young lecturer in political economy at the University of Sydney who Mr. Sunkara met (like Mr. Ackerman) through the e-mail list of Doug Henwood's Left Business Observer, got some pickup on blogs. But it was a packed Jacobin-organized panel on the Occupy movement, held in a downtown Manhattan bookstore three weeks after the protests began in Zuccotti Park in September 2011, that really put the magazine on the map, drawing attention from Politico and Glenn Beck.
''The purpose was to force people to actually talk about ideology, about which ideas Occupy would stand for, about whether there should be any ideology at all,'' Mr. Ackerman said, adding that many people he sees mentioning Jacobin on social media come from ''Occupy-ish'' circles.
Meanwhile the magazine was also attracting attention from more established figures on the left, who saw it as raising fundamental questions that had been off the table since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Corey Robin, an associate professor of political science at Brooklyn College who became a contributing editor last winter, pointed in particular to articles by Mr. Ackerman and Peter Frase, another early Jacobin recruit, debating the possibility of a post-capitalist economy involving, among other things, drastically reduced working hours.
''So many people are not working or already getting wages subsidized by the state -- maybe there's something already at play that we haven't paid enough attention to,'' Mr. Robin said.
Mr. Sunkara, the son of middle-class South Asian immigrants who was voted ''most likely to succeed'' in high school, traces his politics less to experience than to reading. In seventh grade a stray reference in an introduction to ''Animal Farm'' sent him to Trotsky's own writings. By his freshman year of college he was editing a blog for Democratic Socialists of America and writing for Dissent.
His multitasking work ethic hardly shows signs of flagging. In addition to his position as a staff writer for the progressive monthly In These Times his 2013 projects include an essay collection for Metropolitan Books (edited with Sarah Leonard of Dissent), to appear in September; a series of Jacobin-branded books published by Verso; a $7,500 fund-raising drive; and, if he gets around to it, a podcast called ''This American Strife'' -- ideally followed, he likes to say, by a lawsuit from Ira Glass.
Mr. Sunkara also plans to keep writing for Vice magazine, where he has compared outrage over rich professional athletes to outrage over ''overpaid'' public-sector employees, all of whom he sees as just trying to negotiate their fair share.
That time, Mr. Sunkara's editor wrote the headline, the Vice-like ''Jeremy Lin Is Not Greedy, You're Just Stupid.'' But when it comes to Jacobin's goal of smuggling radical analysis out of the intellectual ghetto and into the mainstream Mr. Sunkara's motto seems to be: by any means necessary.
It helps, he said, ''that liberals think we are relatively sane.''

HEADLINE: Texas Attorney General to New Yorkers: Come on Down, With Guns

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- Attention New Yorkers: Texas wants you. And your guns.
Last week, the day after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York approved a broad package of gun-control measures that made New York's tough gun laws even tougher, the Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, began running Internet advertisements in Manhattan and Albany asking New York gun owners to consider moving to Texas.
The two ads -- displayed on news sites and aimed at Web users with Manhattan and Albany ZIP codes -- promote the state's low taxes and gun culture, with one asking, ''Is Gov. Cuomo looking to take your guns?'' The other reads, ''Wanted: Law abiding New York gun owners looking for lower taxes and greater opportunity.'' 
When clicked on, the ads lead users to a Facebook page where a letter from Mr. Abbott, the state's chief law enforcement official, promotes Texas's strong economy and lack of an income tax, allowing transplanted gun owners ''to keep more of what you earn and use some of that extra money to buy more ammo.''
The ads are a rare burst of political theater from Mr. Abbott, a former State Supreme Court justice who has built a reputation as a gentlemanly yet fiercely conservative litigator eager to challenge the Obama administration, and who, in a speech last year, described his job this way: ''I go to the office. I sue the federal government. And then I go home.''
Mr. Abbott has been laying the groundwork and raising millions of dollars for a possible run for governor in 2014, regardless of whether Gov. Rick Perry, his ally and fellow Republican, decides to seek re-election.
Mr. Abbott's ads were paid for not by the attorney general's office but by his political campaign, Texans for Greg Abbott. A campaign spokesman, Eric Bearse, said the ads began running on Wednesday and were ''interest targeted'' to those in Manhattan and Albany who visited several news sites, including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.
Mr. Bearse said the ads were created in response to New York's new gun-control laws as well as the executive actions that President Obama announced the same day to curb gun violence. He declined to say how much they had cost Mr. Abbott, whose campaign account has grown to $18 million.
''It's a somewhat unconventional method to weigh in on a very serious issue,'' Mr. Bearse said. ''It makes the point that Texans value freedom, and specifically their freedom to protect themselves. Our state has experienced the largest population growth in the country from places like California and New York because our culture does value freedom.''
The ads illustrate the extent to which the debate over guns and gun violence since the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has played out differently in Texas than it has in other parts of the country.
In Texas, guns and the right to carry them continue to be closely linked to the state's self-image. Those licensed to carry a concealed weapon can do so in restaurants, shopping malls and even the Capitol building here in Austin.
Responding to Mr. Obama's gun proposals, Mr. Perry said in a statement that he was disgusted to see the political left and the news media use the school shooting to advance a pre-existing agenda, and he suggested that prayers rather than laws were in order.
A day after the president unveiled his proposals, a different sort of gun debate unfolded here, after a Republican state senator from Granbury, Brian Birdwell, filed a bill to allow those with a concealed handgun license to carry their firearms on college campuses.
Mr. Abbott posted his ads on his Facebook page, creating an impromptu cross-state forum and occasional shouting match between New Yorkers and Texans on both sides of the issue. A woman from Jarrell, Tex., called the ads ''another embarrassing example'' of politicians in the state. Another woman in Texas complained of Yankees and their liberal attitudes, adding, ''Stay up North we don't want you in Texas.''
And one Republican New Yorker wrote that she was sick of Mr. Cuomo, ready to move to Texas and would greatly appreciate ''any info, regarding employment, schools, and city to live in.''
New Yorkers moving to Texas might find that the two places have more in common than they expect: each is as much a state of mind as it is an actual state. The century had barely gotten started when Mr. Perry declared in his inaugural address in 2011 that historians would look back and call it ''the Texas century.'' New Yorkers are as New York-centric as Texans are Texas-centric.
And there is at least one place where newly arrived New Yorkers might feel strangely at home: New York, Tex., an unincorporated community amid the green acres of East Texas, about 1,500 miles from Times Square. It is made up of a handful of houses, a cemetery, a church and Reynolds New York Store.
Carolyn Reynolds, who runs the feed and fertilizer store, paused when asked for the population. She started counting under her breath. ''Right now, I'd consider it 11,'' she replied.
Still, Mr. Abbott said in a statement, because of the state's low taxes and gun laws, ''our New York is better than their New York.''

HEADLINE: For Obama, Context for His 2nd Term

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Here are two realities about U.S. second presidential terms: They aren't cursed, as legend has it, and they are rarely better than first ones.
On Sunday, Barack Obama was to become the 17th U.S. president to be inaugurated for a second time, and historians offer useful context. ''Obama has read the literature and understands overreach,'' said Michael Beschloss, one of the more than half a dozen scholars who recently had dinner with the president. ''This puts him one step ahead of most'' re-elected presidents.
That sentiment contrasts with the mood of many Democrats these days. In conversations with a dozen Democratic politicians, with a few exceptions, there is a pervasive pessimism about the next several years. Almost all requested anonymity, not out of fear, they say, but to avoid giving solace to Republicans. 
The political environment, they say, is as poisonous as it ever was.
The fiscal struggles won't be settled in the next few months; more likely they'll be prolonged through the year, crowding out most other issues, with the possible exception of immigration and conceivably gun violence legislation.
The president shows few signs of reaching out or broadening his horizon. If anything, Capitol Hill Democrats say, the inner circle is more closed. Mr. Obama, most recently at a news conference last week, deprecates the role of relationships in politics; he's dismissive of the notion that all would be better if he would just drink whiskey with lawmakers, as Lyndon B. Johnson did. He's right. Few will shift policy positions because of a good Scotch or bourbon. Yet his critics also are right when they point out that every successful president has forged crucial political relationships.
Some conditions are beyond a president's control to influence. Saturation news coverage takes more of a toll in a second term. ''One of the greatest threats to the modern presidency is overexposure,'' said the historian Richard Norton Smith. ''There will be Obama fatigue.''
Then there's the supposed second-term curse: Johnson and the Vietnam War; Richard M. Nixon and Watergate; Bill Clinton and impeachment; George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina.
Robert W. Merry, who has written about how presidents are evaluated, suggested ''it's almost impossible to find a president who had a second term better than his first.''
Presidents usually win re-election because they had a reasonably successful first term; that, some experts point out, distorts any comparisons, a state of affairs that became apparent with one of the earliest U.S. presidential re-elections: that of Thomas Jefferson in 1804.
''You can't buy Louisiana every term,'' Mr. Norton-Smith said. ''That doesn't mean there can't be accomplishments.''
Ronald Reagan, in his second term, won sweeping tax changes and a historical arms-reduction treaty with the Soviet Union. Even some administrations known for conspicuous failings look better with perspective.
Franklin D. Roosevelt botched the economic recovery and tried to pack the Supreme Court in the late 1930s. He also, subtly, prepared the United States for World War II, a bigger achievement. Dwight D. Eisenhower's party was clobbered in congressional elections, and he was embarrassed when a spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union. He also sent U.S. troops to integrate the schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, a seminal moment. Mr. Clinton's second term produced few tangible achievements, though he continued to reposition the Democratic Party.
Today, the second-term optimists among Democrats say the president is contending with a much stronger and stable economy than the one he inherited four years ago. They see a more self-assured chief executive. One outside operative contrasts a session he had with Mr. Obama four years ago with one a few weeks ago, saying the president is a different man, more confident, clearer on what he wants to do.
Mr. Obama no longer harbors illusions, these Democrats say, about Republican congressional leaders. He's willing, even eager, for combat. Republicans, whose standing with the public continues its free fall, are one of Mr. Obama's greatest assets.
Whatever the political limitations, historians say Mr. Obama needs to think big, starting with his second Inaugural Address.
''He has a chance to explain where America ought to be in 10 or 20 years,'' said H.W. Brands of the University of Texas at Austin, who also attended the scholars' dinner with the president. ''He can rise above everyday politics and speak to history. Lincoln did it in 1865; F.D.R. in 1937. Now it's Obama's chance.''
Some Democrats say the president would be able to make a more compelling case if his inner circle weren't so insular. The Team of Rivals of the early first term, when the president brought in diverse voices, has turned into the Band of Brothers, with a premium on personal loyalty. Top White House aides have let it be known that they will be making more personnel and policy decisions in the economics and foreign affairs arenas.
And while Mr. Obama may appreciate the dangers of second-term overreach, he's quick to claim a mandate on issues, an assertion with a dubious historical resonance.
''Presidents should erase the word 'mandate' from their vocabulary,'' Mr. Norton Smith said. ''At best, it's treacherous.''

HEADLINE: With Tax Advantages Looking Shaky, Private Equity Seeks a New Path

BYLINE: JANE SASSEEN


HIGHLIGHT: The private equity industry is discussing how to respond to a new reality: its long-held tax advantages are likely to disappear. 

 BODY:
As Washington grapples with the country's fiscal woes, the private equity industry is grudgingly facing a new reality: its long-held tax advantages are likely to disappear.
For years, private equity has quashed efforts to raise taxes on so-called carried interest income, the profits partners receive as part of their compensation. Those earnings are considered capital gains, so they are taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary income.
While few concede defeat publicly, the industry is rethinking its strategy. Rather than trying to stop the changes outright, lawyers and executives behind the scenes are trying to minimize the hit if it happens.
Private equity recognizes the shifting politics. In the current budget debate, sacred cows like the tax deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable donations are on the table, along with potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare. 
"Once they start looking for revenues, carried interest will be on the list," said Anne Mathias, director of Washington policy research at Guggenheim Partners, a financial services firm. "You can hear it already: 'We need that money, or Grandma won't get a new hip.' "
Democrats and Republicans alike are looking at eliminating loopholes as part of a broader effort to overhaul the tax code. Changes to the treatment of carried interest could bring in $17 billion over 10 years, according to Congressional estimates.
"There is absolutely no reason why income earned for managing other people's money shouldn't be taxed in the same way as income earned teaching or working in a factory," said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who introduced the latest carried interest bill in 2012. Legislation based on Mr. Levin's bill is likely to be part of a broader package if carried interest comes into play.
Officially, the private equity industry remains opposed to change. Its lobbying group, the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, began an extensive public relations campaign last year to improve the industry's image during the presidential race, in which the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, was criticized for his actions as chief executive of the private equity firm Bain Capital.
The trade group also increased its Congressional lobbying. To highlight the industry's economic contributions, it arranged 70 meetings in which House members visited private-equity-owned companies or met their chiefs. For example, Representative Robert Hurt, Republican of Virginia, toured a distribution center for Dollar General, a retailer previously owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
"We will continue to do what we have always done," said Steve Judge, chief executive of the trade group.
He and others argue that it is appropriate to treat private equity income as capital gains because managers have money at risk and actively reorganize companies. Mr. Judge also noted that private equity is already paying more under the deal to avert the fiscal cliff, which raised the capital gains tax rate to 20 percent from 15 percent, on top of the 3.8 percent capital gains surcharge enacted on wealthy taxpayers to finance President Obama's health care law.
But even as the industry continues to press its case, many of its members acknowledge that the carried interest break is coming to an end. "At some point it's inevitable, so they will deal with it," said Bradley Morrow, a senior private markets consultant at Towers Watson. If the proposal does re-emerge, the industry is expected to focus its lobbying on softening transition rules.
One issue will be the amount of carried interest reclassified as ordinary income. Mr. Levin's 2012 bill would convert 100 percent of carried interest. By contrast, an earlier version of the bill proposed capping the affected income at 50 percent to 75 percent.
The industry is also likely to focus on how quickly any changes would go into effect. Lobbyists will probably push for a longer delay, even if it means little or no cap, said Micah W. Bloomfield, a tax lawyer with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. That would give partners more time to pocket capital gains or restructure funds before the rate increase took effect.
Another point of contention will be the treatment of profits that partners earn when they sell stakes in their firms, a sum known as enterprise value. Currently, profits attributable to enterprise value are treated as capital gains. In earlier bills, they would have been reclassified as ordinary income.
"What people complained most vociferously about in the earlier bills was the treatment of enterprise value," said James R. Brown, a tax lawyer with Willkie Farr & Gallagher. If a fund manager sold the business, "all the gain from the sale would have been considered ordinary income," Mr. Brown said. "That's a big difference in how any other business is taxed when it's sold."
The Obama administration and Congressional proponents of reform acknowledge the problem. Mr. Levin's latest bill included provisions to treat enterprise value as capital gains. The issue is particularly important for large, publicly traded firms like Blackstone and K.K.R. As partners near retirement, they see it as crucial to get capital gains tax treatment when they divest their stakes.
But the issue is complex. Congressional tax staff, worried that firms could redefine some carried interest as enterprise value, wrote the language of the bill narrowly to prevent abuse.
Private equity advocates argue that the bill still casts too wide a net, and that some legitimate profits from business sales would end up classified as ordinary income.
"They may think they have solved the issue, but they haven't," said one industry lobbyist, who requested anonymity because of the delicacy of the discussions.
Beyond transition rules, firms might consider adapting their own structures if the break does end.
The simplest strategy - one already occurring - is to accelerate the recognition of accrued capital gains. Funds might also remove some unrealized carried interest from their investment partnerships altogether, said Steven Rosenthal, a visiting fellow at the Washington-based Tax Policy Center. They could do that by shifting ownership of the gains to an affiliate by distributing securities of equal value.
These ideas may not all work, but funds are preparing nonetheless. Many have added language to partnership agreements, reserving the right to restructure, Mr. Brown said.
Tax lawyers have been searching for a broader escape hatch for years, in something of a cat-and-mouse game with legislators. In one early proposal, the lawyers suggested that general partners borrow money from limited partners to help capitalize a fund. They also explored setting up funds using foreign corporations that allow income to flow through to their owners as capital gains. But legislators rejected those ideas in later bills.
A potential strategy still being discussed involves setting up new funds as America-based C corporations, which the Internal Revenue Service taxes separately from their owners. In one possibility, a private equity firm would create a corporate holding company to buy and manage each individual portfolio company, instead of buying them through a partnership.
The private equity partners would then receive holding company shares, rather than being paid with carried interest. The private equity managers would pay ordinary income taxes on the initial share distribution, but any further increase in the shares' value would be considered capital gains.
The structure is similar to one used in venture capital, said Patrick B. Fenn, a tax lawyer with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. "People are looking at this, but no one has gotten to the point where they'd do it for their next fund," Mr. Fenn said. "You won't see any real reaction on structures until we see the specifics."
Added Mr. Morrow of Towers Watson: "There are a number of ideas on the drawing boards. I'm not sure any of them will work, but the tax lawyers and accountants are certainly working on it."

HEADLINE: China's Focus on Aerospace Raises Security Questions

BYLINE: KEITH BRADSHER


HIGHLIGHT: As Beijing's leaders try to find new ways to invest $3 trillion of foreign reserves, aerospace deals prove attractive even as they give China's neighbors a reason to wonder about security threats. 

 BODY:
TIANJIN, China - When Airbus executives arrived here seven years ago scouting for a location to assemble passenger jets, the broad, flat expanse next to Tianjin Binhai International Airport was a grassy field.
Now, Airbus, the European aerospace giant, has 20 large buildings and is churning out four A320 jetliners a month for mostly Chinese state-controlled carriers. The company also has two new neighbors - a sprawling rocket factory and a helicopter manufacturing complex - both producing for the Chinese military.
 The rapid expansion of civilian and military aerospace manufacturing in Tianjin reflects China's broader ambitions.
As Beijing's leaders try to find new ways to invest $3 trillion of foreign reserves, the country has been aggressively expanding in industries with strong economic potential. The Chinese government and state-owned companies have already made a major push into financial services and natural resources, acquiring stakes in Morgan Stanley and Blackstone and buying oil and gas fields around the world. 
Aerospace represents the latest frontier for China, which is eyeing parts manufacturers, materials producers, leasing businesses, cargo airlines and airport operators. The country now rivals the United States as a market for civilian airliners, which China hopes to start supplying from domestic production. And the new leadership named at the Party Congress in November has publicly emphasized long-range missiles and other aerospace programs in its push for military modernization.
If Boeing's difficulties with its recently grounded aircraft, the Dreamliner, weigh on the industry, it could create opportunity. Chinese companies, which have plenty of capital, have been welcomed by some American companies as a way to create jobs. Wall Street has been eager, too, at a time when other merger activity has been weak.
Washington is trying to figure out what to do about China's deal-making broadly. "Many of these transactions raise important security issues for our country," said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was created by Congress to monitor the bilateral relationship. "China's interest in promoting these investments isn't necessarily consistent with our own interests, and it's appropriate to thoroughly examine the transactions."
In aerospace, the Chinese deal-makers have deep ties to the military, raising additional issues for American regulators. The main contractor for the country's air force, the state-owned China Aviation Industry Corporation, known as Avic, has set up a private equity fund to purchase companies with so-called dual-use technology that has civilian and military applications, with the goal of investing as much as $3 billion. In 2010, Avic acquired the overseas licensing rights for small aircraft made by Epic Aircraft of Bend, Ore., using lightweight yet strong carbon-fiber composites - the same material used for high-performance fighter jets.
Provincial and local government agencies in Shaanxi Province, a hub of Chinese military aircraft testing and production, have set up another fund of similar size for acquisitions. Last month, a consortium of Chinese investors, including the Shaanxi fund, struck a $4.23 billion deal with the American International Group to buy 80 percent of the International Lease Finance Corporation, which owns the world's second-largest passenger jet fleet.
"There has always been an obvious cross-fertilization of ideas, expertise and money between the civilian and military," said Martin Craigs, a longtime aerospace executive in Asia who is now the chairman of the Aerospace Forum Asia, a nonprofit group in Hong Kong. He added that Chinese companies had been actively hiring senior American and European aerospace engineers, so national security concerns could be quelled some by hiring the right people.
The push into aerospace coincides with growing worries in the West and across Asia about China's increasingly assertive territorial claims, including the dispatch of Chinese warships to waters long patrolled by Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam.
Coincidentally, hours after the A.I.G. deal was announced, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua announced that two Chinese navy destroyers and two frigates had entered disputed waters patrolled by Japan. The report was disputed by Japan's defense ministry, which said the Chinese vessels turned away before reaching the disputed areas.
China and Japan have stepped up public criticisms of each other since. And the Obama administration has begun a strategic "pivot," shifting military forces from the Mideast back to the western Pacific, a move that Chinese officials have criticized as an attempt to contain their country.
Such confrontations in the region are drawing attention to China's deal-making ambitions.
In October, a $1.79 billion bid by a business linked to Beijing's municipal government to acquire the corporate jet and propeller plane operations of bankrupt Hawker Beechcraft in Wichita, Kan., fell apart over national security concerns in Washington. Executives found it hard to disentangle the civilian operations from the company's military contracting business.
But many aerospace experts predict that Chinese investors and companies will find ways to appease American regulators. "There will be concerns undoubtedly and generally quite valid, but the commercial imperatives are such that people will find a way around them," said Peter Harbison, the chairman of CAPA-Center for Aviation, a global aerospace consulting firm.
The sale of A.I.G.'s leasing business is expected to face scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews the national security implications of deals involving foreign buyers.
The group's customers include many of the largest carriers in the United States, and the federal government has long counted on being able to use civilian passenger jets to transport troops overseas during a national emergency. When Saddam Hussein sent the Iraqi army into Kuwait in 1990, the Defense Department relied on the emergency mobilization of civilian jetliners to ferry 60 percent of the soldiers sent to and from the Mideast during the first Persian Gulf war and a quarter of the cargo, according to a RAND study.
Henri Courpron, the chief executive of A.I.G.'s International Lease Finance Corporation, said that he did not believe the United States should be concerned that the acquisition would prevent civilian aircraft from being available in a future crisis. Only 8 percent of the company's aircraft are currently leased to American air carriers, and most of these are narrow-body aircraft that lack the range to ferry troops across oceans.
"It's really a nonissue - we have 900-plus aircraft in our fleet, and there are only 11 wide bodies" currently being leased to American carriers, he said in a telephone interview. He added that the carriers have control over the aircraft during the leases. Executives from the consortium buying the stake in the leasing company declined repeated requests for interviews.
Chinese suitors in the aerospace industry understand the concerns. In part, they watched the experience in the natural resources industry. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation failed in its 2005 bid to acquire Unocal after intense political opposition. After that, Chinese energy giants have been more cautious, pursuing minority stakes in the United States and limiting their outright acquisitions.
Chinese companies are taking a similar tack in aerospace, pursuing joint ventures and technical cooperation agreements alongside acquisitions. For example, Avic is working with General Electric and other American aerospace companies on the production of a civilian jetliner, the C919. Beijing envisions the narrow-body C919 as the next step toward building a domestic aerospace business that can compete with Boeing and Airbus.
Western companies and their advisers say that they are acutely aware that technology transfers could help China strengthen its military and develop more competitive civil airplanes, and are taking precautions to protect trade secrets and national security. "You transfer the part that is most easily reverse engineered, or easily dissected," said a lawyer with detailed knowledge of these transactions.
But many in the aerospace sector are more skeptical that the West can avoid losing control of technology. "The mentality is, they're going to find a way to get there anyway, and we may as well get there with them," Mr. Harbison of the CAPA-Center for Aviation said.
Airbus executives say that they are being prudent. They add that there are few trade secrets about the A320 manufactured here, an aircraft that was designed in 1986. "The A320 is well known all over the world," said Jean-Luc Charles, the general manager of Airbus's operations here.
A tour of the main assembly area, a hangar with gray steel walls and large red cranes overhead, suggests that it may be possible to protect the technology. The seats are installed here and the aircraft painted, but the factory is largely assembling planes from kits imported from Europe. Entire fuselages, with green protective coatings, are brought by ship from Hamburg, Germany. Even the stepladders and freight elevators give weight limits in German, and the tool boxes are labeled in English, not Chinese.
Mr. Charles said that 95 percent of the parts are still imported, and that it would take many years for that amount to shrink. "One by one, we start to give them the parts," he said. "But each subassembly is a complex project - it takes five years."
An earlier version of this article incompletely described an incident involving the movement of Chinese naval vessels shortly after the A.I.G. deal was announced. While China announced that its navy flotilla had sailed into waters "near" and "surrounding" a cluster of uninhabited islands claimed by both countries, Japan's defense ministry said that its tracking of the vessels showed that they turned away well before reaching the disputed islands.

HEADLINE: In Euro Zone, Signs of Progress and Fears of Complacency

BYLINE: LIZ ALDERMAN and JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: Europe's political leaders have taken important steps to improve spending discipline among euro members, but have yet to address some serious flaws in the structure of the euro zone. 

 BODY:
PARIS - This may be the year that Europe stops being the ticking time bomb of the global economy.
Ireland is on track to leave international bailout limbo by summer. Talk of Greece's departure from the euro is off the table. And financial speculators have generally stopped betting the euro zone will blow up.
But even as the sense of emergency fades, Europe is potentially facing a starker problem.
For three years, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and a phalanx of policy makers have been working to shore up the euro's foundations to prevent the currency union from coming apart. As they gather with academics, executives and various experts this week at the World Economic Forum, which opens Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland, the biggest concern is that leaders might become less vigilant now that the heat is off, ushering in a spate of new troubles that could dog the euro for years to come. 
"The risk is that complacency takes hold because there is no more urgency in the crisis, and that everything that has been done up until now will be deemed sufficient," said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. If that happens, he warned, "Europe will turn into the next Japan, and become a permanently depressed or stagnating economic area."
Ms. Merkel might be forgiven for feeling a sense of vindication. Her deliberate approach to crisis management and refusal to get too far ahead of German public opinion has often frustrated her euro zone peers and foreign allies. And yet, the strategy seems to have worked - so far, at least. Ms. Merkel, who is to speak in Davos on Thursday, and other European leaders have generally done just enough to contain the crisis without alienating taxpayers.
Much of the credit for the current calm in Europe goes to Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. He appeased financial markets with his promise last summer to do whatever it took to preserve the euro, including buying the government bonds of Spain if necessary to keep a lid on the country's borrowing costs.
The effect of Mr. Draghi's promise has been evident: financial markets have stopped driving the borrowing costs of Spain and Italy toward the danger levels that led Ireland, Greece and Portugal to reach for international financial lifelines. Today, few people fear that Europe's southern countries will break away from the euro union.
Other dire prospects, like Germany and other Northern European countries fleeing the euro union to avoid getting caught in a quagmire, have also dropped off the watch list. If anything, the focus of anxiety is the fiscal situation in the United States, where gridlock in Washington has become just as debilitating for the country's finances as the euro policy paralysis was for European politicians.
"Some European policy makers who visited the United States recently were delighted to see that because of the fiscal cliff, Europe wasn't on every channel," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. "There is an ecstasy over the fact that they won't blow apart tomorrow."
Still, Professor Rogoff added, Europe must revive economic growth to fully address its problems. "And even if they do, that's not a long-term solution," he said. "They need to integrate more fully, or they will fall apart."
Europe's political leaders have taken important steps to improve spending discipline among euro members, provide a financial backstop for troubled euro zone countries and consolidate supervision of banks. Despite many imperfections, the measures seem to have been enough to convince investors that officials are slowly building a more resilient currency union.
"European countries have shown their resolve in making the euro a success and reaffirmed the deep political commitment to work together toward a stronger union," Vítor Constâncio, the vice president of the European Central Bank, told an audience in Beijing on Jan. 12.
But leaders have yet to address some serious flaws in the structure of the euro zone. For example, they have not solved the problem of how to wind down terminally ill banks without sticking taxpayers with the bill. And they are far away from a deposit insurance fund for Europe, which means the risk of bank runs remains.
"In order to define a turning point, you need a lot of factors besides the stabilization of financial markets," Mr. Draghi said this month.
But coming events could undermine confidence. Germany will hold national elections in September, which could make Ms. Merkel even more cautious than usual and stall euro zone decision-making. Already, her main rivals pulled off an upset in regional elections this weekend in Lower Saxony.
Italian elections are also looming. Mario Monti, the prime minister, who restored Italy's international credibility and is to speak at Davos on Wednesday, faces a public that is grumpy about a rollback of job protections and other policy overhauls. Silvio Berlusconi, a former Italian prime minister who presided over years of an economic standstill, is aiming for a populist comeback.
In France, President François Hollande's pledge to bring the deficit down to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year to adhere to the rules governing euro membership may be challenged if France's military engagement in Mali and the surrounding region turns into a drawn-out affair.
Across the channel, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who is scheduled to speak in Davos on Thursday morning, has sounded warnings that the country might leave the European Union if changes in its administration are not made. "The danger is that Europe will fail and that the British people will drift toward the exit," according to prepared text of a speech that Mr. Cameron postponed delivering last week because of developments in the hostage crisis in Algeria.
In the meantime, the severe effects of prolonged austerity in several European countries are leaving deep social scars. Tax increases and steep spending cuts have ground many European citizens deeper than ever into hardship, prompting millions to demonstrate in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Recessionary economies in those countries are expected to get worse before they improve.
In Greece, where austerity has hit the hardest, people are burning trash and wood this winter for lack of money to pay electricity bills, and the government's efforts to enact structural overhauls intended to turn the economy around and attract foreign investors continue to lag.
And then there is Germany, which itself is being tugged into a slowdown as its cash-poor southern neighbors continue to refrain from buying Audis and other high-price German goods.
Unemployment in the euro zone continues to climb: the jobless rate in the 17 countries of the bloc hit a record 11.8 percent in November. Youth unemployment has surpassed 50 percent in Spain and Greece, a stratosphere of despair. Thousands of bright young people continue to flee Greece, Ireland, Spain and other countries every month for the booming economies of Australia and Canada.
Portuguese workers are even going to Africa in search of a better future, as the middle class there grows along with improving economic conditions on the southern part of the African continent.
Yet painful adjustments are starting to bear some fruit. Labor costs have come down in countries including Spain and Portugal, helping make their work forces more competitive in the region. In Spain, for instance, where unit labor costs have fallen 4 percent since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, the labor market is now so alluring that Ford, Renault and Volkswagen have announced plans to expand production there.
In addition, the alarming flight of deposits from banks in Spain has come to a stop.
The euro zone's problems have proved an opportunity for some countries to remove structural impediments to growth. In France, where Mr. Hollande has promised to make the economy more competitive, labor unions have agreed to a deal to overhaul swaths of the notoriously rigid labor market.
The deal would tame some of the French labor code's most confounding restrictions, including lengthy hiring and firing procedures and outsize business taxes, as the country tries to lift its competitiveness, curb unemployment and improve the budget.
"Is the worst over? Probably yes," analysts at Barclays Capital wrote in a recent note to clients.
That will be especially true if leaders and businesses persist in using the crisis as a chance to renew European competitiveness.
Some countries may have made enough economic overhauls to enjoy substantial growth, but once the crisis is past, said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels, "there are a lot of nuts still to crack."
 Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

HEADLINE: In Davos, a Chance to Rub Shoulders With the Elite of Business and Politics

BYLINE: LIZ ALDERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: For the more than 2,500 people making the pilgrimage this year, some personalities will command more attention than others. 

 BODY:
The minimum $20,000 entry fee has been paid. Fur hats and silk underwear are in the luggage. And stacks of business cards are ready to be slipped into the palms of the business and political elite gathering this week at the snowy alpine fortress that is the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
For the more than 2,500 people making the pilgrimage this year, some personalities will command more attention than others. On the Continent, where fears of the euro's imminent demise dominated thinking for the last year, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, are being credited rather than pilloried these days for saving the euro from disaster. 
Together with Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy and the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, they will be among the keynote speakers on whether Europe's fortunes will at last take a turn for the better.
 Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain may throw cold water on that idea, if he attends. But in Davos, if he does turn up, his main task may be to explain why investors should not be spooked by his warning that Britain may drift away from the European Union.
With plenty of dynamism stirring outside Europe, emerging markets leaders will be making the case for investment dollars to flow their way. Executives and academics from China and India will swarm the halls to discuss the evolution in their economic climate, which has cooled since a year ago but remains well ahead of those in Western economies.
Prime ministers from a number of African countries will also make the trek to explain how dynamism continues to build, especially on the southern part of the continent. Two years after the Arab Spring unfolded, numerous decision-makers from North Africa will outline plans for overhauls and address the political, social and economic transitions, and upheavals, in their countries.
With fighting in Mali still making headlines and the Algerian gas-field hostage disaster still being sorted out, North African issues are very likely to be prime topics.
Not everyone has been panting to get to Davos. Officials from the United States, for example, will barely be represented. But those coming - including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is a regular at the forum, and Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations and a former candidate to be the next secretary of state - are likely to stir controversy.
And some of the highest-wattage regulars are turning their attention elsewhere. Three notable absentees will be the top Google executives, Sergey Brin, Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt. (For Mr. Schmidt, Davos evidently doesn't have the same allure as North Korea, where he visited recently.) Google has not said why its leaders are not attending.
But some other men with big money will be on hand, though Jamie Dimon, the chief of JPMorgan Chase, can't count on quite as much money as before, now that the bank's board had decided to dock his pay after a multibillion-dollar trading loss in 2012.
Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America and George Soros will all be sniffing out investments. So will Lloyd C. Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, who has shunned Davos in the past but decided to join the party this time.
It's not all about deals, though. Bill and Melinda Gates, hardy Davos perennials, will again be there to preach the need to invest in what counts for future generations: education, health and related philanthropic activity.
For celebrity sizzle, the South African actress Charlize Theron will be in town to promote her Africa Outreach Project. The forum discouraged celebrities for a while after Sharon Stone stole the show in 2005 and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did the same the following year. Since then, a few stars have swanned in, mostly, it seems, out of curiosity.
Last year, Mick Jagger sidled into a spate of private Davos parties wearing a velvet plum jacket and a lilac shirt, speaking eruditely about current events with people like Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, before busting a few lanky dance moves late in the evening.
This year, another power broker expected to prowl the corridors is Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees. Whether anyone will consider face time with him a must probably depends on a given attitude toward American baseball generally, and the widely followed Yankees specifically.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Facebook Search

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: What graph search means for small businesses, charging liberals more for smoothies, managing sales executives and does everyone really need a social media strategy? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 The Economy: Housing Starts Soar 
The bull market may be on shaky ground. Machine tool orders fall 11 percent. Manufacturing slows in the New York region. But there is also good news: home prices, retail sales and factory output all rise, and housing starts (PDF) soar. Job seekers per opening fall to a four-year low, and jobless claims are at a five-year low. Consumer prices rose only 1.7 percent in 2012, and the producer price index is down. Builder confidence holds steady. House Republicans agree to lift the debt ceiling. Here is a rundown of all the approaching fiscal deadlines and their consequences. The threat of sequestration looms over the manufacturing sector. Ben S. Bernanke wants Congress to get rid of the debt ceiling.
 Facebook: A Busy Week 
In the same week that Justin Timberlake helped introduce a new and improved MySpace, Facebook took on Google with its new graph search, introduced a free calling service for the iPhone and disrupted the server business. Here are five things Facebook's new search function means for business. Christopher Wallace believes that Facebook's timeline makes promoting a business more effective. This is how two sisters used Facebook to get a puppy and @brettryland tweeted: "I waited four years for a Justin Timberlake song for this?" 
 Around the Country: Liberals Pay Extra 
December's home sales in Southern California were the highest in three years, which must mean California is back from the brink! Or is it? (And the state's former governor takes some time out to answer questions on Reddit.) A Michigan-based company encourages entrepreneurs to let all of their business frustrations (and joys) out into the world through competitive storytelling. A Utah small business that sells smoothies charges liberals a dollar extra. The owner of a machine shop in Ohio reveals his biggest mistake. These are the worst cities for bedbugs. The national flu outbreak is affecting small businesses. Startup New York is helping small businesses after Sandy, and New York City is encouraging the growth of businesses owned by women. FedEx announces the winners of its small-business grant competition. A turnaround expert is looking for companies to fix for a new TV series.
 Around the World: Japan Chooses Stimulus 
The World Bank cuts its growth forecasts as developed nations lose steam. Euro zone factory output falls, but Italian machine tool orders rose 3.5 percent in 2012. Britain is expected to drop from the world's top 10 economies by 2050. Germany's economy shrinks. A third of Greek workers are uninsured for social security benefits. Paul Krugman admires Japan's recent stimulus efforts. United Airlines is now offering Wi-Fi on some overseas flights. Some feel that the road for a start-up in Africa can be like a video game: each time a player slays a monster, a larger one appears. These are the smartest cities in the Asia-Pacific region, and these are the most polluted cities in each industrialized country. A worker outsources his job to China and makes a profit.
 Health Care: Premiums Rising 
As 2014 approaches, more small businesses are worrying about exceeding the 50-employee limit. Health insurance premiums have been rising, and consumers may experience another series of price shocks later this year (and 18 human heads are found at O'Hare Airport). The Department of Health and Human Services publishes new rules on Medicaid expansion and state exchanges. Support for Medicaid expansion is growing among governors of both parties. A Gallup poll finds that American workers who are engaged in their work and workplace are more likely to report a healthier lifestyle than their counterparts.
 Management: A Party Boy Explains 
Dan Smith wonders what you would do if someone tried to steal your success. A college party boy explains how he built the company behind the Golden Globes (but no one can explain Jodie Foster's speech). These are the five biggest Internet entrepreneurs of 2012. More than 60,000 people have signed up for a Darden business school professor's free online course on how to expand a company. Matt Wilson believes that a great way to get ahead is to become a "university entrepreneur." And The Onion reports that most small businesses fail within the first six hours of being on fire.
 Employees: Wal-Mart and Public Relations 
Here is why some employers are paying employees to lose weight. Wal-Mart says that it will hire any military veteran honorably discharged within the past 12 months (but is it just public relations?). Bank of America cuts 14,600 employees. This may be the greatest penalty shot ever.
 Finance: Looking for Sponsors 
Mariah Courtney believes that factoring gives invoice financing a bad name. An online learning company raises $103 million. A new online service hopes to help entrepreneurs connect with the next generation of business leaders. Read this to remind yourself how long you should keep your business documents.
 Mobile: Are You Prepared for SoLoMo? 
Galaxy S device sales top 100 million. Tablets now surpass smartphones in paid search advertising spending, and last month 11.3 billion online video ads were watched. A Pitney Bowes survey finds that 27 percent of consumers ages 18 to 34 say they activate quick response codes. Court Cunningham lists 10 trends to watch in local marketing and predicts that the number of small and midsize businesses with mobile sites will triple. A webinar this week will explain how to prepare your brand for today's SoLoMo - social, local, mobile - environment.
 Marketing: How to Manage Sales Executives 
Rohit Bhargava receives the best birthday promotional e-mail ever. An Experian marketing survey finds that e-mail still generates traffic and revenue. Joshua Lockhart has 10 great tips for dealing with angry, trollish or rude e-mail. Andy Crestodina says you should avoid making Web site navigation mistakes, like having a nonstandard style: "Putting your navigation in standard places makes your site easier to use. That means a lower bounce rate, more pages per visit and higher conversions." Josh Pigford explains how to write fun and engaging survey questions. Chris Keller suggests marketing methods for small businesses that have the best return on investment. Steve Reeves says the secret to managing sales executives is "not to bother." An idea: combine the return of the National Hockey League with your own promotional items. G.B. Oliver believes that including your business card is never a bad idea.
 Social Media: S.M.O.? 
Allison Stadd has the essential social media acronym glossary, including terms like S.M.O. (social media optimization). Farhad Manjoo is passionate about why you should never, ever use two spaces after a period. This is how the tennis star John Isner aces social media. Mark Schaefer asks whether everybody really needs a social media strategy. Monster.com and Score team up to provide a social media marketing workshop. According to the latest social media statistics, approximately 172,000 new members join LinkedIn per day. Community forums are among the seven viral marketing tools Abel Velazquez says you might not know about. What if businesses could rate customers the way customers rate businesses?
 Retail: Google's New Coupon 
Retailers had an unexpectedly strong December, and many are remaking their store strategies. Google shows off a new digital coupon product to take some of the pain out of using coupons in a grocery store. PayPal expands its retail store payment service. A Twitter vice president tells retailers how to start on social media. Nathan Hanks suggests five ways to win when serving local businesses, including: "Live amongst your customers."
 Red Tape: Home Office Deduction 
While a pretend president practiced for the inaugural, the real president took on the gun industry. These tax loopholes slipped under the fiscal cliff radar. The Internal Revenue Service announces an optional $1,500 home office deduction in lieu of depreciation. A fan sues the San Antonio Spurs for resting top players. The Small Business Administration announces changes in a contracting program for small businesses owned by women and introduces an online marketplace that streamlines the government contracting process for small businesses.
 Technology: Rogue Clouds 
Here's a recap of what mattered to small businesses at the Consumer Electronics Show. PC sales slump, despite Microsoft's Windows 8 release. Here are three more reasons businesses are sticking with Windows XP. "Phablets" are catching on. CNET becomes embroiled in a scandal. Mathew Ingram considers ditching his precious iPhone: "the main attraction is the openness of the ecosystem that Android takes advantage of." This is what would happen if Jesus had an iPhone. Heather Clancy shares eight options for taming small-business expenses. A new app can send self-destructing files to users that are just perfect for undoing a bad decision. A new Symantec global survey reveals a surge in rogue clouds and other hidden costs.
 Tweet of the Week

 The Week's Bests 
 Jon Ferrara explains how to build presence for truly social selling: "Identify those individuals and companies whose needs mesh with your strengths. Formalize connections and continue to talk, listen and watch (and even keep an eye on your competition and gather a bit of intelligence!)."
 Paul Morin says a sense of purpose is especially important during tough times: "Without a 'why' or sense of purpose, it's likely that regardless of how precise and well-thought-out your goals may be, you will find it hard to persevere toward achieving them, especially when the inevitable tough times come along."

HEADLINE: Work in the Walmartocene

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The retailing giant Walmart has made a generous commitment to hire recent veterans, but its wages, treatment of workers and opportunities for advancement remain limited, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
Some scientists contend that we should label the era we live in the Anthropocene, because we humans (anthropoi) have fundamentally altered our global ecosystem. Economists might, for similar reasons, consider labeling the current economic era the Walmartocene.
The world's largest retail company (and second-largest business), having easily survived recent skirmishes with workers, shareholders and the law, just announced that it would virtually guarantee jobs to most recent American veterans, who currently suffer from higher-than-average unemployment rates. 
In some ways, Walmart represents the archetype of modern capitalism. It is Tyrannosaurus rex. It pioneers cost-saving methods of global outsourcing and resistance to unionization. It leaps national borders in a single bound. It generates huge profits for its shareholders by delivering a gazillion goods to consumers around the world at prices that few other big-box stores - much less small retail businesses - match.
Many of its regular shoppers adore it. Many of its workers, on the other hand, feel underpaid and underappreciated, and have filed numerous suits, accusing it of violations of labor law, including failure to pay overtime, locking workers in stores overnight, union-busting and sex discrimination. The details of the company's bribery of Mexican officials, in a successful effort to bypass community opposition to store construction in proximity to a historic site, proved particularly embarrassing to its shareholders.
Walmart has long had a love-hate relationship with the American public. But the hate has become more visible in recent years, and the company has made active efforts to abate it.

Before announcing its most recent veteran-hiring initiative, it had thrown its considerable weight behind locally grown organic food and green energy initiatives, pursuing themes that seem intended to win approval from the Obama White House.
These efforts may represent nothing more than cost-effective investments in public relations. But they may also reflect the values of a new generation of Walton family members.
In terms of ownership and management, Walmart is not a classic capitalist company owned by shareholders buying and selling purely on the basis of price per share. It is a family operation, largely controlled by the Walton family, which keeps a tight hand on management.
Although the founder Sam Walton was an entrepreneur, succeeding generations represent a kind of feudal dynasty, largely based on inherited wealth.
Analysis of data from the Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that, in 2010, the Walton family controlled assets equivalent to those of the bottom 42 percent of American families.
This Arkansas aristocracy may feel a certain noblesse oblige. Offering to give jobs to all veterans honorably discharged on or after the plan's announcement on Jan.15 is a patriotic gesture, even if it is sweetened by substantial tax credits.
The company values loyalty and its hierarchical management structure may look familiar to men and women who have participated in the armed forces.
However, most veterans taking up Walmart's offer will have to tighten their belts. An Army private first class, with four years' experience, earns a base pay of $24,178. The average active-duty service member receives a total benefits and pay compensation package worth $99,000 a year, because of substantial in-kind benefits in the form of housing, health care and food.
The average wage for a full-time hourly Walmart associate in the United States is $12.57, which adds up to $26,108 a year at 40 hours a week. But the primary benefits Walmart offers are slim: a health-insurance plan with high deductibles that workers can choose to sign on and contribute to, and a 10 percent discount on store purchases. As a result, Walmart workers make more use of public health and welfare programs, such as food stamps and Medicaid, than other retail workers.
Opportunities for promotion and annual raises are rather limited.
The new hiring policy may increase the proportion of men working the Walmart aisles, because veterans are predominantly men. On the other hand, female veterans may be more likely to apply for jobs in retailing.
Some of these women, bruised by a "brass ceiling" based on their exclusion from combat roles, may prove rather feisty when they learn of continuing class-action suits against Walmart, accusing it of restricting women's access to management positions. Some may be heartened, however, by Walmart's recent efforts to increase women's representation on its board and to promote women's businesses.
One could argue that efforts to shame Walmart have paid off. But it seems unlikely that the United States economy would look much different if Walmart had been slightly better behaved all along. The company itself is the product of increasingly global competition that has increased the scale of business enterprise, concentrated the ownership of wealth and weakened democratic governance.
In the Walmartocene Era of declining opportunities for American workers, some veterans may feel that even the promised entry-level jobs are worth fighting for.

HEADLINE: Obama's Second Inauguration

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Repeating the phrase "we the people," the president tried to appeal to Americans' better natures. 

 BODY:
The consensus on TV this morning was that Barack Obama's second inauguration wasn't as amazing as his first. The crowd was much smaller. People were just not as excited as they were four years ago.
But, call me sappy, when the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir sang "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," I felt pretty much the same thrill as on Jan. 20, 2009. 
Mr. Obama took over a country gravely damaged by his predecessor. (In fact I was convinced in 2008 that whoever succeeded President George W. Bush could only last one term). He got a raw deal, and then he helped prevent the Great Recession from turning into the Second Great Depression. Wall Street doesn't like Mr. Obama, but corporate profits have soared in the last four years. He ended the war in Iraq, and he's on his way to getting us out of Afghanistan. He passed health care reform. Along the way, he faced a Republican Party that was not only implacable in its opposition to his agenda but also hostile toward him personally (no doubt in part because of his race.).

Republican super PACs spent tens of millions of dollars trying to run Mr. Obama out of office. They failed - and not just because Mitt Romney was a bad candidate. Mr. Obama offered a contrast to the Republicans' ideology of intolerance and the vision of a government dedicated to helping the powerful and ignoring the powerless.
*
Vice President Joseph Biden was sworn into a second term by Justice Sonya Sotomayor, the first woman of color ever appointed to the Supreme Court. And Chief Justice John Roberts, who stunned the right wing by voting to uphold Mr. Obama's health reform law, administered the oath to the president.
Mr. Obama's second inaugural speech will not go down in history with Lincoln's or Franklin Delano Roosevelt's, but it wasn't a disappointment.
"We are made for this moment and we will seize it," he said, "so long as we seize it together. For we the people understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe that America's prosperity must rest up on the broad shoulders of a rising middle class."
Repeatedly deploying the phrase "we the people," Mr. Obama tried to appeal to Americans' better natures. "We are true to our creed," he said, "when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American, she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own."
And equality, for this president, explicitly includes equal rights for gay Americans. "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law - for if we are truly created equal then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well," Mr. Obama said. It's worth pausing to recognize how extraordinary it is that, sixteen years after DOMA, an American president alluded to same-sex marriage in his inaugural address.
I was, personally, upset that Mr. Obama did not discuss gun control. I hope that was not a sign of a lack of commitment on his part to the ambitious proposals he put forth last week. He did see fit to mention climate change and immigration reform.
But perhaps he wanted to avoid a topic that breeds division. Despite the bitterness of the last four years, Mr. Obama's message was that we can't succumb to ideological differences. "Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time - but it does require us to act in our time," he said. "For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect."
It is still amazing to have a president who acknowledges that imperfection will be with us always even as he insists on action - and who invited Beyoncé to sing the national anthem at his inauguration. She absolutely hit it out of the park.

HEADLINE: Is 2013 the New 1913?

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Substitute China for Germany and the United States for Britain, a scholar argues, drawing an inexact but troubling parallel to the year before the start of World War I. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - It's a provocative idea - and a disturbing one. The world in 2013 looks "eerily" like the world in 1913, writes Charles Emmerson, a senior research fellow at Chatham House.
Substitute the United States for the United Kingdom, and China for Germany, and the parallels are fairly clear. 
"The leading power of the age is in relative decline, beset by political crisis at home and by steadily eroding economic prowess," Mr. Emmerson writes in "Eve of Disaster," a piece in Foreign Policy magazine. 
"Rising powers are jostling for position in the four corners of the world, some seeking a new place for themselves within the current global order, others questioning its very legitimacy. Democracy and despotism are locked in uneasy competition.
"A world economy is interconnected as never before by flows of money, trade, and people, and by the unprecedented spread of new, distance-destroying technologies. A global society, perhaps even a global moral consciousness, is emerging as a result. Small-town America rails at the excessive power of Wall Street. Asia is rising once again. And, yes, there's trouble in the Middle East," he writes, asking: "Sound familiar?"
Yes, perhaps especially in Asia, where the rise of China is being felt strongly.
Consider this: In Hong Kong over the weekend, Shotaro Yachi, the foreign policy adviser to the Japanese prime minister, accused China of "breaching the rule of international order" (his remarks were delivered by a former Japanese official, Takujiro Hamada, The South China Morning Post reported).
"You will be a superpower - much feared but not much liked," Mr. Yachi warned China at the third Sino-U.S. Colloquium, organized by the China Energy Fund Committee.
China is asserting territorial claims by force, said Mr. Yachi, referring to Beijing's actions at the Diaoyu Islands, which Japan calls the Senkakus and which are claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan.
"I should like to ask you: Is this a China you want to show to the world?" he said. "Is this a China that your children will be proud of?"
A retired People's Liberation Army major general, Pan Zhenqiang, now an adviser to the Chinese government, characterized Mr. Yachi's statement as "very rude and arrogant" and warned Tokyo to treat China as an enemy at its peril, The Post reported. 
Jostling nations, a shifting global order: sound familiar?
Deeply involved in the quarrel is the United States, which has a security treaty with Japan. 
On Sunday, China harshly criticized the U.S. secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for presenting what it said was a distorted picture of its dispute with Japan over the islands in the East China Sea, as my colleague Jane Perlez wrote.
In Asia, the escalation is, arguably, increasingly reflected in national politics, with the December election of Japan's nationalist and conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, a sign of a rightward swing driven at least in part by fear of China, analysts say.
In fact, China's rise is "distorting" domestic politics among its neighbors, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, as they respond to its growing challenge, said Mark Harrison, a politics and culture specialist at the University of Tasmania.
In Japan, "a dimension of the right-wing resurgence is due to anxiety about China," Mr. Harrison said in a telephone interview.
Just how far that resurgence is going needs to be noted. Consider the following pieces of information about Mr. Abe's conservative cabinet, according to The Economist. Each is guaranteed to infuriate other Asian countries with memories of Japan's World War II brutality in the region, amid feelings in some quarters that Japan never really apologized enough.
"Fourteen in the cabinet belong to the League for Going to Worship Together at Yasukuni, a controversial Tokyo shrine that honors leaders executed for war crimes," The Economist notes. "Thirteen support Nihon Kaigi, a nationalist think-tank that advocates a return to 'traditional values' and rejects Japan's 'apology diplomacy' for its wartime misdeeds. Nine belong to a parliamentary association that wants the teaching of history in schools to give a better gloss to Japan's militarist era."
Sound familiar?
In his essay, Mr. Emmerson notes that "the United States in 2013 may not be a perfect analogue for Britain in 1913 (nor China in 2013 a perfect analogue for Germany in 1913)." But, he says, "The world of 1913 - brilliant, dynamic, interdependent - offers a warning."
"In 2013, at a time of similar global flux, the biggest mistake we could possibly make is to assume that the operating system of our own world will continue indefinitely, that all we need to do is stroll into the future, and that the future will inevitably be what we want it to be," he writes. "Those comforting times are over. We need to prepare ourselves for a much rougher ride ahead."

HEADLINE: Seeing Progress in Decisions That Aren't Black or White

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
Billy King was at courtside Monday afternoon, having a pregame chat with those irascible former Knicks, Larry Johnson and John Starks, when a reporter approached, note pad open.
''I'm not talking today,'' said King, the Nets' general manager, pleasant but firm.
Told that the intended subject had nothing to do with the state of his red-hot team -- it was a question about whether the N.B.A. had in certain operational ways become the realization of Martin Luther King's dream -- he dropped his guard and nodded. 
''I think a lot of credit has to go to David Stern,'' King said. ''His message to ownership has always been, 'It's not the color of skin, it's can a guy coach?' That's what set us on the path to where we are today.''
Where the Nets of Brooklyn and Kings County are for the moment is one game behind the first-place Knicks in the Atlantic Division less than a month after they presumably were left behind to scrounge the rest of the season for low-level playoff position. But on Dec. 28, King replaced his coach, Avery Johnson, with P. J. Carlesimo and the Nets promptly ripped off 11 victories in 13 games, including Monday's 88-85 nipping of the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, keyed by Joe Johnson's right-side jumper over J. R. Smith with 22.3 seconds left.
King, an executive who is black, fired Johnson, a coach who is black, and appointed as an interim the veteran Carlesimo, who is white, and didn't have to think twice about consternation or consequences.
Progress is when one makes decisions that are solely pragmatic, or at least one's perception of it.
When Mike D'Antoni, who is white, faced a virtual mutiny last season from Carmelo Anthony, who is black, and was replaced by Mike Woodson, who is black, there was never a suggestion that race was involved. In a similar development last month, Johnson had apparently lost the support of the star point guard Deron Williams and other Nets players -- most of whom, for the record, are black.
''When we felt we needed to make a change, we chose the guy with the most experience, and color had nothing to do with it,'' said King, relaxed in such conversation on a holiday when reflection on race is almost expected and on Monday was no doubt enhanced by the second inauguration of President Obama.
Referring to the N.F.L.'s Rooney Rule, which demands that teams at least interview minority candidates, King added: ''I always thought it was kind of ridiculous that you had to have a rule. Shouldn't be a rule; it should be based on what he's done and who he is.''
That broader scope comes into sharper focus when there is a history of open-mindedness for a sports league -- or any industry, for that matter -- to stand taller than its competition. The N.F.L., which had made progress in its once-pitiful hiring practices, has been looking so 20th century of late after 15 head coaching and general manager positions became vacant and not a single minority candidate was hired.
Stern has taken his lumps through the years for a variety of issues, and he was mindlessly assailed by the broadcaster Bryant Gumbel for lording over his predominantly African-American player constituency during last season's lockout. But on Stern's watch, the N.B.A. has consistently scored high in minority hiring measures, has ushered in Michael Jordan's purchase of the Charlotte franchise and generally has been a leader in progressive thinking.
Not that it couldn't do better. Billy King, for example, is one of five black general managers in a 30-team league. ''That's maybe an area we can grow in, but you have guys up there and some of them have been recycled a little bit,'' said the 18-year veteran Jerry Stackhouse, who signed with the Nets this season with the intention of being an unofficial player-assistant to Avery Johnson. ''You know, with Avery, I don't think one person even raised the question of whether it was a white-black thing. Avery's a good enough coach that he'll land on his feet.''
If he does, maybe he will bring Stackhouse into the fraternity as an assistant. If he doesn't, the well-traveled Stackhouse figures to have options. He will also keep his eye on Scott Skiles, his onetime coach, who recently resigned in Milwaukee but doesn't figure to be unemployed long.
''It's a brotherhood, always about relationships,'' Stackhouse said, noting that the N.B.A. has become a coaching haven for former players, white and black. Though the odds still surely favor the smaller pool of white players.
Certainly the N.B.A. is a fairer place than the league Woodson broke into with the Knicks as a player in 1980. For years, black players would nag white teammates not to forget them when they ascended into head-coaching jobs or the front office.
Currently one of 12 black head coaches, Woodson is an increasingly rare N.B.A. coach who can remember the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968.
''I think I was 10 years old,'' he said. ''I didn't understand the dynamics of it, but I think he was fighting for all the people, not just African-American people. He's probably the reason I'm in the position I'm in today and a lot of people.''
Even Carlesimo, in a sense, despite the very real racial undertones of the 1997 incident in which he was attacked and choked by Latrell Sprewell when they were feuding coach and player at Golden State.
Stern's league has navigated many such minefields, emerging stronger for them.
''Things have changed,'' Woodson said, though not in conclusion. ''Hopefully, they'll get better.''

HEADLINE: A Call for Progressive Values: Evolved, Unapologetic and Urgent

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- He did not utter the words, but President Obama suffused his second Inaugural Address with the spirit of a favorite phrase: the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s call to heed ''the fierce urgency of now.''
This was a president unbound from much of what defined him upon taking office four years ago, a man clearly cognizant of time already running down on his opportunity to make his imprint on the country and on history. 
Gone were the vision of a new kind of high-minded politics, the constraint of a future re-election campaign and the weight of unrealistic expectations. In their place was an unapologetic argument that modern liberalism was perfectly consistent with the spirit of the founders and a notice that, with no immediate crisis facing the nation, Mr. Obama intended to use the full powers of his office for progressive values.
''We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect,'' he said.
After spending much of his first term ''evolving'' on the question of same-sex marriage and doing too little in the eyes of many African-Americans to address poverty and civil rights, he invoked ''Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall'' and cited responsibility for the poor, sick and displaced.
He acknowledged the budget deficit but emphasized protecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. He mentioned jobs but highlighted global warming. He lauded the bravery and strength of the United States armed forces, but started his foreign policy remarks by asserting that ''enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.''
Mr. Obama came to office four years ago all but consumed by what he inherited: two wars and an economy in free fall. He then confronted an exhausting series of crises and political problems at home and abroad: budget showdowns, a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Middle East turmoil, the rise of the Tea Party movement.
Through it all, he chose to wage additional battles of choice, most notably his successful push to overhaul the health insurance system. But not until this point, with the economy gradually mending, one war over and another winding down, with Osama bin Laden dead and the Democratic Party drawing strength from the nation's changing demographics, has he had the opportunity to master his own presidency.
The policy details of what that effort entails will emerge over the next month through his State of the Union address and his budget, and many or most of them will encounter strong opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Monday's address to the nation and its political class was intended to set out the value system that informs the policy.
Mr. Obama has always had a dialectical quality: pragmatism versus ideology, bold versus cautious, hawk versus dove, post-racial versus man of color. Those tensions no doubt remain.
But since Election Day, he has seemed to be choosing between them more than in the past. His decision after the Newtown massacre to embark on a full-scale effort to crack down on gun violence showed him to be less shackled to political wisdom about what is possible or electorally wise. His willingness to stare down Republicans over raising the debt limit -- and winning -- showed that he is less likely nowadays to start a negotiation by moving to the center and trying to find common ground.
To some Republicans, it is what they warned of all along: a president who ran as a centrist proving to be an unreconstructed liberal. It was no doubt hard for some of them to accept a scolding for treating ''name calling as reasoned debate'' -- a phrase in his Monday address -- from a man who won re-election by excoriating Mitt Romney as a job-killing plutocrat.
''I think all Americans would hope that President Obama, now that he's not facing re-election, would actually sit down and honestly work with Republicans who are very sincere in our desire to fix these problems,'' said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin.
But, Mr. Johnson added, that was not the sentiment he detected from Mr. Obama on Monday. ''You've got to sit down in good faith,'' he said. ''But I just don't see that with this president.''
Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, said, ''I'm surprised we've so abruptly noticed after this election we're now managing America's demise, not America's great future.''
Mr. Obama's address nodded to ideological inclusiveness but did not repeat his view from four years ago that it was time to end the ''recriminations and worn-out dogmas'' that characterized Washington battles. It recognized the power of individual liberty but argued that only through collective action could the nation remain prosperous and secure.
But most of all, it sought to elevate to a more prominent place in the political debate the question of how best the nation should address the ''little girl born into the bleakest poverty,'' the parents of a child with a disability, the gay men and women seeking to marry, voters facing hurdles because of their race and immigrants seeking a toehold in a land of opportunity.
''We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few,'' Mr. Obama said.
In many ways it was an address, given on a day that commemorates King, that reflected not just the civil rights leader's ''fierce urgency of now'' but the lines that immediately followed it in his ''I Have a Dream'' speech on the National Mall 50 years ago.
''This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism,'' King said. ''Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.''

HEADLINE: Cameron to Deliver Delayed Europe Speech on Wednesday

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL and JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron will deliver his postponed address on Britain's future relations with Europe on Wednesday, his office said Monday.
Mr. Cameron had planned to deliver the speech in Amsterdam on Friday but delayed it amid the Algerian hostage crisis, in which at least three Britons were killed. However, Mr. Cameron's office released excerpts suggesting he had planned to explicitly warn that Britain might leave the European Union unless the bloc changed the way it was run.
Under pressure from his Conservative Party, Mr. Cameron has signaled his readiness for a referendum on the relationship with Europe, although the precise question to be asked is not clear. 
The United States has been unusually public in its insistence that Britain, a close ally, stay in the union. Last week, a White House spokesman quoted President Obama as telling Mr. Cameron by telephone that ''the United States values a strong U.K. in a strong European Union, which makes critical contributions to peace, prosperity and security in Europe and around the world.''
On Sunday the American ambassador in London, Louis B. Susman, told Sky News, ''We cannot imagine a strong E.U. without a vibrant partner in the U.K.''
''That is what we hope will come about, but it is up to the British people to decide what they want,'' Mr. Susman said, according to the news agency Press Association.
Mr. Cameron's initial choice of Amsterdam for the speech reflected a long tradition of using European cities for British pronouncements on Europe. But a spokesman for Mr. Cameron, speaking on the condition of anonymity under departmental protocols, said Monday that the speech would be given in London and would include both European and British perspectives.
''There is a debate going on across the E.U.,'' the spokesman said. ''There is also an active debate going on here in the U.K. The prime minister's speech will be reflecting both those aspects.''
According to the excerpts released last week, Mr. Cameron planned to note ''a gap between the E.U. and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is -- yes -- felt particularly acutely in Britain.''
''If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift toward the exit. I do not want that to happen. I want the European Union to be a success, and I want a relationship between Britain and the E.U. that keeps us in it.''
Liam Fox, a former defense secretary and a leading Conservative euroskeptic, said he had been briefed on the address's content. ''If that is the speech that is finally delivered,'' he said, ''a great many of us will think that it's a speech that we've been waiting a long time for any prime minister to deliver.''
Foreign Secretary William Hague said Sunday there was a strong case for seeking ''fresh consent'' about the relationship between the European Union and Britain, which held a referendum in 1975 approving membership in the union's precursor.
''We want to succeed in the European Union'' he said, adding, ''But we have to recognize that the European Union has changed a lot since the referendum of 1975, and that there have been not only great achievements to the E.U.'s name but some things that have gone badly wrong, such as the euro.''

HEADLINE: Obama Offers a Liberal Vision in Inaugural Address: 'We Must Act': Speech Gives Climate Goals Center Stage

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama made addressing climate change the most prominent policy vow of his second Inaugural Address, setting in motion what Democrats say will be a deliberately paced but aggressive campaign built around the use of his executive powers to sidestep Congressional opposition.
''We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,'' Mr. Obama said on Monday at the start of eight sentences on the subject, more than he devoted to any other specific area. ''Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.''
The central place he gave to the subject seemed to answer the question of whether he considered it a realistic second-term priority. He devoted scant attention to it in the campaign and has delivered a mixed message about its importance since the election. 
Mr. Obama is heading into the effort having extensively studied the lessons from his first term, when he failed to win passage of comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming. This time, the White House plans to avoid such a fight and instead focus on what it can do administratively to reduce emissions from power plants, increase the efficiency of home appliances and have the federal government itself produce less carbon pollution.
Mr. Obama's path on global warming is a case study in his evolving sense of the limits of his power and his increased willingness to work around intense conservative opposition rather than seek compromise. After coming to office four years ago on a pledge to heal the planet and turn back the rise of the seas, he is proceeding cautiously this time, Democrats said, intent on making sure his approach is vetted politically, economically and technologically so as not to risk missing what many environmental advocates say could be the last best chance for years to address the problem.
The centerpiece will be action by the Environmental Protection Agency to clamp down further on emissions from coal-burning power plants under regulations still being drafted -- and likely to draw legal challenges.
The administration plans to supplement that step by adopting new energy efficiency standards for home appliances and buildings, a seemingly small advance that can have a substantial impact by reducing demand for electricity. Those standards would echo the sharp increase in fuel economy that the administration required from automakers in the first term.
The Pentagon, one of the country's largest energy users, is also taking strides toward cutting use and converting to renewable fuels.
Mr. Obama's aides are planning those steps in conjunction with a campaign to build public support and head off political opposition in a way the administration did not the last time around. But the White House has cautioned activists not to expect full-scale engagement while Congress remains occupied by guns, immigration and the budget.
The president's emphasis on climate change drew fire from conservatives. Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a group financed by the Koch brothers, who made a fortune in refining and other oil interests, criticized the speech in a statement. ''His address read like a liberal laundry list with global warming at the top,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''Americans have rejected environmental extremism in the past and they will again.''
Still, Mr. Obama has signaled that he intends to expand his own role in making a public case for why action is necessary and why, despite the conservative argument that such changes would cost jobs and leave the United States less competitive with rising powers like China, they could have economic benefits by promoting a clean-energy industry. In addition to the prominent mention on Monday, Mr. Obama also used strong language in his speech on election night, referring to ''the destructive power of a warming planet.''
Those remarks stood in contrast to Mr. Obama's comments at his first postelection news conference, when he said he planned to convene ''a wide-ranging conversation'' about climate change and was vague about action. He is also expected to highlight his plans in his State of the Union address next month and in his budget plan soon afterward.
Beyond new policies, the administration is seeking to capitalize on the surge of natural gas production over the past few years. As a cheaper and cleaner alternative to coal, natural gas gives it a chance to argue that coal is less economically attractive.
After the defeat in 2010 of legislation that would have capped carbon emissions and issued tradable permits for emissions, Mr. Obama turned to regulation and financing for alternative energy. Despite the lack of comprehensive legislation, emissions have declined roughly 10 percent since he took office, a result both of the economic slowdown and of energy efficiency moves by government and industry.
The administration is discussing with Congressional Democrats, some of whom are leery of the issue because their states are home to coal businesses, how to head off a Republican counterattack on the new regulations. Democrats are paying particular attention to the likelihood of Republicans employing a little-used procedure to block new regulations with a simple majority vote.
Senate Democrats are also girding for a battle when Mr. Obama nominates a new head of the E.P.A. The agency, excoriated by Republicans as a job-killing bureaucracy, would take the lead in setting the new regulations.
The approach is a turnabout from the first term, when Mr. Obama's guiding principle in trying to pass the cap-and-trade bill was that a negotiated legislative solution was likely to be more politically palatable than regulation by executive fiat. Now there is a broad expectation that he will follow up his first big use of the E.P.A.'s powers to rein in emissions -- proposed rules last year for new power plants -- with a plan to crack down on emissions from existing power plants.
According to estimates from the Natural Resources Defense Council, emissions from current coal-fired plants could be reduced by more than 25 percent by 2020, yielding large health and environmental benefits at relatively low cost. Such an approach would allow Mr. Obama to fulfill his 2009 pledge to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by about 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, the group says.
''There's a really big opportunity, perhaps bigger than most people realize,'' said Dan Lashof, director of the defense council's climate and clean air program.
The regulatory push will be particularly important because Mr. Obama has little prospect of winning as much money for clean energy as he did in his first term, with Republicans now in control of the House. Despite the renewed attention to climate change following Hurricane Sandy and record-high temperatures in the continental United States last year, there is little sign that the politics of the issue will get any easier for Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Coup Attempt by Rebel Soldiers Is Said to Fail in Eritrea

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
GARSEN, Kenya -- Eritrea, a sliver of a nation in the Horn of Africa that is one of the most secretive and repressive countries in the world, was cast into confusion on Monday after mutinous soldiers stormed the Ministry of Information and took over the state-run television service, apparently in a coup attempt.
According to several people with close contacts inside Eritrea, the coup attempt failed, with government troops quelling the would-be rebellion and no one rising up in the streets. But many analysts said it was only a matter of time before President Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea's brash and steely leader for the past 20 years, is confronted again -- and most likely from within. 
''There's a lot of dissatisfaction within the armed forces,'' said Dan Connell, a professor at Simmons College in Boston and the author of several books on Eritrea. ''If this is suppressed, it won't be the end.''
Eritrea is often called the North Korea of Africa because it is so isolated and authoritarian, with few friends and thousands of defectors in recent years as Mr. Isaias tightens his grip and the economy teeters on the brink of ruin.
In the early 1990s, when Mr. Isaias first took power, Eritrea was hailed as a beacon of hope in Africa, a country of low crime, ethnic harmony and can-do spirit along the Red Sea. The Eritreans fought for years in trenches and from craggy mountaintops to defeat a Soviet-backed Ethiopian government and win their independence.
But the euphoria did not last. In the late 1990s, Eritrea and Ethiopia waged a costly war over their shared border, in which tens of thousands of people died. Shortly afterward, Mr. Isaias rounded up political dissidents and journalists, dooming them to years in prison, often in sweltering, underground shipping containers.
Thousands of young Eritreans have been drafted into the army and then required to work indefinitely for the government for pittance wages in what is called ''national service.'' Each year, many young people risk their lives to escape. Eritrea has waged war with just about all of its neighbors, and the United Nations has imposed sanctions on Eritrea over what is suspected to be its support of Somali militants.
By nightfall on Monday, it seemed that the government had beaten back the mutineers, with some analysts saying that the government broadcaster, Eri-TV, was back on the air.
The rebel soldiers, believed to number around 100, made it as far as the director's office in the Ministry of Information, forcing him to read a statement on air calling for the release of political prisoners. Then the broadcast abruptly cut out. They also may have briefly taken hostage Mr. Isaias's daughter, Elsa, who is said to work in the ministry.
It was not clear what happened to the renegade soldiers; analysts said that troops loyal to the government had surrounded the Ministry of Information and that the mutineers would most likely be captured and imprisoned.
The State Department said that the situation remained fluid, and the small embassy in Asmara, Eritrea's capital, sent out a warning on Monday to the few American citizens living there. ''The U.S. Embassy has been made aware of increased military presence in some sections of Asmara,'' the warning said. ''Employees of the U.S. government have been advised to limit their movements within the city, avoid large gatherings and exercise caution. We strongly recommend that private U.S. citizens do likewise.''

HEADLINE: Despite Signs of Progress in the Euro Zone, Fears of Complacency Linger

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and JACK EWING

 BODY:
PARIS - This may be the year that Europe stops being the ticking time bomb of the global economy.
Ireland is on track to leave international bailout limbo by summer. Talk of Greece's departure from the euro is off the table. And financial speculators have generally stopped betting the euro zone will blow up.
But even as the sense of emergency fades, Europe is potentially facing a starker problem.
For three years, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and a phalanx of policy makers have been working to shore up the euro's foundations to prevent the currency union from coming apart. As they gather with academics, executives and various experts this week at the World Economic Forum, which opens Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland, the biggest concern is that leaders might become less vigilant now that the heat is off, ushering in a spate of new troubles that could dog the euro for years to come. 
"The risk is that complacency takes hold because there is no more urgency in the crisis, and that everything that has been done up until now will be deemed sufficient," said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. If that happens, he warned, "Europe will turn into the next Japan, and become a permanently depressed or stagnating economic area."
Ms. Merkel might be forgiven for feeling a sense of vindication. Her deliberate approach to crisis management and refusal to get too far ahead of German public opinion has often frustrated her euro zone peers and foreign allies. And yet, the strategy seems to have worked - so far, at least. Ms. Merkel, who is to speak in Davos on Thursday, and other European leaders have generally done just enough to contain the crisis without alienating taxpayers.
Much of the credit for the current calm in Europe goes to Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. He appeased financial markets with his promise last summer to do whatever it took to preserve the euro, including buying the government bonds of Spain if necessary to keep a lid on the country's borrowing costs.
The effect of Mr. Draghi's promise has been evident: financial markets have stopped driving the borrowing costs of Spain and Italy toward the danger levels that led Ireland, Greece and Portugal to reach for international financial lifelines. Today, few people fear that Europe's southern countries will break away from the euro union.
Other dire prospects, like Germany and other Northern European countries fleeing the euro union to avoid getting caught in a quagmire, have also dropped off the watch list. If anything, the focus of anxiety is the fiscal situation in the United States, where gridlock in Washington has become just as debilitating for the country's finances as the euro policy paralysis was for European politicians.
"Some European policy makers who visited the United States recently were delighted to see that because of the fiscal cliff, Europe wasn't on every channel," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. "There is an ecstasy over the fact that they won't blow apart tomorrow."
Still, Professor Rogoff added, Europe must revive economic growth to fully address its problems. "And even if they do, that's not a long-term solution," he said. "They need to integrate more fully, or they will fall apart."
Europe's political leaders have taken important steps to improve spending discipline among euro members, provide a financial backstop for troubled euro zone countries and consolidate supervision of banks. Despite many imperfections, the measures seem to have been enough to convince investors that officials are slowly building a more resilient currency union.
"European countries have shown their resolve in making the euro a success and reaffirmed the deep political commitment to work together toward a stronger union," Vítor Constâncio, the vice president of the European Central Bank, told an audience in Beijing on Jan. 12.
But leaders have yet to address some serious flaws in the structure of the euro zone. For example, they have not solved the problem of how to wind down terminally ill banks without sticking taxpayers with the bill. And they are far away from a deposit insurance fund for Europe, which means the risk of bank runs remains.
"In order to define a turning point, you need a lot of factors besides the stabilization of financial markets," Mr. Draghi said this month.
But coming events could undermine confidence. Germany will hold national elections in September, which could make Ms. Merkel even more cautious than usual and stall euro zone decision-making. Already, her main rivals pulled off an upset in regional elections this weekend in Lower Saxony.
Italian elections are also looming. Mario Monti, the prime minister, who restored Italy's international credibility and is to speak at Davos on Wednesday, faces a public that is grumpy about a rollback of job protections and other policy overhauls. Silvio Berlusconi, a former Italian prime minister who presided over years of an economic standstill, is aiming for a populist comeback.
In France, President François Hollande's pledge to bring the deficit down to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year to adhere to the rules governing euro membership may be challenged if France's military engagement in Mali and the surrounding region turns into a drawn-out affair.
Across the channel, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who is scheduled to speak in Davos on Thursday morning, has sounded warnings that the country might leave the European Union if changes in its administration are not made. "The danger is that Europe will fail and that the British people will drift toward the exit," according to prepared text of a speech that Mr. Cameron postponed delivering last week because of developments in the hostage crisis in Algeria.
In the meantime, the severe effects of prolonged austerity in several European countries are leaving deep social scars. Tax increases and steep spending cuts have ground many European citizens deeper than ever into hardship, prompting millions to demonstrate in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Recessionary economies in those countries are expected to get worse before they improve.
In Greece, where austerity has hit the hardest, people are burning trash and wood this winter for lack of money to pay electricity bills, and the government's efforts to enact structural overhauls intended to turn the economy around and attract foreign investors continue to lag.
And then there is Germany, which itself is being tugged into a slowdown as its cash-poor southern neighbors continue to refrain from buying Audis and other high-price German goods.
Unemployment in the euro zone continues to climb: the jobless rate in the 17 countries of the bloc hit a record 11.8 percent in November. Youth unemployment has surpassed 50 percent in Spain and Greece, a stratosphere of despair. Thousands of bright young people continue to flee Greece, Ireland, Spain and other countries every month for the booming economies of Australia and Canada.
Portuguese workers are even going to Africa in search of a better future, as the middle class there grows along with improving economic conditions on the southern part of the African continent.
Yet painful adjustments are starting to bear some fruit. Labor costs have come down in countries including Spain and Portugal, helping make their work forces more competitive in the region. In Spain, for instance, where unit labor costs have fallen 4 percent since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, the labor market is now so alluring that Ford, Renault and Volkswagen have announced plans to expand production there.
In addition, the alarming flight of deposits from banks in Spain has come to a stop.
The euro zone's problems have proved an opportunity for some countries to remove structural impediments to growth. In France, where Mr. Hollande has promised to make the economy more competitive, labor unions have agreed to a deal to overhaul swaths of the notoriously rigid labor market.
The deal would tame some of the French labor code's most confounding restrictions, including lengthy hiring and firing procedures and outsize business taxes, as the country tries to lift its competitiveness, curb unemployment and improve the budget.
"Is the worst over? Probably yes," analysts at Barclays Capital wrote in a recent note to clients.
That will be especially true if leaders and businesses persist in using the crisis as a chance to renew European competitiveness.
Some countries may have made enough economic overhauls to enjoy substantial growth, but once the crisis is past, said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels, "there are a lot of nuts still to crack."
Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Antonio Frasconi, Woodcut Master, Dies at 93

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
In 1953, Time magazine called Antonio Frasconi America's foremost practitioner of the ancient art of the woodcut. Four decades later, Art Journal called him the best of his generation.
Mr. Frasconi did not reach this pinnacle by adhering to orthodoxies. He found inspiration in comic books as well as the old masters. He decried art education, saying the average student does not learn the pertinent questions, much less the answers. He abhorred art that dwelt on aesthetics at the expense of social problems. He repeatedly addressed war, racism and poverty, and devoted a decade to completing a series of woodcut portraits of people who were tortured and killed under a rightist military dictatorship in his home country, Uruguay, from 1973 to 1985.
''A sort of anger builds in you, so you try to spill it back in your work,'' he said in a 1994 interview with Americas, a magazine of the Organization of American States. 
Mr. Frasconi, who died on Jan. 8 at 93, illustrated more than 100 books, and his work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library, the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian. His woodcuts appeared on album and magazine covers, holiday cards, calendars and posters, and in exhibitions around the world. Several of his children's books won awards. In 1963 he designed a stamp to honor the centennial of the National Academy of Sciences.
In 1968 he represented Uruguay at the Venice Biennale, exhibiting prints from 20 years of work.
Much of that work was done in the studio at his home in Norwalk, Conn., where the views of migrating birds and passing seasons from the window influenced his art. He built the house in 1957, and his son Miguel said he died there.
Mr. Frasconi's was patient and meticulous in his art, which involves making an impression on paper from a design carved in a block of wood. Before producing a woodcut titled ''Sunrise -- Fulton Fish Market'' in 1953, he spent three months wandering Lower Manhattan's wharves and the holds of fishing boats. He spent hour upon hour studying ''just how a man lifts a box,'' he said.
He then spent three weeks carving five wood blocks, each to apply a different color, as they are stamped successively on the same sheet of paper. He said the capricious nature of wood governed many artistic decisions. He loved the hands-on experience of working with wood, some of which he gathered from the beach in front of his home.
''Sometimes the wood gives you a break,'' he told Time in 1963, ''and matches your conception of the way it is grained. But often you must surrender to the grain, find the movement of the scene, the mood of the work, in the way the grain runs.''
Mr. Frasconi said he took up the art after being attracted to the idea of making multiple prints, in part so he could offer art to people at reasonable prices. The woodcuts of Paul Gauguin were an enormous influence, he said.
Antonio Rudolfo Frasconi was born to Italian immigrant parents on April 28, 1919, in Buenos Aires; a few weeks later his family moved to Uruguay. His father was frequently unemployed, and his mother worked in a restaurant and as a seamstress. He dropped out of art school at 12 because he was bored with copying from plaster casts of classical sculpture and became a printer's apprentice. On his own, he made posters deriding Franco and Hitler, which he signed ''Chico.''
In 1945 he came to New York on a one-year scholarship to the Art Students League, and the next year he had a show at the Brooklyn Museum. After moving to California, he worked as a gardener and as a guard at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, where he had an exhibition.
Returning to New York, he collaborated with the adapter Glenway Wescott and the book designer Joseph Blumenthal on ''12 Fables of Aesop,'' which was published by the Museum of Modern Art and honored by the American Institute of Graphic Arts as one of the year's 50 best books. He illustrated a poem by Federico García Lorca on the brutality of Franco's police.
A later political work about the Vietnam War superimposed bombsights on terror-stricken peasants. He illustrated selections from the poems of Herman Melville to comment on the Ohio National Guard's killing of students at Kent State University in 1970.
For many years Mr. Frasconi, a citizen of both Uruguay and the United States, taught at Purchase College of the State University of New York.
His first marriage, to Rene Farmer, ended in divorce. His second wife, Leona Pierce, a noted woodcut artist, died in 2002 after 50 years of marriage. In addition to his son Miguel, Mr. Frasconi is survived by another son, Pablo, and a granddaughter.
Some of Mr. Frasconi's work was devilishly playful. His 1952 book, ''The World Upside Down,'' pictured a bull butchering a human, a man in a bird cage while a bird cavorts outside, and a sheep herding a flock of humans. A dog sleeps in bed, while a man slumbers in a doghouse on the floor. A fire hydrant is nearby, apparently in case the man needs it.

HEADLINE: Cutting Red Tape on the E.U.'s Road to Change

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- When Belsat TV started broadcasting seven years ago, Belarussians finally gained access to independent television news. The monopoly of public broadcasting tightly controlled by President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko was broken.
Belsat TV works out of small offices in Warsaw, where it has been operating on an annual budget of &#x20ac;6 million, or $8 million. The Polish government has provided most of that, with additional contributions from Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands.
Despite the European Union's commitment to spreading democracy and human rights, Brussels has given no funding to Belsat TV. 
Late last year, money became so scarce that Agnieszka Romaszewska-Guzy, Belsat TV's director, was forced to make programming cuts. ''We simply ran out of money,'' she said.
Financial support, however, may be on its way through the European Endowment for Democracy, or E.E.D., which recently began operating in Brussels.
The private foundation is named and modeled after the influential National Endowment for Democracy, which the United States set up in 1984 to assist pro-democracy independent movements like the Solidarity trade union in Poland. The E.E.D.'s goal is to support pro-democracy individuals or groups operating under authoritarian regimes.
''The promotion of democratic values is Europe's role. That is what defines us,'' said Jerzy Pomianowski, who was appointed executive director of E.E.D. this month. ''Any time support for the undersupported is necessary, the E.E.D. will act in a flexible manner.''
But why is there a need for the E.E.D. in the first place? Doesn't the European Union pride itself on supporting pro-democracy organizations and promoting its values of human rights anyway?
''The E.U. bureaucracy and lack of transparency is terrible,'' Ms. Romaszewska-Guzy said. ''Applying for a grant from the E.U. is a bureaucratic nightmare.''
Mr. Pomianowski agreed. ''The E.U. has established a highly bureaucratic and administrative process for applying for funds, getting them agreed and released,'' he said. ''The E.U. institutions have a lot of money, but they are cautious about spending it. And they have to consider the taxpayers.''
The E.E.D. aims to avoid bureaucracy. ''It will not become blocked by procedural hurdles,'' said Pavol Deme, one of the foundation's board members, who is based in Slovakia for the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
The E.E.D. is necessary for another reason: enlargement fatigue.
In the past, the prospect of joining the Union motivated governments, opposition parties and independent movements in wider Europe to introduce democratic reforms.
But today, ''E.U. enlargement is no longer the driving engine of European foreign policy,'' Mr. Demes said. Because of that, he added, ''certain countries are not interested in receiving E.U. assistance and do not want conditionality.''
As a result, pro-democracy groups have become more vulnerable. But instead of responding in a more creative and flexible manner, the European Union has often frozen them out.
''One of the conditions of the E.U. for providing money is that organizations need to be registered,'' Mr. Pomianowski said. ''In many countries, this means that they have been vetted by the regime.'' That is why, he added, the E.E.D. wants to support unregistered groups.
''That is exactly what N.E.D. did with Solidarity under Communism and continues to do so with other pro-democracy individuals and groups throughout the world,'' said Carl Gershman, the N.E.D. president.
Even the Council of Europe is no longer an organization where human rights activists and groups can expect unequivocal support.
The council was established in 1949 to develop common and democratic principles throughout Europe based on the European Convention on Human Rights.
But since the 1990s, when the council admitted Russia and the authoritarian regimes of Central Asia, advocacy groups and diplomats say the organization has become a bitter ideological battleground.
On the one side are countries committed to holding the members of the Council of Europe accountable to the organization's values. On the other side are those, including Russia and Azerbaijan, that resort to corruption and bribery to divert criticism from human rights violations.
''Bribes and gifts are about softening, even stopping'' the council's criticism ''of rampant human rights violations, especially in Central Asia,'' said a senior European diplomat who requested anonymity because the issue is sensitive.
No wonder that the E.E.D. wants to start working as quickly as possible.
It has a small budget. The European Commission has allocated &#x20ac;6 million for running costs. Many E.U. member states have together contributed an additional &#x20ac;10 million, but Germany, Italy, France, Britain and Spain have not donated.
Mr. Pomianowski insists that, with such funding, the E.E.D. will be independent from political interference. Belsat TV cannot wait to apply.

HEADLINE: Obama Offers a Liberal Vision in Inaugural Address: 'We Must Act': Inaugural Stresses Theme of Civil and Gay Rights -- Safety Net Praised

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Reporting was contributed by Jeremy W. Peters, Michael D. Shear, Jennifer Steinhauer and Jonathan Weisman.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Barack Hussein Obama ceremonially opened his second term on Monday with an assertive Inaugural Address that offered a robust articulation of modern liberalism in America, arguing that ''preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.''
On a day that echoed with refrains from the civil rights era and tributes to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Obama dispensed with the post-partisan appeals of four years ago to lay out a forceful vision of advancing gay rights, showing more tolerance toward illegal immigrants, preserving the social welfare safety net and acting to stop climate change.
At times he used his speech, delivered from the West Front of the Capitol, to reprise arguments from the fall campaign, rebutting the notion expressed by conservative opponents that America risks becoming ''a nation of takers'' and extolling the value of proactive government in society. Instead of declaring the end of ''petty grievances,'' as he did taking the oath as the 44th president in 2009, he challenged Republicans to step back from their staunch opposition to his agenda. 
''Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-old debates about the role of government for all time -- but it does require us to act in our time,'' he said in the 18-minute address. ''For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act.''
Mr. Obama used Abraham Lincoln's Bible, as he did four years ago, but this time added Dr. King's Bible as well to mark the holiday honoring the civil rights leader. He became the first president ever to mention the word ''gay'' in an Inaugural Address as he equated the drive for same-sex marriage to the quests for racial and gender equality.
The festivities at the Capitol came a day after Mr. Obama officially took the oath in a quiet ceremony with his family at the White House on the date set by the Constitution. With Inauguration Day falling on a Sunday, the swearing-in was then repeated for an energized mass audience a day later, accompanied by the pomp and parade that typically surround the quadrennial tradition.
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered on a brisk but bright day, a huge crowd by any measure, though far less than the record turnout four years ago. If the day felt restrained compared with the historic mood the last time, it reflected a more restrained moment in the life of the country. The hopes and expectations that loomed so large with Mr. Obama's taking the office in 2009, even amid economic crisis, have long since faded into a starker sense of the limits of his presidency.
Now 51 and noticeably grayer, Mr. Obama appeared alternately upbeat and reflective. When he re-entered the Capitol at the conclusion of the ceremony, he stopped his entourage to turn back toward the cheering crowds on the National Mall.
''I want to take a look, one more time,'' he said. ''I'm not going to see this again.''
If the president was wistful, his message was firm. He largely eschewed foreign policy except to recommend engagement over war, and instead focused on addressing poverty and injustice at home. He did little to adopt the language of the opposition, as he has done at moments in the past, and instead directly confronted conservative philosophy.
''The commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us,'' he said. ''They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.''
The phrase, ''nation of takers,'' was a direct rebuke to Republicans like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, last year's vice-presidential nominee, and several opposition lawmakers took umbrage at the president's tone.
''I would have liked to see a little more on outreach and working together,'' said Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican who lost to Mr. Obama four years ago. ''There was not, as I've seen in other inaugural speeches, 'I want to work with my colleagues.' ''
Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership, said that from the opening prayer to the closing benediction, ''It was apparent our country's in chaos and what our great president has brought us is upheaval.'' He added, ''We're now managing America's demise, not America's great future.''
Mr. Obama struck a more conciliatory note during an unscripted toast during lunch with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall after the ceremony. ''Regardless of our political persuasions and perspectives, I know that all of us serve because we believe that we can make America for future generations,'' he said.
For the nation's 57th presidential inauguration, a broad section of downtown Washington was off limits to vehicles and a major bridge across the Potomac River was closed to regular traffic as military Humvees were stationed at strategic locations around the city.
Joining the president through the long day were the first lady, Michelle Obama, and their daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11. The young girls were playful. Malia at one point sneaked up behind her father and cried out, ''Boo!'' Sasha used a smartphone to take a picture of her parents kissing in the reviewing stand, then made them do it again. Both girls bounced with the martial music at the Capitol.
Mr. Obama's day began with a service at St. John's Episcopal Church, across Lafayette Square from the White House, where the Rev. Andy Stanley told him to ''leverage that power for the benefit of other people in the room.'' At the Capitol, Myrlie Evers-Williams, the civil rights leader, delivered the invocation and the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir performed the ''Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sworn in at 11:46 a.m. by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The singer James Taylor then performed ''America the Beautiful.''
At 11:50 a.m., Mr. Obama was sworn in again by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. After the two mangled the 35-word oath four years ago, necessitating a just-in-case do-over the next day, the president and chief justice this time carefully recited the words in tandem without error, although Mr. Obama did swallow the word ''states.''
Mr. Obama was more specific in discussing policy than presidents typically are in an Inaugural Address. Particularly noticeable was his recommitment to fighting climate change. ''We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,'' he said.
He referred only implicitly to terrorism, the issue that has so consumed the nation for the past decade, but offered a more inward-looking approach to foreign policy, saying that ''enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.'' He also talked of overhauling immigration rules so ''bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our work force, rather than expelled from our country.''
For a president who opposed same-sex marriage as recently as nine months ago, the speech was a clear call for gay rights, as he noted the journey ''through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall,'' symbolically linking seminal moments in the struggles for equal rights for women, blacks and gay men and lesbians.
''Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,'' he said.
The expanse between the Capitol and the Washington Monument was filled with supporters, many of them African-Americans attending only the second inauguration of a black president. As large TV screens flickered in and out and the audio often warbled, the ceremony was difficult to follow for many braving the Washington chill.
The speech was followed by song, poem and benediction from Kelly Clarkson, Richard Blanco, the Rev. Luis Leon and Beyoncé. The president and first lady got out of their motorcade twice to walk stretches along Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Biden and Jill Biden did as well, and the vice president greeted bystanders with fist-pumping gusto.
The two families then settled into the specially built bulletproof reviewing stand to watch the parade. Mr. Obama, who often uses Nicorette to tame an old smoking habit, was spotted chewing as the bands marched past.
In the evening, the Obamas attended two official inaugural balls, down from 10 four years ago. The president, in tuxedo with white tie, danced at each of them with the first lady, in a custom Jason Wu ruby chiffon and velvet gown, to Al Green's ''Let's Stay Together,'' performed by Jennifer Hudson. The Obamas were back at the White House by 10:15 p.m.

HEADLINE: Smoothing the Airport Wait

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
On a recent business trip to New York, Joe Pullin of Novi, Mich., did something he would have considered unthinkable not long ago.
Rather than rush off the plane and into a cab headed into Manhattan, he lingered at the arrival gate at La Guardia Airport, stopping for a leisurely lunch at Bisoux, a French bistro, and using the iPad mounted on his table to order his meal, check his e-mail and pay the bill.
''I'm very impressed. I think it adds another dimension to this airport that never existed before,'' said Mr. Pullin, a consumer electronics executive and frequent business traveler. 
About 38,000 travelers pass through Delta Air Lines' two terminals at La Guardia each day. That they may be glad to spend more time there is good news for Delta and OTG Management, the airport restaurant company that owns and operates all the concessions in Terminals C and D.
With two dozen restaurants, cafes, food courts and bars in the terminals, sales per passenger are well above other airports, said Rick Blatstein, chief executive of OTG. ''We're in the $9, $10 and $11 range,'' he said.
That is about $3 to $5 above the $5.80 spent, on average, by travelers at other large airports in the United States, according to Airport Revenue News.
Mr. Blatstein attributed the higher passenger spending to several things, including new restaurants linked to locally known chefs, dining and shopping areas incorporated throughout the terminal and waiting-area iPads that give travelers easier access to it all.
If he so chose, Mr. Pullin could have used his table-mounted screen to order reading material from a nearby newsstand and have it delivered to the restaurant.
''We wanted to create the desire to go to the airport early, not because you need to get to the airport early but because you think, 'I'll get there early, plug my laptop in, get a glass of wine and relax before my flight,' '' Mr. Blatstein said.
The upscale features are part of a global trend, and even small airports are getting in on the act. Long Beach Airport in California is completing work on a $45 million project to give its waiting areas more of a resort feel. There's a wine bar by the outdoor fire pit and the restaurants are local establishments overseen by an airport executive chef.
''Our mission is to provide services above our customers' expectation,'' said Mario Rodriguez, the airport's director. ''We want to make sure this is a proper first impression and a wonderful final impression of the city.''
The upgrading at airports large and small could mitigate the deteriorating experience of air travel, said Curtis Fentress, an architect who has designed many large airports over the last 20 years.
''We're trying to put the romance of travel back into the passenger experience,'' Mr. Fentress said. ''Increasing amenities with retail, bringing retail that is not just food or fast food, but food that is appealing and upscale, I think there is a trend toward that.''
At La Guardia, the interior space in Delta's two terminals was reconfigured and food and shops were brought all the way into the gate area. Most of the rows of fixed plastic upholstered seats were replaced with bar-height stools that tuck into clean white countertops fitted with electrical outlets and USB ports.
There are cafe tables where travelers can face one another. All the new seating includes space to tuck away luggage from traffic areas and every one of the new seats has an iPad so passengers can play games, browse the Internet or see what's available for sale nearby.
OTG paid $50 million to remake the terminals, as part of its deal to be Delta's exclusive concessionaire. Mr. Blatstein said he was intrigued by the revenue potential of all that space at the boarding gates, previously filled with people with nothing to do but wait. Along with rent, OTG pays an undisclosed percentage of its total revenue to Delta.
''We've been saying the real sweet spot for airlines is to enhance passenger experience and monetize at the same time,'' said Brett Proud, president and chief executive of GuestLogix, a technology company that helps airlines expand revenue sources. ''Bag fees aren't enhancing the experience,'' he said.
Delta first installed iPads at a few of its gates at Kennedy Airport in November 2010. Response was so positive that the devices became an integral part of the planned renovation at La Guardia.
Delta and OTG found that the devices allowed them to serve travelers with ''gate anxiety'' -- a preference for waiting by the gate instead of wandering through the terminal and shopping. With the iPads, travelers can still sit near the gate but order food or products from their seats and have them delivered.
''If that's where they like to be, let's create an experience there,'' said Gail Grimmett, senior vice president for Delta in New York.
One recent afternoon, Michael McDonagh, visiting from Israel, read his own iPad before boarding the plane. ''It's a lovely touch,'' but he said he wondered if having devices for everyone, everywhere was really necessary.
Mary Caponera of Winston-Salem, N.C., was eating a slice of pizza at a cafe table by her gate and using the iPad to read the news. ''This is nice, it's really nice,'' she said as she waited for her flight, which was delayed. But, she added, ''it doesn't change how I feel about my flight being changed.''
She added, ''If I had to choose between this airport and another airport that didn't have this, I'd probably choose this airport.''
Once on the airplane, the economy seats are still small and the passenger cabin is still crowded. But Ms. Grimmett said, even here, the airport experience carries over. After relaxing and recharging at the gate, she said, fliers are bound to be in better humor.
''It is too late to start that passenger experience when they get on the plane if they're already stressed out,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Debt Ceiling Optimism Lifts Markets Overseas

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
LONDON (AP) -- Hopes that United States politicians will be able to reach a deal on raising the government's debt ceiling, avoiding the risk of a disastrous default, supported global markets on Monday, with Wall Street closed for a holiday. 
Congress must agree by the end of February to increase the limit on how much the nation can borrow so the government can service its debt. If it doesn't, the country could default, which would deal a heavy blow to global financial markets and undermine confidence in the world's largest economy.
Republicans appear ready to raise the debt ceiling temporarily and have also backed away from their insistence on deep spending concessions in exchange for a deal. The signs of compromise last week encouraged investors to buy into stock indexes, many of which are near multiyear highs.
''Although this again could be seen as another round of political battle, any progress to avoid immediate dangers will likely be seen as positive by the market,'' Gary Yau, analyst at Crédit Agricole, said in a report to investors.
The FTSE 100 in Britain closed Monday up 0.43 percent, at 6,180.98, the DAX in Germany advanced 0.36 percent, to 7,729.80. The CAC-40 in France ended the day up 0.2 percent, at 3,749.79.
United States stock and bond markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King's Birthday.
Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities in Hong Kong, said he was optimistic that an agreement on the debt ceiling would be reached because of the high price tag attached to failing to do so.
''Both parties will find some kind of solution because they all know that the debt ceiling will have to be increased,'' Mr. Wong said. ''At the very last minute, they will sort it out.''
Earlier in Asia, markets were more cautious, with Japanese shares hit hard by a rise in the yen. The Nikkei 225 fell 1.5 percent, to close at 10,747.74.
The Bank of Japan began a two-day policy meeting and has been under pressure from a new government to take more aggressive steps to fight the long deflationary slump there. Some analysts expect the bank to expand its asset-purchasing program and set an inflation target.
In commodity markets, the benchmark oil contract for February delivery was down 50 cents to $95.06 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 7 cents to finish at $95.56 a barrel on the Nymex on Friday.

HEADLINE: Shaken-Baby Murder Trial Rivets Local Chinese Press

BYLINE: By JEFFREY E. SINGER

 BODY:
Even as murders in New York City have plunged to historically low levels, murder trials are almost always unfolding in the city's many courtrooms. Most of them attract little attention from the city's major news outlets.
That has certainly been the case in an ongoing shaken-baby murder trial in Queens, despite disturbing details about terrible injuries. But while local television and radio stations and the city's larger newspapers have largely ignored the testimony, the trial has been big news among the fiercely competitive Chinese-language newspapers sold on newsstands in Flushing and other Chinese immigrant neighborhoods. 
The case has been a popular topic ever since 2-month-old Annie Li died in 2007 and her father, Li Hangbin, was charged with causing her death. Prosecutors say Annie died from shaken-baby syndrome after being violently beaten and shaken by Mr. Li. The trial is taking place in State Supreme Court in Queens, where one major news outlet in the city, The New York Post, keeps a reporter assigned permanently.
But while the decline of newspapers is a familiar story, the city's immigrant press is still a vibrant force. At Mr. Li's trial, about half a dozen reporters from several daily Chinese-language newspapers turn out each day in Room 306 of the courthouse and hang on every word of testimony.
The trial, which started nearly two weeks ago, has produced headlines like ''Li Hangbin's Lawyer: Autopsy Hasty and Unprofessional'' and ''Forensic Testimony Unfavorable for Li Hangbin.''
It commands space on a daily basis next to stories on other more run-of-the-mill topics, like local art exhibitions, events hosted by Chinese groups or the prevalence of cellphone thefts.
There has also been a steady group of Chinese immigrants showing up at the trial to support Mr. Li, including many who have donated money toward his legal fees.
The case has drawn intense interest among Chinese readers not only for its disturbing story line, but also for the glimpse it offers many immigrant readers, some of whom speak little or no English, into a legal system that ''is a learning process for the whole Chinese community,'' said Stella Chan, a reporter for Sing Tao Daily, one of several popular daily Chinese-language newspapers in New York that include local news coverage.
Mr. Li was arrested in 2008 along with his companion, Li Ying. Both were held at the Rikers Island jail for over four years as their case wound through the criminal justice system. They were to be tried together, but prosecutors this month dropped the charges against Ms. Li. Mr. Li has said that he inadvertently bumped his infant daughter's head on a bedside table the same evening she fell ill.
But day after day, prosecutors have been presenting medical records and expert witnesses to support their claim that Annie died as a result of violent shaking.
The Chinese reporters speak English, but admit that the long hours of testimony filled with legal and medical jargon have sometimes tried their patience and understanding.
''The witnesses keep talking and they don't stop,'' said Hubert Lu, a reporter for World Journal. Some reporters admit that they cannot help but identify with Mr. Li and Ms. Li. After spending so much time with them, Chinese reporters ''feel that they have become like part of their family,'' Mr. Lu said.
Many of his readers, he said, share stories similar to that of the Lis, who came here illegally from Fujian Province in China and were struggling to establish an economic foothold.
''All of the Chinese in the United States know about the Lis' case,'' said Su Lina, 55, a part-time nanny in Flushing who has helped raise money for the defense. ''They couldn't have possibly done anything as horrible as they say. We don't believe it. Their situation is really just miserable.''
As for the supporters, many speak virtually no English but still sit for hours silently observing the trial while prosecutors have introduced photos and X-rays of the dead baby.
One supporter is Michael Chu, a travel agent in Flushing whose office has become a headquarters of sorts for Mr. Li's supporters and whose walls are filled with newspaper clippings about the case. One anonymous blogger has been providing daily updates of the trial in English, with information provided by an unknown ''tipster'' and selected translations from Chinese-language newspapers provided by a ''C.F.,'' or Chinese friend.
Another reporter, Xi Ji from Ming Pao Daily, said of the Lis: ''The law system, the legal system locked them up for four years without explanation. If the Chinese newspaper doesn't support them, then who will?''

HEADLINE: President Barack Obama

 BODY:
President Obama's first Inaugural Address offered a clear and bracing vision for a way out of the depth of an economic crisis and two foreign wars. His second, on Monday, revealed less of his specific plans for the next four years but more of his political philosophy.
He argued eloquently for a progressive view of government, founded on history and his own deep conviction that American prosperity and the preservation of freedom depend on collective action. In the coming days, there will be no let up of political combat over the debt ceiling, gun control, national security and tax policies that can either reduce income inequality or allow such inequality to stifle economic growth and opportunity for all but the very wealthiest in this society. 
But, on Monday, the president stepped back from those immediate battles to explain what it means in the broadest sense to be ''we the people,'' Mr. Obama's most eloquent description of our common heritage.
''We have always understood that when times change, so must we,'' he said, ''that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.''
In every sphere of life -- improving education, building roads, caring for the poor and elderly, training workers, recovering from natural disasters, providing for our defense -- progress requires that Americans do these things together, Mr. Obama said.
That applies, he said, to ''the commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.''
President Obama rejected any argument that the American people can be divided into groups whose interests are opposed to each other. The choice is not ''between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future,'' he said. ''For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty, and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.''
He spoke only obliquely of the persistent gridlock in Congress, where he will face right-wing Republicans whose bleak agenda would weaken civil rights, shred the social safety net and block important programs that could help put millions of jobless Americans back to work. ''We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect,'' he said.
Instead, he took the fight to the people, laying out his principles and priorities: addressing the threat of climate change, embracing sustainable energy sources, ensuring equality of gays and lesbians, expanding immigration and equal pay for women. Disappointingly, the need for stricter gun controls was noted solely in a reference to the safety of children in places like Newtown, Conn.
On foreign policy, President Obama expressed with fervor a view of the role of the United States in a world that is threatened by terrorism on many continents. ''We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully -- not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear,'' he said. ''America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.''
Mr. Obama is smart enough to know that what he wants to achieve in his second term must be done in the next two years -- perhaps even in the first 18 months. Throughout his first term, he clung to a hope of bipartisanship even when it became obvious that his Republican adversaries had no interest in compromise of any sort.
Time is not on his side. It is pointless to wait for signs of conciliation from the extreme right, whose central ideology is to render government ineffective. He has gotten off to a good start by putting forward a comprehensive plan to tighten gun laws, despite outrageous propaganda against sensible controls from the gun lobby.
Mr. Obama acknowledged that there is much left to be done to shore up the economic recovery and invest in education and opportunities for the next generation. And, above all, he stressed the importance of the middle class to America's economic survival. ''Our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,'' he said.
It's natural for a second-term president to be thinking about his place in history. There is no doubt that Mr. Obama has the ambition and intellect to place himself in the first rank of presidents. With this speech, he has made a forceful argument for a progressive agenda that meets the nation's needs. We hope he has the political will and tactical instincts to carry it out.

HEADLINE: Arizona Sale Of Rare Cars Draws Rich And Envious

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- The way Steve Davis sees it, arranging collectible cars for display at auction is like writing the script for a good action movie: ''You've got to have a beginning that gets you excited, a middle that grips you and an end that delivers.''
Barrett-Jackson, which bills itself as ''the world's greatest collector car auction,'' had several tents mounted on the same expanse of green grass where horses and players convened for a polo match some months ago, as well as a main pavilion where the rarest and most valuable of all the vehicles could be found. Mr. Davis, the company's president, arranged each of them, looking to offer ''an experience'' for the more than 310,000 visitors who came by over the course of six days, but ultimately to entice buyers. 
He positioned a 2005 Chevy Silverado by the main pavilion's entrance, which was right by the building where 5,000 people whose combined lines of credit hit nearly $1 billion signed up to bid on roughly 1,400 vehicles -- not including the potential buyers who needed no credit check to place their bids.
Some of the cars were extraordinarily expensive, others were there to suit the middle market, but all of them were objects of someone's desire, from the custom-built quarter-scale replica of a John Deere tractor, sold for $7,500, to television's original 1966 Batmobile, sold for $4.62 million. (Except for the vehicles that were sold for charity, all prices include the buyer's commission.)
Cars were not the only attraction, though. There was a mall at which vendors were selling diamond earrings, private jets and handmade cowboy boots; racing simulators to entertain children and adults; and a lounge where women could get their hair and makeup done while sipping wine, away from the dizzying chant of the auctioneer.
''Spending money is the sport here,'' Mr. Davis said.
And there were many enticements. The elaborately customized Silverado pickup was literally a work of art, its body adorned with scenes of combat, patriotic monuments and firefighters emerging from the smoldering remains of the World Trade Center towers. It had a polished stainless-steel frame, a hand-molded fiberglass interior, airbrushed leather seats and a formidable stereo system. Its owners, Dale and Connie Ison of Hillsboro, Ohio, said it took five years, 50,000 hours and $658,000 to get it the way it is. It sold for $209,000.
The Isons said the truck was, more than anything, a repository of memories. Mr. Ison, 61, recalled meeting the son of the sailor famously pictured kissing a woman in Times Square on the day in August 1945 when the war against Japan ended, an image reproduced on the Silverado, which has been to county fairs, Veterans Day parades and even the Pentagon's courtyard, but got to be ''too much for a man my age.''
Six slots in -- next to the 1946 four-door Cadillac sedan that featured a rear-mounted shotgun, cowhide seats and bull horns on the hood (sale price: $77,000) -- Norma and Vernon Wamsley said goodbye to the 1954 Kaiser Darrin convertible that had been theirs since 1989, when they bought it ''in pieces, nuts and bolts in pails,'' as Mrs. Wamsley put it.
She snapped a picture of her husband, who seemed more anxious about how much the car would fetch at the auction than about giving it up for good.
Barrett-Jackson featured the largest number of no-reserve cars ever auctioned, or cars that are sold to the highest bidder, regardless of what the bid might be. It is a risky proposition for the seller, as well as an enticement for potential buyers, given the possibility of bringing home a car for a lot less than what it is worth.
''We're hoping to get good funds,'' said Mr. Wamsley, whose Kaiser Darrin sold for $106,700.
Barrett-Jackson began as a charity fund-raising car show in the 1960s and evolved into the big event that it is today -- exclusivity cloaked in a carnival atmosphere. While high rollers in skyboxes dined on scallops and sea bass, others had plenty of food choices on the pavement outside, including hot dogs and funnel cake.
''I've been coming here for 10 years and it always blows me away,'' said Jeff Otto, 52, who had never placed a bid and had no plans to bid on any car. He had flown in from Denver, bringing his son, Christopher, who is 14, and his father-in-law, Jim Stewart, who is 72.
This year, gross car sales reached nearly $109 million, a 17 percent increase over last year and a tie for the record set in 2007, before the economy collapsed and car collectors kept their most prized possessions in the garage, knowing it was not a good time to sell.
On Saturday, a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL, which Clark Gable had bought for $7,295, sold for $2.03 million. The Batmobile -- customized in 15 days, on a $15,000 budget, out of a 1955 Lincoln Futura -- also sold that night, as did 21 vehicles whose proceeds went for charity. One of them was a 2009 Ford F150 Super Crew pickup truck owned by President George W. Bush (sale price: $300,000). Another was the first 2014 Corvette Stingray to hit the retail market (sale price: $1.1 million).
Craig Jackson, chairman and chief executive of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company, said the event, which ended on Sunday, is ''a scene, it's an attraction.'' But the cars, he went on, are ''first and foremost a huge investment.''

HEADLINE: Michael Winner, 77, 'Death Wish' Director

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Michael Winner, the brash British director known for violent action movies starring Charles Bronson including ''The Mechanic'' and the first three ''Death Wish'' films, died on Monday at his home in London. He was 77.
His wife, Geraldine, confirmed his death in a statement to British news media. Mr. Winner revealed last summer that he had heart and liver ailments. 
Mr. Winner's films viscerally pleased crowds, largely ignored artistic pretensions and often underwhelmed critics. He directed many major stars in more than 30 films over more than four decades.
Marlon Brando played Quint in ''The Nightcomers'' (1971), a prequel to Henry James's ''The Turn of the Screw'' (Vincent Canby called it ''quite bad'' in The New York Times); Sophia Loren played a wife who traveled to the tropics to avenge her husband's murder in the action film ''Firepower'' (1979) (''A lot happens,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, ''None of it makes sense.''); and Oliver Reed played an adman who tried to escape the crass commercialism represented by his boss, Orson Welles, in the comedy-drama ''I'll Never Forget What's'isname'' (1967).
Mr. Winner's most recognizable work remains a series of high-body-count action melodramas starring Charles Bronson. In ''The Mechanic'' (1972) Mr. Bronson played a bloodthirsty assassin, and in ''The Stone Killer'' (1973) he played a bloodthirsty police detective. But the actor-director team perfected their formula with ''Death Wish'' (1974).
Mr. Bronson played Paul Kersey, a New York City architect who becomes a vigilante after his wife is murdered and his daughter is sexually assaulted by muggers. The film struck a chord with audiences who were titillated by its extreme violence and what many took as its tough anti-crime stance, but some critics were appalled at what they saw as a transparent attempt to manipulate audiences and the cheapening of suffering and death.
''It's a tackily made melodrama, but it so cannily orchestrates the audience's responses that it can appeal to law-and-order fanatics, sadists, muggers, club women, fathers, older sisters, masochists, policemen, politicians, and, it seems, a number of film critics,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. ''Its message, simply put, is: KILL. TRY IT. YOU'LL LIKE IT.''
Mr. Winner directed two more successful films in the series, but dropped out of the final two.
Michael Robert Winner was born in London on Oct. 30, 1935. The son of a well-to-do business owner, Mr. Winner graduated from Cambridge, having studied law and economics.
He was always fascinated by film, and resolved to become a director after college, even though his family thought the industry vulgar.
Mr. Winner initially struggled to find work. ''Eventually I conned my way into doing a few shorts, documentaries, commercial spots and things,'' he said in The London Sunday Times in 1970.
The odd jobs led to his first feature, the pop musical ''Play It Cool'' (1962). By the 1970s his work had reached American audiences.
He was confident on set, sometimes bordering on the dictatorial. ''You have to be an egomaniac about it. You have to impose your own taste,'' he said. ''The team effort is a lot of people doing what I say.''
Mr. Winner also made movies with Anthony Hopkins and Burt Lancaster. His last film was the comic thriller ''Parting Shots'' (1998), about a photographer who decides to kill everyone who has wronged him in life after a doctor mistakenly tells him he has six weeks to live.
For almost 20 years, Mr. Winner wrote a weekly food column titled ''Winner's Dinners'' for The Sunday Times of London.
Survivors include his wife, the former Geraldine Lynton-Edwards, whom he dated off and on for more than 50 years before they married in 2011.
When Mr. Winner proposed, he did not drop to one knee. ''If I had,'' he told The Daily Mail, ''I doubt I would have been able to get back up.''

HEADLINE: A Plan to Cut Social Security Benefits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Misguided Social Security 'Reform' '' (editorial, Jan. 13):
I share your concern that President Obama has been too eager to go along with Congressional Republicans to reduce Social Security benefits by lowering cost-of-living adjustments for millions of retirees, widows and orphans. The consequences of shifting to a ''chained'' Consumer Price Index would be even worse than you described. 
The chained C.P.I. would take benefits away from more than three million disabled veterans and their families. A veteran who began receiving V.A. disability benefits at 30 would have benefits reduced by $1,425 at 45 and by $3,231 at 65, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The chained C.P.I. would also result in across-the-board tax increases with a disproportionate effect on working families. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, switching to a chained C.P.I. would increase taxes by $59.6 billion over the next decade. More than three-quarters of the new revenue raised by the year 2021 would come from Americans making less than $200,000 a year.
Those making between $30,000 and $40,000 would be hit the hardest, while those making more than $1 million would see virtually no change.
At a time when corporations are enjoying record profits and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, there are better ways to reduce the deficit than cutting programs for the elderly, veterans and the sick.
BERNARD SANDERS Burlington, Vt., Jan. 14, 2013
The writer, the Vermont independent, is chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in the new Congress.
To the Editor:
You are to be commended for opposing the proposal by the Obama administration and others to index Social Security retirement benefits to a revised cost-of-living measure, the ''chained'' Consumer Price Index. But rising rates of economic insecurity among the elderly, especially among women and people of color, demonstrate that the current C.P.I. measure is not adequate for estimating the real costs of living for seniors.
One new measure is the Elder Economic Security Standard Index, developed by Wider Opportunities for Women. This index has also been calculated state by state, and New York State is among those where costs are high.
Another measure, the Senior Financial Stability Index, was developed at Brandeis University. Both measures address the needs of those in their mid-70s and beyond when assets have dwindled and health care costs generally rise. These proposals also deserve serious consideration.
JEANE W. ANASTAS New York, Jan. 13, 2013
The writer is a professor of social work at New York University.
To the Editor:
For 2012, the payroll taxable limit for Social Security was $110,100. Working income beyond that amount was not taxable for Social Security. This means that the millions and billions of huge incomes earned by the wealthy after the taxable limit is reached go untaxed. And now, ardent conservative Republicans are seeking to weaken Social Security.
It would seem that a change to taxing all working income, with no limit, would make Social Security secure forever.

HEADLINE: A Day of Celebration for a Diverse Crowd Savoring a Moment in History

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- From the musicians in new purple uniforms who traveled from places like Des Moines and Montgomery, Ala., to march with a gay and lesbian band, to high school mariachi performers from Texas -- including some who took their first plane ride to get here -- to scores of elegant African-American women in full-length mink coats and matching hats, the faces of Inauguration Day 2013 were the faces of those left behind by the political process in decades and centuries past.
If Jan. 20, 2009, was a day for the history books and a feel-good moment for all of America, Monday was a celebration for the diverse coalition that landed the nation's first black president in the White House for a second term: Latinos, gay people, women and especially African-Americans. 
Riding on a bus to the heated staging tent on the National Mall, members of the Lesbian and Gay Band Association listened intently as the radio played President Obama's Inaugural Address. A tear streamed down the cheek of Gary Nell, a 53-year-old drum major from Des Moines, as Mr. Obama referred to the Stonewall riots of 1969 in New York, which spawned the gay rights movement. ''It was so affirming,'' Mr. Nell said.
Outside the security perimeter, 11-year-old Angel Lucero, fresh-faced and earnest, politely asked passers-by where he and his family might get tickets to the swearing-in. His parents, Mexican immigrants, spoke little English. His older sister, Jennifer, 15, said they had come from Bladensburg, Md., to see the president ''because we think that he's going to help us, help other people who aren't free in this country.''
For gay people and Latinos particularly, the president's second swearing-in was an occasion to savor newfound political clout. But it was also imbued with the sense that Mr. Obama had better make good on the promises he failed to keep during his first term, including an immigration overhaul, as well as a repeal of the law barring federal recognition of same-sex marriage.
''This time there is a much higher expectation,'' said Jessica Gallegos, 23, a native of Quito, Ecuador, who works for the World Bank. Despite the president's failure to revamp the nation's immigration laws, she said, ''the community still stood behind him. Now it's time for him to deliver.''
On a day that doubled as a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Obama drew a connection between them by swearing to uphold the Constitution over King's Bible. While some African-American leaders wish Mr. Obama would pay more attention to issues like poverty and urban decay, many blacks who trekked to the capital said the second time around was even sweeter.
''I think the first time a lot of African-Americans voted for him just because he was black,'' said Mark McDaniel, 42, a retired Navy officer from Chesapeake, Va., as he navigated a packed Metro station. ''This time it seemed like the country wanted him back.''
Throughout Washington on Monday, as the sun rose over the Capitol and gray skies gave way to blue, there was a festive spirit in the air. The cold was not nearly as bitter and the crowds not as crushing as four years ago, but the turnout was still heavy, as tens of thousands of visitors, clutching maps and toting cameras, filled the city.
Security was tight. Paradegoers waved American flags, street vendors hawked Obama paraphernalia -- which was not selling nearly as briskly as in 2009 -- and the streets downtown, closed to cars, became a sea of (mostly polite) humanity.
''We're here for the history in the making,'' said Iris Davis-Saulsberry, a high school history teacher from Las Vegas who wore a bomber jacket bearing the presidential seal. Her friend Dorothy Lawson was already thinking about 2016, and the possibility that a woman might become president. ''That's our dream,'' Ms. Lawson said.
As the president delivered a message that focused heavily on equality, members of the Texas high school mariachi band, dressed in finery that was hand-embroidered over the border in Guadalajara, awaited their turn to play. Among them was Noel Marquez, a guitar player who recently turned 18 and said he would have voted for Mr. Obama -- if only he had been old enough.
Not far away, Marita Begley, artistic director of the Lesbian and Gay Band Association, could barely contain her excitement. She had painstakingly prepared a program featuring the work of gay composers (Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland), a woman (Lady Gaga), and a Latino (Pitbull).
Her group marched in the 2009 inaugural parade, before Mr. Obama came out in favor of same-sex marriage, and before ''don't ask, don't tell'' was repealed. Although there is still more to do -- Ms. Begley would like same-sex marriage to be legal across the land -- she could not help notice that inauguration officials allowed her band to bring a much bigger contingent this time, and gave it a much more prominent spot, right next to the civil rights float.
''It's really good to be here,'' she said, ''as full citizens.''

HEADLINE: China Looks to the Sky

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
TIANJIN, China - When Airbus executives arrived here seven years ago scouting for a location to assemble passenger jets, the broad, flat expanse next to Tianjin Binhai International Airport was a grassy field.
Now, Airbus, the European aerospace giant, has 20 large buildings and is churning out four A320 jetliners a month for mostly Chinese state-controlled carriers. The company also has two new neighbors - a sprawling rocket factory and a helicopter manufacturing complex - both producing for the Chinese military.
The rapid expansion of civilian and military aerospace manufacturing in Tianjin reflects China's broader ambitions.
As Beijing's leaders try to find new ways to invest $3 trillion of foreign reserves, the country has been aggressively expanding in industries with strong economic potential. The Chinese government and state-owned companies have already made a major push into financial services and natural resources, acquiring stakes in Morgan Stanley and Blackstone and buying oil and gas fields around the world. 
Aerospace represents the latest frontier for China, which is eyeing parts manufacturers, materials producers, leasing businesses, cargo airlines and airport operators. The country now rivals the United States as a market for civilian airliners, which China hopes to start supplying from domestic production. And the new leadership named at the Party Congress in November has publicly emphasized long-range missiles and other aerospace programs in its push for military modernization.
If Boeing's difficulties with its recently grounded aircraft, the Dreamliner, weigh on the industry, it could create opportunity. Chinese companies, which have plenty of capital, have been welcomed by some American companies as a way to create jobs. Wall Street has been eager, too, at a time when other merger activity has been weak.
Washington is trying to figure out what to do about China's deal-making broadly. "Many of these transactions raise important security issues for our country," said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was created by Congress to monitor the bilateral relationship. "China's interest in promoting these investments isn't necessarily consistent with our own interests, and it's appropriate to thoroughly examine the transactions."
In aerospace, the Chinese deal-makers have deep ties to the military, raising additional issues for American regulators. The main contractor for the country's air force, the state-owned China Aviation Industry Corporation, known as Avic, has set up a private equity fund to purchase companies with so-called dual-use technology that has civilian and military applications, with the goal of investing as much as $3 billion. In 2010, Avic acquired the overseas licensing rights for small aircraft made by Epic Aircraft of Bend, Ore., using lightweight yet strong carbon-fiber composites - the same material used for high-performance fighter jets.
Provincial and local government agencies in Shaanxi Province, a hub of Chinese military aircraft testing and production, have set up another fund of similar size for acquisitions. Last month, a consortium of Chinese investors, including the Shaanxi fund, struck a $4.23 billion deal with the American International Group to buy 80 percent of the International Lease Finance Corporation, which owns the world's second-largest passenger jet fleet.
"There has always been an obvious cross-fertilization of ideas, expertise and money between the civilian and military," said Martin Craigs, a longtime aerospace executive in Asia who is now the chairman of the Aerospace Forum Asia, a nonprofit group in Hong Kong. He added that Chinese companies had been actively hiring senior American and European aerospace engineers, so national security concerns could be quelled some by hiring the right people.
The push into aerospace coincides with growing worries in the West and across Asia about China's increasingly assertive territorial claims, including the dispatch of Chinese warships to waters long patrolled by Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam.
Coincidentally, hours after the A.I.G. deal was announced, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua announced that two Chinese navy destroyers and two frigates had entered disputed waters patrolled by Japan. The report was disputed by Japan's defense ministry, which said the Chinese vessels turned away before reaching the disputed areas.
China and Japan have stepped up public criticisms of each other since. And the Obama administration has begun a strategic "pivot," shifting military forces from the Mideast back to the western Pacific, a move that Chinese officials have criticized as an attempt to contain their country.
Such confrontations in the region are drawing attention to China's deal-making ambitions.
In October, a $1.79 billion bid by a business linked to Beijing's municipal government to acquire the corporate jet and propeller plane operations of bankrupt Hawker Beechcraft in Wichita, Kan., fell apart over national security concerns in Washington. Executives found it hard to disentangle the civilian operations from the company's military contracting business.
But many aerospace experts predict that Chinese investors and companies will find ways to appease American regulators. "There will be concerns undoubtedly and generally quite valid, but the commercial imperatives are such that people will find a way around them," said Peter Harbison, the chairman of CAPA-Center for Aviation, a global aerospace consulting firm.
The sale of A.I.G.'s leasing business is expected to face scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews the national security implications of deals involving foreign buyers.
The group's customers include many of the largest carriers in the United States, and the federal government has long counted on being able to use civilian passenger jets to transport troops overseas during a national emergency. When Saddam Hussein sent the Iraqi army into Kuwait in 1990, the Defense Department relied on the emergency mobilization of civilian jetliners to ferry 60 percent of the soldiers sent to and from the Mideast during the first Persian Gulf war and a quarter of the cargo, according to a RAND study.
Henri Courpron, the chief executive of A.I.G.'s International Lease Finance Corporation, said that he did not believe the United States should be concerned that the acquisition would prevent civilian aircraft from being available in a future crisis. Only 8 percent of the company's aircraft are currently leased to American air carriers, and most of these are narrow-body aircraft that lack the range to ferry troops across oceans.
"It's really a nonissue - we have 900-plus aircraft in our fleet, and there are only 11 wide bodies" currently being leased to American carriers, he said in a telephone interview. He added that the carriers have control over the aircraft during the leases. Executives from the consortium buying the stake in the leasing company declined repeated requests for interviews.
Chinese suitors in the aerospace industry understand the concerns. In part, they watched the experience in the natural resources industry. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation failed in its 2005 bid to acquire Unocal after intense political opposition. After that, Chinese energy giants have been more cautious, pursuing minority stakes in the United States and limiting their outright acquisitions.
Chinese companies are taking a similar tack in aerospace, pursuing joint ventures and technical cooperation agreements alongside acquisitions. For example, Avic is working with General Electric and other American aerospace companies on the production of a civilian jetliner, the C919. Beijing envisions the narrow-body C919 as the next step toward building a domestic aerospace business that can compete with Boeing and Airbus.
Western companies and their advisers say that they are acutely aware that technology transfers could help China strengthen its military and develop more competitive civil airplanes, and are taking precautions to protect trade secrets and national security. "You transfer the part that is most easily reverse engineered, or easily dissected," said a lawyer with detailed knowledge of these transactions.
But many in the aerospace sector are more skeptical that the West can avoid losing control of technology. "The mentality is, they're going to find a way to get there anyway, and we may as well get there with them," Mr. Harbison of the CAPA-Center for Aviation said.
Airbus executives say that they are being prudent. They add that there are few trade secrets about the A320 manufactured here, an aircraft that was designed in 1986. "The A320 is well known all over the world," said Jean-Luc Charles, the general manager of Airbus's operations here.
A tour of the main assembly area, a hangar with gray steel walls and large red cranes overhead, suggests that it may be possible to protect the technology. The seats are installed here and the aircraft painted, but the factory is largely assembling planes from kits imported from Europe. Entire fuselages, with green protective coatings, are brought by ship from Hamburg, Germany. Even the stepladders and freight elevators give weight limits in German, and the tool boxes are labeled in English, not Chinese.
Mr. Charles said that 95 percent of the parts are still imported, and that it would take many years for that amount to shrink. "One by one, we start to give them the parts," he said. "But each subassembly is a complex project - it takes five years."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Cornell Technology School Will Foster Commerce Amid Education

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Their curriculum devotes months to helping a company solve a current technological challenge. Their progress is supervised not just by an academic adviser, but also by an industry adviser. Their vast campus on Roosevelt Island, when it is built, will intersperse classrooms with office buildings, where high-tech companies can rent a suite and set up shop.
And when they showed up Monday for the very first day of classes at Cornell NYC Tech, the most ambitious institution of higher education to open in New York City in decades, students arrived not at some temporary structure on the edge of a construction site but to 20,000 square feet of donated space in the middle of Google's $2 billion New York headquarters. 
Cornell NYC Tech, a new graduate school focusing on applied science, is a bold experiment on many fronts: a major expansion for an august upstate school, a high-impact real estate venture for Roosevelt Island, an innovative collaboration with a foreign university, a new realm of influence for City Hall. But the most striking departure of all may be the relationship it sets forth between university and industry, one in which commerce and education are not just compatible, they are also all but indistinguishable. In this new framework, Cornell NYC Tech is not just a school, it is an ''educational start-up,'' students are ''deliverables'' and companies seeking access to those students or their professors can choose from a ''suite of products'' by which to get it.
Colleges and universities across the country -- a great many of which are scrambling to find new ways to finance scientific research, as well as new ways to profit from the fruits of that research -- are watching closely. In the last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has announced the creation of technology schools by both Columbia and New York University. And Cornell's president, David J. Skorton, said he had been visited by representatives from other cities hopeful that the Cornell NYC Tech model might work there, too.
Of course, Cornell NYC Tech is not the first school to forge alliances with the local business community. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology plays a prominent role in that state's technology scene, and Silicon Valley would not exist without Stanford, which has collected more than $1 billion in royalties as innovations linked to its campus made their way into the market.
But for Cornell NYC Tech, that close relationship is not merely the desired outcome; it is the founding premise. ''The campus was set up specifically to increase the talent pool in New York City,'' Dr. Skorton said, ''to positively influence the New York City economy.''
New York City's Economic Development Corporation, which helped select Cornell NYC Tech as the winner of a competition for $100 million in funds and $300 million worth of real estate from the city, predicts that the companies that will spin out from its campus will create tens of thousands of new jobs.
Calculations like that, impressive as they may be, have given some observers pause.
''The university has been at the forefront of big science since the 1940s and 1950s,'' said Isaac Kramnick, a professor of government at Cornell's main campus in Ithaca. ''Now it's entering an era in which it seems to be interested in for-profit science, and that does require some thinking as to what the fundamental purpose of a university is.''
Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell NYC Tech, is the first to admit that this new academic model is rife with potential conflicts of interest.
''I think there are lots of risks in trying to bring what are fundamentally different cultures and sets of goals together,'' he said. ''Companies need to make a profit. Universities have different motives -- partly societal good, partly education -- and that leads to different value systems.'' For starters, he said, ''if a student that a faculty member is advising is working at a company that the faculty member has a financial interest in, is the faculty member really keeping students' interests in mind?''
Dr. Skorton, an expert in research ethics, mentioned several other areas of concern, including the work that students will do with outside companies. ''If you don't protect that interaction crisply and clearly,'' he said, ''you could be concerned about the student basically working in an unpaid capacity for industry.''
Like Dean Huttenlocher, however, Dr. Skorton argues that the best solution to these potential conflicts is not to tiptoe around them, but to highlight them, debate them and arrive at appropriate safeguards.
Cornell's program, a partnership with Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, is starting small, with just eight students this semester (and a starting tuition of $43,185), but it will scale up to 2,000 students by 2037. Unlike schools like Stanford or M.I.T., it is open only to master's degree students studying the applied sciences. This allows it to bypass the broad educational needs of undergraduates and focus instead on one distinct but shared goal: ''cultivating entrepreneurial technologists,'' in the words of Greg Pass, the former Twitter executive who is Cornell NYC Tech's chief entrepreneurial officer.
It is all an attempt, Mr. Pass said, to catch up with the way research occurs these days. ''In the manufacturing age,'' he said, ''it really was largely true that innovation began in university labs,'' then made its way to corporate research and development labs, and years later to some consumer application.
Today, many of the most innovative ideas come from the market itself, and only later undergo intensive research. ''In my own experience at Twitter,'' he said, ''we had to backfill expertise into the most difficult areas of technological challenge.''
To create a more fluid exchange of ideas, then, professors will be not just permitted, but also encouraged, to take time off to work on commercial (or even nonprofit) projects. And instead of protracted legal battles with the university over intellectual property rights to those projects, the companies that oversee them will get a contract designed to facilitate frictionless collaboration. At the same time, Cornell Tech is setting up a business development office to seek out prospects for cooperation and promote opportunities, and Cornell itself is setting aside $150 million to invest in New York's technology scene. As for the companies involved, they will have the option to ''co-locate'' in office space on campus.
In some cases, a company's employees will pursue their work in the academic buildings themselves, coding and designing and networking right alongside the faculty and students, then breaking for lunch in the cafeteria just like any other member of the Cornell NYC Tech community. They can come and lecture on Fridays, which are set aside for students to learn from people outside of academia, or invite teams of students to work on challenges the company faces as part of a hands-on ''master's project'' that takes the place of a traditional master's thesis.
A number of companies have signed on for some part of the Cornell NYC Tech experience, from young start-ups like Artsy to nonprofits like the Robin Hood Foundation to influential corporations like McKinsey & Company, the management consultants, and Google itself. The main motivation they cite is the shortage of qualified job candidates in New York's rapidly expanding technology sector.
''By the time they're graduating and they're looking for a full-time job, it's too late to get the best ones,'' said Daniel Doubrovkine, Artsy's head of engineering. ''We want to reach the best ones very early, and we want them to experience the real world of a technology company while they're still in school.''
Many companies would, presumably, be willing to pay a high price for access to the most elite new talent pool in New York's technology world, but they will not have to. ''I think the companies that can pay the most money don't necessarily make the best partners,'' said Dean Huttenlocher. ''Universities live and die on their academic reputations. So to the degree to which interaction with a company can help us attract better faculty or generate better research, that's incredibly valuable.''
But the model is still in an early phase, or in beta, to use the preferred idiom. ''It's entirely possible,'' Mr. Pass said, ''that this time next year we'll have scrapped these principles and come up with others.''
No one, however, envisions exporting them to the creative writing program. ''There certainly is a case for large swaths of scholarship that should be divorced from the market,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Inaction, Mideast Cataclysm?

BYLINE: By BERNARD AVISHAI and SAM BAHOUR. 
Bernard Avishai is an Israeli-American writer in Jerusalem. Sam Bahour is a Palestinian-American business consultant in Ramallah, the West Bank.

 BODY:
ISRAELIS go to the polls today in an election that will likely give Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a third term; like the current one, Israel's next governing coaltion will probably be heavily reliant on right-wingers and religious parties.
Even so, Mr. Obama's second term could offer a pivotal opportunity to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In his first term, he backed away from the process, figuring that America could mediate only if the parties themselves wanted to make peace -- and that new talks were unlikely to be productive. 
This is a mistake. The greatest enemy to a two-state solution is the sheer pessimism on both sides. Unless President Obama uses his new mandate to show leadership, the region will have no place for moderates -- or for America either.
The rationale for inaction rests on four related assumptions: that strident forces dominate because their ideologies do; that the status quo -- demographic trends that would lead to the enfranchisement of occupied Palestinians, a ''one-state solution'' and the end of Israel as a Jewish democracy -- will eventually force Israel to its senses; that the observer-state status secured by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the United Nations is empty because his West Bank government is broke, dysfunctional and lacking in broad support; and that given the strength of the Israeli lobby, Mr. Obama's hands are tied.
These assumptions seem daunting, but they are misguided. First, while Hamas, the militant Islamists who control Gaza, and Israel's ultra-rightists, who drive the settlement enterprise, are rising in popularity, the reason is not their ideologies, but young people's despair over the occupation's grinding violence.
Last month, a poll by the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace, based in Washington, found that two-thirds of Israelis would support a two-state deal, but that more than half of even left-of-center Israelis said Mr. Abbas could not reach binding decisions to end the conflict. The same month, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, in Ramallah, found that 52 percent of Palestinians favored a two-state resolution (a drop from three-quarters in 2006, before two Israeli clashes over Gaza). But two-thirds judged the chance of a fully functional Palestinian state in the next five years to be low or nonexistent. In short, moderates on both sides still want peace, but first they need hope.
Second, the status quo is not a path to a one-state solution, but to Bosnian-style ethnic cleansing, which could erupt as quickly as the Gaza fighting did last year and spread to Israeli Arab cities. Right-wing Israelis and Hamas leaders alike are pushing for a cataclysmic fight. Mr. Abbas, whose Fatah party controls the West Bank, has renounced violence, but without signs of a viable diplomatic path he cannot unify his people to support new talks. If his government falls apart, or if the more Palestinian territory is annexed (as right-wing Israeli want), or if the standoff in Gaza leads to an Israeli ground invasion, bloodshed and protests across the Arab world will be inevitable. Such chaos might also provoke missiles from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group based in Lebanon.
Third, the Palestinian state is not a Fatah-imposed fiction, but a path toward economic development, backed by international diplomacy and donations, that most Palestinians want to succeed. It has a $4 billion economy; an expanding network of entrepreneurs and professionals; and a banking system with about $8 billion in deposits. A robust private sector can develop if given a chance.
Fourth, American support need not only mean direct talks. The administration could promote investments in Palestinian education and civil society that do not undermine Israeli security. Mr. Obama could demand that Israel allow Palestinian businesses freer access to talent, suppliers and customers. He could also demand a West Bank-Gaza transportation corridor, to which Israel committed in the 1993 Oslo accords.
America is as much a player as a facilitator. The signal it sends helps determine whether the parties move toward war or peace. The White House, despite its frosty relationship with Mr. Netanyahu, hasn't set itself up as a worthy mediator by opposing Palestinian membership in the United Nations and vetoing condemnations of settlements.
In nominating Chuck Hagel to lead the Pentagon, Mr. Obama rightly ignored attacks by ''pro-Israel'' (really pro-Netanyahu) groups. He should appoint a Middle East negotiator trusted by all sides -- say, Bill Clinton or Colin L. Powell. He should lead, not thwart, European attempts to make a deal. He has stated that the settlements will lead to Israel's global isolation; he should make clear that they endanger American interests, too.
Washington has crucial leverage, though this won't last forever. When it weighs in, it becomes a preoccupying political fact for both sides. If it continues to stand back, hopelessness will win.

HEADLINE: In Davos, a Chance to Rub Shoulders With the Elite of Business and Politics

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
The minimum $20,000 entry fee has been paid. Fur hats and silk underwear are in the luggage. And stacks of business cards are ready to be slipped into the palms of the business and political elite gathering this week at the snowy alpine fortress that is the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
For the more than 2,500 people making the pilgrimage this year, some personalities will command more attention than others. On the Continent, where fears of the euro's imminent demise dominated thinking for the last year, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, are being credited rather than pilloried these days for saving the euro from disaster. 
Together with Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy and the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, they will be among the keynote speakers on whether Europe's fortunes will at last take a turn for the better.
Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain may throw cold water on that idea, if he attends. But in Davos, if he does turn up, his main task may be to explain why investors should not be spooked by his warning that Britain may drift away from the European Union.
With plenty of dynamism stirring outside Europe, emerging markets leaders will be making the case for investment dollars to flow their way. Executives and academics from China and India will swarm the halls to discuss the evolution in their economic climate, which has cooled since a year ago but remains well ahead of those in Western economies.
Prime ministers from a number of African countries will also make the trek to explain how dynamism continues to build, especially on the southern part of the continent. Two years after the Arab Spring unfolded, numerous decision-makers from North Africa will outline plans for overhauls and address the political, social and economic transitions, and upheavals, in their countries.
With fighting in Mali still making headlines and the Algerian gas-field hostage disaster still being sorted out, North African issues are very likely to be prime topics.
Not everyone has been panting to get to Davos. Officials from the United States, for example, will barely be represented. But those coming - including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is a regular at the forum, and Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations and a former candidate to be the next secretary of state - are likely to stir controversy.
And some of the highest-wattage regulars are turning their attention elsewhere. Three notable absentees will be the top Google executives, Sergey Brin, Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt. (For Mr. Schmidt, Davos evidently doesn't have the same allure as North Korea, where he visited recently.) Google has not said why its leaders are not attending.
But some other men with big money will be on hand, though Jamie Dimon, the chief of JPMorgan Chase, can't count on quite as much money as before, now that the bank's board had decided to dock his pay after a multibillion-dollar trading loss in 2012.
Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America and George Soros will all be sniffing out investments. So will Lloyd C. Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, who has shunned Davos in the past but decided to join the party this time.
It's not all about deals, though. Bill and Melinda Gates, hardy Davos perennials, will again be there to preach the need to invest in what counts for future generations: education, health and related philanthropic activity.
For celebrity sizzle, the South African actress Charlize Theron will be in town to promote her Africa Outreach Project. The forum discouraged celebrities for a while after Sharon Stone stole the show in 2005 and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did the same the following year. Since then, a few stars have swanned in, mostly, it seems, out of curiosity.
Last year, Mick Jagger sidled into a spate of private Davos parties wearing a velvet plum jacket and a lilac shirt, speaking eruditely about current events with people like Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, before busting a few lanky dance moves late in the evening.
This year, another power broker expected to prowl the corridors is Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees. Whether anyone will consider face time with him a must probably depends on a given attitude toward American baseball generally, and the widely followed Yankees specifically.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.N. Agency Warns That Global Unemployment Will Probably Rise in 2013

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- More than 197 million people worldwide are jobless, and an additional 39 million have simply given up looking for work, a United Nations agency said on Monday, warning that government budget-balancing was hurting employment and would probably lead to more job losses soon.
With global growth stalling five years after the financial crisis upended much of the world economy, the number of jobless is expected to rise by 5.1 million this year, to more than 202 million, the International Labor Organization said in a special report. And it predicted there would be a further three million newly jobless people next year. 
High unemployment rates in the developed world -- 7.8 percent in the United States, 11.8 percent in the euro zone -- weigh on demand and hold back economic growth. Global gross domestic product will probably expand about 3.6 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said in October, below its previous forecast.
Addressing the issue of unemployment last Thursday, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Christine Lagarde, urged governments to focus on ''growth that can actually deliver jobs.''
''We stopped the collapse,'' Ms. Lagarde said during a news conference in Washington, warning about the risks to growth posed by complacency in Europe and difficult budget negotiations in the United States. ''We should avoid the relapse, and it's not time to relax.''
The International Labor Organization found that macroeconomic imbalances ''have been passed on to the labor market to a significant degree.'' With aggregate demand weakening, employment ''has been further hit by fiscal austerity programs in a number of countries, which often involved direct cutbacks in employment and wages, directly impacting labor markets.''
More troubling, it said, was that while governments had sought to counter the effects of the financial crisis with fiscal stimulus, later austerity measures in some countries appeared to be reinforcing the downturn.
The effects of the recession in Europe are being felt elsewhere through ''a spillover effect,'' the organization found, mostly through the mechanism of reduced demand for foreign goods, but also in the form of volatile capital inflows in places like Latin America and the Caribbean. These forces have left policy makers with difficult choices about how to keep soaring currencies in check without strangling economic growth.
The agency said that it was common for the rate of job creation to be slow after a financial crisis, but that there had been ''a short-lived respite'' for developed countries beginning in 2010. That period has now ended, and once again ''further job restructuring is likely before a stronger rebound can be expected in labor markets.''
More people were simply leaving the job market altogether, particularly in the developed world, with labor force participation rates falling ''dramatically,'' it said, ''masking the true extent of the jobs crisis.''
The ratio of employment-to-population ratio has fallen as much as four percentage points or more in some areas, it noted, and even where jobless rates have eased, the participation rate ''has not yet recovered.''
The labor organization also spotlighted youth unemployment, noting that there were 73.8 million young people unemployed worldwide. It estimated that an additional half million would join the ranks of the jobless this year. The youth unemployment rate, now 12.6 percent, will probably rise to 12.9 percent by 2017, the agency said.
''The crisis has dramatically diminished the labor market prospects for young people,'' the agency said, ''as many experience long-term unemployment right from the start of their labor market entry, a situation that was never observed during earlier cyclical downturns.''
The agency said employment tapered off in 2011 before turning negative in 2012, with four million people added to global unemployment rolls last year.
But even countries in which jobless rates have not risen ''often have experienced a worsening in job quality,'' the organization said.

HEADLINE: Applause Is Muted in City With Role in President's Rise

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Harvey Nelson glanced around a diner here on Monday, then dropped his voice to a hush to talk about politics. Yes, he said, looking around again at nearby tables, he voted for President Obama, and yes, he said, some signs seem to be emerging of an improving economy.
''But I must confess, it's the uncertainty of everything that bothers me right now,'' said Mr. Nelson, 68, who retired from a state agency in this state capital. ''The people in Washington seem unable to sit down and talk.'' He added an explanation for all the whispering: fierce partisan polarization, he said, seems to have filtered out from the highest reaches of government even to places like this, Charlie Parker's Diner, where pancakes can be as big as pizzas. 
Here, in the city where Barack Obama first announced his plans to run for president at the Old State Capitol, the same place where Abraham Lincoln once served, the mood of residents -- both supporters and detractors of the president -- appeared muted, watchful, tentative as a second term began.
Mr. Obama's strongest advocates said they were hopeful about what may be ahead for the nation on matters of immigration and gun control, but anxious about how partisan battling and Republicans in the House may complicate those efforts. And many of Mr. Obama's critics said they felt resigned to the outcome of the election, but deeply worried about the nation's financial footing, spending and what one resident here described as ''way too many cliffs.''
''All I can say is that the debt really scares me,'' said another resident, Robert Lackie, 54. ''Why is it so difficult to think for the future instead of just for the next election?'' asked Mr. Lackie, who works in marketing and said he voted for Mr. Obama's Republican competitors in 2012 and 2008.
Although Mr. Obama easily won Illinois, his home state, in both of his elections, Springfield, where government is a significant employer, is about 200 miles southwest of Chicago, and the voters here, as in much of central and southern Illinois, are more Republican-leaning. Mr. Obama, who had served in the State Senate here, won this county, Sangamon, in 2008, but Mitt Romney won it in 2012.
Around this city, residents on all sides seemed to agree mainly on one thing: Washington has grown dysfunctional -- worse, many people said, than they had ever seen before and with no end in sight. Adding to the mood of uncertainty here, state politicians have also hit impasses lately: Illinois has wrestled with its own set of financial woes.
''With all the speeches today, what's going to be different tomorrow than it was yesterday?'' Loren Barnes, 66, said as inauguration ceremonies blared from three giant-screen televisions above a nearly empty bar inside an American Legion post where he ate a salad on Monday. His purpose for being here, he noted, was not to watch the ceremonies in Washington. He was here for lunch.
''What's going to happen? Nothing,'' said Mr. Barnes, a former farmer who works at a nonprofit operation. ''We're not doing anything. The Republicans can't seem to get along with the Democrats. And it's just unheard of that our credit rating goes down because of the fools in Washington and what they did.''
Many spoke of signs of economic improvement -- a friend who had at last found a job, a daughter who had sold her house -- but said they also remained cautious about what may be ahead and reluctant about whether it was really time, say, to commit to buying a new car or more insurance.
''Everyone is still in a rut,'' said Elisa Williams, a teacher from the Rockford area, visiting the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum here on Monday. ''A lot depends on how the next four years go -- a whole lot.''
And few seemed hopeful that partisan lines might fade soon. The issues ahead seemed likely only to sharpen the anger, many here said. Those opposed to Mr. Obama's health care law spoke pessimistically about where it would leave the nation, while supporters said they were eager to watch it play out. Supporters of increased gun restrictions said they were looking forward to seeing their children protected in the years ahead, while at least one opponent cautioned that Mr. Obama and the Democrats would be roundly rejected here if they moved to limit weapons.
''We are so polarized,'' said Mark Frailey, a former teacher from Belvidere, recalling a recent visit from a neighbor he barely knew. The neighbor dropped by, Mr. Frailey recalled, to rail about the debt, the budget, the nation's troubles, apparently because he remembered that Mr. Frailey had an Obama sign in his yard in 2008.
''I just let it go,'' said Mr. Frailey, as he headed off to an exhibit about the struggles of President Lincoln, a beloved hometown figure in these parts. ''But we really have to get beyond the bickering. ''
Back at Charlie Parker's Diner, Mr. Nelson wondered aloud about Mr. Obama's legacy. ''What I've seen from studying Lincoln is that it's a really hard job, that there's nothing you can do without people saying you're wrong, that you can't really be yourself, and that the pressure is always on,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''I sometimes wonder why people would want that job.''

HEADLINE: Its Tax Edge On Thin Ice, Private Equity Is Regrouping

BYLINE: By JANE SASSEEN

 BODY:
As Washington grapples with the country's fiscal woes, the private equity industry is grudgingly facing a new reality: its long-held tax advantages are likely to disappear.
For years, private equity has quashed efforts to raise taxes on so-called carried interest income, the profits partners receive as part of their compensation. Those earnings are considered capital gains, so they are taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary income.
While few concede defeat publicly, the industry is rethinking its strategy. Rather than trying to stop the changes outright, lawyers and executives behind the scenes are trying to minimize the hit if it happens.
Private equity recognizes the shifting politics. In the current budget debate, sacred cows like the tax deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable donations are on the table, along with potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare. 
"Once they start looking for revenues, carried interest will be on the list," said Anne Mathias, director of Washington policy research at Guggenheim Partners, a financial services firm. "You can hear it already: 'We need that money, or Grandma won't get a new hip.' "
Democrats and Republicans alike are looking at eliminating loopholes as part of a broader effort to overhaul the tax code. Changes to the treatment of carried interest could bring in $17 billion over 10 years, according to Congressional estimates.
"There is absolutely no reason why income earned for managing other people's money shouldn't be taxed in the same way as income earned teaching or working in a factory," said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who introduced the latest carried interest bill in 2012. Legislation based on Mr. Levin's bill is likely to be part of a broader package if carried interest comes into play.
Officially, the private equity industry remains opposed to change. Its lobbying group, the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, began an extensive public relations campaign last year to improve the industry's image during the presidential race, in which the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, was criticized for his actions as chief executive of the private equity firm Bain Capital.
The trade group also increased its Congressional lobbying. To highlight the industry's economic contributions, it arranged 70 meetings in which House members visited private-equity-owned companies or met their chiefs. For example, Representative Robert Hurt, Republican of Virginia, toured a distribution center for Dollar General, a retailer previously owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
"We will continue to do what we have always done," said Steve Judge, chief executive of the trade group.
He and others argue that it is appropriate to treat private equity income as capital gains because managers have money at risk and actively reorganize companies. Mr. Judge also noted that private equity is already paying more under the deal to avert the fiscal cliff, which raised the capital gains tax rate to 20 percent from 15 percent, on top of the 3.8 percent capital gains surcharge enacted on wealthy taxpayers to finance President Obama's health care law.
But even as the industry continues to press its case, many of its members acknowledge that the carried interest break is coming to an end. "At some point it's inevitable, so they will deal with it," said Bradley Morrow, a senior private markets consultant at Towers Watson. If the proposal does re-emerge, the industry is expected to focus its lobbying on softening transition rules.
One issue will be the amount of carried interest reclassified as ordinary income. Mr. Levin's 2012 bill would convert 100 percent of carried interest. By contrast, an earlier version of the bill proposed capping the affected income at 50 percent to 75 percent.
The industry is also likely to focus on how quickly any changes would go into effect. Lobbyists will probably push for a longer delay, even if it means little or no cap, said Micah W. Bloomfield, a tax lawyer with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. That would give partners more time to pocket capital gains or restructure funds before the rate increase took effect.
Another point of contention will be the treatment of profits that partners earn when they sell stakes in their firms, a sum known as enterprise value. Currently, profits attributable to enterprise value are treated as capital gains. In earlier bills, they would have been reclassified as ordinary income.
"What people complained most vociferously about in the earlier bills was the treatment of enterprise value," said James R. Brown, a tax lawyer with Willkie Farr & Gallagher. If a fund manager sold the business, "all the gain from the sale would have been considered ordinary income," Mr. Brown said. "That's a big difference in how any other business is taxed when it's sold."
The Obama administration and Congressional proponents of reform acknowledge the problem. Mr. Levin's latest bill included provisions to treat enterprise value as capital gains. The issue is particularly important for large, publicly traded firms like Blackstone and K.K.R. As partners near retirement, they see it as crucial to get capital gains tax treatment when they divest their stakes.
But the issue is complex. Congressional tax staff, worried that firms could redefine some carried interest as enterprise value, wrote the language of the bill narrowly to prevent abuse.
Private equity advocates argue that the bill still casts too wide a net, and that some legitimate profits from business sales would end up classified as ordinary income.
"They may think they have solved the issue, but they haven't," said one industry lobbyist, who requested anonymity because of the delicacy of the discussions.
Beyond transition rules, firms might consider adapting their own structures if the break does end.
The simplest strategy - one already occurring - is to accelerate the recognition of accrued capital gains. Funds might also remove some unrealized carried interest from their investment partnerships altogether, said Steven Rosenthal, a visiting fellow at the Washington-based Tax Policy Center. They could do that by shifting ownership of the gains to an affiliate by distributing securities of equal value.
These ideas may not all work, but funds are preparing nonetheless. Many have added language to partnership agreements, reserving the right to restructure, Mr. Brown said.
Tax lawyers have been searching for a broader escape hatch for years, in something of a cat-and-mouse game with legislators. In one early proposal, the lawyers suggested that general partners borrow money from limited partners to help capitalize a fund. They also explored setting up funds using foreign corporations that allow income to flow through to their owners as capital gains. But legislators rejected those ideas in later bills.
A potential strategy still being discussed involves setting up new funds as America-based C corporations, which the Internal Revenue Service taxes separately from their owners. In one possibility, a private equity firm would create a corporate holding company to buy and manage each individual portfolio company, instead of buying them through a partnership.
The private equity partners would then receive holding company shares, rather than being paid with carried interest. The private equity managers would pay ordinary income taxes on the initial share distribution, but any further increase in the shares' value would be considered capital gains.
The structure is similar to one used in venture capital, said Patrick B. Fenn, a tax lawyer with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. "People are looking at this, but no one has gotten to the point where they'd do it for their next fund," Mr. Fenn said. "You won't see any real reaction on structures until we see the specifics."
Added Mr. Morrow of Towers Watson: "There are a number of ideas on the drawing boards. I'm not sure any of them will work, but the tax lawyers and accountants are certainly working on it."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Mumbai/New York Photo Project: On the Sidewalks

BYLINE: NISHA SONDHE and NEHA THIRANI BAGRI


HIGHLIGHT: In both cities, the sidewalk is for much more than just walking. 

 BODY:
 This is the second installment in Nisha Sondhe's Mumbai/New York photography project. View part one, "On the Waterfront," here. Read more about the project here. 
Mumbai and New York are both crowded cities teeming with traffic - not just in the streets, but on the sidewalks, too. The New York City Transportation Department estimates that the city has 12,750 miles of sidewalk, which are becoming more congested each year.
A city government survey calculating the "pedestrian volume index" suggested that since 2007, the number of people walking on New York's sidewalks had risen over 10 percent by May 2011. That's a good thing: the city government is attempting to encourage the walking habit by widening streets, adding more benches and improving cleanliness.
Mumbai is also already a very pedestrian-heavy city. The pavements of Mumbai host about 15 million walking trips each day, with about 55 percent of Mumbai residents walking some distance to work.
However, dilapidated sidewalks and an ever-increasing volume of cars mean that safety is a pressing issue in the city. According to a study, 78 percent of Mumbai's road fatalities involve pedestrians. The Walking Project, an initiative by a group of Mumbai activists, is advocating for better provisions for pedestrians in the city.
To the uninitiated, it may seem that the sidewalks of Mumbai are meant for almost anything except for walking. In fact, they play an integral role in the city's vibrant informal economy. You can find a barber for your morning shave or someone to mend your shoes, clean your ears or sharpen your knives. A recent study estimated that there were nearly 250,000 street vendors in the city.
New York City's sidewalks are also littered with vendors selling everything from hot dogs to fake designer handbags and cheap electronics. In some cases, it seems New York City takes its inspiration from Mumbai. Thirukumar Kandasamy, also known as "the Dosa Man," runs one of New York's most well-known street stalls and claims to be listed in the guidebooks of 42 countries. The Street Vendor Project estimates that New York City has about 20,000 street vendors.
In both cities, the sidewalk often becomes an important spot for the city's artistic expression. Along the many of the sidewalks of New York City are interesting murals, art installations and often-irreverent graffiti. New York City's Transportation Departmentencourages urban art projects, collaborating with different artists and groups to brighten up the city.
Meanwhile, artistic graffiti is slowly gaining popularity in Mumbai. The Wall Project, started in 2009 with the blessing of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, saw over 400 Mumbai resident volunteers painting the 2.4-kilometer (1.5-mile) stretch that spans Tulsi Pipe Road. The stretch of wall along a busy road was once the city's most derelict.
In both of these cities, a walk down the street is never a dull affair.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: Journalist and Author Fareed Zakaria

BYLINE: GAYATRI RANGACHARI SHAH


HIGHLIGHT: On India's Arab Spring, how the country can restore its image and ways Mumbai has changed since he was a boy. 

 BODY:
 Fareed Zakaria is a prolific Indian-American journalist, author and commentator. He is an editor-at-large of Time magazine, hosts a show on CNN, has written three books, and is a regular contributor to various journals and papers, including the prominent journal Foreign Affairs, which he edited from 1992 to 2000. 
Mr. Zakaria was recently in Mumbai to film a documentary on India's politics and economy for CNN. He took time out from filming to meet with India Ink at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in southern Mumbai to discuss a wide range of topics, from America's domestic problems to India's place in the world -- as well as what a Mumbai native like him makes of this rapidly transforming mega-city.
 Q. 
You recently wrote that India is going through its own version of the Arab Spring. Can you explain? 
 A. 
The average person in the Arab world was stuck in a system that simply was not performing and delivering. 
Now it is true that India is very different. India has been a democracy for 65 years. Sixty percent of the Indian electorate is women, and yet when you look at how women fare in any international ranking, India fares poorly. So clearly there is some problem that democracy has not solved for the emancipation and empowerment of women. 
It derives from the fact that much of the oppression we see in India comes from society and not the state. In India the oppression you find is social oppression, because of caste or religion or ethnicity, and most acutely in terms of gender. 
You are finally beginning to see these forces of oppression challenged, for three reasons. The first is democracy, which has certainly enabled people. The second is capitalism, which produces this great churn where anyone can succeed. The third is technology. I've been struck by the degree to which, just like in the Arab Spring, the media has been able to publicize this issue of women's rights. 
The urban issue has become a national issue. This is a reflection of the rise of a much bigger middle class. Urban India has generally been seen as a place where politicians extract resources. Rural India is the place where they get the votes. That's changing. 
 Q. 
Given the recent tensions along the Line of Control and the public anger within India, what should the government of India's response be? 
 A. 
Manmohan Singh has been quite shrewd to diffuse the public pressure. The real story between India and Pakistan over the last five years has been one of remarkable improvement in relationship, particularly in relation to trade and travel. These kinds of skirmishes have gone on since 1947. I would hope this doesn't derail what is a promising shift. 
 Q. 
Has the Indian media been saber-rattling for a war with Pakistan, perhaps to increase viewers, in your opinion? What role should the media play in such a situation? 
 A. 
It's mainly a problem with television. India has 325 television channels. You have 40 news channels in Hindi alone. So these people are in a desperate search for market share and the result is a bias towards sensationalism. 
The print media was saying 'We've got to be careful.' The television media-- I've talked to some of the people involved and they themselves felt that the coverage was getting too jingoistic. It is interesting to see this distinction between print and television media here which is now very dramatic. 
 Q. 
In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, you wrote about a new crisis of democracy in the United States. What do you mean? 
 A. 
It is a crisis of democracy because the nature of the problem is one that is inherent in democracy, and therefore one that India faces as well: How do you impose short-term pain for long-term gain? 
This is the great challenge for the United States economy. There are things the United States has to do, whether it's a cumbersome tax code or reform of entitlements in pension and health care. Instead, we privilege present consumption over investments for the long term. 
India has a similar problem. It is hard to stop subsidizing power or giving people rice and instead divert those resources either towards putting your fiscal house in order or making long-term investments in infrastructure and education that will have huge payoffs 20 years down the road. America's fundamental challenge is: 'How does it do this?' 
 Q. 
How can India restore its growth story? 
 A. 
All India needs to do is make a few key decisions. For instance, if India could genuinely open up agriculture, retail and the supply chains relating to that, you would bring down food inflation. People don't realize that India has some of the highest interest rates in the world. If food inflation goes down, the Reserve Bank could lower interest rates. 
Businesses are borrowing money at 14 percent and they still thrive. Imagine what they could do if rates were four points lower. 
Then there's the obvious thing that India has to build infrastructure. To be fair to the reformers in India, they've done a lot. Most of the economy is fairly open. So what you have are a few remaining obstacles, and they are very large and hard to do politically. 
 Q. 
India has been shaken by a series of recent corruption scandals and then the recent Delhi gang rape. How does India restore its image overseas? 
 A. 
It's simple: growth. Has India's image taken a beating? Yes. I believe that its good that the corruption story and the rape story are coming out because this stuff always happened. Let's not kid ourselves. What's different now is that there's a huge national conversation about it and there's political action that is coming out of it. 
 Q. 
How much importance does America place on India? 
 A. 
America would love to see it as an increasingly deep and broad strategic relationship. I think there are two problems. One is that India has not been able to perform in terms of opening up its economy in quite the ways we were hoping. Openness to foreign capital has been more hesitant and inconsistent than what was promised. 
The second is that the Indian political elite remains ambivalent about a close relationship with America. There's a suspicion of America as some kind of a global capitalist war monger. This is very unfortunate as this ideology is triumphing over India's natural national interests. India's interests are so clearly aligned with America's, whether you look at Pakistan, Afghanistan, China or whether you look at the issue of democracy and human rights. 
I can't tell you how many Americans tell me that they are sure India will be the success story over China. This is the triumph of hope over facts. The Chinese economy is 3.5 times the size of India's and still grows faster than India's. So what it tells you is that Americans want India to succeed. 
 Q. 
Do you think there's any merit in the argument that the Chinese path to development is better than the Western one? 
 A. 
None whatsoever because what they have largely done is copy the Western model. What the Chinese have done is opening up to the market and in building great infrastructure. In what sense is this an Asian model or a Chinese model? 
 Q. 
You admitted in August of last year to a "terrible mistake," in which a column you penned resembled an article in the New Yorker, and have been largely forgiven for this. Is there something about the current media environment, which emphasizes immediacy and round-the-clock coverage, that allows mistakes like that to happen more now than before?
 A. 
It was my mistake. I don't want to excuse it by claiming that there was some larger system. 
The only point I would make and which I feel didn't get as much focus is that I cited the book at the start of the paragraph. I hope people can see that it was unintentional as I wasn't trying to pass it off as my own. I have been writing for 25 years and I made a mistake. I have tried to make sure that over the next 25 years I don't make another mistake. 
 Q. 
You're from Mumbai. How does today's Mumbai look to you? 
 A. 
Edith Wharton writes of New York at the turn of the century and that the old New York she knew was a quiet, genteel place and now it's a brash, new-money place. I feel the same way about Bombay. The city I grew up in was so quiet. If you went for a walk in the Hanging Gardens, there would be five people there, and you'd know four of them. Now you go there and you can't find parking. 
Yet I love it. The city is almost unrecognizable. The idea that Andheri is the center of the city is just unfathomable. Don't get too nostalgic for the old days. Look at it from the point of view of the middle-class guy who never had access to much. Does he or she mind that they have to spend an hour or an hour and a half to drive from Andheri to south Mumbai? No, because they now have a car and they never had a car before. 
I am very optimistic about India. There's no question India will be a middle-class country. The question is, will it go further than that and how soon?

HEADLINE: Unappeasable Scolds

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Being reasonable won't help. 

 BODY:
Mark Thoma is puzzled: if Larry Summers is going to write a piece about how we're obsessing too much about the deficit, why begin with two paragraphs about how the deficit is a big problem? 
But there's no mystery: that's the INK disclaimer -- I'm Not Krugman. It's supposed to establish Larry's bona fides as a Serious Person, appeasing the deficit scolds so that he can get on with the substance of his argument.
I wish him luck, but don't think he'll get far. For the deficit scolds are unappeasable.
If you believed that the scolds were just honest citizens concerned about America's long-run prospects, you might also believe that a careful, rational argument about how those prospects are better served by investing more, not less, while the economy is depressed could win them over. But to hold such beliefs, you'd have to have been living in a cave, reading nothing but the Washington Post editorial page, for the past four years.
The reality, first, is that the deficit scolds -- who are, after all, making a living by scolding -- depend on constant warnings of imminent fiscal crisis to drum up interest. Saying that it's a longer-term issue, and not our first priority right now, is not something they can afford to hear.
Moreover, most of the deficit scolds don't really care about the deficit; it's all really about using deficit fears to bully us into downsizing government and tearing down the safety net. Remember, three of the leading deficit-scold organizations gave Paul Ryan an award for fiscal responsibility even though anyone who understood numbers could see that his plans would actually increase the deficit; and David Walker endorsed Mitt Romney despite his budget-busting proposals on taxes and military spending.
Or consider the deficit-scold habit of hectoring President Obama for failing to endorse a balanced combination of deficit reduction through tax increases and spending cuts, despite the fact that this is exactly what he has endorsed, many times. Why, you'd almost think that deficit-reduction doesn't count if it comes from a Democrat.
So Larry is trying to curry favor with a segment of respectable opinion that, as far as I can tell, doesn't actually exist. OK, it's a big country; there may be somebody out there who's persuadable, maybe even someone inside the Beltway. Maybe that person and Larry can have lunch.

HEADLINE: The Non-Surge in Government Spending

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Keep your eye on the business cycle. 

 BODY:
The fiscal debate in Washington is dominated by things everyone knows that happen not to be true. One of those things is the notion that we have a fiscal crisis, an assertion belied both by the low interest rates at which the Feds can borrow and by the fact that medium-term deficit projections really aren't that alarming. Another is the notion that our current deficit is driven by a surge in government spending. 
I've written on various occasions about that latter point, but we're further along in the business cycle now, so it's time for an update.
The crucial thing to understand here is that you do need to take the state of the business cycle into account; it's not enough simply to do what Nate Silver, for example, does, and look at spending as a share of GDP -- a calculation that can be deeply misleading in the aftermath of a severe recession followed by a slow recovery.
Why does this matter? First, if the economy is depressed -- if GDP is low relative to potential -- the share of spending in GDP will correspondingly look high. Suppose that you have commitments to defense, to Social Security, to Medicare that are growing at rates consistent with the long-run growth in the economy; if the economy plunges and then takes a long time to get back to trend, those spending programs will temporarily account for a larger share of GDP, even if there hasn't been any acceleration in their growth.
Second, there are some programs -- unemployment benefits, food stamps, to some extent Medicaid -- that tend to spend more when the economy is depressed and more people are in distress. And rightly so! You don't want to take a temporary spike in UI payments after a deep slump as a sign of runaway spending.
So how can we get a better picture? First, express spending as a share of potential rather than actual GDP; we can use the CBO estimates of potential for that purpose. Second, keep your eye on the business cycle -- and, in particular, on how spending is evolving now that a gradual recovery is underway.
So, let's look first at a longish time series of total government spending as a share of potential GDP:
What you see is not a sustained upward trend: there's actually a considerable fall during the Clinton years, reflecting in part falling defense spending, then a more modest rise in the Bush years, mainly reflecting spending on the War on Terror (TM), and finally a temporary surge associated with the financial crisis -- but much of that surge has already been reversed.
Here's a closeup on Bush's last two years and Obama's first four:
That was the spending surge that was.
Now, there's still stuff out there that will, under current law, lead to rising spending: mainly an aging population plus rising health care costs. And some of that is already affecting spending trends. But the idea that we've had some kind of spending surge, and that current deficits reflect that surge, is just wrong, and distorts public discussion.

HEADLINE: At Davos, Crisis Is the New Normal

BYLINE: ALISON SMALE


HIGHLIGHT: While global capital remains a driving force of our age, it won't solve big world issues. For those tasks, we must rely either on the nation state or on international institutions whose effectiveness is regularly questioned by the Davos crowd. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland - In certain ways, the very setting of the World Economic Forum reflects the restless, challenged state of human affairs. Our footing is uncertain, as on this ski resort's slithery streets, and we have steep slopes to climb, as the Magic Mountain will remind the global elite this week.
Barely into 2013, Mali and Algeria are new sites of hot war and chilling fear. Where the tumult that began in the Arab Spring will end is still as unclear as when it erupted - far from Davos - two years ago. 
The challenge posed by the free flow of information in China went to the New Year streets in Guangzhou. Washington's feuding politicians walked up to the brink before resolving not to jump off the so-called fiscal cliff. Europe seems to have averted a collapse of the euro, but even in Germany, growth is anemic. 
 Crisis, in short, is the new normal.
And while the business community determinedly seeks opportunity in troubled times, even many an entrepreneur views the years since the financial crisis of 2008 as what Rich Lesser, the new chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group, called "a higher period of turbulence and uncertainty in the global economy than we have experienced in a very long time."
The days in which "quants" and algorithms reigned supreme are gone, their increasingly untrackable results having helped the financial system spin out of control in 2008 and 2009. The heady triumph of capitalism after 1989 is also a distant memory, although its chief effect - that capital went global - remains a driving force of our age.
But global capital does not solve big world issues: debt and financial crisis, political paralysis or gridlock, the transformative effects of the digital revolution, climate change, resource shortages, shifting demographics.
For those tasks, we must rely either on the nation state - an aging collective unit that does not readily serve transnational action - or on international institutions whose effectiveness is regularly questioned by the Davos crowd.
"The global economy has integrated, but global society is as fragmented as ever," said Dennis J. Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
In that fragmentation, there is an increasing lack of consensus about the global way forward. A few years ago, the inexorable rise of China led to talk of a new Beijing consensus, replacing the Washington consensus that epitomized the confident domination of the United States.
But China, while still growing, is growing less fast. It remains a one-party state, and its advance has arguably resulted more from enormous investment than creative increases in productivity. The challenges to its new leadership are clear: the need for financial reform; the perils of shadow banking and corruption; thick urban pollution; and, above all, the free flow of information, as seen in the standoff this month between a state censor in Guangzhou and journalists at the Southern Weekend and their supporters.
Ian Bremmer, head of the Eurasia Group political consulting firm, who in general sees a big return of politics in business calculations as the world becomes permanently restless, likened China to a large car that is racing toward a brick wall, "and we don't know if they have steering" to skirt the obstacle, or whether they will hit it. 
"As China grows wealthier," he said in an interview, "entrenched Chinese will see the benefit of the rule of law" - a key element of the Washington consensus. But "the new leadership is not anywhere near there."
For Yasheng Huang, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the saving grace of the incoming president, Xi Jinping, and his colleagues is that they are pragmatists. Pragmatism, he argued in an interview by phone, "means that you weigh the costs and benefits of certain actions." It "checks the ideology."
Yet even as China helps to sustain international growth - where would Europe's purveyors of luxury be without the eager Chinese consumer? - it remains, like other emerging countries, self-absorbed.
"Look at the big debates of the last five years," said Minxin Pei, like Mr. Huang a Chinese-born academic, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College in California. "It's very hard to find one that originated in Beijing. People talk about China outside China, but still the country is very inward-looking." This also feeds rising nationalism seen most markedly in the escalating dispute between China and Japan in the East China Sea.
As with China, so with Russia, India and Brazil, or indeed South Africa, Nigeria, Indonesia and other favorites of those who seek bright spots on a gloomy globe. In Brazil, "everything is focused on being Brazilian, how great it is," noted Misha Glenny, a British analyst who has written on global mafias, cybercrime and is now working on a book about Brazil.
In these countries, absorbed in their own material advances and increasingly wary of a Washington-made prescription for their future, the "fiscal cliff" and debate about the limit on the United States deficit serve as proof that they are on the right path, though critics might dispute it.
"On the whole, we made a recovery from the crisis even faster than other countries," President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told a news conference last month. "Just look at the recession in Europe, while Russia has posted growth, albeit a modest one, but we still have a much better situation than in the once-prosperous euro zone, or even in the United States."
In the United States, recent books have argued that the country's status as a debtor nation is curbing its global reach. After the last-minute fiscal deal this month, a commentary of the kind believed to reflect high government thinking on the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua noted tartly: "The American people were once better known for their ability to make tough choices on difficult issues." It went on, "The Americans may be proud of their mature democracy, but the political gridlock in Washington really looks ugly from an outsider's view."
One example of how nations in transition are going their own way is Egypt, where President Mohamed Morsi seems to seek a geopolitical mix: a dose of Turkey, an Islamist-leaning democracy, with much-needed financial aid from China, and relations with Washington warm enough to garner more aid and collaborate on diplomacy like mediating the Israeli-Palestinian fighting over the Gaza Strip last November.
The fluid nature of this world is enhanced by digital communication. With the collapse in newspaper readership and the spread of social media, "everyone gets little snippets of information, and never fully understands the implications," Mr. Glenny noted. "Very few people do deeper reading and thinking."
This, he argued, increases people's sense that "everything has just become too big to grasp and understand."
A crucial topic for the dozen or so analysts interviewed for this article, and central also to discussions of increasingly important trends like the global rise of women, is education. Instead of machines being in charge, a nimble human mind, connecting individuals with collective wisdom, is seen as the antidote to cacophony, poverty and chaos.
In this view, more and better schooling will help lift hundreds of millions out of poverty, make it easier for populations to cope with change and stimulate the kind of innovation that Mr. Lesser sees already in technology, medicine and health care.
What kind of education is a topic that will be much debated at Davos, to judge from several scheduled sessions on disruptive universities and the like.
"We need government to recognize the need to build the next-gen work force," Mr. Lesser said. This is "fundamental to staying competitive in the future," he said. "The challenge goes beyond education. It's also about good immigration policies." In this way, he argued, a country facing demographic challenges - Germans, according to a government survey released last week, are the most childless adults in Europe - may preserve wealth and adapt to the future.
Whether by increasing online courses, interacting with students or raising the relatively dismal level of numeracy and literacy among American high school graduates, improving education "is one of the few things I can be unguardedly optimistic about," said Niall Ferguson, the Harvard University historian. "The solutions are relatively cheap, simple and to hand."

HEADLINE: Pressures at Home, Tensions Offshore

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: It is tempting to conclude that the increasingly dangerous dispute between China and Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands is driven in part by Beijing's need to distract its populace from problems at home. 

 BODY:
China's gross domestic product grew 7.8 percent in 2012, its slowest pace since 1999. The growth slowdown appears to have bottomed out, and for the fourth quarter of 2012 the economy grew at 7.9 percent, slightly ahead of expectations. 
Many analysts questioned the health of the apparent recovery and the limited progress in rebalancing the economy away from investment toward consumption. 
In spite of the improvement in the Chinese economy, the construction and mining sectors have remained relatively weak. Caterpillar's China operation has had some difficulties, and it now turns out that the company has had to deal with not only a weak economy but also what it says wasoutright fraud.
In 2011, Caterpillar announced the acquisition of ERA Mining Machinery for up to $886 million. On Friday afternoon, on the eve of a three-day weekend, Caterpillar issued a news release saying it had "uncovered deliberate, multiyear, coordinated accounting misconduct" in ERA's operations.
Another month, another Chinese fraud, a cynic might quip. What makes this scam so remarkable is that a huge multinational with decades of experience in China was fooled, possibly because of a "distracted board of directors", and that the principal shareholdersof ERA - Emory Williams, a former president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, and James E. Thompson III, heir apparent to the Crown Shipping fortune - are prominent Western expatriates.
Caterpillar has not publicly accused Mr. Williams or Mr. Thompson of misconduct, but the release says "Caterpillar's investigation of these matters is ongoing and any other comment at this time is not appropriate."
 SIGNIFICANT INCOME INEQUALITY may be hampering China's rebalancing from investment-led to consumption-driven growth. For the first time since 2000, the Chinese government has released official estimates of the country's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's 2012 Gini coefficient was 0.477, similar to the 2011 figure for the United States. The bureau also reports that the measure has declined since 2008.
There was much skepticism about the official calculations, and a separate report released last month by researchers from a Chinese University claimed that China's Gini was actually 0.61 in 2010. 
Most likely it is somewhere between 0.477 and 0.61, but regardless of the true number it is clear that income disparities - along with a slower economy,air pollution and unsafe food, among many issues - are an increasing source of frustration for its citizens.
China's new leadership is clearly feeling pressure, and it is tempting to conclude that the increasingly dangerous dispute between China and Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands is driven in part by Beijing's need to distract its populace from problems at home. The risks of a conflict, however, are immense for Beijing's leaders. If China were to fight and lose any clash with the Japanese, the Communist Party could face an immediate and terminal legitimacy crisis.
The hope is that things will not escalate beyond patrols and rhetoric, given the deep economic ties between Japan and China, as well as the danger of American involvement in any clash given the security relationship between the United States and Japan. 
Both sides continue to talk, though mostly past each other, and a prominent Japanese politician arrived in Beijing on Tuesdaycarrying a letter to Xi Jinping from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.
As the politicians talk, growing numbers of ships and aircraft are maneuvering in a relatively small area around the islands, significantly heightening the risk of accidents. A collision in 2001 involving a Chinese fighter jet and an American spy plane over the South China Sea resulted in the death of a Chinese pilot, and several days' detention for the American crew and the loss of American equipment. The crisis ended peacefully after Washington sent expressions of regret that Beijing trumpeted in domestic media as an apology.
It is hard to believe that a similar mishap involving the Chinese and Japanese would end so quickly or peacefully. China's relentless media campaign since the summer, the anti-Japanese teachings so prevalent in the Chinese education system and the imperative of any new leadership to not look weak, especially toward the Japanese, could mean that if an accident did occur, especially one that resulted in the death of a Chinese citizen, Beijing might have so painted itself into a corner that it would have respond with force.
 THE COSTS OF A CONFLICT could be astronomical, but history is rife with miscalculations that have repeatedly demonstrated irrational actions in the heat of nationalism cannot be ruled out.
Even if this round of the dispute is resolved peacefully, the underlying problems will remain. Meantime, the Chinese-Japanese relationship has eroded, and China, Japan and their neighbors will want to increase military spending to prepare for inevitable future disputes.
Mistrust between China and the United States hasincreased. China blames the United States for giving the islands to Japan to administer and believes that without the American security umbrella, Japan would no longer dare to challenge China.
A commentary in the official Chinese news agency Xinhua on Inauguration Day declared that "Obama could build a legacy by boosting trust with China." Xinhua's suggestions may be difficult for President Obama to accept, but his handling of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands crisis and the overall relationship with China in his second term will likely define a significant part of his foreign policy legacy.

HEADLINE: Reports Reveal Financial Challenges, but Few Solutions

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Mandatory reading at the World Economic Forum should be two reminders from JPMorgan Chase and the Federal Reserve that we are far from understanding or preventing financial crises, the Deal Professor writes. 

 BODY:
The important and self-important of global finance are again gathering at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This year, the mandatory reading should be two recent reminders from JPMorgan Chase and the Federal Reserve that we are light years from understanding or preventing financial crises.
The reminders come in the form of JPMorgan's management task force report on the bank's billions in losses from the "London whale" trade and the released transcripts of the 2007 Federal Reserve meetings. The report and the transcripts provide a sobering lesson that the people who run our financial system not only have a lot of work to do, they still aren't sure what that work is.
Let's start with JPMorgan's $6.2 billion trading loss.
JPMorgan is a huge institution with more than $2 trillion in assets. Banks typically lend their deposits, but for the tens of billions that JPMorgan cannot lend, this remainder is turned over to its chief investment office. This unit is charged with earning returns on this money and also using these billions to hedge the enormous financial institution against bad events. 
What happened next was that a number of C.I.O. traders got stuck.
The traders made a complex financial bet that was intended in part to hedge the bank from another big credit disruption. But the trading position became so large - more than $50 billion in notional value - that the JPMorgan traders couldn't liquidate it without hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Instead of liquidation, they went in the other direction, adding some $30 billion more in notional value to the portfolio, hoping this would save them. But that trade still didn't work, and JPMorgan lost an estimated $169 million in the first two months of 2012. It was then that the traders added another $40 billion to the portfolio.
The trade went really bad after that.
In early April, reports emerged of an outsize bet by a JPMorgan trader in London - the "whale." Hedge funds went on the attack as they took offsetting positions in anticipation that the bank couldn't hold the trade. The funds were right. JPMorgan lost $412 million on the first trading day after Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal reported about the London whale, and the losses would subsequently mount.
The internal report details what went wrong, and it is head-scratching. In the middle of a meltdown, JPMorgan traders fudge numbers, ignore orders, try to evade pesky regulations and in general scramble as they try to salvage their trade. Management races to understand what is going on at the subsidiary while markets go haywire in ways that no one ever expected or that JPMorgan's models predicted. After the first-day loss of $412 million, Ina R. Drew, then the head of the chief investment office, wrote in an e-mail that it was an "eight sigma event," according to the report. The Reuters columnist Felix Salmon calculated that the chances of it happeningwas one in 800 trillion.
Unfortunately, the bank's trading debacle was just history repeating itself.
You could substitute the names, but this story of self-interest, unexpected market events and huge losses is similar to almost every other financial blowup of the last two decades.
In every instance, the question is: Where were the regulators? Well, one answer comes from the recent release of the transcripts from the 2007 meetings of the Federal Reserve. The transcripts portray a regulator that not only failed to appreciate the risk that had built up in the financial system and the coming storm, but also seemed to misunderstand fundamentally the subprime mortgage market.
For example, in the Federal Reserve's August 2007 meeting, the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial was described as having a "strong franchise." Countrywide has since saddled its acquirer, Bank of America, with tens of billions of dollars in losses.
In this meeting, the Federal Reserve governors went on to discuss the economy and noted that despite the recent market turmoil, it had a "reasonably good" chance of returning to its trend growth. The gem from this meetingwas a remark by Frederic S. Mishkin, who stated that since "subprime market is really a very small percentage of the total credit markets," the fact that the markets were now turning a critical eye to this sector was a "good thing."
It's all sobering. Not only are financial trading losses hard to predict and manage from the inside, but regulators with a farther view often do not appreciate the risk, the markets or the prospect of the losses. It happened with subprime mortgages and again after the financial crisis with JPMorgan's trading loss, a loss that even the firm's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who had a vaunted reputation as a risk manager, could not prevent.
The JPMorgan report in particular is disheartening. One is struck that nothing we have really done so far in terms of financial reform would have prevented JPMorgan's loss. Certainly the requirement that boards have systemic-risk committees wouldn't have done anything. If the traders and JP Morgan's management can't monitor things, how could the boards? In fact, how can anyone anticipate a one-in-800-trillion event?
This all adds strength to those who argue to break up the banks or limit their financial activity through the Volcker Rule.
Which brings us to the World Economic Forum.
Flipping through the forum's program, it is once again filled with events that are Davos-like, like a panel on "Connected Transportation - Hype or Reality." But nowhere do the words "financial crisis" even appear in the preliminary program, though there is a worthwhile discussion of the crisis in Mali. And flipping through its 80-odd pages, I counted only two panels on big systemic risk issues even tangentially related to financial institutions. Instead, the panels are the same old Davos big think and global stuff, except now instead of about China dominating the world, it is about whether China will make it.
This is a problem. We are five years past the beginnings of the financial crisis, and there is still no real explanation for what happened, let alone a solution. Was it a unique event that should have been foreseen and prevented? How can we regulate these institutions when smart people like Federal Reserve governors can miss so much? And is breaking up banks even feasible in a global economy?
Here, JPMorgan has admirably provided its own self-analysis, and its task force prescribes more risk analysis, better risk models and management - all of the comforting things you would want - as a remedy. But would it really prevent a one-in-800-trillion event, or even just an event its traders didn't model?
The World Economic Forum and its leaders appear to be moving on, but if the financial titans gathered there are really going to fight off the small but growing number of critics who are calling for the breakup of the big banks or even more likely a stronger Volcker Rule, they should put forth an alternative or an explanation for why these blowups keep occurring. The forum would seem to be an ideal place to do it.

HEADLINE: The Appeal of Investments That Cost More and Return Less

BYLINE: CARL RICHARDS


HIGHLIGHT: Wealthy people are still putting their money in hedge funds, even though they're expensive and don't often offer big returns. 

 BODY:
 Carl Richards is a financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at the BAM Alliance. His book, "The Behavior Gap," was published last year. His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog.
People seem to besticking with hedge funds, despite another terrible year in a terrible decade of performance, according to The Economist: 
"The S&P 500 has now outperformed its hedge-fund rival for 10 straight years, with the exception of 2008 when both fell sharply. A simple-minded investment portfolio, 60 percent of it in [stock] shares and the rest in sovereign bonds, has delivered returns of more than 90 percent over the last decade, compared with a meager 17 percent after fees for hedge funds."
On top of that, investors are paying through the nose for the privilege of investing in hedge funds. Felix Salmon points out:
"Steve Cohen's SAC Capital, marred by insider trading investigations, made it to the top of Bloomberg Markets' ranking of the most profitable hedge funds this year, not because of performance but because of fees. Instead of the usual 2 and 20 fee structure, SAC reportedly charges a 3 percent management fee and as much as 50 percent of its clients' profits."
The question that I can't stop asking myself is why?
Why, despite this body of evidence and our experience to the contrary, do people think that once you have a bunch of money you've somehow outgrown the simple, low-cost investment tools that most academics think you should use, like broadly diversified index funds and basic, safe fixed-income instruments?
I can think of a few possible reasons.
First, that's just what rich, smart people do, right? It's just another piece of (bogus) investing folklore: Once you have a big pile of money to invest, the solution must be complicated. And the more complicated and secretive and exclusive it is, the better.
Second, people want to believe there's a better way of investing that's only available to a select few. This idea of using plain old mutual funds is for the common folk. People think, "I've got to get access to the best minds in the industry, and they're in the heads of people who go manage hedge funds, right?"
Finally, there's a perverse belief that if something is more expensive, it simply has to be better.
But when it comes to investing, as Vanguard Group's founder, John Bogle said, "You get what you don't pay for."
This is just cold, hard math. If an investment earns 10 percent, and you're paying a 3 percent management fee plus 50 percent of profits (or even 2 and 20), you're going to keep a lot less of your money than with an investment that earns 10 percent and only charges a management fee of 0.5 percent or 0.25 percent, like an index mutual fund or exchange-traded fund might.
I once worked with an attorney who represented a large family endowment that wanted a new investing strategy. So I walked him through a simple, well-diversified, low-cost portfolio. I gave him the returns and the risk numbers. They were impressive. But this was just a plain vanilla portfolio.
Three other groups made pitches. Those folks came with two-inch-thick proposals and flew people in to give presentations. Their strategies were pretty complicated with lots of bells and whistles. But their performance numbers weren't quite as good.
Not long after the pitches, the lawyer called to say that his client had decided to go in different direction. He told me it was because my plan seemed too basic.
I knew this attorney pretty well. I waited a few days, and then I took the same numbers from my too-basic portfolio and moved the return number down a little, bumped the risk number up a little and charged a slightly higher fee.
I sent the numbers to the lawyer and called him and said something like, "Hey, did you look at those numbers? The strategy involves a proprietary fund run by some of the smartest people I've ever met. They won't even reveal their process because it's basically rocket science in a box."
His response? "Wow, we'd like to hear more about that."
I'm curious: Why do you think people still invest in hedge funds? What am I missing?

HEADLINE: Turning 'Them' Into 'Us'

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: There is a reason America values immigration, and it goes beyond just adding students and engineers to the workforce. 

 BODY:
In his second inaugural address, President Obama stressed the great American "we," the sense of national unity and common purpose that allows us to achieve great things while looking out for one another. His speech described a never-ending, mutual journey toward betterment - "as one nation, and as one people" - and you'd have to be a pretty solitary, grudging soul not to have been impressed.
But Mr. Obama missed a chance to amplify the theme, to finish the thought, to connect the final dot. 
Because - who is this "we," anyway? In America, mostly it's immigrants and their descendants. And Mr. Obama gave only cursory mention to our need to repair the broken-down machinery that makes "them" into "us," outsiders into Americans. That's the great American idea, but he examined it in just one sentence:
"Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity, until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country."

There is a reason America values immigration, and it goes beyond just adding students and engineers to the workforce. As one immigrant advocate observed about the speech: "It makes the cold, utilitarian argument for immigration. We need to legalize them to help our economy."
Maybe Mr. Obama wanted to suggest something bigger, to make a point about immigrants and the national character, but he didn't.
Luckily for him, the inaugural poet, Richard Blanco, did so beautifully.
He did it with his evocation of one nation under one sky, of an America where kindness and welcome are expressed in many languages - "hello, shalom,buon giorno, howdy, namaste, or buenos días" - but the daily toil takes place on one ground, where the plain hard labor of working-class immigrants like his mother, who rang up groceries, and his father, who cut sugar cane, add up to one country - "all of us" - looking up at the stars together.
The essence of the immigration debate is over who gets to be "us." The forces that oppose reform argue for sweeping exclusion. They have pushed a sharply constricted vision of who gets to stay and who has no hope of staying.
For all his talk of enlisting, not expelling, hopeful strivers, it's a view that Mr. Obama has often bought into. He remains the expeller-in-chief, who has deported more people more quickly than any of his predecessors.
For America to fulfill its promise, and remain exceptional, it needs to reinvigorate its immigrant character, to remain the land of opportunity. This will not happen just by creating narrowly tailored visa programs for highly educated people in favored industry sectors.
What makes the juxtaposition between the inaugural address and poem perfect is that Mr. Blanco is himself an engineer - "a civil engineer by day, poet by night," as he puts it - who rejected his family's pressure to put a respectable day job ahead of a career in the arts.
Because what if you're an unauthorized immigrant who doesn't want to be an engineer? What if Mr. Blanco ends up inspiring more youthful poets than STEM visa applicants? Will that be bad for our economy? Won't those young people add to the country as well? Aren't they, too, '"we, the people?
They surely are, as are the mothers, fathers, seamstresses, cabbies, musicians, coal miners, farm workers, teachers, truck drivers and others honored in Mr. Blanco's wonderful poem. As he put it in an essay on CNN.com, his story is "the essence of the American dream: how a little Cuban-American kid on the margins of mainstream America could grow up with confidence, have the opportunity to become an engineer thanks to the hard work of his parents who could barely speak English, and then go on, choosing to become a poet who is now asked to speak to, for and about the entire nation."

HEADLINE: Carded at Age 77

BYLINE: MORT YOUNG


HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: A strict supermarket manager and an embarrassed cashier followed the ID rule out the window. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary:
As I approached my 80th birthday this Jan. 2, and the celebration soon to be held, I recalled some anecdotal events that, piled atop each other, might make an acceptable speech. I had forgotten about this incident in a local Eighth Avenue supermarket, which took place when I was a mere 77-year-old. 
When I stopped at the cashier to pay for a six-pack of beer, I noticed the manager lurking nearby, keeping an eye on the young girl at the register. As a constant customer, I knew she was new at the job. Before ringing up the sale she said:
 "I need to see your ID."
 "Why?"
 "I have to card you."
 "You're kidding."
 "It's the rule."
 "That's crazy. Just look at me."
 A blush swept across her face. "I have to ask."
 At this point the manager strolled over. "She's right," he said. "We now card everyone buying alcohol."
 There seemed no point to argue further. I took out my driver's license and was allowed to pay and take home my six-pack.
 Then it finally occurred to me why I was carded: not because I might have been too young to buy beer. I might have been too old.
 The next time I went into the supermarket, the rule had been discontinued. There was also a new manager.

HEADLINE: Where Swag and Publicity Go Hand in Hand

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The swag that has been promoted at Sundance comes with news releases packed with brand names. 

 BODY:
 10:12 p.m. | Updated PARK CITY, Utah - One of the biggest bummers about Sundance in the eyes of many longtime festivalgoers is the Great Glom On -- brands trying to bask in the media spotlight generated by the premieres of more than 100 feature films. Robert Redford, Sundance's founder, contemptuously refers to them as "rogue marketers." 
Shy they aren't. This reporter, for instance, has received six emails in the last two days from someone named Jacqueline De Berry from 5W Public Relations (slogan: "Real. Resourceful. Results.") Celebrities like Mario Lopez, she would like everyone to know, have been flocking to the Hint Water booth. 
 Publicists working for Stella Artois -- the Belgian beer is an official Sundance underwriter and also sponsors three event spaces here - sent a news release saying that two reality TV stars, Mercedes Javid and Golnesa Gharachedaghi of "Shahs of Sunset," had been spotted "mingling together with Stella Artois chalices in hand." Ben Lyons, the film critic and TV personality, popped into one Stella Artois space, where he was seen "eyeing the Belgium waffle stations," the release said.
 The award for the most Sundance brand mentions crammed into a single sentence (at least so far) goes to Brandsway Creative, whose news release contained this: "VIPs took advantage of the gorgeous Everest Mansion, powered by Saygus, in Park City, which featured a performance stage, MoneyDesktop VIP Lounge, organic oasis Moksha Yoga Room, Sheila G's Original Brownie Brittle Snack Bar and Corzo Tequila Cocktails."
 There aren't as many swag suites here as in the festival's pre-recession days, longtime attendees say, but the celebrity feeding frenzy is still so prevalent that one group - Rally.org, which helps stars raise money for charitable causes - has gained attention by pouring cold water on all the freebies. Rally.org has been encouraging stars to donate the swag they receive to people affected by Hurricane Sandy. (There is a drop-off station inside the pub Rock & Reilly's Park City.)
 Items that victims may not need - so basically everything given out here - will be auctioned and the money used for things they do.

HEADLINE: The Liberal Hour

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Three reasons why an ascendant President Obama might not prove to be the "liberal Reagan." 

 BODY:
I naturally preferred my own version of President Obama's second inaugural to the speech he actually delivered yesterday, but the substance of the two was roughly similar. The president clearly feels that his re-election both reflects and ratifies a larger leftward shift in American politics: His address reached backward to ground this new progressive era in the American past, offered explicit nods to the demographic groups and constituencies whose present-day growth has made it possible, and then sketched out an agenda suited to a more left-of-center future - climate change legislation and green industrial policy, a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the universalization of gay marriage, new gun control laws, etc. It was not a speech designed to co-opt opponents of this agenda, to put it mildly - particularly those opponents whose control of the House of Representatives will make this agenda difficult to implement. But those of us who watched his negative, joyless re-election campaign and assumed that this president would begin his second term as a lame duck were only half-right. While there's still good reason to think that Obama's biggest legislative accomplishments are in the rearview mirror, the fact that he could win a clean victory despite the grim economic backdrop seems to have given him more confidence in the staying power of his coalition, and the continuing short-term impediments to his agenda in Washington seem to have liberated him to play for the longer term instead. 
If his first four years were about the inside game, then - leveraging the Democratic majorities of 2009-2010 to pass major legislation, even when doing so risks voter backlash - his second term seems likely to be more about the bully pulpit, the court of public opinion, and the elections of 2014 and 2016. America may not be quite as liberal as its president, but so long as the Republican Party remains unable to offer a coherent alternative to progressivism there's an opportunity to continue pushing the American center leftward. And on the evidence of his second inaugural (and, indeed, his entire post-re-election political approach), that's an opportunity Obama is determined to exploit.
For now, there are good reasons to think he will succeed. Liberalism's majority is real, its demographic base is growing, its opposition is in disarray. The current confidence of liberal pundits is less jaunty than it was after the sweep of 2008, but perhaps more justified. Indeed, it's quite possible that we'll look back and see the conservative backlash of 2010 as the new progressive era's greatest test, a brush with death which it has now successfully survived.
But let me briefly play the auriga at a Roman triumph, whispering "memento mori" in the conqueror's ear. Liberalism's prospects may indeed be as bright as they look today. But as a counterpoint to the inauguration hoopla, here are three reasons why Obama might not be remembered as the kind of "liberal Reagan" that he seems to be today.
1) Obama's political victories are clearer than his policy accomplishments. The question of whether Obamacare will be implemented has been answered; the question of whether it can survive its own design flaws has not. The question of whether Obamanomics would be rejected by the public in the short run has been answered; the question of whether it can produce the kind of longer-run growth that previous generations of Americans took for granted has not. (The sluggish economic recovery barely figured into the second inaugural, and the president talked more about green industrial policy than about the plight of the unemployed.) The question of whether Obama's foreign policy would avoid major disasters and be an asset in his re-election bid has been answered; the question of whether his navigation of the Arab Spring and his attempts to contain Iran will look skillful in hindsight has not. Obama plainly turned the social issues to his party's advantage last year (with a major assist from Todd Akin). But a tentative and ambiguous pro-choice trend in public opinion after a long period of pro-life gains does not mean that liberals have won the abortion wars, especially given that the main policy shift of the Obama era has been an uptick in state-level abortion restriction. And even on gay marriage, where most observers - myself included - assume that the Obama era will be remembered as genuinely transformational, that transformation has only actually been achieved in nine of the fifty states.
None of this means that Obama won't ultimately being remembered for policy triumphs as clear the victory over stagflation or the successful resolution of the Cold War, or that his presidency won't cast a long, Reagan-like shadow over subsequent policy debates. But we don't know that yet: The current recovery is no Reagan boom, it will be years before we can tell if the Affordable Care Act lives up its name, and plenty of surprises may await in the next four years. And remember - if passing major legislation, building a stable-seeming coalition, presiding over okay-but-not-great growth and winning a hard-fought re-election were enough to earn a spot on Rushmore, George W. Bush's face would be being chiseled there right now.
2) Liberalism, no less than conservatism, is riven by internal contradictions. The Obama majority does indeed reflect the diversity of twenty-first America, just as its enthusiastic boosters claim: It's the party of Silicon Valley billionaires and immigrants who work at Wal-Mart, of public sector employees and affluent dual-earner professionals, of the secular academy and the black church, of the multiracial Southwest and white New England. But for political parties as well as human societies, diversity is as often a weakness as a strength, and it's easy enough to imagine scenarios where the Democratic Party of the near-future fractures along lines of race or geography, class or culture.
These crack-ups could happen over issues where the party seems superficially united at the moment, like guns and immigration and environmentalism, or they could happen over issues where the divisions are already there for everyone to see, like Medicare and Social Security. They could divide the party's shrinking-but-still-large pool of white voters from its minority constituents, or they could divide minority voters from each other on one or more of the many issues where the interests of all Hispanics, all African-Americans or all Asians do not obviously align. Above all, they could force Democrats to choose, decisively and disruptively, between their traditional identity as the party of middle-class entitlements and their current identity as the party of low taxes on everyone except the richest of the rich - a choice that the Obama administration has thus far deliberately postponed.
3) The Republican Party is, in fact, capable of change. These potential fissures within liberalism won't matter if the G.O.P. remains as hapless as it is today. And there's a increasingly popular strain of opinion on the left that holds that Republicans are now structurally incapable of moderation, reform and self-correction - that the grip of ideology is too strong, the demands of the base too intense, the party's distance of twenty-first America too great. If this view is right, the G.O.P. is almost irrelevant to liberalism's fortunes, and Obama's political legacy is really only threatened by "black swan" events like suitcase nukes and 2008-style financial panics.
But just because the G.O.P. looks like it could spend a generation in the wilderness doesn't meant that it actually will. National parties exist to win national elections, and that incentive alone often suffices to drive changes that the party's interest groups and ideological enforcers dislike. For every case like the Republicans of the 1930s and the 1940s, the Carter-Mondale-Dukakis Democrats, or the British Tories between John Major and David Cameron, there's another case where a party that seems to have lost its way completely turns out to be one successful campaign, one appealing nominee or one change of circumstances away from a comeback. In modern G.O.P. history alone, the Goldwater rout was swiftly succeeded by the Nixon realignment, and the various Gingrich-era debacles by the rise of George W. Bush's "compassionate conservatism." We are only one presidential term removed from the latter rebranding, and the idea that it cannot happen again (albeit hopefully along somewhat different lines) seems ahistorical and naive. Yes, obviously, the Republican Party might remain a mess for years to come. But liberals who expect that continuing conservative dysfunction will help cement Obama's legacy are betting on a trend, not counting on a certainty.
I'll end where I ended one of last week's posts, with two numbers: 51 and 23. The first is the percentage of Americans who told Gallup they were "very satisfied" with the country's direction in the first year of Ronald Reagan's second term; the second is the average who said the same last month. Liberalism's current ascendance is undeniable, and the president's goal of a transformational presidency is plainly within his reach. But until the second number rises closer to the first one, those transformations will remain at least partially reversible, and Obama's quest to become liberalism's Reagan will be incomplete.

HEADLINE: At Davos, Is the Party Over?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Blowout bashes hosted by prominent companies including Google and Nike are noticeably missing. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- In previous years, the Friday night of the World Economic Forum was always filled with big dinners and blowout parties. 
Certain bashes were among the most coveted. Google held a standing-room only party at Steigenberger Belvedere Hotel, complete with bands flown in from New York and beyond. Across the street, Accel Partners, the venture capital firm behind Facebook, held a wine tasting at the Kirchner Museum, often flying in cases of vintage wine from California. And Nike held a huge dinner with the slogan, "No Speeches. No Powerpoint. And no ties." 
This Friday, however, the operative slogan could be "No dinner. No parties."
All three companies - Google, Accel and Nike - are not holding events this year. Perhaps more important, virtually all of the senior people from all three companies are not attending Davos, either. Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, had been a regular attendee. Also missing this year are the Google co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who often flouted the dress code and wore jeans and shirts to the proceedings.
Accel, which usually sends a delegation of venture capitalists in search of the next big thing, is virtually missing in action -- with the exception of Joe Schoendorf, a partner at the firm, who started the party almost two decades ago. And the Nike contingent is now a shell of itself without any of its most senior people attending.
Have those companies given up on Davos for good? Is there something bigger here at play than just parties? Those are some of the questions being asked, however, answers have been forthcoming - at least not yet.
Those executives are not the only ones skipping Davos this year. Bono, a regular, is not in attendance, nor is former President Bill Clinton. Also not here is Niall Ferguson, the historian who typically leads multiple panels.
For those worried that there won't be any parties on Friday, fear not: Marissa Meyer, ex-Google who now heads up Yahoo, has stepped in to sponsor a cocktail party. And rumors are rampant that Sean Parker, the Internet entrepreneur, is holding an exclusive party Friday night.

HEADLINE: The Brewing Terror Threat in Thailand

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: After an Islamist jihad thrust in Mali provoked military intervention from Western and African forces, attention is turning on East Asia's most terror-prone spot: Thailand's south. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Islamic terrorism never went away, though it seemed perhaps to have quieted down after the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. But is it back now, stronger, as the crisis in Mali shows? And is southern Thailand a next crisis zone?
According to the Global Terrorism Index issued by the Institute for Economics and Peace, the countries suffering the most from the impact of terrorism include familiar places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia. But here's a surprise, perhaps: Thailand ranked No. 8, even though many people associate it with holiday-making in the sun and not the carnage of war. 
According to the index, issued last December by the institute, a nonprofit group that works for world peace, in 2011 Thailand had 173 terrorist incidents that resulted in 142 fatalities (Iraq topped the index with 1,228 incidents and 1,798 fatalities.)
In the excellent interactive graphic, Mali ranked 43d out of the 158 countries studied, something which will presumably change following the jihadist thrust there that has led to the military intervention of France and African nations, supported by the United States. As this Reuters article explains, "The aim of the intervention is to prevent northern Mali from becoming a launchpad for international attacks by al Qaeda and its local allies in North and West Africa."
In Thailand, the decades-old Muslim insurgency is growing and changing in character - and foreigners, as well as Thais, should beware, reports Asia Sentinel, an online platform for Asian issues.
The conflict is already very bloody. More than 5,000 people have been killed since 2001 and about 11,000 severely injured, according to statistics kept by Deep South Watch, a monitoring organization in southern Thailand. The Council on Foreign Relations Web site said this makes Thailand "the deadliest war zone in East Asia."
Last year, the insurgency in Thailand's south began taking on "a worrying new direction," the article in Asia Sentinel said.
"Buddhist monks and teachers have been regularly singled out as targets. More than 300 schools closed recently as teachers went on strike over the worsening security situation. In September 2012, militants threatened to kill anyone not respecting Friday as the Muslim Sabbath, which forced many businesses to close and many people to remain indoors for the day," the article said. "Creeping Islamization is changing the nature of this previously low-level conflict." 
"Further complicating the nature of the rebellion are deep links to local criminal gangs, especially those centered on drug and people trafficking. Conflict in the Deep South is an extremely profitable business," it said.
As the article on the Council's Web site reported, an attack on Sept. 21 killed six in Pattani province in Thailand's south, just a few hundred kilometers from the tourist beaches of Phuket and Thailand's west coast. 
"These types of brutal attacks have become routine in this province," it said. "On a daily basis, groups of heavily armed men attack local officials, police, soldiers, teachers and any Muslim they believe is not adhering strictly enough to Islamic values. The insurgents explode homemade bombs, climb onto school buses and strafe children with gunfire. Those believed to sympathize with the national government are sometimes decapitated, their headless bodies left in public places, along with warnings to obey a strict form of Islam." 
Thailand's deputy prime minister, Chalerm Yoobamrung, who is also the country's "security boss," as the Bangkok newspaper, The Nation, described him, has said that the institute's high ranking on the list was actually a misunderstanding.
Chalerm's response was pilloried early this month by the newspaper, which accused him of sweeping the problem under the carpet and hoping nobody would notice. 
Just as the Islamist push in North Africa appears to have taken a new turn with the killing of local and foreign hostages in Algeria, some are worried the same will happen in Thailand, unless the problem is dealt with.
"Current travel warnings for Thailand continue to understate the risk," said the Asia Sentinel.
"Remarkably, the Thai insurgency has never veered near the coastal enclaves that are packed both with wealthy tourists and westerners who own beach properties in Phuket and other areas."
But, "There is precedent for caution," the Sentinel said. "In 2001, an Abu Sayyaf raid kidnapped about 20 people from Dos Palmas, an expensive resort north of Puerto Princesa City on the island of Palawan in the Philippines, which had been considered completely safe." A Peruvian-American tourist was beheaded by the kidnappers and an American missionary was killed in a shootout between them and security forces.

HEADLINE: In Winning Design, City Hopes to Address a Cramped Future

BYLINE: VIVIAN YEE


HIGHLIGHT: "My Micro NY" will create a building of 55 micro-units each measuring between 250 and 370 square feet, with 40 percent of the units priced to be affordable, the mayor's office said. 

 BODY:
Updated, 5:42 p.m. | The apartment of New York City's future, as the city imagines it, has all the amenities of modern life: wheelchair-accessible bathroom, a full kitchen, space for entertaining and access to a gym, communal lounge, front and back porches and a rooftop garden - all in 250 to 370 square feet.
The city on Tuesday unveiled the winner of a competition to design and build an apartment tower on city-owned land composed entirely of micro-units, 55 homes the size of hotel rooms that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hopes will be the first in a wave of tiny apartments aimed at addressing the city's shortage of studio and one-bedroom apartments. 
Small as it might be, the winning design was chosen for the way that it maximized light, airiness and storage space through the use of 9-foot-high ceilings, large windows, lofts and Juliet balconies.
"We have a shortfall now of 800,000, and it's only going to get worse," Mr. Bloomberg said during the news conference announcing the winning team, a partnership between Monadnock Development, Brooklyn-based nARCHITECTS and a nonprofit that serves creative arts professionals, the Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation. "This is going to be a big problem for cities with young people."
In another futuristic twist, the 10-story tower at 335 East 27th Street in the Kips Bay neighborhood will rise thanks to modular construction, becoming Manhattan's first apartment building to do so: units will be prefabricated, then stacked on top of one another like Legos.
Forty percent of the units will be affordable, restricted to tenants earning no more than $77,190 a year, with the rest at market rate. Rents start at $914 a month for those earning up to $38,344 a year, well below Manhattan's average studio rent of $2,000, and go up to $1,873 for those making $77,190 or less.
If the interior renderings are any indication, the micro-units are designed to appeal most to young professionals, perhaps to a young academic: a person who requires lots of bookshelves for scholarly tomes and hosts the occasional dinner party.
"But there's another side to the person - he or she likes to surf and so on," said Eric Bunge, a principal at nARCHITECTS. Thus the bright-green surfboard, depicted in an interior rendering as stowed in a large loft storage space. (Another unexpected touch was a ghostly image of an old man's bearded head, which Mr. Bunge said was meant to be a drawing on a chalkboard-painted wall.)
But he was quick to caution that the micro-units could be for anyone, from retirees to the nurses at nearby Bellevue Hospital Center. Apart from the kitchen and bathroom, the space is designed to be flexible, he said: "It's all about appropriating your space, really."
The announcement was made at the Museum of the City of New York, whose new exhibit, "Making Room: New Models for Housing New Yorkers," displays the winning proposal alongside a different 325-square-foot micro-unit model that features an electric toilet that doubles as a bidet; Italian shower fixtures; a Murphy bed that pulls down over a hot-pink sofa, a flat-screen TV that slides to reveal extra shelving and a coffee table-cum-ottoman that deconstructs into four stools.
As for whether people would consider living in one, the answer on the streets of Kips Bay, perhaps predictably, seemed to depend on whether you asked a Manhattan dweller or a suburbanite.
Cataline Vincent, 26, who works at Bellevue, said she had struggled to find affordable rentals on her $40,000 salary. "In New York City, space is limited, and we're willing to settle for what we can get," she said. "In New York, people will live in a garbage can!"
Others were quicker to turn up their noses.
"I wouldn't keep a dog in that size room," said one woman, indignantly.
She declined to give her name, but she said she lived in New Jersey.
An article on Wednesday about city-owned land erroneously attributed a distinction to a 10-story tower that is to be built at 335 East 27th Street in Kips Bay. It will be the first apartment building to be built in Manhattan using modular construction, not the first in New York City.

HEADLINE: When Tax Cuts Were a Tough Sell

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Presidents Kennedy and Johnson once embraced the tax-cut policies now supported by the Republican Party (which objected to them at the time), an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Fifty years ago this week, on Jan. 24, 1963, John F. Kennedy sent a special message to Congress on tax reduction and tax reform. Enacted the following year by Lyndon B. Johnson, the legislation cut the top federal income tax rate to 70 percent from 91 percent and the bottom rate to 14 percent from 20 percent. Ironically, it later became the template for Republican tax policy. 
Those who don't know the history probably assume that the tax cut was a slam-dunk for Kennedy, something that was overwhelmingly popular. In fact, a big tax cut was highly controversial because at that time Republicans actually cared about the deficit and recognized that tax cuts would increase it. This view was shared by the large bloc of conservative Southern Democrats then in Congress and the general public as well.
For example, on Dec. 14, 1960, before Kennedy was inaugurated, Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr., Democrat of Virginia and chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, warned Kennedy against even thinking about a big tax cut, given the deficit situation. According to an Associated Press report published in The New York Times, Senator Byrd told Kennedy that a tax cut "would be the worst thing we could do."
A July 1962 Gallup poll asked the American people, "Would you favor or oppose a cut in federal income taxes at this time, if a cut meant that the government would go further in debt?" Only 19 percent of people supported a tax cut, even though the high World War II-era tax rates were still in place; 72 percent were opposed.
Even among those who said that their taxes were too high, only 31 percent supported a tax cut if it would add to the deficit; 61 percent were opposed.
However, in mid-1962, Kennedy was concerned that the economy was not growing enough and that this would endanger his re-election in 1964 unless some action were taken. His economic advisers, under the influence of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, advocated an intentional increase in the deficit to stimulate aggregate demand.
But they were divided about the best way to do it. John Kenneth Galbraith, who had tutored Kennedy in economics at Harvard and was serving as ambassador to India, argued in favor of an increase in public spending to deal with unmet social needs. Kennedy rejected this advice because it would never pass Congress and because he was worried about inflation and growing pressure on the dollar from abroad.
Kennedy's other economists favored a temporary tax cut to put money into peoples' pockets. This course had been recommended in a 1961 report from Paul A. Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kennedy endorsed the idea at a June 7, 1962, news conference, but he remained concerned about both the politics and economics of this approach.
On Aug. 6, 1962, Kennedy met with Representative Wilbur Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Mr. Mills suggested that the president consider a permanent tax rate reduction rather than a temporary one, which would be viewed as an election ploy. This would satisfy the desire of Keynesian economists to stimulate demand, and in a way that would be hard for conservatives to oppose.
On Aug. 10, 1962, Kennedy met with his economic advisers and they endorsed this approach. We know what transpired at these meetings because Kennedy secretly taped them. They were published in 2001.
Kennedy's Jan. 24 message got the ball rolling. Using rhetoric that could easily have been spoken by Ronald Reagan two decades later, Kennedy said:
As I have repeatedly emphasized, our choice today is not between a tax cut and a balanced budget. Our choice is between chronic deficits resulting from chronic slack, on the one hand, and transitional deficits temporarily enlarged by tax revision designed to promote full employment and thus make possible an ultimately balanced budget.
Kennedy even made a "Laffer curve" case that the economic stimulus would be so great that it would offset much of the estimated revenue loss:
Once this tax brake is released, the base of taxable income, wages, and profits will grow - and a temporary increase in the deficit will turn into a permanent increase in federal revenues. The purpose of cutting taxes, I repeat, is not to create a deficit but to increase investment, employment and the prospects for a balanced budget.
Largely forgotten to history is that Kennedy also favored tax reforms to offset some of the estimated revenue loss. The most important of these would have been to tax all unrealized capital gains at death. Then, as now, unrealized capital gains held until death are never taxed; heirs treat the property as if it were purchased for a price equal to its value at the time of death, no matter how large the amount or how wealthy the decedent. This is an unjustified loophole that tax reformers still object to.
Kennedy's tax plan was exactly what Republicans today recommend, but they opposed it strenuously at the time. The Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee unanimously opposed it, saying, "It is morally and fiscally wrong, and will do irreparable damage to the Republic."
When the tax cut came up for a final vote in the House of Representatives on Sept. 25, 1963, only 48 Republicans supported it; 126 voted against it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 271 to 155.
The prospects for the tax cut in the Senate were always far more dicey. A conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats had essentially controlled that body since the late 1930s, and they put budget balance ahead of tax reduction.
It is probably only because of Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 and the strenuous efforts of Johnson, who had led the conservative coalition in the 1950s as Senate majority leader, that the tax cut passed the Senate. Even so, 11 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted against its final passage on Feb. 7, 1964.

HEADLINE: A Veteran's Plea to President Obama

BYLINE: THOMAS JAMES BRENNAN


HIGHLIGHT: As President Obama begins his second term, a retired Marine sergeant outlines issues plaguing veterans, including suicide and traumatic brain injury. 

 BODY:
Dear Mr. President,
Congratulations on your re-election. As you now begin your second term, there are myriad important issues plaguing the veteran community that we wish to bring to the forefront.
There are nearly 23 million veterans living in the United States, making up 8.1 percent of the population. We're a minority, yes - but a sizable one. What's more, we're a minority that continually sacrifices for our country's defense. 
Far too many of us are suffering needlessly. In 2011, a friend and fellow Marine, Steve of Ohio, tried to commit suicide. From 2005 until 2006, Matthew, a fellow retired Marine and friend of mine, lived out of the back seat of his car in parking lots across Pennsylvania. He also debated suicide. My friend David, a former staff sergeant, was recently retired from the corps due to health complications resulting from environmental exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder. Another friend, a former Marine sergeant, Timothy, who has a wife and two sons, was forced to move in with his mother-in-law in Missouri to avoid homelessness. He cannot find work and therefore cannot support his family. A retired soldier and friend, Coban, suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq and requires 24-hour supervision from his wife, who is now unable to work. The list goes on and on. 
Veterans commit suicide at a rate of one every 80 minutes, according to some estimates. Combined with active-duty suicides that means that each and every day in the United States, an estimated 19 men or women who are wearing or have worn a uniform commit suicide. 
We must address this in full force. Too many of my brethren have returned from war only to take their own lives. In August, you signed an to expand mental health treatment and ensure that suicidal veterans are seen by the Department of Veterans Affairs within 24 hours. Your efforts are commendable, but more must be done. 
With the military downsizing, more service members will enter the veteran community, bringing with them their service-connected issues. Traumatic brain injury is the signature wound of our most recent wars. T.B.I., according to the Brain Injury Association of America, has left 360,000 troops wounded since 2001. As the 11-year-old war in Afghanistan continues, that number will rise. And as veterans relocate to small-town America, medical facilities spanning our country must be trained to deal with their wounds.
Recently, the death toll from Iraq and Afghanistan reached over 5,000. The number of amputees is over 1,500 and our wounded over 50,000.
For more than two decades, troops have served in places like Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. The Environmental Protection Agency released a study stating that the dust found in these countries contains toxins, bacteria and metals that can lead to health problems. In an , USA Today found that there has been a 251 percent increase in neurological disorders and a 47 percent increase in respiratory disorders per 10,000 troops. Environmental exposures, from Agent Orange to dust and burn pits, have affected troops through different wars over many decades. We must develop programs for diagnosing and treating those ailments.
With all the service-connected medical issues veterans face, the government must also ensure access to care. Based on various projections by medical experts, I estimate that nearly two million veterans suffer from PTSD. We must ensure that they are treated. The Department of Veterans Affairs has 20,000 mental health workers. Last year, the secretary of veterans affairs, Eric Shinseki, announced that the department would hire 1,600 additional mental health professionals and 300 additional support staff members. Veterans report mental health treatment wait times upward of 30 days. The department's mental health staff should be multiplied until a more acceptable wait time is reached and maintained. 
It's not just health issues that are a concern. As the military continues to downsize, unemployment and homelessness may rise. Two years ago, veteran unemployment stagnated at nearly 10 percent. By October 2012, the rate was lower at just below 7 percent. Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have a more dire outlook regarding employment. Their unemployment rate for 2012 was about 10 percent, while the unemployment rate of their civilian peers was closer to 8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
In November 2011, you signed into law the "Vow to Hire Heroes" act offering tax incentives to those who hire veterans. The first lady, Michelle Obama, has also been instrumental in aiding 125,000 veterans become employed and we commend her actions to ensure that 250,000 more will be hired soon. 
By hiring more veterans, we may possibly quell homelessness. In 2008, an estimated 154,000 veterans were homelessness. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that over 60,000 veterans are still homeless today. That's an improvement, but still 60,000 too many. 
If left untreated, these problems will only get worse with time. In solving these problems, we can make this a new greatest generation. The opportunity to do so is now, and you, President Obama, can lead us there.

HEADLINE: When a Tough-Talking Governor Stops Talking

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
AUGUSTA, Me. -- Temperatures soared into the mid-50s here last week but the capitol building was nonetheless in the grip of a big chill.
The governor, Paul R. LePage, a Republican who won office in 2010 with the backing of the Tea Party, has been giving the Democratic leaders the cold shoulder. He has refused to meet or speak with them since the Democrats took back the Legislature in November.
The standoff started over the governor's annoyance at being followed by a Democratic cameraman, known as a tracker, who films him at public events. It continues even now as the governor and legislative leaders begin to grapple with a new state budget that could lead to a major increase in property taxes. 
And that is not the only source of economic anxiety here; Maine continues to lag behind the rest of New England, and much of the country, in recovering from the recession. Its difficulties were underscored last month when Forbes ranked Maine 50th in its annual list of business-friendly states. It was the third year in a row that Maine came in last.
Mr. LePage essentially agreed with the Forbes assessment. He said that if Puerto Rico were included in the ranking, Maine would come in 51st. He frequently deplores the quality of the state's work force and says the schools do not properly prepare students for college.
Such blunt talk has led his fans to compare Mr. LePage to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is also a Republican. But his critics see little charm in someone who, in their view, runs the state down and bullies the opposition.
In early December, the governor was set to meet with the new Democratic leaders, the Senate president, Justin Alfond, and speaker of the House, Mark Eaves. But he canceled, saying he objected to the cameraman, who, he said, filmed him at a Veterans Day event in November while he was talking with an elderly veteran in ill health. Mr. LePage said the people of Maine should not be used as ''props'' to score political points.
The video, released by the Democrats, showed no such encounter between Mr. LePage and an elderly veteran. Nonetheless, the governor insisted the legislators call off the tracker, which they refused to do, saying they had no control in the matter.
Shortly afterward, Mr. Alfond sent the governor a handwritten invitation to dinner. But the invitation landed in the hands of the news media before it got to the governor, prompting the governor's office to brand the invitation a stunt.
Mr. Alfond said in an interview that the governor's snub was less about the use of trackers, who are now a standard part of politics for both parties, than about power. ''If he doesn't meet with me, it keeps that clear hierarchy,'' Mr. Alfond said. ''He likes that power play.''
Adrienne Bennett, the governor's spokeswoman, declined a request for an interview with the governor. As for his relationship with the Democratic leaders, she said she did not expect it to thaw any time soon. ''When you want to play political games, he's uninterested in engaging,'' she said. Besides, she said, the leaders have access to the governor's staff.
The standoff could become problematic as the two sides, miles apart ideologically, try to balance the state budget. The governor has proposed the drastic step of suspending revenue sharing with the state's municipalities for two years, a move that could save the state about $200 million. He has said the suspension is necessary to make up for federal cuts in reimbursements for health and welfare programs.
Democrats say the governor is shifting costs to the localities to make up for tax cuts that are costing the state almost $350 million in lost revenue and disproportionately benefit wealthier residents. They say the shift will force localities either to slash services or raise property taxes.
Their vast differences over the budget have set the governor and Democrats on a collision course that some predict could end in a government shutdown -- something Maine, which prides itself on its bipartisanship, last experienced in 1991.
The rising tensions over the budget were evident last week when the governor met with three independent House members who do not caucus with either the Democrats or Republicans. When they told Mr. LePage that municipalities could be forced to raise property taxes by hundreds of dollars, the governor grew angry, pounded the table, called them ''idiots'' and later swore at them, according to The Bangor Daily News.
''He went right through the roof when I asked him the question,'' Representative Jeff Evangelos told the newspaper. ''He flew up like a jack-in-the-box and ran out of the room and slammed the door.''
It is too early in the budget process to say whether Republicans will back Mr. LePage or join the Democrats, who need only a handful of Republicans in each house to override a veto. The degree to which any Republicans defect could provide an early indication of how Mr. LePage might fare in 2014 when he is up for re-election, assuming he runs again.
For now, Republican lawmakers are soft-pedaling any talk of a split. ''It's not as awkward as you think,'' said Senator Michael Thibodeau, the Republican minority leader. He said that the governor's standoff with the Democrats was a news media-driven distraction and that Mr. LePage was simply too busy to meet with them.
Senator Roger Katz, the assistant minority leader, has complained before about Mr. LePage's approach to governance. He wrote a column in 2011, signed by some fellow Republicans, saying that Mr. LePage's penchant for demeaning comments lowered the bar for civil discourse.
Mr. Katz said last week that the governor's problem was still one of tone, though he was unhappy with the budget proposal too. ''As a general rule,'' Mr. Katz said, ''the more people of good will talk to each other, the better. I don't know why it hasn't happened yet.''
Later in the week, the temperatures outside the State House plunged into the single digits, more in keeping with the frosty relations inside.

HEADLINE: Archdiocese To Shut Down 24 Schools

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
The New York Roman Catholic Archdiocese announced Tuesday that it would close 22 elementary schools and 2 high schools, saying it could no longer afford to spend millions each year supporting schools that were not economically self-sufficient. 
Because finances were the most significant factor in the decisions, schools filled with children from poor and immigrant families will be hit hard. Seven elementary schools will be shut in the Bronx, 5 in Manhattan and 10 in counties upstate.
Decisions about two Staten Island schools are being deferred because of Hurricane Sandy, and four schools that had been deemed at risk -- St. Gregory the Great in Manhattan, St. Mary School in the Bronx, Sacred Heart in Newburgh and Regina Coeli in Hyde Park -- received reprieves, the archdiocese said.
By June, the archdiocese will have about 150 elementary schools, down from over 200 before it began working on a plan three years ago to consolidate students in fewer schools and manage those schools through regional boards, rather than parishes.
As word of the decisions spread on Tuesday, there were tears, as well as some anger, parents and teachers said. Schools were told in November that they could be saved if they came up with a business plan and raised enough money to stay afloat for three years. Some said they believed their efforts had not been taken seriously.
In New City, supporters of St. Augustine School developed a plan that exceeded the fund-raising targets by more than $800,000, said Beth Rooney, the parents' association president. Yet the school, which performs well academically, is still closing.
The 135-year-old Holy Cross School near Times Square will close, even though alumni and donors came close to reaching the $720,000 in pledges that the archdiocese said would be needed. ''We thought we had done everything we could have done,'' said the principal, Sister Mary Theresa Dixon.
Fran Davies, a spokeswoman for Timothy McNiff, the archdiocesan superintendent, said that finances were just a portion of the evaluation.
In New Rochelle, students and parents at Blessed Sacrament/St. Gabriel High School were surprised to hear their school was closing. The archdiocese had not placed it on its list in November. Art Brennan, an English teacher, said that some students were crying as they sat for Regents exams. ''I don't think we were given a fair chance to at least try,'' he said.
The remaining schools closing:
Manhattan: Annunciation, Holy Name of Jesus, St. James-St. Joseph, St. Jude and St. Agnes Boys High School.
The Bronx: Holy Spirit, Our Lady of Angels, Our Lady of Mercy, St. Jerome, Blessed Sacrament, St. Anthony and St. Mary Star of the Sea.
Upstate: Holy Name of Jesus in Valhalla, Our Lady of Fatima in Scarsdale, St. Casimir in Yonkers, Our Lady of the Assumption in Peekskill, St. Theresa in Briarcliff Manor, St. Joseph in Millbrook, St. Peter in Haverstraw, St. Joseph in Kingston and St. Mary of the Snow in Saugerties.

HEADLINE: Chip Makers Forecast A Slowdown In Orders

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Texas Instruments and Advanced Micro Devices posted quarterly results on Tuesday that topped analysts' estimates but warned of a rocky period ahead as mobile devices gained traction with consumers at the expense of personal computers. 
Texas Instruments posted quarterly revenue that was ahead of Wall Street expectations but the chip maker warned of uncertain demand and a widespread customer reluctance to order until the last minute.
The company said that while orders appeared to be adhering to a normal rate for this time of year, customers were worried about increasing their inventory of chips.
The chief financial officer, Kevin P. March, said quarterly revenue was at the high end of the company's expected range because customers had made some orders late in the quarter.
But he said that weakness in European economies and in China as well as uncertainty about government policies in the United States were making customers wary of ordering too many chips.
In addition, the company's previously announced wind down of its cellphone chip business will push revenue down more than it otherwise would have fallen in the first quarter, Mr. March said.
Texas Instruments said its fourth-quarter profit fell to $264 million, or 23 cents a share, from $298 million or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue in the period, which was the fourth quarter of the company's fiscal year, fell to $2.98 billion from $3.42 billion but was ahead of Wall Street expectations for $2.95 billion.
Advanced Micro Devices said it lost $473 million, or 63 cents a share, in the quarter. Revenue in the period, which ended Dec. 29 and was the fourth quarter of A.M.D.'s fiscal year, fell to $1.16 billion from $1.69 billion a year earlier. It posted a loss of $177 million, or 24 cents a share.
A.M.D. and Intel were both caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices, which led to an unexpected slump in the PC industry.
While Intel has deep pockets to finance research on new processors to catch up in tablets and smartphones, A.M.D. faces declining cash flows and a more modest balance sheet.
One of Silicon Valley's oldest chip makers, A.M.D. is trying to find new markets for its chip technology, including communications, microservers, digital signs and stripped down computers. It recently hired two senior engineers with experience at Qualcomm and Apple, its latest high-level recruitments, as it looks for new business opportunities.
The company said revenue in its current quarter would fall from 6 to 12 percent from the prior quarter. Shares of A.M.D. rose 1.63 percent in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: Microsoft May Back Dell Buyout

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
The effort to take Dell private has gained a prominent, if unusual, backer: Microsoft.
The software giant is in talks to help finance a takeover bid for Dell that would exceed $20 billion, a person briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Microsoft is expected to contribute up to several billion dollars.
An investment by Microsoft - if it comes to pass - could be enough to push a leveraged buyout of the struggling computer maker over the goal line. Silver Lake, the private equity firm spearheading the takeover talks, has been seeking a deep-pocketed investor to join the effort. And Microsoft, which has not yet made a commitment, has more than $66 billion in cash on hand. 
Microsoft and Silver Lake, a prominent investor in technology companies, are no strangers. The private equity firm was part of a consortium that sold Skype, the online video-chatting pioneer, to Microsoft for $8.5 billion nearly two years ago. And the two companies had discussed teaming up to make an investment in Yahoo in late 2011, before Yahoo decided against selling a minority stake in itself.
A vibrant Dell is an important part of Microsoft's plans to make Windows more relevant for the tablet era, when more and more devices come with touch screens. Dell has been one of the most visible supporters of Windows 8 in its products.
That has been crucial at a time when Microsoft's relationships with many PC makers have grown strained because of the company's move into making computer hardware with its Surface family of tablets.
Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment.
If completed, a buyout of Dell would be the largest leveraged buyout since the financial crisis, reaching levels unseen since the takeovers of Hilton Hotels and the Texas energy giant TXU. Such a deal is taking advantage of Dell's still-low stock price and the abundance of investors willing to buy up the debt issued as part of a transaction to take the company private. And Silver Lake has been working with Dell's founder, Michael S. Dell, who is expected to contribute his nearly 16 percent stake in the company to a takeover bid.
Yet while many aspects of the potential deal have fallen into place, including a potential price of up to around $14 a share, talks between Dell and its potential buyers may still fall apart.
Shares of Dell closed up 2.2 percent on Tuesday, at $13.12. They began rising after CNBC reported Microsoft's potential involvement in a leveraged buyout. Microsoft shares slipped 0.4 percent, to $27.15.
Microsoft's lending a hand to Dell could make sense at a time when the PC industry is facing some of the biggest challenges in its history. Dell is one of Microsoft's most significant, longest-lasting partners in the PC business and among the most committed to creating machines that run Windows, the operating system that is the foundation of much of Microsoft's profits.
But PC sales were in a slump for most of last year, as consumers diverted their spending to other types of devices like tablets and smartphones. Dell, the third-biggest maker of PCs in the world, recorded a 21 percent decline in shipments of PCs during the fourth quarter of last year from the same period in 2011, according to IDC.
In a joint interview in November, Mr. Dell and Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, exchanged friendly banter, as one would expect of two men who have been in business together for decades.
Mr. Dell said Mr. Ballmer had gone out of his way to reassure him that Microsoft's Surface computers would not hurt Dell sales.
"We've never sold all the PCs in the world," said Mr. Dell, sitting in a New York hotel room brimming with new Windows 8 computers made by his company. "As I've understood Steve's plans here, if Surface helps Windows 8 succeed, that's going to be good for Windows, good for Dell and good for our customers. We're just fine with all that."
Microsoft has been willing to open its purse strings in the past to help close partners. Last April, Microsoft committed to invest more than $600 million in Barnes & Noble's electronic books subsidiary, in a deal that ensures a source of electronic books for Windows devices. Microsoft also agreed in 2011 to provide the Finnish cellphone maker Nokia billions of dollars' worth of various forms of support, including marketing and research and development assistance, in exchange for Nokia's adopting Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Break All the Rules

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
First, my congratulations and condolences to John Kerry for being nominated to be our next secretary of state. There is no one better for the job today and no worse job to have today. It is no accident that we've started measuring our secretaries of state more by miles traveled than milestones achieved. It is bloody hard to do big diplomacy anymore.
Why? Well, as secretary of state today you get to deal with Vladimir Putin, who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. That is, even though Russia's economy is hugely corrupt and nowhere nearly as innovative as it should be, Putin sits atop a huge reserve of oil and gas that makes him think he's a genius and doesn't need to listen to anyone. When recently confronted with his regime's bad behavior, his first instinct was to block American parents from adopting Russian orphans, even though so many of them badly need homes. If there were an anti-Nobel Peace Prize, Putin would win hands down. 
When Putin isn't available to stiff us, China, to whom we owe a gazillion dollars, is ready to stand in. Those two are the real nations, where there's at least someone to answer the phone -- and hang up on us. Elsewhere, the secretary of state gets to deal with failed or failing states, like Mali, Algeria, Afghanistan and Libya, whose governments cannot deliver for their people, let alone for us. If he is looking for a break, Kerry could always call on our longtime ally Egypt, whose president, Mohamed Morsi, we find out, in 2010 described Jews as ''descendants of apes and pigs.'' Who knew?
So what's a secretary of state to do? I'd suggest trying something radically new: creating the conditions for diplomacy where they do not now exist by going around leaders and directly to the people. And I'd start with Iran, Israel and Palestine. We live in an age of social networks in which every leader outside of North Korea today is now forced to engage in a two-way conversation with their citizens. There's no more just top-down. People everywhere are finding their voices and leaders are terrified. We need to turn this to our advantage to gain leverage in diplomacy.
Let's break all the rules.
Rather than negotiating with Iran's leaders in secret -- which, so far, has produced nothing and allows the Iranian leaders to control the narrative and tell their people that they're suffering sanctions because of U.S. intransigence -- why not negotiate with the Iranian people? President Obama should put a simple offer on the table, in Farsi, for all Iranians to see: The U.S. and its allies will permit Iran to maintain a civil nuclear enrichment capability -- which it claims is all it wants to meet power needs -- provided it agrees to U.N. observers and restrictions that would prevent Tehran from ever assembling a nuclear bomb. We should not only make this offer public, but also say to the Iranian people over and over: ''The only reason your currency is being crushed, your savings rapidly eroded by inflation, many of your college graduates unemployed and your global trade impeded and the risk of war hanging overhead, is because your leaders won't accept a deal that would allow Iran to develop civil nuclear power but not a bomb.'' Iran wants its people to think it has no partner for a civil nuclear deal. The U.S. can prove otherwise.
On Israel-Palestine, the secretary of state should publicly offer President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority the following: the U.S. would recognize the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as the independent State of Palestine on the provisional basis of the June 4, 1967, lines, support its full U.N. membership and send an ambassador to Ramallah, on the condition that Palestinians accept the principle of ''two states for two peoples'' -- an Arab state and a Jewish state in line with U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181 -- and agree that permanent borders, security and land swaps would be negotiated directly with Israel. The status of the refugees would be negotiated between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which represents all Palestinians inside and outside of Palestine. Gaza, now a de facto statelet, would be recognized as part of Palestine only when its government recognizes Israel, renounces violence and rejoins the West Bank.
Why do this? Because there will be no Israeli-Palestinian breakthrough unless the silent majorities on both sides know they have a partner -- that Palestinians have embraced two states for two peoples and that Israelis have embraced Palestinian statehood. Neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor President Abbas have shown a real commitment to nurture these preconditions for peace, and our secret diplomacy with both only plays into their hands. We need to blow this charade wide open by trying to publicly show Iranians, Israelis and Palestinians that they really do have options that their leaders don't want them to see. (Israel's election on Tuesday showed that the peace camp in Israel is still alive and significant.) It may not work. The leaders may still block it or the people may not be interested. But we need to start behaving like a superpower and forcing a moment of truth. Our hands are full now, and we can't waste four more years with allies (or enemies) who may be fooling us.

HEADLINE: Japan Joins Bond Buyers' Club

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
Another central bank, another round of unconventional monetary policy.
Following the lead of their counterparts in the United States, Japan's central bankers announced Tuesday what they called a groundbreaking effort to reinvigorate the country's long-moribund economy and defeat deflation.
With no more room left to cut interest rates and previous steps unsuccessful, the Bank of Japan is taking a page from the Federal Reserve's playbook and will pump trillions more yen into the economy by directly buying government bonds and other assets. It also doubled the country's official inflation target to 2 percent. The action came after months of intense pressure on the Bank of Japan from the country's audacious new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to take more aggressive action to bolster the economy.
But as in the United States, there are doubts about just how much of an effect the move will have in Japan. Three rounds of asset purchases since the onset of the financial crisis have successfully headed off deflation in the American economy but failed to generate the kind of growth necessary to return employment to prerecession levels. 
Japan's move is also likely to further devalue the yen in the long term -- causing some to worry about a possible round of competitive devaluations as countries weaken their currencies to bolster growth in exports. On Tuesday, however, the yen actually rose against the dollar and the euro amid disappointment that the Bank of Japan's efforts had not gone far enough.
Traditionally, curbing inflation, not worrying about deflation, has been the principal task of central bankers. But when economies enter prolonged periods of slow growth, or even contraction, other concerns come to the fore. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was keenly aware of Japan's long-running struggle with deflation as well as the American experience in the Great Depression when he began the first round of United States asset purchases, or quantitative easing, in November 2008.
After a second round of quantitative easing beginning in November 2010, the Fed started a third round in September. It said in December that it would continue to purchase $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month until the job market improved. After considerable pressure, European central bankers also began moving more aggressively last year, vowing to do ''whatever it takes'' to keep the euro zone from fracturing.
Given the scale of the efforts in the United States and Europe, many experts were disappointed by the Bank of Japan's action because the expanded asset purchases will not begin until 2014. They complained that was a waste of valuable time in turning around an economy whose descent into deflation has become a test case of the effects of doing too little in the face of an economic slowdown.
To make matters worse, the Bank of Japan's new plan to purchase 10 trillion yen, or $112 billion, in assets each month sounds more aggressive than it actually will be, said Gustavo Reis, senior international economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That is because many of the securities the Bank of Japan will be purchasing are in the form of short-term debt that will quickly mature, so the additional purchases will equal about $112 billion a year -- not a month -- beginning in 2014.
By contrast, he said, the Fed's balance sheet is expected to expand by a trillion dollars in 2013.
''The Bank of Japan should be more aggressive,'' Mr. Reis said. ''It's a step forward, but given where their economy is, they need to do more.''
In fact, with such a small annual increase in asset purchases, it is unlikely Japan will achieve 2 percent inflation, analysts said. The Consumer Price Index for 2012 fell 0.5 percent, according to government statistics. The Bank of Japan's announcement ''will likely disappoint those who expected the policy board to answer Abe's call for a 'different kind of B.O.J. policy,' or significantly ramp up its pace of easing,'' Izumi Devalier, an economist with HSBC, said in a note to clients.
While certainly better than inaction, there is evidence that unconventional monetary policy can only do so much to lift overall economic growth.
The Fed's monetary policy seems to be having a much more significant effect on asset prices than it has on the underlying economy, said Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays. He noted that nearly four years after markets hit bottom in March 2009, stocks in the United States had more than doubled in value. By contrast, ''most people would characterize the economic recovery as weak.''
For all the challenges in the United States and Europe, Japan's economy, the world's third largest, has been depressed for much longer; the 1990s are regarded as a ''lost decade,'' and the last 10 years are proving to be not much better. Deflation, an all-around fall in prices, profit and incomes, has plagued the country since the late 1990s.
Since last year, when Mr. Abe was still opposition leader, he has urged the central bank to do more after previous rounds of asset purchases failed to reverse deflation. He stepped up the pressure on the bank after a landslide victory by his Liberal Democratic Party in parliamentary elections in December, which catapulted him to office for the second time since a short-lived stint in 2006-7.
Mr. Abe's call for the Bank of Japan to increase the monetary supply has weakened the yen, a boon for exporters, which are responsible for much of Japan's growth. Earlier this month, Mr. Abe also announced an emergency stimulus of 12 trillion yen, providing even more tail wind for the Japanese economy. Those steps have pushed the Nikkei stock index 20 percent higher since mid-November, when Mr. Abe first campaigned on his expansionary platform.
In a joint statement with the government, the Bank of Japan said it was doubling its inflation target to 2 percent and said it would ''pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time.'' The bank's board voted to keep its benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent. The bank also updated its estimates for economic growth in fiscal 2012 and 2013. The bank now forecasts growth of 1 percent for 2012 and 2.3 percent for 2013, with the increase taking into account the new measures.
Mr. Abe immediately hailed the bank's moves, telling the Bank of Japan governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, that the measures were ''groundbreaking,'' according to Kyodo News.
Mr. Abe's critics, however, warn that the central bank will become a printing press for profligate government spending -- expenditures that carry great risks for a country whose public debt is already twice the size of its economy. Critics also say that before flooding a broken system with money, Japan must first tackle structural problems that hurt economic efficiency.
Mr. Abe maintains that deflation will undermine any efforts to grow, and that the government and central bank must act together to get prices rising again. But in a nod to critics, the joint statement said the government would also promote ''all possible decisive policy actions for reforming the economic structure'' and establish ''a sustainable fiscal structure.''
''I believe we are firmly on the path toward bold monetary easing,'' Mr. Abe told reporters.

HEADLINE: Unfinished Luxury Tower Is Stark Reminder of Las Vegas's Economic Reversal

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- It turns out there is something more complicated than shoehorning a seven-building, 17-million-square-foot, $8.5 billion complex of hotels, casinos, high-end shops and luxury condominiums -- known as CityCenter -- into the bustling heart of the Las Vegas Strip.
Tearing part of it down.
The Harmon Tower, promoted as a luxury hotel appealing to a new generation of big-spending Las Vegas revelers, today languishes at the gateway to CityCenter, itself just three years old. Construction was halted at Floor 26 -- the Harmon was planned at 49 stories -- after Clark County inspectors uncovered construction defects in 2008. 
That set off a convoluted battle of blame and lawsuits that has left the Harmon in build-it-or-tear-it-down legal limbo. A trial is set to begin this year.
The unfinished tower enjoys a prime location on Las Vegas Boulevard, a vacant anchor of the most of-the-moment development on the Strip -- a mini-city of sleek and slanting Modernist towers just south of the Bellagio Fountains. CityCenter is a burst of adventurous 21st-century architecture on a Strip dominated by kitsch.
But more than anything, the Harmon, designed by the noted architects Foster & Partners, stands as a symbol of overconfidence and an overextended construction industry rushing to keep pace with a boom of building and profits that gripped Las Vegas 10 years ago: an era when few people could foresee a day of too many hotel rooms and gambling tables, of an economic downturn so severe it could keep tourists away.
The blue-tinted shell looms over Las Vegas Boulevard, largely unnoticed by the thousands of tourists who walk by every day. If it serves any purpose now, it is as what may be the most expensive billboard in the country. On a recent day, half of the north side of the $275 million building sported a poster for ''Zarkana,'' a production of Cirque du Soleil, at the Aria, a hotel in CityCenter that is up and operating.
''It's like you have this dead space -- use it for something,'' said Chris Giunchigliani, a Clark County commissioner whose district includes Las Vegas. ''The whole Strip is overbuilt. We overbuilt rooms. We overbuilt everything.''
The likelihood that construction faults will result in the razing of the Harmon is arguably something of a gift for MGM Resorts International, one of its principal owners, a reason not to open a hotel that many analysts say would struggle during this economic downturn. That is particularly the case since two years ago, the always-bustling Cosmopolitan Hotel -- catering to a similar demographic -- opened, directly across the street.
''This gives them a chance to reset,'' said Billy Vassiliadis, the head of the Nevada advertising agency that represents the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ''It's a great space, a premium piece of real estate. They could rebuild it; they could build a different venue.''
In a continuing court battle, MGM blamed its contractor, the Tutor Perini Building Corporation, for the construction defects and sought to force the company to pay damages and the cost of dismantling the Harmon, around $400 million. ''The building is unusable,'' said Alan M. Feldman, MGM's senior vice president for public affairs. ''The county says it can't be occupied. The county asked us for a remediation plan, we gave it to them and that was to take the building down.''
''We had a contract with Perini that we would pay them to give us a certain kind of building type -- in this case a luxury hotel,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''They haven't kept up their end of the contract. It's a shell of a building that the county says isn't safe.''
Perini responded in court that it was the fault of the designers and not the builders and that the problems could be fixed without tearing down the building. A lawyer for Perini did not respond to telephone calls and e-mails seeking comment.
The problem was spotted by building inspectors who reported that metal rods designed to provide structure support for concrete -- rebars -- were incorrectly placed or missing and that the building would not be able to handle its own weight. The engineers warned that the Harmon could collapse in some sort of cataclysmic event. (Las Vegas is prone to earthquakes.)
William Robinson, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that he doubted that MGM would want to rebuild the hotel, noting the troubled financial history of CityCenter and its struggles in filling the rooms in the other hotels. Even before this legal battle, MGM had announced that it was abandoning plans to put 200 condominiums on what would have been the Harmon's top floors.
''MGM has tried to cut back on the whole project,'' Mr. Robinson said. ''If you are a conspiracy theorist, you think they are just looking for a way to get out of it.''
''Are they going to replace it with something else?'' he asked. ''Are they going to replace it with a different facility? That will tell us what's really going on: it's a fine location.''
Mr. Vassiliadis, one of the Strip's most energetic boosters, said he would be surprised if MGM, assuming it succeeds in demolishing the building, replaces it with another hotel.
''Vegas used to have the mentality of 'Build it and they will come' -- and they did,'' he said. ''I used to freak out every time they put up another 5,000 rooms, but sure enough they filled them.
''But the last four or five years showed our dependence on the national economy: we always knew it, but this is the first time it really hit us,'' he said. ''I'm guessing there will be a lot more measurement on the part of everyone going forward.''
MGM has given no hint of what may happen with the property, though Mr. Feldman, in the interview, repeatedly described it as a choice location for a hotel.
''The proximity of that building to the Strip is really amazing,'' he said. ''And when you are up in it -- and only a handful of people have been up in it -- the relationship of those rooms to the Strip, the energy, is remarkable. I am being personal about this, but I actually think it would have been amazing.''

HEADLINE: Norman Sturner

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Sturner, 72, is the president and chief executive of Murray Hill Properties, a full service real estate company that specializes in office properties in Midtown Manhattan. The company, which Mr. Sturner co-founded in 1971, owns or manages about seven million square feet of office space, including 1180 Avenue of the Americas.
Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINO 
Q. No middle name?
A. We were too poor.
Q. Your firm does a little bit of everything, doesn't it?
A. We're vertically integrated with one exception: we do not own a hammer. So although we will do everything, including the build-out, and manage it, we won't physically build it. We will outsource that to third-party construction companies.
Q. You also don't go outside Manhattan, particularly Midtown.
A. The business in general is focused on New York City commercial office buildings on the island of Manhattan. Period.
So if you said to me you had a great property in Philadelphia, I would tell you we wouldn't buy it. We're not familiar with the marketplace in Philadelphia, or who the good plumbers are.
There is a single property that is the exception to the rule: we own and operate One Pepsi Way in Somers, in Westchester.
The last 10 years we sold almost everything we owned downtown. We were left with the annex at 30 Broad when 9/11 occurred, and about four years after 9/11 we sold it off.
The farthest building to the south we have is One Park, which is near 31st Street, and the most northern property is 1180 Avenue of the Americas.
Q. Murray Hill's strategy seems to be mostly ''value-add,'' which involves buying undervalued properties and improving them.
A. One of the things we do is elevators; another important thing is lobbies, which need sprucing up and a change. In some cases we take the whole thing out and start all over.
We have probably converted in the last 40 years 50 elevators. And that comes from going into a building that's 40, 50 years old, or in some cases 75. The elevators are ancient, and so we convert them. That brings a better class of tenants and an advantage to the tenancy.
''Elevatoring,'' all by itself, is very peculiar. You will wait in line for an hour at a restaurant if you need to eat at that restaurant, or wait 45 minutes for a movie, but God help me if you get into the elevator and you press the button and the door doesn't close!
Q. How do you find these properties?
A. We go to a fellow owner -- because you know they're in difficulty, you know they need cash, that a major tenant is coming up and they can't afford the replacement costs, or are in a refinancing -- and buy them out.
We'll also joint-venture. For the most part, what we'll do with somebody who's in distress is we'll put up all the new money. We'll make all your payoffs, we'll write all the checks, we'll do all the work.
And we'll pay the transfer tax if necessary. But you won't have to file foreclosure or bankruptcy. You will still have your name attached to the property.
Q. And what percentage of the property will you end up owning?
A. About 90.
Q. Are you in talks with any owners right now?
A. We're actually in negotiations with three owners, two of which don't even have a mortgage.
Q. Let's talk about one of your latest purchases, at 530 Fifth Avenue.
A. It's 550,000 square feet and it has 45,000 feet of available retail. We bought that eight or nine months ago.
We're repositioning the asset by building a brand-new lobby. There's a repositioning in the retail -- the bankruptcy of Syms/Filene's created an enormous opportunity for us. And then there's 500,000 feet above grade that is constantly turning.
We're going through 10- and 12-year-old leases, when the market would have been in the $30s and $40s, in a market that's now in the $60s and up.
There are probably 15 tenants. Their leases will expire over the next 30 months.
Q. Speaking of rental rates, what are Murray Hill's portfolio-wide?
A. On the low side, probably the low $50s; on the high side, the high $60s. We don't own the Gold Coast, nor do we have C-type properties. We're B-plus.
Q. And occupancy rates?
A. Mid- to high 90 percent.
Our focus is on 10,000- to 50,000-foot floor plates, or the midsize tenant.
Q. So business was good in 2012?
A. Better than '11.
Q. What's your outlook for this year?
A. We're looking at a vibrant New York City economy. And there's no major new construction going on in the city -- in the center city.
Q. How did you get into the real estate business?
A. We got into it by accident. It's 1971, we own a seat on the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington stock exchange. I am one of the largest mutual fund dealers in the country; my business partner has a major life insurance agency.
At the time they were giving New York City away. It was hours away from filing bankruptcy.
And somebody walked in -- a friend of a friend of a friend -- and said, ''I'm stuck in a residential building on West 57th Street and I can't get my deposit back. I'm about to lose my money. Would you buy 30 apartments for $70,000?'' I said, ''What do we know about real estate?''
But we went there anyway and we bought it. And I said to the fellow that walked in, ''Do me a favor: the next time you see a building, call us.''
It took him a week and he called and said, ''I have two six-story brownstones on Park Avenue and 39th Street, but these are expensive. These are $150,000 each.'' We bought them for cash. He came back a third time and said, ''I got 500 apartments on Queens Boulevard.''
All of a sudden I turned to my partner and said, ''Do you really want to be in the insurance business anymore?''
And he said, ''Do you want to be in the mutual fund business?''

HEADLINE: A Cold Shoulder for Russian Dissidents

BYLINE: By OLEG KASHIN. 
Oleg Kashin is a correspondent and columnist for the magazine Russian Life. This article was translated by Steven Seymour from the Russian.

 BODY:
MOSCOW
LAST week, Alexander Dolmatov, an activist in a political party opposed to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, committed suicide at a detention center in the Netherlands. He had fled Russia last June, hoping to be granted political asylum. When his application was denied, he took his life -- the only way to guarantee that he would not be deported home and, most likely, face time in prison.
A Dutch official said ''the asylum denial is not the reason for his suicide,'' citing a note Mr. Dolmatov, who was 36, left behind. In that note, which Mr. Dolmatov's mother shared with me, he expressed regret for ''having brought shame on everybody.'' However, his lawyer has said that Mr. Dolmatov might have written the note under duress. Mr. Dolmatov's mother has asked the Dutch government for an investigation. 
Mr. Dolmatov's case is only the latest example of the fallout of 2011-12 protests against the Putin regime. It raises questions about concern for human rights in the West, which once sheltered numerous defectors from the Soviet Union but is now less hospitable to dissidents. Instead of Western Europe, America and Israel, today's dissidents are seeking refuge in former Soviet republics -- though their safety is not guaranteed there.
Last year, two opposition activists, Anastasia Rybachenko and Mikhail Maglov, fled Russia. Ms. Rybachenko, who had initially sought asylum in Germany, is now a student in Estonia; Mr. Maglov has applied for asylum in Ukraine.
Another dissident who had fled to Ukraine, Leonid Razvozzhayev, vanished in October after requesting asylum at a United Nations office in Kiev. Days later, he emerged outside a Moscow courthouse, saying he had been kidnapped, repatriated and tortured.
Sergei Kuznetsov, a Russian journalist who has exposed corruption, left in 2011 and moved to Georgia after his attempts to seek refuge in Britain and Israel failed. The European Union has been criticized for dithering on asylum requests from Chechens and other ethnic minorities who have left Russia.
Mr. Dolmatov, Ms. Rybachenko and Mr. Maglov were all casualties of a government crackdown over a series of protests in Bolotnaya Square, which has a long history as a site of repression. Two legendary Cossack leaders were executed there: Stepan Razin in 1671 and Yemelyan Pugachev in 1775.
More recently, the square was the site of the biggest protests in Russia since the Soviet era. In December 2011, tens of thousands of Russians gathered there to protest fraud and manipulation in parliamentary elections. Mr. Putin, the president from 2000 to 2008, was prime minister at the time, while his protégé Dmitri A. Medvedev was president. The men announced a series of political reforms and a reshuffling of Mr. Putin's staff, which gave liberals slight hope.
Mr. Putin, a K.G.B. officer during the Soviet era, has always been nervous about street protests. His regime was terrified by the largely peaceful revolutions that toppled dictators in Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004, as well as the Arab Spring.
But the Kremlin quickly recovered from its initial fright. Last May, just before Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev switched jobs, thousands of Russians again thronged Bolotnaya Square. Instead of concessions, the government responded with repression. It went after ordinary participants in the protests, including a student, a journalist, even a chemist. Sometimes the authorities would first search the home of a suspect, then detain him a few days later. Because of that delay, several opposition participants managed to avoid detention by fleeing Russia after their homes were searched.
One of them, Mr. Dolmatov, went farther than others in his flight to safety. Unlike other people persecuted in connection with the demonstrations, he had been under surveillance by the F.S.B. (the K.G.B.'s successor) long before the demonstrations started, because he worked for a state-run missile-design company and had a government security clearance. After he fled, during a search of his parents' home, a government agent told them their son was lucky to have left, or he would have been charged not only with protesting but also spying.
Mr. Dolmatov is returning to Russia -- to be buried. His death is a tragedy to those who knew him and also to thousands of anti-Putin protesters who, fearing persecution, have hoped that the West would offer them a haven.
During the cold war, Western public opinion was resolutely on the side of harboring persecuted Soviet dissidents. But as the European Union has drawn closer to Russia economically, interest in Russian human rights has waned, except when developments are so outrageous -- like the assassination of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 -- that they cannot be ignored. If the West's doors remain closed, more Russian dissidents will become victims of the state -- or die by their own hands.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Representative Will Step Down

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, will step down in late February, his office said Tuesday. Lael Brainard and Michael Froman, two top administration aides on international economic policy, are considered among the front-runners to succeed him, people knowledgeable about trade policy said. 
''From bringing home new trade agreements with Korea, Colombia and Panama and negotiating to open up new markets for American businesses to cracking down on unfair trade practices around the world, he has been a tremendous advocate for the American worker,'' President Obama said in a statement.
The White House did not say when a successor would be named to the job, a cabinet-level position that advises the president on trade policy and negotiates trade agreements.
The next trade representative will inherit a full slate of issues. The administration is negotiating a free-trade deal with nearly a dozen Pacific Rim nations, including Canada, Mexico, Australia, Vietnam and Singapore, though not the regional powers of China and Japan. It is also edging closer to free-trade talks with the European Union.
Mr. Kirk, 58, a former mayor of Dallas, made clear last year that he intended to resign. In addition to losing another cabinet-level assistant, Mr. Obama is also losing a favored golf partner in Mr. Kirk.
''We have made great strides to bring about the president's vision of a more robust, responsible and responsive trade policy that opens markets to products stamped 'Made in America' and enforces Americans' trade rights around the world,'' Mr. Kirk said in a statement.
Mr. Froman, 50, who has known Mr. Obama since they attended Harvard Law School together, holds a joint appointment at the White House National Security Council and National Economic Council. Ms. Brainard, also 50, an under secretary at the Treasury Department and a contender for secretary later in Mr. Obama's second term, is the country's top financial diplomat.
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Froman and Ms. Brainard are attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, according to an official list of participants.

HEADLINE: Security Council Condemns North Korea Rocket Launching

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The Security Council on Tuesday unanimously condemned North Korea for launching a rocket last month, with Pyongyang's main ally, China, taking an uncommon step by joining the criticism.
The resolution ratcheted up existing sanctions on North Korea after it used ballistic missile technology to launch a multistage rocket, which carried a 200-pound surveillance satellite into orbit on Dec. 12.
The United States and China said they had worked closely on drafting the resolution, with Security Council diplomats saying they wanted to get it passed before South Korea takes over the monthly rotating presidency of the Security Council in February. 
Despite China's rejection of proposals by the United States to add new sanctions, the Obama administration sought to characterize the vote as a tough response. ''This resolution demonstrates to North Korea that there are unanimous and significant consequences for its flagrant violation of its obligations under previous resolutions,'' said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations.
The measure said the Council ''deplores the violations'' of previous resolutions, which barred North Korea from undertaking new nuclear or ballistic missile tests. The resolution added four organizations and six individuals to an existing blacklist, including the North Korean space agency, the Korean Committee for Space Technology. It also threatened more measures for any new launchings.
China's ambassador to the United Nations, Li Baodong, emphasized that the resolution stressed the need for negotiations to resume over ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program; known as the six-party talks, they include both Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. ''We believe that the situation on the Korean Peninsula is at a crossroads,'' Mr. Li said. ''There is an opportunity for all stakeholders on the Korean Peninsula to start the diplomatic track and to avoid the escalation of tension.''
North Korea reacted swiftly and angrily to the resolution, threatening to accelerate its military advances, including nuclear weapons, and reject any effort to resume the six-party talks. ''We will take measures to boost and strengthen our defensive military power including nuclear deterrence,'' its Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.
The measures included in the resolution will most likely have little day-to-day effect, experts said, but the 15-to-0 vote was significant because it included China, a longtime economic benefactor and protector of North Korea.
''The most important element of this is not the practical impact of any sanctions, but the clear message to North Korea that it has a choice to go forward with its weapons programs or with an economic opening,'' said Matt Stumpf, the director of the Asia Society's Washington office.
The resolution, the third in six years condemning ballistic missile tests, comes at a time when there are new rumblings about North Korea carrying out another nuclear test.
Tuesday's resolution serves to warn Pyongyang that Beijing's patience is not infinite, and that a third nuclear test could even provoke Chinese anger, said William H. Tobey, who was the Bush administration's senior official for nuclear nonproliferation and is now at Harvard's Belfer Center.
But only a threat of economic action by China might have a real impact, he noted. ''Chinese willingness to withhold these benefits would be the only lever with much power over Pyongyang,'' Mr. Tobey said.

HEADLINE: Microcosm Of Society, Seeking An Anchor

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT. 
Watch A. O. Scott with David Carr in ''The Sweet Spot,'' on culture and criticism, at nytimes.com.

 BODY:
In Europe as in the United States, immigration is a politically contentious issue most often addressed in abstract demographic and ideological terms. There have been movies that try to give the problem a human face, focusing on the struggles of families and individuals, frequently with well-meaning sentimentality.
''The Pirogue,'' a remarkably cleareyed, quietly ambitious film from the Senegalese director Moussa Touré, takes a different approach. In chronicling a perilous sea voyage from Africa to Spain -- a common, frequently fatal undertaking, in spite of the European economic crisis -- the film dispenses with hopeful piety, bluntly presenting a reality that is all too easily ignored or turned into fodder for slogans and wishful thinking. 
The film begins with a festival that blends dance, ritual and wrestling, and that offers a glimpse of modern Africa's cultural vitality. The 30 men and one woman who set off in the long, brightly painted wooden canoe that gives the movie its name are not necessarily eager to abandon their home. The captain of the boat, Baye Laye, is especially reluctant. But the fish that once supplied his livelihood are scarcer than they used to be, and so is money.
After holding out for a while, Baye Laye (Souleymane Seye Ndiaye), who has a wife and children to support, accepts the job. The passengers include his brother, an aspiring musician, and another young man who dreams of playing professional soccer. Others have more practical, or at least more modest, ambitions. A tribal elder is leading a group of men seeking agricultural employment in Spain. Another man hopes to work until he can afford a prosthesis for the leg he lost in an accident. The woman -- Nafy (Mame Astou Diallo), a stowaway who agrees to pay for her passage by preparing meals -- is trying to reunite with her children after her husband drowned on a similar voyage.
Every fictional boat -- from the whaling ship in ''Moby-Dick'' to the dinghy in ''Life of Pi'' -- is a society in microcosm, and if Baye Laye's passengers share a basic economic motive, they also represent a diverse array of backgrounds and beliefs. Some wear traditional clothing, while others favor hip-hop and Hollywood-influenced fashions. There are pious Muslims and cynical hedonists, and each migrant approaches the journey with a distinctive blend of superstition and pragmatism.
Mr. Touré surveys their interactions with sympathy, but without insisting on the innocence or heroism of anyone on board. As they run into trouble, and optimism turns first to anxiety and then to desperation, their fragile solidarity is tested, and so is each individual's capacity for cowardice, bravery and compassion. At one point they encounter another boat whose engine has failed, and the pleas of the Africans on board represent a terrible moral dilemma and also, perhaps, an omen. Should Baye Laye and the others on his pirogue risk their own lives by helping the others, or should they turn away in the interests of their own survival?
It is an awful choice and a devastating moment in a film that is full of them. But the most powerful thing about ''The Pirogue'' is the way it deals with emotionally charged events matter-of-factly, rather than melodramatically. The story Mr. Touré has chosen to tell is both painfully specific -- about these individuals, in this boat -- and immeasurably vast, since the experience it depicts is shared by millions of people around the world. And yet somehow he gets the scale just right.
The Pirogue
Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh's Three Rivers, Now a Public Attraction

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE H. O'TOOLE

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- Pittsburgh exists for three reasons: the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio.
In the 20th century, the banks of those rivers were controlled by industrial behemoths. They largely lost that identity after the waning of the steel industry in the 1980s. Over the last two decades, however, the city's progress in clearing and cleaning its waterfront has created 12 miles of recreational trails, three professional sports stadiums, several boat landings and an influx of nearly 2,000 new downtown residents.
The city has managed to leverage a $124 million investment in publicly accessible riverfront into $4 billion in corporate, public, nonprofit and entertainment development downtown. 
That success has renewed a debate that would have been unthinkable in Pittsburgh's polluted industrial heyday: how best to expand public access to the shorelines of the three rivers. Projects proposed for two of the largest tracts left to be developed on the downtown fringe illustrate the opportunities and limits of public-private partnerships.
This month, the city's Urban Redevelopment Authority approved preliminary plans for an $80 million to $90 million investment in new roads, streets and utilities on a 178-acre former industrial site that is the biggest remaining waterfront property in the city. The developers will use a tool called tax increment financing, which earmarks a portion of a site's future property taxes to build its infrastructure. Such financing, approved by both the authority and the City Council on a case-by-case basis, has galvanized redevelopment on Pittsburgh's complex industrial sites.
The latest project, which uses the acronym Almono for the city's three rivers, is a case in point. It envisions a $900 million office, industrial and residential development on a former steel and coke manufacturing site on the Monongahela River that closed in 1997.
In 2002, an alliance of four philanthropies bought the property for $10 million to protect it for postindustrial development. ''It was a once-in-a-century opportunity to develop the riverfront, and we thought foundations, as nonprofit owners, could supply patient money,'' said William P. Getty, president of the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation.
The current Almono partnership comprises the Heinz Endowments, the Benedum Foundation and an affiliate of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. It is managed by the Regional Industrial Development Corporation of Southwestern Pennsylvania, a nonprofit economic development group.
The former industrial site occupies a strategic location between downtown and two rapidly expanding research institutions, the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon. Both universities lease space in the adjacent Pittsburgh Technology Park. Carnegie Mellon also conducts robotics field testing at the Almono site.
Donald F. Smith Jr., president of the development corporation, says the partnership is talking with both universities about their futures at the site. ''The universities are important players,'' he noted. ''They will have space needs for their tech transfer efforts.''
Private developers will be asked to submit proposals for four interconnected zones on the Monongahela River that will include two million square feet of office space, research and clean manufacturing, and 1,200 residential units. The master plan developed by the Rothschild Doyno Collaborative, an architecture and urban design firm, calls for alternative technologies for energy generation and storm and wastewater management, along with 25 acres of parks, trails and river access. The design also suggests new uses for a few existing structures, like a rail yard roundhouse and a 1,300-foot-long steel mill.
''Riverfront access, beautification and redevelopment of the entire neighborhood is important,'' said Jim Richter, executive director of the Hazelwood Initiative, a community development organization.
While plans include continued traffic on a CSX rail line through the site, a proposed highway has been suspended because of its $4 billion price tag and community opposition.
''The Mon-Fayette Expressway kept the site in limbo for 40 years,'' said Ken Doyno, principal at Rothschild Doyno. ''Now there's been a huge cultural shift. It became clear that there was a better use than a highway and industry.''
While Almono's plan is moving forward, a different riverfront plan for the Allegheny River recently changed gears.
Last year, the Buncher Company, a real estate developer, announced plans to build Riverfront Landing, a $400 million mixed-use complex on 55 acres next to the Strip District, a downtown market area on the south shore of the Allegheny River. The market and Buncher's site are between 11th Street and 21st Street. They have been included in several public design plans in the last two years that call for a continuous 95-foot space along the river for public use.
Riverlife Pittsburgh, a public-private partnership that guides and advocates waterfront redevelopment, lobbied Buncher to move its complex 95 feet back from the river, citing riverbank erosion and storm water management, as well as aesthetics.
Councilman Patrick Dowd, chairman of the City Council's intergovernmental affairs committee, complained that the city's Urban Redevelopment Authority had been vague about how money from the tax increment financing plan would be used at Buncher's site. Mr. Dowd also said the gated streets at Riverfront Landing would limit city residents' access to the river.
''The rivers have been blocked for too long by industrial sites,'' he said. ''Right now, the city's turning to face the river.''
The City Council has approved a special planning district and public access through the Riverfront Landing site, as well as a minimum 70-foot distance back from the river.
But after a six-month standoff with Mr. Dowd, who refused to bring the tax increment financing plan to a vote, Buncher said in early January that it would no longer pursue a $50 million tax increment plan for the site.
''The Buncher Company has earned a highly respected community reputation over the last 60 years and does not wish to participate in a financing program the community views negatively,'' said Tom Balestrieri, president of Buncher.
Yarone Zober, chairman of the Urban Redevelopment Authority, said he expected the project to proceed without the tax plan, but he said it would probably affect public amenities, like a proposed piazza and a trail.
''Potentially we have lost the opportunity to take tax proceeds from that development and plug them directly into public improvements,'' he said. ''Without the tax increment plan, we'll have to roll up our sleeves.''

HEADLINE: A Tax Bite Tailored To Help All

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
What would happen if the government raised everybody's taxes?
The fiscal deal struck in the wee hours of 2013 will raise at best $700 billion from higher taxes on wealthy Americans in the coming decade. This is hardly enough to stabilize the nation's debt in the next 10 years, let alone deal with a long-term budget deficit that is expected to mushroom as the population ages and spending on entitlements rises.
To make ends meet, both parties agree, spending must be drastically cut. Under the White House budget proposal, discretionary spending on everything except the military is projected to shrink to its smallest share of the economy since the Eisenhower administration by the beginning of the next decade. Though he has resisted Republican demands to slash entitlements, President Obama remains willing to look for further savings from Medicare.
This is not, however, the only option we have. There is an alternative: raising more money from all taxpayers, including the middle class. 
Nobody wants to talk about this. Republicans don't want to raise taxes at all. ''The tax issue is finished, over, completed,'' declared the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell. President Obama does want to raise more money, but only narrowly. His proposals for tax reform are aimed carefully at high-income taxpayers and corporations.
Yet Americans would benefit from a discussion of this possibility. Higher taxes would undoubtedly stress many working families, especially after a decade of falling income for all but the most successful. But these families might nonetheless prefer paying more in taxes to losing government services they rely on.
A good way to start the debate might be to explain what higher taxes would entail for middle-class families, so they could balance the bill against the benefits they would otherwise lose. ''One way or another, middle-class people are going to take a hit,'' said Eric J. Toder, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ''It's unfortunate that neither party is willing to admit that.''
The tax hit would depend, of course, on the size of the federal bill. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group, has suggested that after the fiscal deal, we need only $1.4 trillion in additional deficit reduction to stabilize the federal debt at about 73 percent of the economy over the next decade.
That $1.4 trillion amounts to less than 1 percent of our economic output. But it would come on top of enormous cuts to civilian discretionary spending, from the National Institutes of Health to training programs for unemployed workers. What's more, the center's analysis stops in 2022, before the budget deficit is really expected to take off.
We might consider instead the experience of other advanced countries, which raise more money in taxes than we do to pay for programs like child care for working mothers and government-financed health care for everybody.
Taxes in the 34 nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development averaged about 34.5 percent of gross domestic product from 2004 to 2010, the latest year for which the organization provides data. That's about 8.5 percentage points more than our federal, state and local taxes put together in the same period.
Or we might try something between the two. In November 2011, before the White House and Congress raised taxes on the wealthy, the Tax Policy Center analyzed how the United States could reduce the debt burden using taxes alone, without resorting to deep cuts to entitlements or discretionary spending.
Compared with a situation in which all of the Bush administration's tax cuts were extended indefinitely and other government policies remained in place, the center estimated that we could trim the federal debt to 60 percent of gross domestic product, from about 70 percent, in two decades by increasing tax revenue by 4.1 percent of gross domestic product -- some $650 billion last year.
The average cost of this option for American taxpayers, according to the policy center, is substantial. But perhaps it is bearable: over the long term, beyond one-time adjustments, the after-tax income of the average American family would fall by 6.6 to 7.1 percent. This might be seen as the price tag for saving the government roughly as we know it.
The burden could be distributed in several ways. In one possibility, the center estimated, the top federal income tax rate for the richest families, earning more than $398,600 a year, would rise to almost 54 percent, well above the 39.6 percent agreed to in the recent fiscal negotiations.
The poorest Americans, earning $17,850 or less, would pay a top rate of 15.4 percent, up from 10 percent today. Middle-class families, earning $17,850 to $72,600, would see their top tax rate rise to 23.1 percent from 15 percent.
This would distribute the burden fairly progressively, drawing a larger share of taxes from wealthier Americans. The top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax income drop 13.1 percent. The poorest fifth would only lose 0.4 percent of their income. Middle-income families would lose about 4.2 percent, on average -- about $2,000 for a family earning $50,000 a year.
But that's not the only way to increase taxes. Most economists agree, in fact, that it is a costly method. High income tax rates blunt incentives to earn more, putting a drag on economic growth. Another option is to tax the money that people spend, using the kind of value-added tax employed in every other advanced country. The Tax Policy Center estimated that the government could hit its revenue targets with a broad V.A.T. of 16.7 percent.
Such a tax would look like a sales tax, an extra charge on the purchase of goods and services. Because it wouldn't discourage work or investment, it would not slow growth like a high income tax rate would. But because the poor spend a larger share of their money than the rich, it would fall more heavily on lower-income Americans.
Even if the government were to offer a rebate to compensate the poorest among us, their after-tax income would decline 1.3 percent, according to the policy center's analysis. The income of the top 1 percent would decline 7.6 percent. Families in the middle of the income distribution would lose 6 percent -- $3,000 from an after-tax income of $50,000.
Citizens of other advanced nations appear to believe that a richer array of government services is worth the price. Standard V.A.T. rates in almost every European country exceed that in the Tax Policy Center's analysis. Europe's social democracies compensate for the regressive nature of the tax by spending the money on benefits that are particularly valuable for the poor.
Americans have historically been more hostile to taxation than citizens of other wealthy nations. Still, our elected officials' refusal to discuss higher taxes may overstate our aversion. Respondents to a poll by the Pew Research Center in the fall of 2011 thought, almost two to one, that it was more important to avoid cuts in Social Security benefits than to avoid payroll tax increases.
According to a CBS/New York Times poll last summer, 74 percent of Americans oppose shorter school days or more crowded classrooms, even if those measures would lower their tax bill significantly. And 82 percent oppose lower taxes if that means reducing the ranks of the police.
Clearly, Americans value government services. We may welcome an opportunity to save them.

HEADLINE: Justice and Prosperity

 BODY:
When Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. congratulated President Obama after he completed his oath of office on Monday, Americans heard the cordial, affirming voice that regularly fills the courtroom of the Supreme Court. But the chief justice's graciousness did not mean he was endorsing the president or his views. 
As the president's Inaugural Address made plain and as important rulings of the Roberts court show, the Obama and Roberts visions of America are very different. No disagreement is more fundamental than that about the connection between justice and prosperity.
To Mr. Obama, prosperity enables justice and vice versa. Persuasively, he said in his address, ''Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.'' He also said, ''We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else.'' And commitments to justice, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, he said, ''do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.''
The Roberts court, on the other hand, with the chief justice in the majority, has regularly ruled as if justice and prosperity are unrelated or even antithetical -- by protecting large corporations from class-action lawsuits; by making it much harder for private lawsuits to succeed against mutual fund malefactors, even when they have admitted to lying and cheating; or by allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns and advance their narrow interests by exerting influence unjustly over government.
When the chief justice cast his critical vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act last June, he made clear that he did not favor the law, which is the most important commitment to justice and prosperity so far of the Obama administration. He wrote tartly, ''It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.''
The connection between justice and prosperity is clear and strong. ''Economic growth,'' the scholar Benjamin Friedman documented, ''more often than not fosters greater opportunity, tolerance of diversity, social mobility, commitment to fairness and dedication to democracy.'' And justice of all kinds, especially social justice, is an essential means of achieving prosperity, as economic progress in the South demonstrated after the civil rights laws brought racial progress.
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the coming months about the continuing need for a critical section of the Voting Rights Act that prevents racial discrimination and about the basic rights of gay Americans. Those cases are unquestionably about justice and fundamental issues of fairness. But their outcomes will inevitably affect prosperity as well, because they deal with issues of participation in American society and, as a result, in the American economy.
The cameras lingered on President Obama after the inaugural ceremony just before he entered the Capitol, as he turned back toward the Mall and took in the crowd of a million or so of the American people whose general welfare he again swore to promote. When Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath, he had a similar chance to be reminded of the multitudes to whom the Supreme Court pledges ''Equal Justice Under Law'' -- and to be reminded of the strong link between justice and prosperity.

HEADLINE: Federal Class-Action Securities Lawsuits Fell in 2012, Study Finds

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The number of federal class-action securities lawsuits filed in 2012 came to 152 cases last year, well below the level in 2011, according to a study by Cornerstone Research. 

 BODY:
As the stock markets improved last year, it appears, demand for federal shareholder lawsuits diminished.
The number of federal class-action securities lawsuits filed in 2012 amounted to 152 cases, according to a new study by Cornerstone Research. That is well below the average of 193 suits in the previous 15 years as well as the 188 suits filed in 2011. 
And that drop was consistent across a broad array of potential legal areas. Federal lawsuits filed over announced mergers, for example, fell by nearly a third in 2012 from 2011, to 13 cases. (The study's authors caution that the drop may be because plaintiffs are pursuing claims in state courts, rather than turning to the federal court system.)
Filings against Chinese companies that pursued stock listings in the United States - at one point a red-hot topic - tumbled to 10 cases last year, from 31 in the prior year.
And new lawsuits tied to the financial crisis finally disappeared for the first time, as the market turmoil of 2008 receded even further into the distance.

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis Suit Suggests Bad Behavior at Morgan Stanley

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Documents released as part of a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley shed new light on what bankers knew at the height of the housing bubble and what they did with that secret knowledge. 

 BODY:
On March 16, 2007, Morgan Stanley employees working on one of the toxic assets that helped blow up the world economy discussed what to name it. Among the team members' suggestions: "Subprime Meltdown," "Hitman," "Nuclear Holocaust" and "Mike Tyson's Punchout," as well a simple yet direct reference to a bag of excrement.
Ha ha. Those hilarious investment bankers.
Then they gave it its real name and sold it to a Chinese bank. 
We are never going to have a full understanding of what bad behavior bankers engaged in in the years leading up to the financial crisis. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have failed to hold big wrongdoers to account.
We are left with what scraps we can get from those private lawsuits lucky enough to get over the high hurdles for document discovery. A case brought in a New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan against Morgan Stanley by a Taiwanese bank, which bought a piece of the same deal the Chinese bank did, has cleared that bar.
The results are explosive. Hundreds of pages of internal Morgan Stanley documents, released publicly last week, shed much new light on what bankers knew at the height of the housing bubble and what they did with that secret knowledge.
The lawsuit concerns a $500 million collateralized debt obligation called Stack 2006-1, created in the first half of 2006. Collections of mortgage-backed securities, C.D.O.'s were at the heart of the financial crisis.
But the documents suggest a pattern of behavior larger than this one deal: people across the bank understood that the American housing market was in trouble. They took advantage of that knowledge to create and then bet against securities and then also to unload garbage investments on unsuspecting buyers.
Morgan Stanley doesn't see the narrative as the plaintiffs do. The firm is fighting the lawsuit, contending that the buyers were sophisticated clients and could have known what was going on in the subprime market. The C.D.O. documents disclosed, albeit obliquely, that Morgan Stanley might bet against the securities, a strategy known as shorting. The firm did not pick the assets going into the deal (though it was able to veto any assets). And any shorting of the deal was part of a larger array of trades, both long and short. Indeed, Morgan Stanley owned a big piece of Stack, in addition to its short bet.
Regarding the profane naming contest, Morgan Stanley said in a statement: "While the e-mail in question contains inappropriate language and reflects a poor attempt at humor, the Morgan Stanley employee who wrote it was responsible for documenting transactions. It was not his job or within his skill set to assess the state of the market or the credit quality of the transaction being discussed."
Philip Blumberg, the Morgan Stanley lawyer who composed most of the names, meet the underside of a bus, courtesy of your employer.
Another Morgan Stanley employee sent an e-mail that same morning, suggesting that the deal be called "Hitman." This might have been an attempt to manage up, because "Hitman" was the nickname of his boss, Jonathan Horowitz, who helped head the part of the group that oversaw mortgage-backed C.D.O.'s. Mr. Horowitz replied, "I like it."
Both Mr. Blumberg and Mr. Horowitz, now at JPMorgan, declined to comment through representatives at their banks.
In February 2006, Morgan Stanley began putting together the Stack C.D.O. According to an internal presentation, Stack "represents attractive business for Morgan Stanley."
Why? In addition to fees, another bullet point listed: "Ability to short up to $325MM of credits into the C.D.O." In other words, Morgan Stanley could - and did - sell assets to the Stack C.D.O., intending to profit if the securities backed by those assets declined. The bank put on a $170 million bet against Stack, even as it was selling it.
In the end, of the $500 million of assets backing the deal, $415 million ended up worthless.
"While investors and taxpayers all over the world continue to choke on Wall Street's toxic subprime products, to this day not a single major Wall Street executive has been held accountable for misconduct relating to those products," said Jason C. Davis, a lawyer at Robbins Geller who is representing the plaintiff in the lawsuit. "They are generally untouchable, but we are pleased that the court in this case is ordering Morgan Stanley to turn over damning evidence, so that the jury will get to see what Morgan Stanley really knew about the troubled nature of its supposedly 'higher-than-AAA' quality product."
Why might Morgan Stanley have bet against the deal? Did its traders develop a brilliant thesis by assessing the fundamentals of the housing market through careful analysis of the public data? The documents suggest something more troubling: bankers found out that the housing market was diseased from their colleagues down the hall.
Bankers were getting information from fellow employees conducting and receiving private assessments of the quality of the mortgages that the bank would purchase to back securities. These reports weren't available to the public. It would be crucial information for trading in securities backed by those kinds of mortgages.
In one e-mail from Oct. 21, 2005, a Morgan Stanley employee warned a banker that the mortgages Morgan Stanley was buying from loan originators were troubled. "The real issue is that the loan requests do not make sense," he wrote. As an example, he cited "a borrower that makes $12K a month as an operation manger (sic) of an unknown company - after research on my part I reveal it is a tarot reading house. Compound these issues with the fact that we are seeing what I would call a lot of this type of profile."
In another e-mail from March 17, 2006, another Morgan Stanley employee wrote about a "deteriorating appraisal quality that is very flagrant."
Two of the employees who received those e-mails joined an internal hedge fund, headed by Howard Hubler, that was formed only the next month, in April 2006. As recounted in Michael Lewis's "The Big Short," Mr. Hubler infamously bet against the subprime market on Morgan Stanley's behalf, a fact that Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer conceded in late 2007. Mr. Hubler's group was supposed to be separate from the rest of Morgan Stanley, but the two bankers continued to receive similar information about the underlying market, according to a person briefed on the matter.
At no point did they receive material, nonpublic information, a Morgan Stanley spokesman says.
I struggle to see how the private assessments that the subprime market was imploding were immaterial.
Another of Morgan Stanley's main defenses is that it couldn't have thought the investment it sold to the Taiwanese was terrible because it, too, lost money on securities backed by subprime mortgages. As the Morgan Stanley spokesman put it, "This deal must be viewed in the context of a significant write-down for Morgan Stanley in 2007, when the firm recorded huge losses in its public securities filings related to other subprime C.D.O. positions."
This is a common refrain offered by big banks like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns to absolve them of any responsibility.
But does losing money wipe away sin?
Yes, Mr. Hubler made his bets in what turned out to be a deeply disastrous way. As part of a complex array of trades, he bet against the middle slices of subprime mortgage C.D.O.'s. He bought the supposedly safe top parts. The income from the top slices helped offset the cost of betting against the middle slices. But when the market collapsed, the top slices - called "super senior" because they were supposedly safer than Triple A - didn't hold their value, losing billions for Mr. Hubler and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hubler did not respond to requests for comment.
So Morgan Stanley lost a great deal of money.
But let's review what the documents suggest is the big picture.
In the fall of 2005, bank employees shared nonpublic assessments of how the subprime market was a house of tarot cards.
In February 2006, the bank began creating Stack in part so that it could bet against it.
In April 2006, the bank created its own internal hedge fund, led by Mr. Hubler, who shorted the subprime market. Among the traders in this internal shop were people who helped create Stack and other deals like it, and at least two employees who had access to the private due diligence reports.
Mr. Hubler's group had no investment position in Stack, according to the person briefed on the matter, but it sure looks as if the bank saw what was coming and tried to position itself for a subprime market collapse.
Finally, by early 2007, the bank appeared to realize that the subprime market was faring even worse than it expected. Even the supposedly safe pieces of C.D.O.'s that it owned, including its piece of Stack, were facing losses. So Morgan Stanley bankers set to scouring the world to peddle as a safe and sound investment what its own employees were internally deriding.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment on whether it made money on its Stack investments over all. But it looks to have turned out well for the bank. In Stack, it managed to fob off a nuclear bomb to the Taiwanese bank.
Unfortunately for Morgan Stanley, it had so many other pieces of C.D.O.'s, so many nuclear warheads, that it couldn't find nearly enough suckers around the world to buy them all.
And so when the real collapse came, Morgan Stanley was left with billions of dollars in losses.
That hardly seems exculpatory.

HEADLINE: Why India's Waste-to-Energy Industry Won't Catch Fire

BYLINE: DAVID FERRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Bureaucracy, turf battles and and demands for bribes make it difficult for a plant to open and stay profitable. 

 BODY:
K.S. Sivaprasad, an engineer from India, spent four decades perfecting a factory that accepts city trash, dries it, picks out the burnable elements and ignites them to create electricity. His first full-scale plant chews through 700 tons of garbage a day and delivers 5.5 megawatts to the power grid.
The unfortunate part is that the plant is in Malaysia, not India, where the process was invented. Mr. Sivaprasad, an energetic 80-year-old, went abroad after repeatedly trying to build his project in India but finding that the system was stacked against him, he says. 
India tosses more than 188 million tons of garbage each day, but is falling behind other Asian nations in early efforts to turn it into electricity. The Chinese government claims to be on track to produce three gigawatts of power from city waste-to-energy factories by 2015, and Malaysia plans to build a second, larger plant based on Mr. Sivaprasad's design. 
Meanwhile, India has captured methane from several large landfills and has built six facilities that pull out and ignite flammable trash, turning it into what is known as refuse-derived fuel. But these six fuel factories, which rely on new refuse, have either shut down or barely run, victims of equipment failure or bureaucratic snarls that paradoxically leave them short of garbage.

Why? "It is the million-dollar question," Mr. Sivaprasad said. "I don't know what to say. India has a lot of hurdles, you know, very bureaucratic. Very difficult. In short, if you put it in a nutshell, technology developed in India has come up in another country."
India's output of trash grew nearly 50 percent in the decade ending in 2011, driven by swelling urban populations that have adopted parts of the throwaway Western lifestyle. Those same demographics account for a surge in power usage that has left the country chronically short of electricity and major cities prey to rolling blackouts.
One problem is the nature of trash in the poorer nations of Asia: it is soggier than that of Europe, the United States or Japan and doesn't easily catch fire. In India, the urban waste mix is nearly 47 percent water, according to a study by the Earth Engineering Center at Columbia University. Urbanites in poorer Asian countries cook more of their own food, while more affluent Westerners use more disposable (and flammable) plastic and paper. As a result, urban waste in the developed world is embedded with 10 megajoules of power per ton, while that of countries like India contains just 7.3 megajoules. 
The waste-to-energy effort lies at the intersection of two heavy industries, energy production and waste disposal, both of which are hampered by a thick layer of bureaucracy, turf battles among local, state and federal governments and demands for bribes by middlemen. These, along with hefty maintenance costs, make it difficult for a waste-to-energy project to open and stay profitable, according to Amiya Kumar Sahu, president of the National Solid Waste Association of India.
"So far, there is not a single plant in India which is a success story about waste to energy. Not a single one," Dr. Sahu added.
Another issue is incentives. China and Malaysia finance their waste-to-energy projects with a combination of feed-in-tariffs and tipping fees, giving trash entrepreneurs a reward for consuming trash and for producing power. This approach also gives companies like Mr. Sivaprasad's time to refine what can be a temperamental technology. The haphazard nature of junk means that an errant piece -- say, a shattered bottle -- can invade the gears and cause expensive delays.
Mr. Sivaprasad licensed his technique to Malaysia to build the Kajang waste-to-energy plant, which is outside Kuala Lumpur. It is administered solely by the central government and relies for income on a subsidy of 14 cents per kilowatt-hour produced and $13 per ton in tipping fees charged to the municipality of Kajang, whose trash feeds the plant. 
In India, by comparison, tipping fees are illegal and subsidies are only for construction. Beyond inviting corruption, this structure gives plant operators no motive to produce power once the plant is built.
Mr. Sivaprasad got interested in turning trash into energy when he visited the United States during the energy crisis in the early 1970's. By the 1980's he had built a prototype in Bangalore and received a patent, but it wasn't until the mid-1990's that Malaysia approached him about using his design. 
The Malaysian factory was completed in 2009 at a cost of $45 million and is about to undergo an expansion that will increase its output to 10 megawatts. A second plant of the same size may break ground soon. 
Mr. Sivaprasad's company, Core Competencies, has brought in Surendra Saxena, an expert in carbon sequestration from Florida International University, to control another waste stream: the carbon dioxide from its smokestacks. Mr. Saxena's involvement will help the company apply for a grant from the Trade and Development Agencyin the United States for the next project that Mr. Sivaprasad would like to build: a plant that would absorb 1,200 tons of trash a day and produce 10 megawatts of power in the southern Indian cities of Chennai or Bangalore. 
"Some improvement is coming in, and with American money I can clinch a project," he said. "This has taken a very long time."

HEADLINE: Vermont Lawmaker Moves to Repeal Protection for Drug Maker

BYLINE: ERIC LIPTON


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Peter Welch introduced legislation that would repeal language passed into law in early January that benefits a California-based biotechnology company, saying the deal "confirms the American public's worst suspicions of how Congress operates." 

 BODY:
A Vermont lawmaker on Wednesday introduced legislation that would repeal language passed into law in early January that benefits a California-based biotechnology company, saying the deal "confirms the American public's worst suspicions of how Congress operates." 
The bill introduced by Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, would eliminate the two-year delay in Medicare price restraints that Amgen, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., sought as part of the legislation to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. The provision protects certain oral drugs, including Amgen's Sensipar, from Medicare price controls, costing the federal government perhaps as much as $500 million in the coming two years.
This special protection, first detailed in The New York Times, was supported by the two top members of the Senate Finance Committee - Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah -- who are major recipients of campaign contributions from Amgen and its employees. 
Aides for the senators, and a spokeswoman for Amgen, said the delay in the price controls was necessary to protect kidney dialysis patients, because so many other changes are already taking place in the way Medicare covers this care. They dismissed any suggestion that the provision was related to political contributions, saying the change was good public policy.
"Patient access to necessary treatments would be compromised," Kelley Davenport, an Amgen spokeswoman , said in a written statement Wednesday, defending the provision and opposing any repeal.
But critics called the provision an unnecessary giveaway to Amgen.
"As the nation's economy teetered on the edge of a Congressional-created fiscal cliff, lobbyists for a private, for-profit company seized an opportunity to feed at the public trough," Mr. Welch said in a statement issued Wednesday announcing the plan to repeal the provision. "Without scrutiny or debate, the American taxpayer was stuck with the $500 million tab. This special interest provision should have stood on its own merits with an up or down vote. It's no wonder cockroaches and root canals are more popular than Congress."
Ms. Davenport defended the company's behind-the-scenes push to secure the provision, which Amgen has acknowledged should help sales of Sensipar.
"Our 2012 lobbying efforts and expenditures reflect Amgen's continued advocacy efforts to provide patient access to and advance the coverage of existing and future innovative products," she said in a statement last week.
Mr. Welch, the chief deputy whip for House Democrats, lined up three co-sponsors for the legislation, including one Republican, Richard Hanna, of New York. But the repeal of the provision has little chance of becoming law unless a much larger number of lawmakers sign on to the effort, and then move to attach the repeal to some other piece of related legislation moving through the House.

HEADLINE: Chipping Away at Poverty - an Exchange

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: A back-and-forth about SSI, my reporting and how best to make progress on poverty. 

 BODY:
Advocates of Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, have been steaming at a December column that I wrote from Kentucky, arguing that it unfairly maligns a program that is a lifeline to the disabled. Here's one criticism , here's another, and here are letters we published. I've tweeted some of the criticisms and responded with tweets, but I haven't really engaged in a broader discussion, so that's what I'd like to do here. First, you'll see below a memo from two attorneys from Community Legal Services in Philadelphia to the Times's Public Editor (they've agreed to make the memo public), and then (after their footnotes) a response by me to the points they raise.
To:From:Date:RE:
Margaret Sullivan, Public Editor, The New York Times
Jonathan Stein, General Counsel, and Rebecca Vallas, Staff Attorney/Policy Advocate, Community Legal Services, Inc. Philadelphia
PUB-DATE: January 14, 2013
Nicholas Kristof's Column, "Profiting From a Child's Illiteracy," Sunday The New York Times, Dec. 7, 2012 
The recent column by Nicholas Kristof on the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for children manifests serious problems in journalistic rigor, accuracy and professionalism, problems that warrant independent scrutiny by The Times's Public Editor. The SSI program has a history of problematic media coverage that has been exploited by politicians to the great detriment of low income, disabled children and their families.
The allegation of local eastern Kentucky parental behavior that Mr. Kristof assumed to be true-and upon which he based a call to Congress to defund the national SSI program-is extraordinarily similar to unfounded allegations also originating in the poor, rural South, in an earlier round of SSI child disability media frenzy. Back in the mid 1990s, it was erroneously asserted that parents "coached" their children to act retarded or dumb to get SSI.[1] Well over 100,000 disabled children were terminated from the SSI program after Congress adopted major eligibility restrictions based on these untrue press reports. More recently, House Republicans passed two Budget Resolutions for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, that were not adopted by the Senate, that would have cut respectively $1.5 billion and $3.5 billion from the SSI childhood program after another media attack that was fully refuted by SSA and others.
The following are our specific concerns with the column by Mr. Kristof:
 1. "Moms and dads fear that if kids learn to read, they are less likely to qualify for a monthly [SSI] check ." " 'The kids get taken out of the program because the parents are going to lose the [SSI] check,' said Billie Oaks, who runs a literacy program in Breathitt County [KY] ." 
The Breathitt County, Kentucky parental behavior that Mr. Kristof assumed to be true, is not based on convincing facts. Mr. Kristof, making this allegation the lead and theme of his column, appears not to have talked to any Kentucky parent who possessed this "fear," nor identified one person who took a child out of a literacy program because of their misperception that doing so would aid in maintaining the child's SSI eligibility. Mr. Kristof relies solely on the report of one Ms. Oaks. He assumes the accuracy of her assertion, and jumps to sweeping generalizations.
Mr. Kristof interviewed and quoted three local county school officials, none of whom spoke to this alleged phenomenon. They were, Ron Combs, Melanie Stevens, and Wayne Sizemore, the latter director of special education in Breathitt County. A co-writer of this memo, Jonathan Stein, spoke via phone with Mr. Sizemore, who confirmed his awareness of his personal knowledge of the SSI program, especially for children in special education, but stated to Mr. Stein that he neither knew nor had ever heard of local parents taking a child out of a literacy program to maintain SSI. 
The SSI program for poor, disabled children has a history of flawed media coverage. On multiple occasions, erroneous reports have been exploited by politicians to the great detriment of low income, disabled children and their families. Did Mr. Kristof ask Mr. Sizemore or any other local school officials whether they were aware of parents taking children out of a literacy program due to misperceptions about SSI eligibility? We do not understand why Mr. Kristof relied on a second or third-hand report from a single source.
Ms. Oaks' allegations are unfounded and erroneous. It appears upon investigation that Breathitt County has just one "literacy program," an in-school, volunteer grandparent program of 1 to 1 mentoring. It has nothing to do with eligibility for SSI. The in-home early intervention program of Save the Children, also Mr. Kristof's focus, and similar to what are called HANDS programs in Kentucky, are parenting programs, and are not considered literacy programs. Unrelated to SSI or literacy programs, local sources in Kentucky suggested to us cultural reasons that may cause parents in remote, rural areas such as Breathitt County, to be reluctant to permit strangers (such as the social workers from these programs) in their homes. If Mr. Kristof had more fully investigated the Oaks allegation, he might have uncovered some understandable parental behaviors having nothing to do with literacy or SSI.
 2. " 'One of the ways you get on this program is having problems in school,' notes Richard A. Burkhauser ." "'If you do better in school, you threaten the income of the parents. It's a terrible incentive.' " (Kristof quoting Burkhauser) 
Mr. Kristof doubly errs here. Firstly, illiteracy is not now and has never been a basis for qualifying for SSI disability benefits. Nowhere does Mr. Kristof seek out or cite a Social Security Administration source regarding the role that school academic performance may or may not play in qualifying for SSI child disability benefits, or make reference to any relevant SSI child disability law or policy.
Rather, he relied on a single source, Richard Burkhauser, to explain SSI eligibility policies for qualifying disabled children who are attending school. Mr. Kristof identifies Mr. Burkhauser as a "Cornell economist who recently wrote a book on disability programs," but omits mention of Mr. Burkhauser's more relevant and biased affiliation as a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI). [2] Mr. Burkhauser is hardly an impartial expert: he has testified repeatedly as a Republican witness at Congressional hearings aimed at cutting SSI and other disability programs.
A myriad of published federal policies show that Social Security has long required a medically documented mental or physical impairment that results in "marked and severe functional limitations," and that SSA takes a "whole child" approach looking at a wide variety of evidentiary sources, testing assessments, clinical evaluations, and reports from professionals treating or attending to the child.[3] Although SSA does consider the plethora of formal school evidence (grades, aptitude and achievement test scores, teacher and school psychologist reports and special education evaluations), SSA policy states explicitly that the agency never relies solely on these measures, but looks to other sources, including medical ones, as well as sources outside the school setting, to determine both initial and continuing disability. [4]
Mr. Kristof's reliance on a singular source with a known bias on this topic, to stand-in for actual law and policy, along with his unsubstantiated assumption (discussed above) regarding a pattern of parental misbehavior, appear to form the basis for his conclusion that the SSI program is a failed one deserving of major cuts. Notably, though Mr. Kristof spoke at length with a widely respected policy official and SSI expert at The Arc of the United States (formerly Assoc. of Retarded Citizens), who provided him with information about Social Security's actual SSI childhood disability policies (including those referenced here) that contradicted the statements of Mr. Burkhauser as well as Mr. Kristof's assumptions and conclusion, nowhere in his column does Mr. Kristof acknowledge that there might be another side to the issue as he presents it.
A journalist-particularly one who writes opinion columns-owes his readers the duty of fact-checking, especially when delving into policy recommendations for a program that serves as a vital lifeline for 1.3 million low-income disabled kids.
 3. " But now 55 percent of the disabilities [SSI] covers are fuzzier intellectual disabilities short of mental retardation, where the diagnosis is less clear-cut ." (Kristof) 
This assertion, not attributed to any source and thus adopted by Mr. Kristof as his own, reveals that Mr. Kristof failed to do his own independent and objective research. This erroneous assertion parrots the misconception by Mr. Burkhauser and friends that mental impairments are more subjective or indeterminate than mental retardation (MR, now called intellectual disability or ID) or physical disabilities. Social Security, in numerous published policies, makes clear that these other, non-MR mental disorders that "may" qualify a child with mental disorders for SSI, if severe enough and verified by the extensive medical documentation of a medical doctor or psychologist, are anything but "fuzzier" or "less clear-cut" than mental retardation. They include: Organic Mental Disorders; Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders; Major Depressive or Bi-Polar Disorders; Personality Disorders; Autism and other Developmental Disorders. [5]
Mr. Kristof implies that there must be something "illegitimate" about a disability program for children where the majority receiving benefits have mental disorders. Yet even minimal research would have revealed that the share of children with mental disorders receiving SSI mirrors the picture of childhood disability in the U.S. and worldwide. The World Health Organization, for example, reports that 67% of all young people with disabilities have one or more mental disorders, and that mental disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide.
4. " a full 8 percent of all low-income children-are now enrolled in S.S.I. as disabled, at an annual cost of more than $9 billion." (Kristof) 
This is an error of fact. The percentage of low-income children receiving SSI is half that reported by Mr. Kristof, who may have mistakenly divided the number of children on SSI by those children at or below the federal poverty level, rather than the (much larger) number of children at or below 200% of the poverty level (the widely accepted measure of "low-income"). This error is explained in detail by an analyst at the Center on Economic Policy Research, in a responsive column. [6]
The unmistakable implication of Mr. Kristof's use of the above (inaccurate) statistic is that this "full 8 percent" (in fact, 3 to 4 %) is a somehow "illegitimate" percentage, wasting considerable federal dollars. Is it fair and objective, beyond reporting the true percentage of 3 to 4 % (see note 6 below), to neglect any mention of the fact that just one in four children with disabilities in the U.S. receives SSI? And that the eligibility test for SSI children is so severe that nearly two out of three children who apply for SSI get turned down? [7]
5. "I'm no expert on domestic poverty." (Kristof)
"I hope that the budget negotiations in Washington may offer us a chance to take money from S.S.I. and invest in early childhood initiatives instead." (Kristof) 
What a tragedy it would be if Mr. Kristof's column, based as it is on erroneous assertions and inadequate reporting, would do great harm to an extraordinarily important and successful child disability income support program-and more importantly, the vulnerable children it serves. 
It is not histrionic to conjecture such a result given the misguided mid-1990's media reports described above, which led directly to major changes in the SSI program by Congress, causing over 100,000 disabled children to be terminated from the program. [8]
We grant that in journalism, opinion writers like Mr. Kristof, might have a bit more leeway to inject their opinion-whatever it might be-on matters that they address. But even opinion writers, whether they be columnists or editorial page writers, must nevertheless adhere to standards of fact-based, and reality-based conclusions. Opinion writers cannot distort or ignore the facts, or fail to exercise the journalistic rigor for the truth that one expects of any content published in The New York Times, the newspaper of record.
Mr. Kristof's column does not take into account the importance of SSI to the nearly 1.3 million children and families who receive benefits. [9] By his own admission, Mr. Kristof has almost no factual understanding of how the SSI program works. He relied upon uncorroborated sources (as discussed above), and leapt to the conclusion that undetermined amounts of the $9 billion annually going to the SSI children's program should be "taken" from this program.
Mr. Kristof's sole acknowledgment that the program might have even limited value is restricted to a single, qualified sentence: "There's no doubt that some families with seriously disabled children receive a lifeline from S.S.I." (emphasis added). 
By his wording, Mr. Kristof suggests that only a small minority of disabled children rely on the program as a "life-line." He fails to report or acknowledge that the SSI program helps families keep children at home and not in institutions; provides for the basic essential needs like food, clothing and shelter for children with severe disabilities; compensates for the lost wages of parents out of the labor force or who work fewer hours to care for a disabled child; meets known, additional costs of raising a disabled child; and enhances the disabled child's opportunity to lead a more independent and productive life in adulthood. [10]
Facts are critical, even in opinion columns, particularly when the economic security and well-being of so many severely disabled children hangs in the balance. [11]We thank you for considering these comments.
1. The "coaching" and parental manipulation allegations were debunked in a myriad of investigations from GAO, HHS IG, SSA and others, yet the hyped and erroneous media reports had done their damage in major cutbacks in the program in 1996.

6. As Shawn Fremsted at CEPR recently wrote: " '8% of poor kids get SSI': No, it's half that-less than 3.9% of low-income kids receive SSI. Kristof got 8% from a truth seeker affiliated with AEI who manufactured it by dividing the number of children receiving SSI (1.28 million in 2011) by the number of children living below the federal poverty line (16.1 million in 2011). This would be fine if SSI were limited to kids with incomes below the federal poverty line, but it's not. In fact, about half or more of the children receiving SSI have incomes above the federal poverty line, mostly between 100-200% of the poverty line. So, an accurate SSI participation statistic would use the number of low-income kids below 200% of the poverty line (32.7 million in 2011). Dividing the 1.28 million kids receiving SSI by the 32.7 million kids under 200 percent of poverty gets us 3.9% not 8%."

7. This data of incidence of childhood disabilities, among other facts about the program ignored by Mr. Kristof were sent to him by The Arc prior to publication. They appeared in a policy brief of the National Academy of Social Insurance, Supplemental Security Income for Children with Disabilities, which was co-authored by one of the writers of this memo, Rebecca Vallas, available at http://www.nasi.org/research/2012/supplemental-security-income-children-disabilities

10. These benefits of the program have long been established by experts and policy makers who, unlike Mr. Kristof, have studied the program. See J. Mashaw et al., Restructuring the SSI Disability Program for Children and Adolescents, Report of the Committee on Childhood Disability of the Disability Policy Panel of the National Academy of Social Insurance (Washington, DC, 1996); National Commission on Childhood Disability, "Supplemental Security Income for Children with Disabilities: Report to Congress of the National Commission on Childhood Disability" (Washington, DC, 1995), http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/SSI/ChildhoodDisabilityReport.html; S. Parish et al., "Material Hardship in U.S. Families Raising Children with Disabilities," Exceptional Children, Vol. 75, No. 1 (2008): 71-92, and "Material Hardship in U.S. Families Raising Children with Disabilities: Research Summary and Policy Implications" (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2009). 
11. Another responsive column worth reviewing was published by Harold Pollack, a respected economist at the University of Chicago, who studies social policy and healthcare, available at http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/profiting-from-a-childs-illiteracy-nicholas-kristof-on-the-childhood-ssi-program-12/.
So now back to me, Nicholas Kristof. Let me go through Stein's and Vallas's ponts one by one. 
The first objection is that I jumped to conclusions based on one person's false assertion. But the suggestion that parents fear that if their kids learn to read they'll lose SSI benefits did not just come from Billie Oaks. This came up at a lunch discussion with a half-dozen local school officials and several in-state Save the Children representatives. Ron Combs, a principal, was the first person to raise it, as I recall, and then that led to a discussion in which one person after another chimed in. It was at that point that Billie Oaks commented in the way that I quoted her. Later I ran this by the local grassroots person in Breathitt County for Save the Children, who has lived there all her life, and she adamantly confirmed it. So did the superintendent of schools when I reached her separately. This was not one person, an outlier, but a consensus, and then the scholar I quote later confirmed that is how the incentives work. 
In all, I interviewed something like a dozen people in Kentucky, and several more in Washington and elsewhere. One may disagree with this column, but it was not materialized out of thin air; it was thoroughly reported. I also reached out to the most pro-SSI experts I could find, at ARC, to lay out what I had found and see if I was missing something, and then read reams of pro-SSI material they sent. They didn't really challenge my findings but rather emphasized their take that SSI helps a lot of kids who truly are in need. I'm sure that's true, as my column notes, but it doesn't allay concerns about poor incentives.
The memo writes that SSI has "a history of flawed media coverage." Another way of describing that is to say that it's a controversial program that has been the subject of frequent critical newspaper coverage, including in the Boston Globe and New York Times.
The second accusation is that I relied on a single source, and a biased one, to suggest that illiteracy helps in qualifying for SSI. On the contrary, this is something that I discussed at length with the pro-SSI advocates and spent a good dealing of time exploring on the SSI websites. And indeed, as the memo then states, the SSA does look at school grades and performance so that illiteracy is a factor - it's just not the only factor. I think we're actually in agreement that an illiterate child is going to be more likely to win SSI than a literate one.
As for the notion that I quoted a biased source, well, there are biases on all sides. I talked to people on all sides of this issue and quoted Burkhauser because I found him particularly knowledgeable and persuasive. After all, the whole point of a column is not to catalog the range of different views but to make an argument. And Burkhauser is a distinguished Cornell economist who has written a book on SSI and testified before Congress. One may disagree with him, but he is eminently qualified.
The third objection is that I say that while SSI originally covered mostly severe physical handicaps or mental retardation, now 55 percent of the disabilities it covers are "fuzzier intellectual disabilities short of mental retardation." The memo argues that these impairments aren't fuzzy.
I'm sorry, this runs against a long strain of discussion in the social sciences noting that while blindness or amputation is fairly straightforward, a reading disability or autism is not. SSI advocates may believe that they should be covered by SSI, but they are fuzzier to diagnose then a broken leg.
The fourth objection is that the proportion of low income children on SSI is misstated. The 8 percent figure appears on page 88 of Richard Burkhauser and Mary Daly's book, "The Declining Work and Welfare of People With Disabilities," figure 6.1, and he confirmed to me its accuracy before publication. I reached out to him and Daly after receiving this letter, and they again confirm (for somewhat complicated reasons that I won't summarize here) that they stand behind it.
The fifth objection is essentially that I should have embraced SSI instead of criticizing it, i.e. that I reached the wrong opinion. I appreciate the fervor of defenders of SSI, and I don't doubt their good will. I appreciate their passion on behalf of disabled kids in America. But I think they are on the wrong track if they're trying to overcome poverty, and the defense of SSI feels to me an echo of the defense of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC, a generation ago. At that time, defenders of AFDC insisted that it would be a calamity when President Clinton ended it as part of welfare reform. In fact, by almost every neutral account, that calamity did not come to pass, and those advocates were wrong. Likewise, a generation earlier, those same advocates were wrong when they denounced Daniel Patrick Moynihan's work on poverty. 
(In fairness, I don't think those attacking AFDC were proven right either. The end of AFDC essentially moved low income people from welfare to low-skilled dead-end jobs, and they remained trapped in poverty for the most part. Ending AFDC was quite successful in getting people off welfare without causing a disaster, but it was not a success at ending poverty.)
The stories I heard in Kentucky resonated with me because I'm from an area of rural Oregon with many of the same problems, and some of my high school buddies have similar issues with disability. The focus of that column from Kentucky was actually how early childhood interventions can break the cycles of poverty, and the need to invest in children - but invest in ways that make a difference to break these cycles and pathologies. SSI hasn't done that, and I don't know of any evidence that SSI for children reduces that person's likelihood of living in poverty as an adult. On the contrary, either 4 or 8 percent of poor kids are now supported by SSI (depending on whom you believe) and two-thirds of those children make the transition at age 18 to the adult disabled lists. Those kids, in other words, are streamlined to become disabled for the rest of their lives, almost guaranteeing them a hand-to-mouth existence.
Wouldn't we be better off limiting SSI to the most extreme and clearcut cases of disability, and then using the savings for early interventions so that those kids learn to read and can thrive in school? Early childhood education has shown enormous benefits in randomized control trials, so why wouldn't we be better off investing in those programs? Struggling children can use a helping hand early in life, in rural Oregon or in rural Appalachia or almost anywhere inbetween, while sending checks to parents in part based on the children's failing school performance does not seem to me the wisest and most cost-effective way to chip away at poverty.
But, again, my central point is not hostility for SSI, which I acknowledge is a lifeline for some needy families. It's that we should transform our anti-poverty programs so that they are based on evidence-based initiatives that will actually create social mobility and move people up the escalator of life.

HEADLINE: Kashkari, Onetime $700 Billion Man at Treasury, Weighs Political Bid

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Neel Kashkari, the former Bush administration official who oversaw the Treasury Department's sweeping bank rescue plan during the financial crisis, is leaving Pimco to consider running for office in his adopted home state of California. 

 BODY:
More than four years after the financial crisis, one of the top figures behind the Bush administration's sweeping rescue plan is considering a return to government service.
Neel T. Kashkari, who was the initial overseer of the Treasury Department's bank bailout program, told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he was planning to leave his post at Pimco to weigh running for office. In a statement, he confirmed those plans. 
"As much as I have enjoyed my time at Pimco, I feel an obligation and a desire to serve my community through public service," Mr. Kashkari said in the statement. "My time at the Department of the Treasury was the most rewarding professional experience of my life and I want to find ways to continue to serve my fellow citizens in some capacity."
Staying true to his roots, he would run as a Republican -- even in overwhelmingly Democratic California. (Pimco's headquarters, however, are in Newport Beach, Calif., an oasis of conservative politics in the largely liberal state.)
By Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Kashkari had created a Web page emphasizing his core concerns, including the state economy and education. He writes on his site:
California has so many strengths - a vibrant, diverse, hardworking population, world-class universities, unparalleled natural resources and beauty - it is up to us to unlock its potential and fulfill the dreams of all of our people. Our government must work for all Californians.
I am reaching out to leaders in communities across California to hear their ideas, share my own, and explore how I can best affect positive change in our state. After decades of benign neglect, I believe it is our duty to finally have an honest discussion about these issues and take bold action to help all Californians succeed.
Running for office would take Mr. Kashkari into perhaps his most public role since the financial crisis, when he gained attention for his role as the Treasury Department's interim assistant secretary for financial stability. A former Goldman Sachs employee, he was only 35 at the time, with six years of experience in finance and government. He was put in charge of the taxpayer-financed lifeline known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, earning him the nickname the $700 Billion Man, after the size of the extensive bailout.
Mr. Kashkari left the Treasury Department in 2009 to join Pimco, formally the Pacific Investment Management Company, tasked with building the bond investor's nascent stock-fund offerings. 
It was something of a return home, because Mr. Kashkari, an Ohio native, moved to California in 1997 to work as an engineer for TRW. He later attended business school and joined Goldman, where he worked as an investment banker in Silicon Valley who was known for his bald head and steady demeanor. It was at that firm that Mr. Kashkari became acquainted with Henry M. Paulson Jr., then Goldman's chief executive.
When Mr. Paulson became Treasury secretary in 2006, Mr. Kashkari reached out to ask about joining the government. He became a lieutenant to Mr. Paulson, and co-wrote a doomsday bank rescue proposal, entitled "Break the Glass," that formed the basis of what became TARP.

HEADLINE: Why A.I.G. Did Not Sue the Government

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A court document released on Wednesday offers a lens into why A.I.G. did not join a lawsuit against the same government agencies that bailed it out during the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
When American International Group's directors met this month to consider joining a lawsuit against the same federal agencies that rescued it with a $182 billion financial crisis bailout, they received a stark warning from their lawyers. One lawyer said that the lawsuit had only a 20 percent chance of succeeding, according to a document released on Wednesday. 
At the time, A.I.G. was weighing whether to join a suit filed by A.I.G.'s former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, and the firm he now runs, Starr International. The case, brought on behalf of fellow shareholders, was based on the argument that A.I.G. investors lost tens of billions of dollars when the government attached onerous terms to the bailout. 
But A.I.G.'s lawyers were skeptical, noting that the long odds were not the only reason to steer clear of the case. Even if the $25 billion lawsuit against the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York succeeds, one lawyer pointed out, it could damage A.I.G.'s reputation. 
Citing recent negative media coverage about the board's deliberations, the directors agreed. The lawsuit, they worried, "threatened to destroy much of the good work that A.I.G. and its employees had done rebuilding A.I.G. and its name and reputation" after the bailout, according to a letter by Paul Curnin, the lawyer who advised A.I.G.
The letter, sent to Mr. Greenberg's lawyers, offer a lens into A.I.G.'s decision-making process over two days in early January. After discussion, directors unanimously voted to avoid the lawsuit. 
A public uproar erupted after The New York Times reported that the company was weighing whether to join the case. Lawmakers slammed the company for even considering the case. 
The government argued that Mr. Greenberg's claims were frivolous, as the company's only alternative was bankruptcy. 
The directors met on Jan. 8 with Mr. Curnin, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who outlined his concerns about the case. While the board had a duty to its shareholders to consider the case, Mr. Curnin noted that "Starr's claim had a low likelihood of success on the merits." He reached the conclusion, he said, after hiring outside legal experts to study the case. 
Both sides then made a final pitch to the directors at a Jan. 9 board meeting. The directors gathered to hear presentations from Mr. Greenberg's lawyer and senior officials from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
In the middle of their deliberations, the directors learned that at least one state insurance regulator had called to talk the company out of joining the case, according to the letter filed on Wednesday. 
Ultimately, the directors sided with the government. "A deal is a deal," they said, according to the letter.

HEADLINE: Further Thoughts on Assessing Regulatory Costs and Benefits

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: A study of costs imposed by federal regulation suggests they are increasing more quickly than taxes, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 2/7/13 | Updated to clarify counting methods in the study. 
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
A new study shows that the impact of federal government regulation might be even more significant than that of federal taxation. 
I recently wrote about the need for a federal regulation budget, explaining how private-sector activities to comply with regulation do not appear in the official federal budget, while private-sector interactions with tax and spending programs do, in terms of the amount of money they pay or receive. I also pointed to a few first steps to quantifying the amount of regulation.
Last week Sam Batkins of the American Action Forum, which describes itself as "a forward-looking policy institute dedicated to keeping America strong, free and prosperous," released a kind of federal regulatory budget for each of the last several years.
The budgets began with the Federal Register, a daily journal of laws passed by Congress, executive orders and federal government agency reports. Government agencies are often required to estimate private-sector costs of complying with those regulations, and Mr. Batkins aggregated those costs (the federal Office of Management and Budget is obligated to conduct a related analysis on a subset of regulations, as you can see in one of its reports).
As a daily journal, the Federal Register contains federal government activity during the year, which makes it different from, say, the federal budget for taxes. Much of the taxes paid in 2012, for example, were collected pursuant to laws and Internal Revenue Service rules promulgated in previous years, at which times they would have appeared in the Federal Register.
In other words, the 2012 Federal Register might be interpreted as additions and subtractions to the inventory of federal regulations as they stood at the end of 2011, rather than the total amount of regulation faced by the private sector during 2012. Mr. Batkins found that new and proposed regulations cost $236 billion in terms of compliance, while regulations rescinded during the year reduced compliance costs by $2.5 billion.
He found that more compliance costs were added in 2012 than in any of the other several years in his study. (The $236 billion in 2012 costs includes $216 billion from rules made final that year; some of that figure may also have been counted in previous years as the cost of proposed rules.) 
Just as a government revenue budget should not be interpreted as net costs because the revenue makes beneficial spending possible, Mr. Batkins's regulatory costs should not be interpreted as net costs because the regulations are thought to create benefits, too.
Another difficulty with estimates from the Federal Register is that new regulations may partly replace old ones (even though the old ones may technically remain on the books), so one might want to subtract the previous compliance costs of obsolete regulations from Mr. Batkins's estimate to arrive at the total increase in compliance costs from, say, 2011 to 2012.
Other costs in Mr. Batkins's study are those imposed on state and local governments, which are real costs but largely result in higher taxes for state and local taxpayers. That means Mr. Batkins's total is really a combination of tax costs and regulatory costs (equivalently, if one were to add tax revenue to Mr. Batkins's compliance costs, the total would involve some double-counting).
A nice feature of Mr. Batkins's study, and one it holds in common with a budget for taxes and spending, is that it can be examined by type. He finds that "commodities and securities" was one of the largest categories of new compliance costs, largely because of the implementation of Dodd-Frank regulations. Environmental regulations were another large category.
The results show that, for good or for bad, the costs of complying with federal regulations are probably accumulating more rapidly than taxes are.

HEADLINE: Can Republicans Change Their Spots?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The alliance of business interests and social conservatism may no longer be politically viable. 

 BODY:
If the Republican Party were a profit-seeking corporation, the current management would be tossed.
A post-election study conducted Dec. 12 by Resurgent Republic, a conservative think tank, concluded that the market for right-wing ideologues is just not there anymore:
Republicans have run out of persuadable white voters. For the fifth time in the past six presidential elections, Republicans lost the popular vote. Trying to win a national election by gaining a larger and larger share of a smaller and smaller portion of the electorate is a losing political proposition.
Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, released findings on Jan. 16 from a Democracy Corp survey that echoed that conclusion:
The Republican Party brand has steeply eroded since Election Day. Half of all voters (51 percent) now give the Party a negative rating and a third rate the party very negatively (under 25 on our 100-point scale). 
Even more threatening to conservatives, according to Greenberg, "Strong majorities of voters view the Republican Party's positions on critical economic and social issues as extreme."
If you're a Republican, the evidence on the party's near-term prospects is pretty grim:
On a host of issues, the Republican Party is perceived as out of the mainstream:
Republicans traditionally defer to rank, but in 2016 the party will need a presidential candidate who understands his (or her) party's ideological and demographic liabilities and can pull it out of a nosedive - no small task. The last candidate to manage this feat? Bill Clinton.
An item that should go on the top of the priority list: dump the party's super PACs and the men and women who run them, including Karl Rove.
The monied wing of the Republican Party suffers from what political scientists call a "resource curse" - the same "paradox of plenty" that blocks the advancement of oil-rich countries in the Middle East and elsewhere. Too much cash flowing from big donors to super PACs and tax-exempt organizations is the Republican curse.
In the 2012 election, major Republican-leaning independent expenditure committees, including Restore Our Future and American Crossroads, spent $579 million, more than three times the $168 million spent by pro-Democratic groups like Priorities USA and the Service Employees International Union.
Despite losing, a network of favored Republican consultants and contractors emerged from the election richer than before: Mentzer Media Services, Inc. collected fees of $141 million; Crossroads Media LLC, $90.8 million; Target Enterprises, $15.2 million; Arena Communications, $12.8 million. For the Republican operatives running these companies, 2012 was hardly a defeat. It was a business bonanza.
William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, wasn't happy after last year's presidential election and not just because of the results:
Reading about some conservative organizations and Republican campaigns these days, one is reminded of Eric Hoffer's remark, "Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket." It may be that major parts of American conservatism have become such a racket that a kind of refounding of the movement as a cause is necessary. A reinvigoration of the Republican Party also seems desirable, based on a new generation of leaders, perhaps coming [#x200b]- [#x200b]as did Ike and Reagan[#x200b] - [#x200b]from outside the normal channels.
Three presidential campaigns earlier, Kristol and David Brooks (who was then a senior editor for The Weekly Standard) were convinced that the McCain 2000 campaign for president offered a "refounding." Kristol and Brooks wrote:
The two great Republican general-election victories of the recent past grew out of intraparty insurrections. In 1980, Ronald Reagan, fresh from challenging a sitting Republican president in 1976, ran against a party establishment represented in various ways by Howard Baker, George Bush, and John Connally. A decade later, Newt Gingrich led an insurrection, first against the Bush budget deal and then against Bob Michel and the Republican congressional establishment, which culminated in the Republican landslide of 1994. Now we are witnessing a third insurrection. John McCain is taking on the Republican establishment. In New Hampshire, he crushed it.
In practice, the McCain insurgency in 2000 was short-lived, posing a serious threat to George W. Bush for less than three weeks - from the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, 2000, to the South Carolina contest on Feb. 19. The brief life of the McCain campaign suggests that future reform efforts will face intense hostility.
I asked Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia how parties can change direction after defeat. Sabato responded by e-mail:
The hardest thing for a party to do is to make painful choices that require a break-up within the old coalition in order to create a new, more competitive coalition. Usually, only repeated losses -being hit over the head with a two-by-four - will motivate a party to try something truly different.
After the disastrous 1964 presidential bid of Barry Goldwater, Sabato pointed out, Richard Nixon and others
grasped that the old moderate-liberal Republican establishment was history. J.F.K. and L.B.J. had converted African-Americans almost wholly, and white liberals too, with the New Frontier-Great Society and civil rights. What was left? Homeless Southern conservatives, who gravitated toward the G.O.P. and pushed out of power the congressional and gubernatorial moderates. The liberal G.O.P. wing had to die to make way for a much larger trove of conservative Southern votes.
At the moment, reactionary forces have a death grip on the Republican Party, and their power has been cemented by the party's institutionalization of closed primaries and caucuses (neither independents nor Democrats can participate) in more than half the states.
Republican opponents of change also hold on to the hope that the American economy will be mired in a period of slow growth, damaging to whichever party is in power. The premise of this strategy is that hard-pressed voters will turn on the Democrats.
The rate of growth since the 2007-8 collapse has been about half the average rate in past post-recession periods. Take a look at this chart from the Congressional Budget Office:
Still, for Republicans to gamble on a listless economy is inherently risky. Jan Hatzius, chief economist for global investment research at Goldman Sachs, argues that in economic terms, "2013 might feel a little friendlier than 2012," picking up steam after the Obama administration and Congress resolve their fiscal and budgetary disputes.
Favorable reports on housing and employment last week boosted the stock market as well as Obama's approval ratings, which on Jan. 17 stood at 52 percent, among his highest since early 2009.
The major factor encouraging Republican inertia is that the party's setbacks have not reached the crisis stage; it still controls the House 233 to 200 (there are two current vacancies).
That majority rests on the weak reed of gerrymandering, however, and on the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban areas. Democratic House candidates actually won the popular vote by one million more votes than Republicans, 56 million to 55 million.
In North Carolina, Bloomberg news found that Democrats won 2.22 million votes to 2.14 million cast for Republican candidates, but Republicans won 9 of the state's 13 House seats. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Democrats won 2.7 million votes to the Republicans' 2.6 million, but Democrats ended up with only 5 of the state's 18 districts.
The fast-approaching budget and sequestration fights have created a dilemma for Republican House leaders. If the party backs its conservative wing and allows the country to go into default later this year or submits to the draconian cuts mandated by sequestration, Republicans in swing districts could turn the House over to Democrats in 2014. If Republicans go in the opposite direction and compromise, significant numbers of House members will face primary challenges from the right.
With more and more Republicans aware that their party is on the ropes, how will its core constituencies respond, especially the Christian right and the Tea Party, which appear likely to lose power in an intra-party realignment? Will they passively accept diminished influence or will they lash out against their fellow Republicans?
If the conservative movement continues on its downward trajectory, the American business community, which has the most to lose from Republican failure, will be the key force arguing for moderation.
The problem that faces business leaders pressing for reform is not just the normal reluctance of a political party to change. Instead, it is the fact that much of the Republican electorate, as presently constructed, is profoundly committed - morally and ideologically - to "traditional values." You're asking groups of people to change who were brought together by their resistance to change. Their opposition to change is why they are Republicans.
The right coalition includes a subset of conservatives determined to preserve white hegemony. Add to that social conservatives who oppose both the women's rights and gay rights movements, and the religiously observant who are dead set against burgeoning secularism and what they see as the erosion of faith in public life.
These voters see the breakneck speed with which big business alters familiar patterns of life - innovation, but also joblessness, foreclosure and broken communities - as laying waste to much they hold dear. Business - that is, capitalism - drives a "perennial gale of creative destruction," as the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously put it. This gale, by definition, is anti-conservative.
Survey data reveals the profound resistance on the right to cultural disruption. Poll after poll shows that Republicans believe politicians should stand firmly against compromising core principles, by much higher margins than either Democrats or independents.
An indirect but important reflection of partisan attitudes to change is visible in the higher percentage of Republicans, 58 percent, who believe in creationism - defined in this survey as the belief that God created human beings in their present form within the last 10,000 years - than Democrats, 41 percent, and independents, 39 percent.
In effect, for many cultural and social conservatives, being a Republican is not just an allegiance to one of two major political parties but a deeply held belief system, an ideology with a strong religious core.
The Tea Party and the Christian Coalition exist in an inevitably fraught alliance with high finance, the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable.
The center-right coalition, in fact, needs more than new management. Over time, its leadership and candidates face the task of breaking up irreconcilable factions and merging the most viable parts with new constituencies, including suburbanites angry over rising tax burdens and increasingly affluent Hispanic and Asian voters.
Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at M.I.T. who studies the evolution of American parties, responded by email to my query about partisan restructuring. Republicans, he said,
need to figure out what the settled parts of American politics are these days - settled matters that they, in their heart of hearts would like to change, but which they agree not to change. That probably includes a much more tolerant society and a dedication to a certain level of social insurance as an obligation embraced by the federal government. The Tea Party leaders won't be able to do that, unless they change their spots thoroughly.
The success of the Republican Party in rural areas, exurbs and in the South has come at a cost. Socially conservative voters will resist changing their spots. When, and if, Republican leaders determine that the demands of these voters for "massive resistance" to abortion, contraception and immigration are futile, they will have to decide whether to cut them loose. No matter what happens, social conservatives are unlikely to become Democrats. It may not be too long before they find themselves with a choice of their own: withdraw from party politics or hold their noses and stick with the Republicans.

HEADLINE: Guest Lesson | Recycling as a Focus for Project-Based Learning

BYLINE: SUZIE BOSS


HIGHLIGHT: In this post, the third in a series, Ms. Boss considers the many ways in which a recycling project can cross disciplines, be personally relevant to young people, heighten awareness about bigger issues and solve real-world problems. 

 BODY:
 This is the third post in a series in which the education writer Suzie Boss suggests ways to use The New York Times Fixes blog and other resources as inspiration for designing real-world projects for schools. 
In her first post,"For Authentic Learning, Start With Real Problems," Ms. Boss explains the concept of project-based learning and suggests ways in which this strategy can work with recent issues in the news. Her second, published near Thanksgiving, invites teachers and students to "think critically about food in a season of plenty." In this post, Ms. Boss considers the many ways in which a recycling project can cross disciplines, be personally relevant to young people, heighten awareness about bigger issues and solve real-world problems.
 Challenge Students to Lead the Way on Recycling 
Citizens in my hometown, Portland, Ore., are enthusiastic recyclers. Instead of putting out the trash in messy barrels, we take part in a weekly exercise of sorting our debris into color-coded bins for glass, paper, plastics, and even compostable food scraps. (A skit on the show Portlandia even mocks this civic habit: "Now there's a bin for everything. Cups: periwinkle. Lipstick lids: rose.") 
Despite these efforts, Portlanders recycle only a little more than 60 percent of residential waste. That's about double the national average for municipal solid waste recycling, but apparently we're all missing a big opportunity by not recycling more. 
In a Fixes column, David Bornstein explains that improving recycling rates in the United States could create 1.5 million new jobs, improve air quality, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Recycling seems so simple, he adds, most of us assume we're already experts: 
Don't we already do that? We think we do, but most of the time, we don't. Nationally, only about a third of municipal solid waste is recycled. (In New York City, it's 15 percent.) And, even when Americans make the effort, we frequently make mistakes that contaminate recyclables - throwing that plate of spaghetti in with those newspapers - so that contents of recycling bins become un-reusable and end up in landfills.
Recycling should be easy enough for students to do, so why not challenge them to help make this a more widespread habit? By using recycling as the focus for project-based learning, you can put students in the role of real-world problem solvers. 
 Start With a Plan 
The first post in this series,"For Authentic Learning, Start with Real Problems," described the basic framework of project-based learning and included resources for project planning. 
In a nutshell, P.B.L. starts with an open-ended question that grabs students' interest. Students learn important academic content as they pursue investigations and brainstorm possible solutions. Then, they apply their learning in creative ways. At the end of a project, students typically produce something, demonstrate or perform something, advocate for a policy or solution, or teach something to others, honing their communication skills in the process. 
 Is Recycling P.B.L.-Worthy? 
As the starting point for an inquiry project, let's consider what recycling has to offer. 
The topic is accessible - right under our noses, in fact. Figuring out how to reduce society's trash is an issue that crosses disciplines, spilling into everything from estimation and measurement (math, economics) to behavioral change (psychology) to product innovation (science, technology, and design) to systems thinking (almost everything). 
Although students may not realize it, recycling affects them and their world in all kinds of ways, from family finances and economic opportunities to neighborhood aesthetics and the arts. There should be no shortage of relevant, academically-rigorous questions for students to investigate, across grade levels and subject areas. 
So far, so good. 
One of the benefits of project-based learning is the heightened engagement that comes with the invitation for students to do something "real," and then share their results with an authentic audience. (Research summaries about the benefits of project-based learning, or P.B.L. are available at the Buck Institute of Education.) The flip side, of course, is that students have to care enough about the topic to drive their own learning. 
 Why Should Students Care? 
Before proceeding with a project, it's worth considering: How can you engage students in this topic? Why will they care? How can you get them interested by helping them see that it is personally relevant? How can you ensure that the project goes beyond the superficial and gets to deeper learning? 
As you start planning a project, make sure you challenge students to do something more meaningful than sorting trash - and make sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing. (As a recent article in the Business section asks, "Are we really doing anything with all this recycling besides feeling better about the stuff we buy?") 
Students can smell the difference between community service that involves clocking hours for menial tasks and authentic projects that put equal emphasis on service and learning. Read about the research behind service learning in "The Benefits of Volunteerism, if the Service Is Real" and"Does Service Learning Really Help?" The Learning Network also has a whole collection on teaching and learning through service.
 Consider the Three A's 
When I talk with teachers about designing projects that have a service-learning focus, I encourage them to consider three A's: Awareness, Advocacy and Action. Any one of these can be a worthy outcome for a service project. Let's take a closer look at each, along with sample project questions and resources to help you plan meaningful projects.
 Raise Awareness 
Awareness projects heighten students' understanding of an issue or problem. Once students develop expertise or insights by exploring a topic in depth, they tend to be motivated to inform others about what they have learned.
A sample driving question for an awareness project might ask students to investigate, Why mess with trash? Where could this lead? In a math project, students might use survey tools, measurement, estimation or data analysis to better understand the problems and opportunities associated with recycling. Their final products might be visual representations of data, like museum-style exhibits about the life span of various materials (like plastics that wind up in the ocean), or infographics that make the case for why we should step up recycling efforts. (For ideas about how to organize a project, see The Learning Network's "Teaching with Infographics: A Student Project Model.")
In a language arts context, a project might focus on using persuasive language in an awareness-raising campaign. Students could critically analyze the effectiveness of existing campaign slogans (like, "Reduce. Reuse. Recycle." Or, "Once is not enough."). They could develop their own slogans to engage a specific audience, like their school or larger community. Going further, they could integrate art and technology to launch a social media campaign that raises awareness or advances the work of an environmental group that they choose to support (requiring more critical thinking from students to compare various causes). 
Learning activities that you incorporate across the arc of the project will help students build background knowledge and develop the skills they need to be successful. As background, for example, high school students might read a nonfiction text like "Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash," an exploration of what happens to society's discards by the science writer Elizabeth Royte. 
To get a better picture of what happens to their community's discards, students could visit a community recycling center (like the Lower East Side Ecology Center), interview experts (like Ron Gonen, New York City's recycling "czar,") or talk with artists who use recycled materials for creative purposes (like those featured in this exhibit). 
 Advocate 
When students take on the role of advocates, they speak up for a cause or argue for a solution. A project involving advocacy challenges students to analyze issues from multiple perspectives, consider pros and cons, and make a convincing argument for their position. It's a chance for students to deepen and apply their critical-thinking skills, a goal of the Common Core State Standards. 
A driving question for an advocacy project might ask: How can we convince people to pitch in?
Where might this question lead? An advocacy project could challenge students to apply systems thinking by examining current recycling efforts in their school or larger community, analyze the gaps, and present arguments for improvements. 
Elementary school students might be motivated by seeing the pile of used lunch containers or food scraps that wind up in the garbage each day. One group might decide to investigate whether washable lunch trays would be greener than the throwaway trays used in their school cafeteria. That would involve defining what they mean by "greener," using measurable data, and exploring the costs and environmental considerations of alternatives before presenting their recommendations to school officials. Figuring out how to deal with food scraps could lead students to propose starting a food composting program, which might open a true can of worms for them to investigate. (See "Urban Composting: A New Can of Worms.") 
Third graders at Kolossi Primary School in Cyprus have become global advocates for recycling. Students under Maria Loizou Raouna, a teacher there, used technology tools for data gathering and analysis about what happens to their community's discards. After they persuaded their own community to institute a new recycling program, they connected with peers in several other countries to encourage similar practices. Their project was an award winner at the recent Microsoft Partners in Learning Global Forum in Prague. Listen to describe Raouna describe the project in this video: 
Taking a different approach, students might decide to investigate how experts persuade people to make behavioral changes. The science behind "nudging" people in an ethical direction is the focus of the Times article Students could apply expert insights to advancing their own advocacy efforts, like making the case for paperless classrooms. 
 Take Action 
Action projects give students the opportunity to put their proposed solutions to work. To get others involved in taking action, students may need to apply leadership skills along with environmental smarts. That's the case at Ben Franklin Elementary in Lawrenceville, N.J. Students from each grade act as "junior E.P.A. representatives," who work with teachers and school leaders to plan school greening activities. Read more about their continuing project in a 
The driving question for an action project might ask students: How can we reduce our school's carbon footprint? When students from Redmond High School in Washington State investigated that question, they wound up trimming their school utility budget by $40,000 annually, encouraging action steps like turning off lights, turning down heat, recycling and persuading teachers to carpool. Mike Town, an environmental science teacher, and others disseminated the project to K-12 schools nationally by founding the Cool School Challenge, now coordinated by the National Wildlife Foundation. 
Although the project teaches important academic content about data analysis and environmental engineering, Mr. Town told me the biggest surprise is how easy it is for students to make a measurable difference by learning to speak what he calls "Carbonese. You learn that every action has a carbon consequence." For more ideas about reducing your school's carbon footprint, see the Learning Network lesson plan "How Green is My School? Conducting an Energy Audit."
In his Fixes column, Mr. Bornstein describes the benefits of another seemingly simple strategy: standardizing labels for recycling. "It's only one piece in a complex puzzle," he writes, "but it's such a central piece that it seems amazing it's been overlooked for a generation." Students can take action to fix the labeling problem at their schools by taking advantage of the free labels from Recycle Across America being distributed by Eco-Schools USA.
 E-Waste Action 
The issue of e-waste - dealing with discarded electronics that contain toxins - offers another good topic for action projects. To make the topic relevant, you might start by asking students to find out what happens to their outdated mobile phones and other electronic castoffs. Investigating the global implications of e-waste would offer opportunities to integrate social studies and science. Students might become curious about government policy to address the issue, like New York's stricter rules on e-waste recycling. As background reading to understand the practical challenges of e-waste recycling, students might read"Responsible Recycling: My E-Waste Odyssey" and compare the writer's experience with their own e-waste sagas. 
After investigating the issue, students may decide to host an e-waste recycling program as an action project. To plan an event, they can consider the Electronic Waste Code of Ethics developed by the environmental educator Christopher Swain. 
 Where Else Might You Go With a Recycling Project? 
Depending on students' interests, projects could focus on specific issues like recycling plastics. How large is your school district's plastic footprint? Students could lead the charge to find out, using tools from the Plastic Disclosure Project.
As a project for an entire school, consider how students might take the lead on earning certification for your campus as a Green Ribbon School. 
Students can apply their innovative thinking skills to come up with creative reuse of materials. Inspire them with some real-world example, like playgrounds and running tracks made of recycled athletic shoes. How about avoiding waste altogether with edible food containers? (See Idea 29 in "32 Innovations That Will Change Your Tomorrow.") A design project that would incorporate science and language arts could ask students to develop prototypes and "pitches" for their own creative reuse ideas. Make the project more challenging by asking students to suggest alternatives for hard-to-recycle items, like used mattresses. 
Take advantage of free classroom resources from the global design firm IDEO to plan innovation projects. Design Thinking Toolkit for Educators is available as a free download.

HEADLINE: Obama Reboot

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
President Obama's Inaugural Address was an unapologetic, unequivocal progressive manifesto of domestic policies.
I needed that.
The president wasted no time on hollow talk about fixing a broken Washington or taking on the toxic tone in our politics.
He seemed to have come to -- and grown more comfortable with and accepting of -- the conclusion that many have always understood: that his very presence, his existence, his achievement is what far too many others find objectionable. 
He is the embodiment of their discomfort. He is the manifestation of their fear. He represents a current and future America -- more socially liberal, more ethnically diverse, more the offspring of unconventional families -- than they can accept.
He is generally effective, not troubled by scandal, pragmatic and patient. He's not perfect, but he is exceptional.
During his address, the president challenged us to examine our ideas of America, to see today in the context of yesterday, to rise on the winds of change and not be afraid of them.
He put change itself at the center of the message and talked about how American constants like equality and altruism and stewardship are not static but dynamic, forever in need of care and maintenance and updating and refitting.
As the president said:
''What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.''
The speech was ambitious and aimed for the history books and may well have found its mark.
No speech can do all things, but a good one does some things exceedingly well.
This speech eschewed seasonal issues -- economic ups and downs, international conflicts -- for the everlasting concepts.
He could have delivered a great speech with the emphasis inverted, and no one would have balked.
The economy is still sluggish. People are still anxious about their jobs, if indeed they have a job. It is unclear how, or if, we can get back to prerecession prosperity.
And the world keeps getting smaller and more hazardous. Europe remains in a precarious economic state. The Middle East remains a mess of volatility. And as we saw last week with the hostage crisis in Algeria, Islamic extremists seem to be broadening their influence in northern Africa.
And yet the president focused on America, the meaning of America, the promises and truisms of America, the aspirations of and challenges facing America. And he did so through a progressive lens, tying liberalism to America's historical idealism. He offered a liberal anchoring, that it is not a disavowing of American values but an affirmation of them.
In the president's words:
''We have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.''
And he went further, placing the gay rights movement in the context of the women's rights and civil rights movements:
''We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall ...''
He continued:
''Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.''
The most striking phrase in that passage, aside from the fact that it was included in an Inaugural Address at all, is ''the love we commit.'' In a time when so many conservatives talk ad nauseam about the differentiation between rights granted by God and those authored by governments, this phrase, the commission of love, the root of many religions, reframes gay rights as God-given rights like other human rights and therefore beyond the right of governments to restrict.
And that was only one of the things that made the speech special.
The president also acknowledged the value to our society of caring for the poorest and most vulnerable. He called on America to address climate change. And he took a sideswipe at those opposing any and all new gun regulations, saying,
''Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm.''
This was a great moment in progressive politics.
Unapologetic, defiant even, and true to the core values of our country.

HEADLINE: A Discomforting Trip to the Isle of Wealth

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
MID-JANUARY IN MANHATTAN, temperature somewhere around freezing, badly in need of an oasis: is there a better time to buy in to Tommy Bahama, the island-friendly lifestyle brand designed explicitly for beach vacations I've never taken?
I am a coward when it comes to these things -- the sand is hot, the sun is hot, the water is warm, the mood is cool. None of those agree with me, so when I do take an occasional day off, I end up either driving long roads listening to the radio, spending money in stores slightly different from the stores I usually spend money in, or staying up later than I usually stay up for less noble reasons. Relaxation is for chumps. 
Tommy Bahama is a place without judgment. Once in the front door, calm settles in right away thanks to lighting the intensity of July mornings and cabinetry made of pale-painted wood that reads as upscale beach cottage. This is a place where no one can do you any harm, least of all yourself.
Tommy Bahama is not as old as the islands but rather was founded 20 years ago by men who wanted to chill people out and make money for the privilege. That might explain why the first item you see as you walk in the door is an orange suede crepe-soled wingtip made by Alfred Sargent for Tommy Bahama, which costs $500. Or why sprinkled throughout the store are ''found'' vintage items like a vintage French bocce set in leather holster heavy on patina ($175) or a bottle opener with a wood handle that looks like a prison art project ($45).
Only the privileged can really relax, because relaxing is a privilege.
As is relaxing waistlines: I am a full size smaller in Tommy Bahama than in almost every other American clothing line, two sizes smaller than most Japanese lines. No exhaling titan wants to be reminded of his physical inflation.
Or maybe all the elastic is a cross promotion with the store's second-floor restaurant, where dinner reservations are recommended, though on the afternoon I stopped by there were plenty of tables free and the mood was soothing. Just next door to the store is the Marlin Bar, a low-key affiliated haunt that's one Paper magazine blurb away from becoming a counterintuitive hot spot.
Mr. Bahama would like every part of you to relax. There are pineapple cilantro and Maui mango candles for your nostrils and two men's fragrances -- Martinique and St. Bart's, the latter of which had some of the charm of lime soda -- for your skin. At one point, Best Coast was playing over the speakers -- ear massage.
And the clothes? Largely unbearable, in Halloween-costume cuts and in lazy color combinations (when they're not purposefully dull). They draw attention to the wearer and are advertisements for his ability not to care about what he's wearing. Maybe they are the mark of a true man.
But hey, if Reyn Spooner can have a revival, Tommy Bahama can't be far behind. I opted for full immersion, starting with a slightly translucent melon-colored linen-cotton shirt ($118) with cuffs that had already been rolled so tight it was as if someone knew I would try to undo them.
In the dressing room, I tried on that shirt with parachute-huge red pseudo-sweats ($62) that had both a mock-corduroy theme and recurring marlin icons, like a nursery school take on a pair of Polo country-club pants. The pants were cuffed high, as if to accommodate the clown shoes they were meant to be paired with.
You couldn't look more cozy if you didn't leave the bed in your fireplace-heated country home for a whole Sunday and just let your hair go whichever way it wanted while you were sipping camomile tea.
You couldn't look more cozy if you were in a pool of Kooshes. You couldn't look more cozy if you were obscenely wealthy.
This is an acceptable fashion choice on some island somewhere, a place where people look at you dressed so slovenly and think, that guy's on to something.
I THOUGHT PANTS with a button might be in order, so I slipped on a 100 percent linen pair the color of sandpaper ($98) with enough elastic in the waist to last me through three failed marriages. Matched with a grapefruit-colored short-sleeve shirt with a palm-tree motif ($118), I looked as if I were running late for a Kem video shoot.
Maybe the shirt was the problem. I'd eyed one that was tropical, but austere, with leaves of varying shades of blue spread loosely across a chalky white 100 percent silk shirt, like shadows of a Calder. I tried it on: huge, but handsome, a triumph. They didn't have my size in stock, which was a convenient excuse to not discover whether I had the courage to buy it, to be that chump.

HEADLINE: How to Get America Online

BYLINE: By SUSAN CRAWFORD. 
Susan Crawford, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, is the author of ''Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.''

 BODY:
ON Monday, President Obama said that during his second term, Americans would act together to ''build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores'' and that ''we cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries -- we must claim its promise.''
The president is right that digital communication networks -- especially high-capacity fiber networks reaching American homes and businesses -- can be a powerful economic engine. But we are far away from being able to realize that vision, even as we cede the advantage such technology offers to other countries. 
Although Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has challenged the country to build additional gigabit fiber networks -- about 100 times faster than most residential connections today -- his words won't advance our digital future unless they are backed up with the leadership necessary to enact pro-growth, pro-innovation and competition-enabling rules.
At the heart of the problem lie a few powerful companies with enormous influence over policy making. Both the wireless and wired markets for high-speed Internet access have become heavily concentrated, and neither is subject to substantial competition nor oversight. Companies like Time Warner Cable routinely get their way when they seek to prevent local officials from encouraging competition. At the federal level, Verizon Wireless is keeping the F.C.C. in court arguing over the scope of its regulatory powers -- a move that has undermined the agency's authority.
As a result, prices are too high and speeds too slow. A third of Americans opt not to buy high-speed Internet access at home, often because they can't afford it.
Incumbents like Comcast and Verizon Wireless (now cooperating in a joint marketing venture) claim that their market is characterized by robust competition. But where is the competition when 94 percent of new wired high-speed customers bought service from their local cable distributors during the third quarter of 2012? Not surprisingly, America lags behind almost every other industrialized country in high-speed access -- even France, the bête noir of American free-marketeers, has better and cheaper Internet access.
There's little question that our wired (Comcast and Time Warner Cable) and wireless (AT&T and Verizon Wireless) giants need to be reined in. We need reasonably priced, globally competitive, ubiquitous communications infrastructure so that Americans can compete and innovate.
To get there, the federal government needs to pursue three goals. First, it must remove barriers to investment in local fiber networks. Republican and Democratic mayors around the country are rightly jealous of the new, Google-built fiber network in Kansas City, Mo., which is luring start-ups from across the country. And yet in nearly 20 states, laws sponsored by incumbent network operators have raised barriers for cities wanting to foster competitive networks.
In response, Congress must act to restore local communities' right to self-determination by pre-empting these unfair and anticompetitive state laws. We must also create infrastructure banks that provide long-term, low-interest financing to support the initial costs of building these networks.
Second, the F.C.C. must make reasonably priced high-speed access available to everyone. In the 20th century, we made a commitment to provide universal telephone service to every American and to subsidize that utility service for our poor and rural neighbors. High-speed Internet access is now undisputedly the dominant communications technology of our era. We need to make sure that subsidies are available for competitive companies willing to extend world-class service to more Americans.
The F.C.C.'s Connect America Fund, which is supposed to promote such expansion, is mostly funneled back through existing communications companies. This isn't the way to encourage new wired network providers to enter local markets. Nor will voluntary programs run by local monopoly cable distributors like Comcast meet our country's needs.
Finally, the F.C.C. must foster more competition by changing the rules that keep the status quo in place. There is a raft of regulations and processes at the F.C.C. that incumbents wield to maintain their market power, including rules about access to programming and to telephone poles that favor existing providers. The agency has ample administrative power to fix these details and to gather the information it needs to develop and enforce effective policies.
We have allowed our affection for consolidation and profit-taking to shape our country's ability to compete on the global stage. Although today's communications networks should make it possible for anyone to create value, communications companies that control access in America have the ability to crush competition and innovation.
With a truly pro-competition agenda at the F.C.C., we could discover great reservoirs of increased productivity and new forms of making a living. Contrary to what giant companies like Comcast and Verizon would have us believe, communications regulation does not stymie entrepreneurial behavior. It unleashes human ingenuity.

HEADLINE: In Hollywood, Powder Puff Blues

BYLINE: By NICOLE LaPORTE

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The shrimp was piled high. Corks from bottles of pink Champagne were popping. And the setting -- the Hollywood Museum in the original Max Factor studio off Hollywood Boulevard -- gave the night an air of mildewy glamour.
But many of the hundreds of men and women who gathered on a night last November to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the makeup artists' and hairstylists' guild (a k a Local 706) were feeling less than bubbly as they milled around photographs of Marilyn Monroe before she was blond, and gowns from ''The Good Wife.''
''A lot of people here are out of work,'' said Jeffrey Fetzer, a hair and makeup artist, nibbling on a chocolate truffle dessert.
Robert Constant, another makeup artist, who was wearing owl-shaped glasses and a paisley print shirt, said: ''This isn't the job your mother wants for you, O.K.? It's a roller coaster.'' 
Now, in the thick of red-carpet season, much attention is paid to the supposedly alluring business of grooming stars on-screen and off. And indeed there was a time when sculpturing a star's hair into the perfect beach wave or contouring winglike cheekbones was a prized job. There was the proximity to A-list actors and actresses; the adrenaline-fueled commotion of a movie set or television show; and decent paychecks.
But many members of Local 706, who work on most of the major feature films, TV shows and theater productions here, find that it's a struggle to get by. Movies and television have been fleeing to tax-break locales like Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana; of the 23 new one-hour network dramas for the fall and midseason, only two were filmed in Los Angeles, an 80 percent drop from 2005.
Hourly rates have also taken a beating and can dip into the teens on low-budget productions, said Tommy Cole, a business representative for Local 706. As a result, many members ''work more for benefits than for wages,'' he said, and stylists are having to reinvent themselves as ''Johnny and Janes of all trades.''
''I recommend to some of our artists, please, find something that you can work on the side,'' Mr. Cole said. ''Have something to fall back on.''
Union members are heeding the advice.
''Yes, absolutely, oh my gosh,'' said Melanie Mills, a makeup artist who won an Emmy for her work on ''Dancing With the Stars,'' when asked if she did anything on the side. ''I run fashion shows, I'll do a wedding -- anything,'' Ms. Mills continued as she hugged a colleague and fellow Emmy winner, Nadege Schoenfeld. ''We just did a show called 'The Taste' with Anthony Bourdain. We love Anthony!''
''So sexy!'' cooed Ms. Schoenfeld.
(The women were less enthusiastic about Nigella Lawson, who is also on the cooking competition show that began its run on Tuesday, because, they said, Ms. Lawson brought her own makeup artist from London.)
But Ms. Mills's main extracurricular project is her makeup line, Gleam by Melanie Mills, which she said she operated ''out of my garage.''
''A lot of people create product lines on the side, trying to become a Bobbi Brown or a Laura Mercier,'' she said.
Kelly O'Leary, a 37-year-old makeup artist who has worked on ''True Blood,'' said she also modeled and did stunt work.
''You can't make enough, no,'' solely as a makeup artist, she said. ''I've even considered finishing my biology degree and pursuing something more stable.''
Things were not always this grim, said Mr. Cole, a former child actor and Mickey Mouse Club Mouseketeer who started as a makeup artist in 1965.
''I'd get on a job for a week, two weeks, I'd get three jobs offered while I was on the job,'' he said. ''And I'd give them to my friends or compadres who I knew would do a good job.''
He rattled off some of the famous faces he has powdered and plucked over the years: Cher (''Never a bad word; she worked with me''); Raquel Welch (''A beautiful lady''); and Barbara Walters (''I did her for four years. I traveled with her back in New York'').
Granted, there is still good money in primping celebrities for premieres and awards shows; for this, makeup artists and hairstylists do not need to be part of the union. And certain stars retain ''personals'' for rather comfortable salaries.
But even then, there is no such thing as job security. Scott Barnes, who was Jennifer Lopez's makeup artist for nearly a decade, has publicly discussed being fired when he was suspected of leaking gossip about the star. (He and Ms. Lopez have since reconciled.)
Mr. Constant stressed the importance of a good reputation.
''Are you honest?'' he asked. ''Are you reliable? Do you not make trouble in the trailer? Are you not telling stories? If you're reliable and you're good to be with, people are going to want to rehire you.''
And if you know your place.
''They're not your friend,'' Mr. Constant said, lowering his voice, of celebrities.
Sheryl Blum, a hairstylist, had this advice: ''You don't want to come across as too gregarious. It's not about us, it's about them. It's about the artist that's sitting in your chair.''
Ms. Blum, an industry veteran whose credits include ''The Hunger Games,'' said that she had no complaints when it came to finding work. ''I've done O.K.''
Michele Payne, a fellow hairstylist standing nearby, noted: ''That's because we work in groups, which helps. Like cliques.''
Ms. Blum and Ms. Payne had just finished doing the hair for background performers on ''Star Trek Into Darkness,'' which comes out this year. (Most of the main stars ''had their own people,'' Ms. Blum said.)
''We invented hairstyles,'' Ms. Payne said proudly.
They joked about one: ''a braid that comes right out of the top of the actress's head,'' Ms. Blum said. ''We did it with chopsticks.''
Ms. Payne mock-punched her friend on the arm. ''You're giving away our secrets!'' she said.

HEADLINE: When Australia Soared On Film

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
The Last New Wave, the title of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of the late-1970s resurgence of the Australian movie industry, might not sit well with everyone. What about Romania, you might ask, or Iran or South Korea?
But ''last'' in this case has a particular frame of reference: the time when new waves were all the rage in film, from French to Czech to American. The Australian reawakening came at the end of that stretch, and for a cohort of American filmgoers who are now in their 40s and early 50s it was the first of those national flowerings that could be experienced in real time.
So this 19-film series, which begins Friday with two of its strongest entries, Fred Schepisi's ''Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith'' (1978) and ''Devil's Playground'' (1976), will be strongly nostalgic for some of us, summoning a time when films like Gillian Armstrong's ''My Brilliant Career,'' Peter Weir's ''Picnic at Hanging Rock'' and Bruce Beresford's ''Getting of Wisdom'' dominated art-house screens and dorm-room conversations. 
It's also a chance to catch up. About half the selections are less familiar ones that most Americans probably missed at the time, from Philip Noyce's debut feature, the rough-and-tumble ''Backroads'' (1977), to Ken Hannam's sheep-station epic, ''Sunday Too Far Away'' (1975), some of which are unavailable online (by legal means) or as American-formatted DVDs.
The Australian revival, beginning in the early '70s with films like Nicolas Roeg's ''Walkabout'' (not in the festival) and Tim Burstall's raunchy comedy ''Alvin Purple,'' was not driven by ideology, either cinematic or cultural. After a fallow period of several decades when, for economic reasons, the country produced practically no feature films, the Australian government stepped in, subsidizing production and establishing a national film school whose first class included Mr. Noyce and Ms. Armstrong.
Just as important, the pent-up creative energies released by this infusion of public money meshed with a pool of technicians and actors who had considerable experience in Australian television, which had remained surprisingly robust while the country's film industry went dark.
The businesslike beginnings of the boom, which was at its height from the mid-'70s to the early '80s, probably help explain the films' popularity in the United States. What unites them more than anything else is their old-fashioned approach to storytelling, a straight-ahead narrative style that could be quite sophisticated in the hands of directors like Mr. Schepisi or Ms. Armstrong but didn't stray far from Hollywood norms. (The exception was Mr. Weir, whose more oblique style at the time contributed to the chic menace of ''Picnic at Hanging Rock.'')
The films also shared a vitality, a love of open spaces and a propensity for sudden violence and languorous sexuality that may have reminded Americans of their own new wave, the Hollywood-maverick period of the late 1960s and early '70s that had just about run its course. Movies like ''Backroads'' and Mr. Burstall's ''Petersen'' (1974), combining loose-jointed, turbulent stories, working-class protagonists and an acute consciousness of the politics of class and race, felt like those earlier American independents.
The film society's selections range widely in subject and period, from the Victorian-era stories of female artists like ''My Brilliant Career'' (from 1979, with its star performance by a young Judy Davis) and ''The Getting of Wisdom,'' to sprawling midcentury historical dramas like ''Sunday Not Too Far Away'' and Mr. Noyce's 1978 ''Newsfront,'' about newsreel photographers; to jittery contemporary tales of misdirected male energy like ''Backroads,'' ''Petersen'' and Michael Thornhill's ''FJ Holden'' (1977), an Australian answer to George Lucas's 1973 ''American Graffiti.''
But strong themes and motifs run through the series, beginning with the omnipresence of the sweeping Australian landscape as photographed by talented cinematographers like Donald McAlpine and Russell Boyd, who between them shot seven of the films in the series. Few of these films take place in cities; it's a cinema of countryside and suburb, and whether that was a choice or a response to a lack of studio spaces, the outdoor settings are defining, lush caldrons for tension and violence or drab rural prisons to be escaped.
Complementing this is a focus on cars, both as symbols of male pride and prerogative and as crucial possessions in a country where great distances separate small pockets of life. Motorized vehicles are central to ''Backroads'' (which even has an opening credit for the stolen 1962 Pontiac Parisienne that the two main characters take on a long and violent joy ride), ''The FJ Holden'' (named after a car) and the most famous, least typical film in the series, George Miller's postapocalyptic demolition derby ''Mad Max'' (1979).
The most noticeable thread linking the films, though, is their emphasis on questions of class and race, a quality that seems both eager -- as if a long-held desire to tackle such issues were finally being satisfied -- and matter of fact: What else would an Australian movie in the 1970s be about? Social mobility is the subject of films as disparate as ''Petersen,'' featuring Jack Thompson's casually moving performance as a former footballer trying to get his college degree, and ''The Getting of Wisdom,'' about a precocious country girl sent to a rigidly conformist boarding school in 1890s Melbourne.
And the question of the relationship between black and white, indigenous and colonizer, is nearly always present, whether as a background note or a central theme. It's at the heart of two of the series's most rewarding films, the minor but inventive ''Backroads'' and the great, shattering period drama ''Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith,'' both profoundly pessimistic takes on the possibility of understanding between aborigines and white Australians.
That ambivalence -- an avoidance of the purely happy ending -- is another thing that characterized the Australian new wave, and it gives the series a weight that compensates for some wide variations in quality. (Best bets: the Schepisi films, ''Backroads,'' ''Newsfront'' and the chilly ''My Brilliant Career'' for Ms. Davis's performance.) Some of those early directors would go on to make even better Australian films -- Ms. Armstrong's ''High Tide,'' Mr. Noyce's ''Rabbit-Proof Fence'' -- but the good ones mostly decamped for Hollywood, and the real future of Australian film would arrive in 1986 with the bewildering worldwide popularity of ''Crocodile Dundee.'' Since then the industry's main exports have been tinselly comedies (''Muriel's Wedding,'' ''The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'') and the bloated fantasies of Baz Luhrmann.
''The Last New Wave'' captures a moment of freedom and abundance that was over almost before we knew it.
''The Last New Wave'' runs Friday through next Thursday at the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, 144 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600, and the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5601; filmlinc .com.

HEADLINE: Indiana's Gambling Lock Loosened by Competition

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
HAMMOND, Ind. -- There is Las Vegas. There is Atlantic City. But when it comes to listing popular American gambling locations, another powerhouse often gets overlooked: Indiana.
The Hoosier State, better known for cornstalks than jackpots, has for years been considered one of the largest gambling states when it comes to casino revenue. Here in the northwest, less than an hour's drive from Chicago, where five floating casinos crowd the Lake Michigan shoreline, the industry has been thriving in what the American Gaming Association currently ranks the third largest commercial gambling market in the United States.
Since the mid-1990s, Indiana casinos have filled state coffers with more than $10 billion in taxes and have drawn millions of visitors across state borders to try their luck at Indiana slot machines. 
But Indiana's luck may soon be running out. Citing a shaky economy and the growing threats of casino expansion in the neighboring states of Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio, a state report predicted 2012 ''will be remembered as the relative calm before Indiana braces for the looming storm of interstate competition for gaming revenues.'' The state's incoming tax revenue from riverboat gambling alone is expected to dip by $73.6 million by 2015, a decrease of about 15 percent.
Admissions numbers in Indiana dropped after an Illinois casino opened in 2011. Even more competition could follow in Chicago as a debate continues over whether to allow casinos in the city and its south suburbs.
The same could happen if Kentucky approves casino gambling in the coming years. Last February, a ballot measure was proposed on the issue, but it died in the State Senate. Gov. Steven L. Beshear, a Democrat, has said he may try again.
But Hoosiers seem most frightened of what is happening in Ohio, which opened its first three casinos in 2012. The new competition has already been blamed for layoffs at Indiana casinos along the border. A fourth Ohio casino, the closest to Indiana, is opening in Cincinnati in March. A similar story has been playing out across the country: more states are pursuing casinos as an untapped revenue stream, diluting a market that early adopting states, like Indiana, once dominated freely and relied on financially.
''We have the rhinoceros by the tail,'' said Scott Pelath, the Democratic minority leader in the Indiana House of Representatives. ''Continuing to hold on is a necessity.''
Gambling contributes about 5 percent of total revenue to the state's general fund, the third biggest revenue source after income and sales taxes. ''Those are not dollars we can do without,'' Mr. Pelath said.
Indiana has outgambled its neighbors in this swath of the Midwest since its first casino opened in 1995. In those early years, riverboat casinos were forced to leave the shore while gambling took place. That requirement faded, along with the charade that permanently docked casinos had to look like boats at all -- though they are still required to be on water.
The sites now range from rundown riverboats to newly renovated venues like the Horseshoe in Hammond, which spent $500 million on upgrades in 2008 in anticipation of new competition from Illinois. Displaying crystal chandeliers and floating on a barge, it now hosts Word Series of Poker circuit events and has 24-hour shuttles to Chicago.
''We focus on controlling those things we can control,'' said Dan Nita, the general manager at Horseshoe. ''We wanted to raise the cost of entry to our competition, so new owners and operators would have to think twice before investing.''
The Horseshoe's owner, Caesars Entertainment, considers Hammond its second highest grossing location, next to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
Industry officials attribute the success of Indiana's 13 casinos, at least until now, to their ability to attract out-of-state visitors, which make up more than 50 percent of all admissions.
''It's become such a part of the fabric of this state,'' said Ed Feigenbaum, who runs Indiana Game Insight, a newsletter that tracks the state's casino industry. ''But the gravy train, if you've noticed, is starting to slow down considerably.''
The grim forecast has renewed a fierce debate among politicians in Indianapolis about how to keep the tax revenue and casino jobs from disappearing, with no easy solution in sight.
''Most observers will say Indiana will never regain the total numbers of dollars it was used to getting,'' said Ernest Yelton, executive director of the Indiana Gaming Commission. ''I think the goal, more realistically, is to minimize the amount of dollars that is going to be lost."
On Wednesday, state senators gathered at the Capitol for a committee hearing to debate a new bill that some legislators and industry leaders believe would help keep the industry viable in the years ahead. The plan would allow casinos to move inland and reduces taxes owed to the state, a proposed investment that would give the gambling facilities more flexibility and financial incentives to stay competitive, said State Senator Phil Boots, a Republican and sponsor of the bill.
But it is not without controversy. Some Assembly members in the Republican-dominated legislature are unlikely to support any form of gambling expansion in Indiana. Other critics point to an impact study released by a state agency this week estimating that Indiana could lose up to $230 million in tax revenue as a result of the proposed policies over the next two years, far exceeding the predicted losses if things stayed the same.
Still, the bill passed out of the Senate's public policy committee with unanimous support on Wednesday. It must be approved by an appropriations committee, where it is expected to meet some opposition in its current form, before it can be called for a floor vote.
''We have been a partner in this process,'' said Mike Smith, president of the Casino Association of Indiana, who backs the legislation. ''We need to give a little to make sure we don't lose a lot.''

HEADLINE: House Vote Sidesteps an Ultimatum on Debt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Avoiding an economic showdown with President Obama, the House on Wednesday passed legislation to eliminate the nation's statutory borrowing limit until May, without including the dollar-for-dollar spending cuts that Republicans once insisted would have to be part of any debt limit bill.
The 285-144 vote staved off an impasse that could have put the full faith and credit of the United States government into doubt and potentially set off an economic disaster. Instead, the next Republican showdown with the president will come in March, when the subject will be across-the-board spending cuts first and a possible government shutdown by the end of the month. 
''We know with certainty that a debt crisis is coming to America. It's not a question of if. It's a question of when,'' Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republicans' vice-presidential nominee last year and current Budget Committee chairman, said as he vowed to press ahead with deep spending cuts.
To give House Republicans a rationale for giving in on the debt ceiling after dropping demands for offsetting cuts, the House legislation included a provision that would withhold the pay of lawmakers in a chamber of Congress that fails to pass a budget blueprint by April 15.
That allowed House Republicans to turn a spotlight on Senate Democrats, who have not passed a detailed budget blueprint since 2009.
''It took one week in which their paychecks were on the line, and now the Senate is going to step up and do the right thing,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said after the vote.
Senate Democratic leaders shrugged off the dictate as an insignificant gimmick and claimed victory.
''The president stared down the Republicans. They blinked,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, thanked Speaker John A. Boehner for reversing course and said he would take up and pass the House bill without changes as soon as next week, possibly by unanimous consent. He said he would then move quickly on a budget plan for the first time since 2009.
''Democrats are eager to contrast our pro-growth, pro-middle-class budget priorities with the House Republicans' Ryan budget that would end Medicare as we know it, gut investments in jobs and programs middle-class families depend on, and cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations,'' said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee.
House Republicans appeared eager for that fight. For two years, the House has passed detailed but nonbinding budget plans that would cut domestic programs to levels not seen since World War II, enact changes to Medicare that would offer older people fixed subsidies to buy private health insurance, and mandate a much-simplified tax code. Democrats have criticized those plans, declined to produce an alternative, and instead demanded what they called a ''balanced approach'' to deficit reduction.
Now, Republicans said, the debate will be over numbers.
''We have a budget that's described as draconian, that decimates this program or that. They have a phrase, 'balanced approach,' '' said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina. ''I'm tired of debating against a phrase.''
The debt ceiling legislation -- devised with awareness of the constitutional hurdles imposed by the 27th Amendment on Congressional pay -- would impound lawmaker salaries until a budget is passed or the 113th Congress ends, whichever comes first. And it would not require the House and the Senate to come to a compromise on the two spending and tax blueprints, which are likely to be very different. That will be the really difficult task.
House Democratic leaders tried to persuade their members to vote against the deal, so as to force as many Republicans as possible to vote to do something most said they would never do: lift the debt ceiling. But 86 Democrats voted yes, more than enough to let 33 Republicans vote no without bringing the bill down and handing Republican leaders an embarrassing defeat.
House Republicans say punting the debt ceiling to May 18 is not so much a retreat as a ''re-sequencing'' of the coming budget showdowns. House Republicans now take for granted that the first deadline, March 1, will come and go, and $110 billion in across-the-board spending cuts to military and domestic programs -- known as a sequester -- will go into force.
''The sequester is going to go into effect on March 1 unless there are cuts and reforms that get us on a plan to balance the budget over the next 10 years. It's as simple as that,'' Mr. Boehner said.
The next real showdown will come by March 27, when the stopgap measure financing the government expires. Republicans have made clear that they are willing to let the government shut down at that time to force deep spending cuts or changes to Medicare and Social Security that would bring down deficits in the long run.
Such continuing brinkmanship brought a rebuke from Ms. Murray, who said Republicans were trying to have it both ways, forcing Senate Democrats to move forward in an orderly way with a budget plan by mid-April, but threatening the next budget crisis weeks before that.
The pay provision brought its own protests. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, called it ''institutionalized bribery,'' since it effectively says, do what Republicans want or do not get paid. That was why the nation passed the 27th Amendment, which says Congressional pay cannot be varied within a single Congress.

HEADLINE: Intent on Being First, Cuomo Used All Means To Enact Gun Limits

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was in his 39th floor office above Third Avenue in Manhattan, after meeting with corporate executives to ask for help lobbying Congress for federal Hurricane Sandy aid, when he heard the news: A gunman had opened fire in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., killing 20 children.
He called his counterpart in Connecticut, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, to offer condolences.
''I didn't even have the words,'' he said. ''It was incomprehensible.'' 
One month later, Mr. Cuomo claimed victory, stunning many observers with the speed and apparent ease with which he pushed a gun control package through a divided Legislature. The State Senate, controlled by a coalition of 30 Republicans and 6 Democrats, approved the package, which included a significant expansion of the state's assault weapons ban, on its first day in session; the Assembly, controlled by Democrats, followed suit the next day, and the governor signed the legislation into law.
The weeks between the mass shooting and the bill signing illustrated the classic Cuomo formula, honed over years in public life and refined during his first two years as governor. Eggs are broken, speed rules, an open process is sacrificed, and results are achieved -- sometimes triumphant, often jagged and imperfect. Before New York's new gun control law was even passed, lawmakers were acknowledging that they would have to pass a second measure to clean up some of its errors.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is often mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2016, had been determined that New York would be the first in the nation to respond to the school massacre. And he saw opportunity presented by change: the Senate, which had been controlled entirely by Republicans skeptical of new gun laws, now was governed by a coalition that included some urban Democrats who wanted gun control. The state's population was sympathetic too -- even on Long Island, a Republican stronghold but also a largely suburban region, haunted by memories of a 1993 shooting rampage on the Long Island Rail Road.
First, there were threats, delivered in phone calls or through intermediaries: He would seek to dissolve their fledgling coalition by pressuring his fellow Democrats to reunite; pummel recalcitrant Republican senators for months with a seven-figure advertising blitz backed by national groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; and campaign on Long Island, where 9 of the 30 Republican senators live, and across the state.
Then, there was the cajoling. Guns, he told the Republicans, were not the issue for them to take a stand on. He shared with them his internal polling data, which showed popular support for a tighter ban on assault weapons, even among gun owners.
There is a dispute over what exactly Mr. Cuomo then said to senior Republicans. A person with direct knowledge of the exchanges quoted Mr. Cuomo as saying: ''You think your record is good the last two cycles? Maybe you should listen to me? Maybe I should be your consultant!''
A senior Cuomo administration official denied that such statements had been made or that there was any contentiousness between the Democratic governor, seeking new gun laws, and the Republican Senate leadership, leery of such laws. But clearly, there was aggressive talk.
''He wanted to get this done, and he was push, push, push,'' said State Senator Thomas W. Libous of Binghamton, the chamber's second-ranking Republican and the governor's closest ally in the Republican caucus.
''Some people don't know how to take that,'' Mr. Libous added. ''I understand; sometimes I can be passionate too. Sometimes, when we want something, we push hard for it. The governor is trying to make his mark.''
Mr. Cuomo had been a longtime supporter of gun control, and after the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last summer, he instructed his aides to begin developing new gun control proposals. But he had done little publicly, other than making an occasional comment at a news conference, until Newtown.
''I think for me, like for people all across this country, that was it,'' the governor said in an interview last week. ''You said, 'Enough.' That was it. It's not an intellectual response; it was more emotional, visceral. Just, it was enough.''
Mr. Cuomo, who has three teenage daughters, said he could not help but think of them.
''Anyone who has a child remembers the first day they dropped the child off at school and they remember that feeling in the pit of their stomach when they were driving away, that little fear that they felt in their spine that said, 'You know, I'm leaving my child; God forbid something were to happen,' '' he recalled. ''This said you were right to have that anxiety, because your nightmare actually came true.''
The governor's aides worked with several advocacy groups, including the Brady Campaign in Washington, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco, to develop a package of measures that would be comprehensive but also politically achievable. They looked to other states; a provision in the new law to require mental health professionals to report possibly violent patients was similar to a recommendation by a task force created last year by Gov. Martin O'Malley and state legislators in Maryland.
For a time, Mr. Cuomo and his team were so eager to act that they contemplated calling the Legislature into special session in December. By the time a few dozen lawmakers had assembled in Albany the week before Christmas for an economic development meeting, negotiations were moving so rapidly that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, instructed his members not to leave the capital until they had called his office -- just in case a gun control deal was ready.
The Assembly was clearly ready to support new gun control, so Mr. Cuomo focused his lobbying on the Senate, where the outcome was less certain.
A few days after the shooting, the Senate Democrats had chosen a new leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Westchester County. Mr. Cuomo invited her to visit. When she arrived, he offered his congratulations and then turned to gun control. By the end of the session, Senator Stewart-Cousins had pledged that all 26 members of her caucus would support his effort.
Mr. Cuomo believed he could get the votes to pass a gun control measure in the Senate, but any doubt was erased by a Dec. 24 ambush in Webster, near Rochester, in which a lone gunman set fire to a car and his house, then killed two firefighters who responded.
''To the extent the Legislature needed any reinforcement, there was no question after Webster,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
He courted a newly elected senator, Simcha Felder, a Democrat from Brooklyn who had decided to align himself with the Republican caucus. And he sat down with the five Democrats whose Independent Democratic Conference had struck a power-sharing agreement with the Senate Republicans; afterward, their leader, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Bronx Democrat, told reporters he was squarely behind the governor's effort.
Even with the votes, Mr. Cuomo still had to ensure that the Senate Republican leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, would not try to prevent the bill from coming to the floor. Senator Skelos and his aides wanted to impose stiffer penalties on the use of illegal guns; extend and expand Kendra's Law, which empowers judges to order mentally ill patients to receive outpatient treatment; and soften some of the new provisions restricting assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Mr. Cuomo was open to the first two of those requests, and he also did not push the Legislature to approve microstamping, a controversial form of ballistics identification, which he had supported but which had been met with resistance by Republicans. In an effort to further mollify their conference, the Senate Republican leadership distributed to their members a one-page handout listing 15 ''rejected Democrat proposals,'' crediting themselves with rebuffing, among other things, a suggestion to confiscate guns now deemed assault weapons and limit gun purchases to one per month. ''Can buy unlimited number of guns,'' the senators were reassured.
The weekend after the Jan. 9 State of the State address, Mr. Cuomo and his allies received some help: A poll by Newsday and Siena College found that more than 7 in 10 residents on Long Island supported an expanded ban on assault weapons. Recalling the Newsday poll, Speaker Silver said, ''I think it may have sealed it.''
On the first full day of the Legislative session, the Senate Republicans met behind closed doors for several hours to discuss the measure, while gun-rights activists tried, futilely, to put the brakes on a deal. The head of the state's National Rifle Association affiliate, Thomas H. King, showed up at the office of the Senate Republicans; Mr. Skelos, he said later, would not see him.
Around 9 p.m., Senator Gregory R. Ball of Putnam County, a gun-rights advocate and avid trap shooter, emerged from the Republicans' private meeting with a defeated look. ''I don't think any lives will be saved today,'' he said. ''The only life that may have been helped is the political life of Andrew Cuomo running for president.''
Later, on his way to the floor, Mr. Skelos acknowledged that the gun issue was ''difficult for many to deal with,'' but he described the final bill as ''well balanced.'' He voted for it, as did all of his Long Island colleagues in the Senate who were present.

 BODY:
TOUGHER ENFORCEMENT Deutsche Bank has agreed to a settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over charges that the bank manipulated California's energy markets in 2010.
The agreement, announced late on Tuesday, includes a $1.5 million fine against Deutsche Bank, which also must surrender around $170,000 in profits related to the energy trading activity. 
The energy commission said in a statement that some of Deutsche Bank's employees had entered into a number of transactions in early 2010 that unfairly benefited the bank. The action is the latest effort to clamp down on market abuses by the commission, which oversees the oil, natural gas and electricity sectors. MARK SCOTT
SHORT BET FALTERS David Einhorn, below, the hedge fund manager who runs Greenlight Capital, had a setback in his short-selling position in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, as the stock rose during the fourth quarter, he said Tuesday in a letter to investors. The stock's 74 percent climb wiped out the position's profit in 2012, Mr. Einhorn said.
It was a rough three months for Greenlight over all, as a 4.9 percent loss in the quarter pared the yearly performance down to a gain of 7.9 percent.
Another notable stumble for Mr. Einhorn was his firm's long position in Apple, which lost its third-quarter gains at the end of the year. Greenlight's stake in Marvell Technology was the ''biggest loser'' of 2012, with the shares falling to $7.26 from $13.85, Mr. Einhorn said. WILLIAM ALDEN
DWINDLING LAWSUITS The number of federal class-action securities lawsuits filed in 2012 amounted to 152 cases, according to a new study by Cornerstone Research. That is well below the average of 193 suits in the previous 15 years as well as the 188 suits filed in 2011.
And that drop was consistent across a broad array of potential legal areas. Federal lawsuits filed over announced mergers, for example, fell by nearly a third in 2012 from 2011, to 13 cases. (The study's authors caution that the drop may be because plaintiffs are pursuing claims in state courts, rather than turning to the federal system.)
New lawsuits tied to the financial crisis disappeared for the first time, as the market turmoil of 2008 receded farther into the distance. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

HEADLINE: Suit Hints At Behavior By Bankers In Bubble

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj. David Pogue, whose State of the Art column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
On March 16, 2007, Morgan Stanley employees working on one of the toxic assets that helped blow up the world economy discussed what to name it. Among the team members' suggestions: "Subprime Meltdown," "Hitman," "Nuclear Holocaust" and "Mike Tyson's Punchout," as well a simple yet direct reference to a bag of excrement.
Ha ha. Those hilarious investment bankers.
Then they gave it its real name and sold it to a Chinese bank. 
We are never going to have a full understanding of what bad behavior bankers engaged in in the years leading up to the financial crisis. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have failed to hold big wrongdoers to account.
We are left with what scraps we can get from those private lawsuits lucky enough to get over the high hurdles for document discovery. A case brought in a New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan against Morgan Stanley by a Taiwanese bank, which bought a piece of the same deal the Chinese bank did, has cleared that bar.
The results are explosive. Hundreds of pages of internal Morgan Stanley documents, released publicly last week, shed much new light on what bankers knew at the height of the housing bubble and what they did with that secret knowledge.
The lawsuit concerns a $500 million collateralized debt obligation called Stack 2006-1, created in the first half of 2006. Collections of mortgage-backed securities, C.D.O.'s were at the heart of the financial crisis.
But the documents suggest a pattern of behavior larger than this one deal: people across the bank understood that the American housing market was in trouble. They took advantage of that knowledge to create and then bet against securities and then also to unload garbage investments on unsuspecting buyers.
Morgan Stanley doesn't see the narrative as the plaintiffs do. The firm is fighting the lawsuit, contending that the buyers were sophisticated clients and could have known what was going on in the subprime market. The C.D.O. documents disclosed, albeit obliquely, that Morgan Stanley might bet against the securities, a strategy known as shorting. The firm did not pick the assets going into the deal (though it was able to veto any assets). And any shorting of the deal was part of a larger array of trades, both long and short. Indeed, Morgan Stanley owned a big piece of Stack, in addition to its short bet.
Regarding the profane naming contest, Morgan Stanley said in a statement: "While the e-mail in question contains inappropriate language and reflects a poor attempt at humor, the Morgan Stanley employee who wrote it was responsible for documenting transactions. It was not his job or within his skill set to assess the state of the market or the credit quality of the transaction being discussed."
Philip Blumberg, the Morgan Stanley lawyer who composed most of the names, meet the underside of a bus, courtesy of your employer.
Another Morgan Stanley employee sent an e-mail that same morning, suggesting that the deal be called "Hitman." This might have been an attempt to manage up, because "Hitman" was the nickname of his boss, Jonathan Horowitz, who helped head the part of the group that oversaw mortgage-backed C.D.O.'s. Mr. Horowitz replied, "I like it."
Both Mr. Blumberg and Mr. Horowitz, now at JPMorgan, declined to comment through representatives at their banks.
In February 2006, Morgan Stanley began putting together the Stack C.D.O. According to an internal presentation, Stack "represents attractive business for Morgan Stanley."
Why? In addition to fees, another bullet point listed: "Ability to short up to $325MM of credits into the C.D.O." In other words, Morgan Stanley could - and did - sell assets to the Stack C.D.O., intending to profit if the securities backed by those assets declined. The bank put on a $170 million bet against Stack, even as it was selling it.
In the end, of the $500 million of assets backing the deal, $415 million ended up worthless.
"While investors and taxpayers all over the world continue to choke on Wall Street's toxic subprime products, to this day not a single major Wall Street executive has been held accountable for misconduct relating to those products," said Jason C. Davis, a lawyer at Robbins Geller who is representing the plaintiff in the lawsuit. "They are generally untouchable, but we are pleased that the court in this case is ordering Morgan Stanley to turn over damning evidence, so that the jury will get to see what Morgan Stanley really knew about the troubled nature of its supposedly 'higher-than-AAA' quality product."
Why might Morgan Stanley have bet against the deal? Did its traders develop a brilliant thesis by assessing the fundamentals of the housing market through careful analysis of the public data? The documents suggest something more troubling: bankers found out that the housing market was diseased from their colleagues down the hall.
Bankers were getting information from fellow employees conducting and receiving private assessments of the quality of the mortgages that the bank would purchase to back securities. These reports weren't available to the public. It would be crucial information for trading in securities backed by those kinds of mortgages.
In one e-mail from Oct. 21, 2005, a Morgan Stanley employee warned a banker that the mortgages Morgan Stanley was buying from loan originators were troubled. "The real issue is that the loan requests do not make sense," he wrote. As an example, he cited "a borrower that makes $12K a month as an operation manger (sic) of an unknown company - after research on my part I reveal it is a tarot reading house. Compound these issues with the fact that we are seeing what I would call a lot of this type of profile."
In another e-mail from March 17, 2006, another Morgan Stanley employee wrote about a "deteriorating appraisal quality that is very flagrant."
Two of the employees who received those e-mails joined an internal hedge fund, headed by Howard Hubler, that was formed only the next month, in April 2006. As recounted in Michael Lewis's "The Big Short," Mr. Hubler infamously bet against the subprime market on Morgan Stanley's behalf, a fact that Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer conceded in late 2007. Mr. Hubler's group was supposed to be separate from the rest of Morgan Stanley, but the two bankers continued to receive similar information about the underlying market, according to a person briefed on the matter.
At no point did they receive material, nonpublic information, a Morgan Stanley spokesman says.
I struggle to see how the private assessments that the subprime market was imploding were immaterial.
Another of Morgan Stanley's main defenses is that it couldn't have thought the investment it sold to the Taiwanese was terrible because it, too, lost money on securities backed by subprime mortgages. As the Morgan Stanley spokesman put it, "This deal must be viewed in the context of a significant write-down for Morgan Stanley in 2007, when the firm recorded huge losses in its public securities filings related to other subprime C.D.O. positions."
This is a common refrain offered by big banks like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns to absolve them of any responsibility.
But does losing money wipe away sin?
Yes, Mr. Hubler made his bets in what turned out to be a deeply disastrous way. As part of a complex array of trades, he bet against the middle slices of subprime mortgage C.D.O.'s. He bought the supposedly safe top parts. The income from the top slices helped offset the cost of betting against the middle slices. But when the market collapsed, the top slices - called "super senior" because they were supposedly safer than Triple A - didn't hold their value, losing billions for Mr. Hubler and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hubler did not respond to requests for comment.
So Morgan Stanley lost a great deal of money.
But let's review what the documents suggest is the big picture.
In the fall of 2005, bank employees shared nonpublic assessments of how the subprime market was a house of tarot cards.
In February 2006, the bank began creating Stack in part so that it could bet against it.
In April 2006, the bank created its own internal hedge fund, led by Mr. Hubler, who shorted the subprime market. Among the traders in this internal shop were people who helped create Stack and other deals like it, and at least two employees who had access to the private due diligence reports.
Mr. Hubler's group had no investment position in Stack, according to the person briefed on the matter, but it sure looks as if the bank saw what was coming and tried to position itself for a subprime market collapse.
Finally, by early 2007, the bank appeared to realize that the subprime market was faring even worse than it expected. Even the supposedly safe pieces of C.D.O.'s that it owned, including its piece of Stack, were facing losses. So Morgan Stanley bankers set to scouring the world to peddle as a safe and sound investment what its own employees were internally deriding.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment on whether it made money on its Stack investments over all. But it looks to have turned out well for the bank. In Stack, it managed to fob off a nuclear bomb to the Taiwanese bank.
Unfortunately for Morgan Stanley, it had so many other pieces of C.D.O.'s, so many nuclear warheads, that it couldn't find nearly enough suckers around the world to buy them all.
And so when the real collapse came, Morgan Stanley was left with billions of dollars in losses.
That hardly seems exculpatory.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Forecasts Modest Global Economic Growth

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday that it continued to expect a modest upturn in global growth in 2013, with fewer risks of major policy mistakes and lower levels of financial stress.
The fund cautioned, however, that growth was not expected to snap back to precrisis levels in the coming years. Over all, the fund expects global growth of 3.5 percent in 2013 and 4.1 percent in 2014, up from 3.2 percent in 2012. In the years just before the global downturn, annual economic growth was 4.5 to 5.5 percent.
''If crisis risks do not materialize and financial conditions continue to improve, global growth could be stronger than projected,'' the Washington-based fund said in its economic report. ''However, downside risks remain significant, including renewed setbacks in the euro area and risks of excessive near-term fiscal consolidation in the United States. Policy action must urgently address these risks.'' 
The fund issued a routine update to the projections it makes in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook report. This time, it whittled down many of the forecasts for 2013 that it had made in October, knocking 0.1 percentage point from its United States growth forecast, 0.3 percentage point from the euro area and 0.4 percentage point from the newly industrialized Asian economies, like Singapore and South Korea.
Still, the International Monetary Fund noted that financial stresses and the risk of a major policy shock in Europe and the United States had decreased. ''Optimism is in the air,'' said Olivier Blanchard, the fund's chief economist, at a news conference. ''Some cautious optimism may indeed be justified,'' he added. ''We may have avoided the cliffs, but we still face high mountains.''
The fund said it downgraded its estimate of European growth from October despite ''progress in national adjustment and a strengthened European Union-wide policy response to the euro area crisis.'' It said that there might be ''delays'' as lower sovereign bond yields and reduced financial stress eventually translated into improved private sector borrowing conditions. It added that uncertainty about the ultimate resolution of the long-simmering European debt crisis remained high.
Mr. Blanchard said that policy challenges ''clearly'' remained highest in certain European countries struggling with large debt burdens and slow-growing economies. He said business competitiveness and exports had improved recently, but high interest rates, pressure for budget cuts and uncertainty continued to depress growth.
Slow growth in advanced economies, including the United States, Germany and Japan, will continue to weigh on growth in emerging economies, the fund said.
Mr. Blanchard noted that financial markets had become considerably more sanguine over the last year. The European Central Bank started a major new bond-buying program and the United States avoided the worst of the so-called fiscal cliff package of tax increases and budget cuts. He said that could be a sign that the financial markets were experiencing some kind of ''bubble'' but also said that investors could be ''seeing things which are truly good.'' Ultimately, with less financial stress, the real economy should pick up, thus explaining the market optimism, he said.
In terms of policy advice, Mr. Blanchard said that his ''main message'' would be that ''financial market optimism should not lead to policy complacency.''
For Washington, the ''priority is to avoid excessive fiscal consolidation in the short term, promptly raise the debt ceiling and agree on a credible medium-term consolidation plan,'' the fund's economists said. Christine Lagarde, the fund's managing director, and other officials have repeatedly warned politicians in Washington not to embark on too stringent an austerity program, for the good of the world economy as well as the United States.
At the news conference, Thomas Helbling of the fund's research division said that the United States faced a ''long-term'' fiscal problem, with much of the policy challenge resting in bringing down health care spending over time. He said that the challenge seemed ''doable.''
This month, the fund's sister institution, the World Bank, released a rosier economic analysis. It foresees global growth of just 2.4 percent in 2013. But it said that emerging economies could worry less about downside risks from advanced economies and start focusing on domestic economic issues, like labor market or regulatory reforms.

HEADLINE: Japan Raises Expectations as Abe's Policies Take Hold

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan raised its expectations for the economy for the first time in eight months Wednesday, as private consumption held firm and business sentiment improved in a sign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policy of easy money and big spending had begun taking effect. 
Improvement in exports and recent steps to stimulate the economy are likely to help the economy recover, but a slowdown in overseas economies remains a risk, the government said in its monthly economic report.
Mr. Abe, who led his Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide election victory in December, has called for aggressive monetary easing -- manipulation of interest rates and money supply -- and heavy spending to beat persistent deflation, helping to drive down the yen and lifting share prices
The government also said it expected the Bank of Japan to take bold steps to meet an inflation goal of 2 percent as part of a bold push to escape deflation and to revive the economy.
''The economy is weak, but signs of bottoming out can be seen in some areas,'' the report said.
That was an improvement from last month, when the government said the outlook was weakening because of a slowdown in overseas economies.
Mr. Abe's cabinet approved a stimulus package of ¥10.3 trillion, or $116.3 billion, this month, while the Bank of Japan, in its most determined effort yet to end years of economic stagnation, decided Tuesday to switch to an open-ended commitment to buying assets next year and doubling its inflation target to 2 percent.
Japan's economics minister, Akira Amari, said the improved outlook reflected the positive effects a softer yen and firmer stock prices were having on corporate sentiment.
Hiroaki Muto, economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management, agreed.
''The yen has depreciated by about 10 percent thanks to Abenomics, and expectations are running high,'' Mr. Muto said, using a popular term for the prime minister's policies.
In the report, the government raised its expectation for private consumption for the second month in a row, saying consumer spending was holding firm.
''Auto sales bottomed in October and were on the rise in November and December. ...Car production is recovering as well. Private consumption is showing signs of bottoming out,'' said a cabinet official who had compiled the report but was not authorized to speak on the record.
''Corporate leaders' views on business conditions are recovering against the backdrop of a recent correction to the yen's appreciation and gains in share prices,'' said the official.
The risk that overseas developments will hurt the Japanese economy had diminished, he added, as the U.S. government averted setting off automatic spending cuts and tax increases, and Japan appeared to be past the worst of its diplomatic fight with China over a small chain of islands in the East China Sea. The dispute resulted in a temporary boycott of Japanese goods in China.

HEADLINE: Iran: World Powers Frustrated by Status of Talks

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
A spokesman for the representative of the six big powers in nuclear talks with Iran expressed irritation on Wednesday with what he described as repeated changes and delays by the Iranian side in finalizing the date and place for the next round of negotiations. 
Michael Mann, the chief spokesman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief who negotiates on behalf of the six big powers in the talks, said the group was still engaged with Iran on the question of when and where the resumed negotiations would be held more than a month after the group had proposed dates and a location.
''Ever since then, we have been very surprised to see Iran come back to us again and again with new preconditions on the modalities of the talks; for example, by changing the venue and delaying the responses,'' Mr. Mann told reporters in Brussels in response to a question about the talks.
Despite public statements by Iranian officials that they are ready to resume the talks on the disputed nuclear program, Mr. Mann said, the discussions to schedule a new round of talks are ongoing. He also said, ''We want to see Iran come back to the negotiating table as soon as possible.''
Both sides have said in recent weeks that they expect an imminent resumption of the discussions, which were last held in Moscow seven months ago.
Mr. Mann spoke as Iran's official news media quoted Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi as saying Egypt had agreed to be the host for the next round of talks. There was no confirmation of his assertion from Egypt or the group of six powers, the so-called P5-plus-1, which are the five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Mr. Salehi as saying that several countries, including Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Switzerland and Sweden, had also expressed readiness to be the host.
The P5-plus-1 group has not specified where it would prefer the next round to be held. Diplomats have said privately that several locations have been proposed, including Turkey, where a round of talks was held last April -- the first negotiations in more than a year.
Western diplomats have accused Iran of repeatedly stalling on the talks, aimed at stopping the country's uranium enrichment activities, which they suspect are meant to develop the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Iran has asserted that its enrichment program is for peaceful purposes.
The United States and European Union have imposed increasingly tough economic sanctions on Iran as part of a pressure campaign to reach an agreement on the nuclear issue. Iranian leaders have said they will not capitulate to such pressure even as they acknowledge that the sanctions have hurt Iran's economy.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Despite Boycott, More Than Half of Voters Are Said to Turn Out in Jordan Election

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; Mohammad Abuarisheh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MULEIH, Jordan -- Two years ago, Mohamed al-Snaid organized laborers to demonstrate against poor working conditions, helping to start a movement that spread throughout the country and gave voice to a festering anger that has shaken the rule of King Abdullah II. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Snaid took on a very different role, as a candidate in Jordan's first parliamentary elections since the start of the unrest. He ran despite a boycott of the election by the many members of the protest movement, Hirak, who regard the vote as a public relations exercise by the king and who say that previous Parliaments were weak and unrepresentative.
Standing outside a polling station, Mr. Snaid said that after debating whether to join the boycott, he decided that the best place to fight corruption and economic inequality was from inside the system. Besides, the king asked personally.
''He told us to participate to help him with reform,'' Mr. Snaid said.
The lines were short, especially in Amman, the capital, but officials said early results showed that 56 percent of the 2.3 million voters who registered turned out, despite the boycott. There were numerous reports of vote-buying but no immediate signs of widespread fraud, which would itself represent a change from charges of interference leveled against the Jordanian authorities in recent parliamentary elections.
In the most serious challenge to the credibility of the elections, the country's main opposition group, the Islamic Action Front, which is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, has joined the boycott, increasing the chances that the election will be followed by more unrest. The group's leaders have argued that the election law is flawed and underrepresents cities, where most Jordanians live -- and where the Brotherhood counts on support, including among Jordanians of Palestinian descent, a majority of the nation's population.
Jordanians approached the polls with trepidation on Wednesday, with some saying that the appearance of so many former members of Parliament on the ballot gave them little faith that the election would provide meaningful change. King Abdullah, a crucial American ally, has insisted that amendments to the election law and other changes would help usher in a new era of pluralism, although many here see him as relying on the vote to fend off the anger in the streets.
''We don't want old faces. We tried that,'' said Khalid Hammad, 28, a lawyer who voted in Amman, in support of a friend, a fellow lawyer who was a first-time candidate. Mr. Hammad said that previous Parliaments had been derided for failing to fight corruption or to grapple with demands for social justice
''We are worried,'' he said. ''We can help Jordan not go the same way as Syria and Egypt.''
In all, 1,425 candidates were running for 150 seats, up from 120, in the lower house -- an election law modification that was intended to quiet complaints about a system that rewarded local power brokers. They were often members of powerful tribes rather than national parties. But the Brotherhood and other opposition groups complained that the new law did not go far enough.
At polling stations, voters seemed to be reverting to patterns that had enfeebled Parliament in the past: ignoring issues while voting for friends, relatives or members of their tribe. And the ballot included several candidates who were arrested on bribery charges in the days before the election.

HEADLINE: Kansas' Governor and G.O.P. Seek to Eliminate Income Tax

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
TOPEKA, Kan. -- President Obama stood on the steps of the Capitol in Washington on Monday afternoon and laid out an expansive liberal agenda for the nation. Inside the Kansas State Capitol here this week, Gov. Sam Brownback and Republican legislators have been drafting what could be a blueprint for the other side.
On Wednesday, lawmakers received a bill to inch the state closer to eliminating income taxes, a centerpiece of a broad legislative vision that many in the Republican Party here hope will serve as a model of conservative governance for other states, if not the nation, to follow.
While Republican principles of small government and low taxes have holds on large swaths of the country, Kansas provides perhaps the starkest view of the crimson ideology that could challenge Mr. Obama's Inauguration Day rallying cry. 
This month, the largest tax cut in Kansas history took effect, and most of its Medicaid system was handed over to private insurers. The bill introduced this week would pare taxes further, with the goal of eventually eliminating the state's individual income tax. Mr. Brownback has already slashed the state's welfare roll and its work force. He has merged government agencies and is proposing further consolidation. He is pushing for pension changes, to change the way judges are selected and for altering education financing formulas.
''I think it is the leading edge of the conservative economic and political movement,'' said State Representative Tom Sloan, a Republican representing the area around Lawrence. ''As such, it is the example that other state leaders will look to to determine whether the political philosophy can mesh with the expectations of the public.''
In last year's elections, the state bucked its long tradition of moderate Republicanism. Conservatives ousted several moderates in Senate primary contests and went on to victory in November. Now, for the first time in generations, the House, the Senate and the governor's office in Kansas are controlled by conservative Republicans. In much of the rest of the country, the political equation is similar: The Republican Party now controls both legislative chambers and governorships in 24 states. Democrats have single-party control in 13.
Many here, including the governor, have characterized the state's legislative endeavors as an experiment. Mr. Brownback, elected in 2010, and his supporters are betting that their agenda will show the rest of the country that conservatism provides a path to economic prosperity.
''I think the unique thing is that we're applying the principles on how you get your cost down and still provide a high-quality product,'' Mr. Brownback said in an interview. ''That's been in the private sector, but it hasn't been in the public sector for 50 years.''
Skeptics, meanwhile, contend that Mr. Brownback is leading Kansas toward economic devastation that will leave many of the state's residents without basic services and its children without a proper education.
''It kind of eliminates a large group of Kansans out of that pursuit of happiness,'' Senator Oletha Faust-Goudeau, a Wichita Democrat, said of the governor's proposals. ''They will still struggle. They'll pay the highest taxes. They are already working jobs with no benefits or very little benefits.''
Representative Barbara Bollier, a Republican representing the suburbs of Kansas City, questioned why the state was cutting taxes at a time of sagging revenues. ''It's beyond extremely conservative because no one else is doing it,'' she said.
Legislation passed last year that took effect this month consolidated three income tax brackets into two (4.9 percent and 3 percent). It also eliminated taxes on nonwage profits for certain types of businesses.
Supporters said these measures were necessary to reverse years of economic stagnation. Private-sector jobs have grown just 1.6 percent in the state over the past 14 years, compared with 12.2 percent in the 10 states with the lowest tax burdens, according to data compiled by the Kansas Policy Institute. The state estimates that the tax cuts will generate nearly 23,000 jobs by 2020 and $2 billion of income for the state.
''If you look at the demographics of my voter base, a lot moved to Florida and Nevada for lower taxes,'' said Senator Susan Wagle, the Republican Senate president who represents Wichita. ''I'd like to see them come back.''
Kansas' tax policy has caught the attention of its neighbors. Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska, a Republican, has introduced a bill to eliminate a variety of taxes, including ones on individual income and small businesses. Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, also a Republican, plans to call for modest income tax cuts, and Missouri lawmakers have discussed reforming their tax code.
But there is significant concern in Kansas over the cost of the tax cuts, which is expected to total nearly $850 million in the coming fiscal year. In the budget he presented last week, Mr. Brownback proposed to help cover the cost of those cuts by keeping in place a sales tax increase that was scheduled to expire this year and by eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. Both proposals have proven unpopular among conservatives and liberals alike.
''I think it's going to be a hard sell,'' said Representative Ray Merrick, the Republican speaker of the House, who supports the income tax cuts.
Critics say Mr. Brownback's tax cut was passed on the backs of low-income Kansans. The bill included the repeal of tax credits for food, rental housing and child care that benefited low-income residents. Because of those repeals, the poorest 20 percent of Kansans will spend an additional 1.3 percent of their incomes, an average of $148 per year, on taxes, according to a report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The top 1 percent, meanwhile, will see the share of their income that goes toward taxes drop by 2 percent, or $21,087 per year, the report said.
''This tax bill that passed is really what I call Robin Hood in reverse,'' said Senator Anthony Hensley, the Democratic leader, who represents Topeka.
While Mr. Brownback has aspired to make Kansas a state without income tax, critics note that other such states have other streams to supplement their revenue -- Texas, for instance, has oil, and Florida has tourism. And as he looks to reduce taxes, Mr. Brownback has not increased financing for education to the level that a state appellate court mandated this month. (The state is appealing that ruling.) Opponents fear deeper spending cuts.
Brownback supporters say more focus needs to be placed on efficient government spending, in education and other areas, rather than the amount that was being spent.
But Mr. Sloan said he felt that lawmakers were simply tailoring spending to fulfill the tax cuts, risking essential services without so much as discussing what the priorities should be.
''Bottom line is, if the governor's right and I'm wrong, the state will prosper,'' he said. ''If I'm right and the governor's wrong, then the state will suffer long term. I hope he is correct because that's the path we're on, but I have my doubts.''

HEADLINE: For Obama's New Term, Start Here

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Point to a group of toddlers in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in America, and it's a good bet that they will go to college, buy nice houses and enjoy white-collar careers.
Point to a group of toddlers in a low-income neighborhood, and -- especially if they're boys -- they're much more likely to end up dropping out of school, struggling in dead-end jobs and having trouble with the law.
Something is profoundly wrong when we can point to 2-year-olds in this country and make a plausible bet about their long-term outcomes -- not based on their brains and capabilities, but on their ZIP codes. President Obama spoke movingly in his second Inaugural Address of making equality a practice as well as a principle. So, Mr. President, how about using your second term to tackle this most fundamental inequality? 
For starters, this will require a fundamental rethinking of antipoverty policy. American assistance programs, from housing support to food stamps, have had an impact, and poverty among the elderly has fallen in particular (they vote in high numbers, so government programs tend to cater to them). But, too often, such initiatives have addressed symptoms of poverty, not causes.
Since President Lyndon Johnson declared a ''war on poverty,'' the United States has spent some $16 trillion or more on means-tested programs. Yet the proportion of Americans living beneath the poverty line, 15 percent, is higher than in the late 1960s in the Johnson administration.
What accounts for the cycles of poverty that leave so many people mired in the margins, and how can we break these cycles? Some depressing clues emerge from a new book, ''Giving Our Children a Fighting Chance,'' by Susan Neuman and Donna Celano.
Neuman and Celano focus on two neighborhoods in Philadelphia. In largely affluent Chestnut Hill, most children have access to personal computers and the shops have eight children's books or magazines on sale for each child living there.
Take a 20-minute bus ride on Germantown Avenue and you're in the Philadelphia Badlands, a low-income area inhabited mostly by working-class blacks and Hispanics. Here there are few children's books, few private computers and only two public computers for every 100 children.
On top of that, there's a difference in parenting strategies, the writers say. Upper-middle-class parents in America increasingly engage in competitive child-rearing. Parents send preschoolers to art classes and violin lessons and read ''Harry Potter'' books to bewildered children who don't yet know what a wizard is.
Meanwhile, partly by necessity, working-class families often take a more hands-off attitude to child-raising. Neuman and Celano spent 40 hours monitoring parental reading in the public libraries in each neighborhood. That was easy in the Badlands -- on an average day ''not one adult entered the preschool area in the Badlands.''
When I was a third-grader, a friend struggling in school once went with me to the library, and my mother helped him get a library card. His grandmother then made him return it immediately, for fear that he would run up library fines.
The upshot is that many low-income children never reach the starting line, and poverty becomes self-replicating.
Maybe that's why some of the most cost-effective antipoverty programs are aimed at the earliest years. For example, the Nurse-Family Partnership has a home-visitation program that encourages new parents of at-risk children to amp up the hugging, talking and reading. It ends at age 2, yet randomized trials show that those children are less likely to be arrested as teenagers and the families require much less government assistance.
Or take Head Start. Critics have noted that the advantage its preschoolers gain in test scores fades by third grade, but scholars also have found that Head Start has important impacts on graduates, including lessening the chance that they will be convicted of a crime years later.
James Heckman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, argues that the most crucial investments we as a country can make are in the first five years of life, and that they pay for themselves. Yet these kinds of initiatives are underfinanced and serve only a tiny fraction of children in need.
We don't have any magic bullets. But randomized trials and long-term data give us a better sense of what works -- and, for the most part, it's what we're not doing, like improved education, starting with early childhood programs for low-income families. Job-training for at-risk teenagers also has an excellent record. Marriage can be a powerful force, too, but there's not much robust evidence about which programs work.
So, President Obama, to fulfill the vision for your second term, how about redeploying the resources we've spent on the war in Afghanistan to undertake nation-building at home -- starting with children so that they will no longer be limited by their ZIP codes.

HEADLINE: Share of the Work Force in a Union Falls to a 97-Year Low, 11.3%

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The long decline in the number of American workers belonging to labor unions accelerated sharply last year, according to data reported on Wednesday, sending the unionization rate to its lowest level in close to a century.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the total number of union members fell by 400,000 last year, to 14.3 million, even though the nation's overall employment rose by 2.4 million. The percentage of workers in unions fell to 11.3 percent, down from 11.8 percent in 2011, the bureau found in its annual report on union membership. That brought unionization to its lowest level since 1916, when it was 11.2 percent, according to a study by two Rutgers economists, Leo Troy and Neil Sheflin.
Labor specialists cited several reasons for the steep one-year decline in union membership. Among the factors were new laws that rolled back the power of unions in Wisconsin, Indiana and other states, the continued expansion by manufacturers like Boeing and Volkswagen in nonunion states and the growth of sectors like retail and restaurants, where unions have little presence. 
''These numbers are very discouraging for labor unions,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''It's a time for unions to stop being clever about excuses for why membership is declining, and it's time to figure out how to devise appeals to the workers out there.''
Labor unions have boasted of their political successes in helping re-elect President Obama and in helping Democrats pick up seats in Congress.
But the figures announced by the bureau point to grave problems for the future of organized labor. The portion of private sector workers in unions fell to just 6.6 percent last year, from 6.9 percent in 2011, causing some labor specialists to question whether private sector unions were sinking toward irrelevance. Private sector union membership peaked at around 35 percent in the 1950s.
The report showed particular drops in union membership in two groups where unions have long been strong: local government employees and manufacturing workers.
Union membership showed sharp drops in Wisconsin, which passed a law in 2011 curbing the collective bargaining rights of many public employees, and in Indiana, which enacted a right-to-work law last February that may have prompted many workers to drop their union membership.
Such laws prohibit requiring employees at unionized workplaces to pay union dues or fees. The bureau's report showed that union membership fell by 13 percent last year in Wisconsin and by 18 percent in Indiana -- both unusually large numbers for a single year.
Barry T. Hirsch, a labor economist at Georgia State University, said an analysis he conducted found that the number of government employees in Wisconsin belonging to a union slid by 48,000 last year, to 139,000 from 187,000, as many public sector workers evidently decided to quit their unions after the Republican-led legislature stripped them of most of their bargaining rights.
Speaking about the nation as a whole, Professor Hirsch said: ''I am really surprised that the drop in unionization was as large as it is in a single year, and it was particularly big in the public sector. It does seem you are seeing reductions in some of the states that you might expect.''
For instance, in Indiana, where the right to work law took effect last March, unionization dropped to 9.1 percent from 11.3 percent in 2011. Michigan enacted a similar law last month.
The bureau said union membership in the public sector -- long a labor stronghold -- fell to 35.9 percent in 2012, from 37 percent the previous year. The number of government workers in unions fell by 234,000, as many teachers, police officers and others lost their jobs. There were 7.3 million public employees in unions, compared with seven million private sector workers.
William Spriggs, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s chief economist, took a more upbeat approach to the report, noting that the bureau had found increased union membership in California, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas.
''It's not a simple story that we don't have our act together,'' Mr. Spriggs said. ''I would be more concerned if union membership was down among Latinos and Asian-Americans, because that's a growing demographic, but it's up.''
He acknowledged that unions were doing poorly in manufacturing, retail and elsewhere in the private sector, which has been adding jobs even as union membership continued a slide that has lasted for decades.
''Our labor laws do not favor unions organizing,'' Mr. Spriggs said. ''It would be one thing to say we're bellyaching, but the Republican Party is really being vindictive against unions, and employers campaign very hard against workers unionizing.''
But Professor Chaison said now would seem a good time for unions to attract workers. ''Workers should be looking to unions because of job insecurity and stagnant wages, but they're not.''
In recent months, there has been an uptick in labor militancy as evidenced by recent protests at Walmarts across the nation and the one-day strike by fast-food workers in New York City last November. Both of those actions against nonunion employers protested what workers said were low wages and meager benefits. Union officials acknowledge that it is often hard to persuade a majority of employees at a big-box store or other workplaces to vote to unionize.
Glenn Spencer, vice president of the Workforce Freedom Initiative of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday's report ''has some alarm bells ringing at union headquarters across Washington.''
With workers no longer spending their entire career at one employer and often switching jobs, he said workers no longer felt as attracted to unions.
''Unions have fundamentally had a hard time conveying to workers what their value proposition is, how they're really going to make workers' lives better,'' Mr. Spencer said. ''And if you look at union contracts and their rigid work rules, there is no incentive for employers to embrace unions either.''
According to the report, North Carolina has the lowest unionization rate, 2.9 percent, followed by Arkansas, at 3.2 percent. New York had the highest unionization rate, 23.2 percent, with Alaska second, at 22.4 percent.
The bureau said that among full-time workers, union members had median weekly earnings of $943 last year (about $49,000 annually), compared with $742 (about $38,600 annually), for comparable nonunion workers.

HEADLINE: Technology Shares Help Dow Reach 5-Year High

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Strong earnings from technology companies nudged the Dow Jones industrial average to a five-year high on Wednesday. Investors were encouraged when the House agreed to let the government pay its bills for the next four months. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.12 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 13,779.33, the highest level since Oct. 31, 2007.
Google and I.B.M. posted solid fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday. Many investors expected tech companies to struggle at the end of last year.
I.B.M.'s results exceeded expectations, helped by its Internet-based business and sales of software services to developing countries like Brazil and Russia. The company increased its earnings outlook for the current year. I.B.M. was the leading gainer in the Dow industrials, rising $8.64 to close at $204.72.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.25 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,494.81. The Nasdaq composite index rose 10.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,153.67.
''This market is really stretched,'' Clark Yingst, chief market analyst at the securities firm Joseph Gunnar, said. ''We've essentially gone straight up since Jan. 2. There's certainly room for people to take profits.''
The S.& P. 500 index is up 4.8 percent this year.
The House passed a bill to suspend the government's borrowing limit until May 19. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said his chamber would immediately move the bill to the White House.
Google rose $38.63, or 6 percent, to $741.50 after reporting higher earnings. Apple fell in after-hours trading after reporting revenue that fell short of forecasts.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32 to 98 6/32 percent. The yield fell to 1.83 percent from 1.84 percent late on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A Month After His Firing, A Coach Understands

BYLINE: By SCOTT CACCIOLA

 BODY:
LUTHERVILLE, Md. -- The day he lost his job, Cam Cameron decided to go to his son Danny's high school basketball game. As soon as Cameron arrived at the gymnasium, he could sense that people were staring at him. It struck him as pity, or perhaps morbid curiosity.
''People were numb because they think you should run and hide,'' he said. ''They think you're embarrassed. I've got nothing to be embarrassed about.'' 
Until Dec. 10, Cameron occupied a high-profile position as the offensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens. Then he was fired, and the Ravens began to thrive without him. The team's remarkable postseason run will culminate in a Super Bowl appearance against the San Francisco 49ers.
Some in the punditry business have cited Cameron's firing as a catalyst for the team's success. If you think this annoys him, think again.
''It was a brilliant move,'' Cameron said Wednesday at his home outside Baltimore. ''Everyone on the team took a look in the mirror after that.''
Cameron, 51, said he learned long ago that being fired was part of football. At this stage of his career, he has a dispassionate view of his profession. In his den, he has a framed photograph of his stepfather, Tom Harp, when he was an assistant coach at Army in 1958. In the photo, Harp is standing next to Earl Blaik, the legendary coach known as Red, and Pete Dawkins, the Heisman Trophy-winning halfback. Army went undefeated that season.
Harp later worked as a head coach at Cornell, Duke and Indiana State, with varying degrees of success. Cameron said he could remember when his stepfather was fired for the first time. ''As a kid, you live it,'' he said.
The demands on coaches -- to win, and win now -- have only grown in recent years, Cameron said. He said coaches once viewed preseason games as opportunities to work on fundamentals and evaluate young players -- nothing more.
''Now, after one preseason game, people are wanting to know what's wrong with the offense,'' he said.
Cameron has had his share of success. An acolyte of the longtime coach Don Coryell, whose high-octane passing attack continues to influence the modern game, Cameron directed one of the highest-scoring offenses in N.F.L. history in 2006 with the San Diego Chargers. After one dismal season as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins, he joined the Ravens as the offensive coordinator in 2008 and helped Joe Flacco develop into one of the league's top young quarterbacks.
This season, the Ravens' offense was not exactly scuffling with Cameron at the helm. When he was dismissed, the team was 9-4, having lost two straight games, and averaging 344.4 yards of offense. Under Jim Caldwell, who was promoted from quarterbacks coach, the Ravens have averaged 406.2 yards -- including 424.7 yards per game in the playoffs. Cameron said the change made a difference -- not so much because of any schematic overhauls, but because it put everyone in the organization on alert.
''We were inconsistent,'' Cameron said, ''and if I'm in charge, I'm saying: 'Why are we inconsistent? We need to get the team's attention.' ''
As center Matt Birk put it, ''It's not like we changed everything we were doing.''
On Dec. 10, the day after the Ravens lost to the Washington Redskins in overtime, Cameron arrived at the team's practice facility at 4 a.m. -- about an hour earlier than usual, he said. He could tell something was brewing, he said, though nobody had told him anything.
''You can tell in decision-makers' eyes, in their body language,'' Cameron said.
Coach John Harbaugh invited Cameron to meet in his office. The conversation was brief, Cameron said, with Harbaugh essentially telling Cameron that the team needed to make a change. Harbaugh later called it his most difficult decision as a head coach.
Cameron said he told Harbaugh that he understood. The two men hugged, and Cameron said he wished Harbaugh luck before leaving the building.
With time on his hands, Cameron pieced together a list of activities that he never had the chance to do while he was pulling 16-hour days as a coach. He drove his three youngest children to school. (His oldest, Tom, is a freshman at Fordham.) He went to the gym with his wife, Missy. He golfed. He fished. He took a bowhunting trip to Ohio with his 14-year-old son, Chris. ''I said, 'I want to see what all this feels like,' '' Cameron recalled.
When he visited New York with his wife to see a couple of Broadway shows, he could feel the sting of unemployment beginning to fade, he said. He found an Irish pub where he watched the Ravens' divisional playoff victory over the Denver Broncos. He said he had invested too much in the team to let himself feel bitter or unhappy. ''You can't do anything but root for those guys,'' he said.
He wants to coach again, he said, and plans to next season. He still loves the game. He interviewed with the Jets for their offensive coordinator position, but was turned down. ''When you're in this situation,'' Cameron said, ''you have to build yourself up a little bit.''
He recalled the message that linebacker Ray Lewis gave the Ravens after their playoff loss to the Patriots last season.
''He said we were right where we were supposed to be,'' Cameron said. ''I believed that then, and I believe it today. I don't necessarily understand it. But I believe that me and my family -- and I've told them this -- we're right where we're supposed to be. And that's very freeing in a lot of ways.''

HEADLINE: This Robot Wants to Be Your Co-Worker

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The robot equipment industry has one word for the alarmist articles and television news programs that predict a robot is about to steal your job: Fiddlesticks!
Well, that wasn't actually the word used this week at the Automate 2013 trade show held here through Thursday, but the sentiment was the same. During a presentation on Monday, Henrik I. Christensen, the Kuka Chair of Robotics at Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Computing, sharply criticized a recent ''60 Minutes'' report on automation that was based on the work of the M.I.T. economists Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson.
The two economists in 2011 wrote ''Race Against the Machine,'' a book that renewed the debate about the relationship between the pace of automation and job growth. They argue that the pace of automation is accelerating and that robotics is pushing into new areas of the work force like white-collar jobs that were previously believed to be beyond the scope of computers. 
During his talk, Dr. Christensen said that the evidence indicated that the opposite was true. While automation may transform the work force and eliminate certain jobs, it also creates new kinds of jobs that are generally better paying and that require higher-skilled workers.
''We see today that the U.S. is still the biggest manufacturing country in terms of dollar value,'' Dr. Christensen said. ''It's also important to remember that manufacturing produces more jobs in associated areas than anything else.''
An official of the International Federation of Robotics acknowledged that the automation debate had sprung back to life in the United States, but he said that America was alone in its anxiety over robots and automation.
''This is not happening in either Europe or Japan,'' said Andreas Bauer, chairman of the federation's industrial robot suppliers group and an executive at Kuka Robotics, a German robot maker.
To buttress its claim that automation is not a job killer but instead a way for the United States to compete against increasingly advanced foreign competitors, the industry group reported findings on Tuesday that it said it would publish in February. The federation said the industry would directly and indirectly create from 1.9 million to 3.5 million jobs globally by 2020.
The federation held a news media event at which two chief executives of small American manufacturers described how they had been able to both increase employment and compete against foreign companies by relying heavily on automation and robots.
''Automation has allowed us to compete on a global basis. It has absolutely created jobs in southwest Michigan,'' said Matt Tyler, chief executive of Vickers Engineering, an auto parts supplier. ''Had it not been for automation, we would not have beat our Japanese competitor; we would not have beat our Chinese competitor; we would not have beat our Mexican competitor. It's a fact.''
Also making the case was Drew Greenblatt, the widely quoted president and owner of Marlin Steel, a Baltimore manufacturer of steel products that has managed to expand and add jobs by deploying robots and other machines to increase worker productivity.
''In December, we won a job from a Chicago company that for over a decade has bought from China,'' he said. ''It's a sheet-metal bracket; 160,000 sheet-metal brackets, year in, year out. They were made in China, now they're made in Baltimore, using steel from a plant in Indiana and the robot was made in Connecticut.''
A German robotics engineer argued that automation was essential to preserve jobs and also vital to make it possible for national economies to support social programs.
''Countries that have high productivity can afford to have a good social system and a good health system,'' said Alexander Verl, head of the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering in Germany. ''You see that to some extent in Germany or in Sweden. These are countries that are highly automated but at the same time they spend money on elderly care and the health system.''
In the report presented Tuesday by the federation, the United States lags Germany, South Korea and Japan in the density of manufacturing robots employed (measured as the number of robots per 10,000 human workers). South Korea, in particular, sharply increased its robot-to-worker ratio in the last three years and Germany has twice the robot density as the United States, according to a presentation made by John Dulchinos, a board member of the Robot Industries Association and the chief executive of Adept Technology, a Pleasanton, Calif., maker of robots.
The report indicates that although China and Brazil are increasing the number of robots in their factories, they still trail the advanced manufacturing countries.
Mr. Dulchinos said that the United States had only itself to blame for the decline of its manufacturing sector in the last decade.
''I can tell you that in the late 1990s my company's biggest segment was the cellular phone market,'' he said. ''Almost overnight that industry went away, in part because we didn't do as good a job as was required to make that industry competitive.''
He said that if American robots had been more advanced it would have been possible for those companies to maintain the lowest cost of production in the United States.
''They got all packed up and shipped to China,'' Mr. Dulchinos said. ''And so you fast-forward to today and there are over a billion cellphones produced a year and not a single one is produced in the United States.''
Yet, in the face of growing anxiety about the effects of automation on the economy, there were a number of bright spots. The industry is now generating $25 billion in annual revenue. The federation expects 1.6 million robots to be produced each year by 2015.
Mr. Greenblatt said that one of the advantages of robots was they did not take breaks.
''My robots are going to work during the Super Bowl,'' he said. ''Do you know how popular I would be to ask my employees to work during the Super Bowl?''

HEADLINE: Russian Minister Backs Assad, and Adoption Ban

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said on Wednesday that the main obstacle to peace in Syria was the opposition's ''obsession with the idea of toppling the Bashar al-Assad regime.'' He also said that the Kremlin's Emergency Ministry flights that removed 77 Russians from the war zone early on Wednesday had not signaled the start of an evacuation.
In an annual news conference, Mr. Lavrov made clear that Russia was unlikely to alter the position it had staked out in Syria, opposing any international measures to force Mr. Assad from power after nearly two years of violence. More than 60,000 people have died in the Syria conflict, according to the United Nations. 
Mr. Lavrov offered some insight into Russian adjustments as Mr. Assad's military position weakens and rebels dig into the suburbs ringing Damascus. He noted that Russia's Foreign Ministry ''proceeds from the notion that there should be no nonessential employees'' in the Russian Embassy in the capital, and that the families of Russian diplomats were sent home ''long ago, because it is not very calm to work there, and that's correct.''
Last week, Russia announced that it was closing its consulate in the contested northern city of Aleppo, in the wake of a double bombing that killed 82 people.
Mr. Lavrov said that diplomats were in regular contact with Russian citizens in Syria, and that around 1,000 people had expressed interest in transportation out, but fewer than 100 had been ''ready to use that opportunity'' when Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations offered free flights to Moscow this week.
He said the two Emergency Ministry aircraft had been delivering humanitarian aid to Beirut, and so offered Russian citizens the option of free passage to Moscow.
Mr. Lavrov spoke as new signals of further disintegration in Syria were reverberating through the region. Jordan's foreign minister, Nasser Judeh, was quoted by Reuters as saying in an interview that 20,000 Syrians had fled to his country just in the previous seven days -- the fastest pace since the anti-Assad uprising began.
Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, told the World Economic Forum annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, that the Syrian military's aerial bombardments of civilian areas should be declared a war crime. ''Syrians are dying not only in bombardments, but the silence of the international community is killing them as well,'' said Mr. Davutoglu, appearing on a panel alongside top representatives of United Nations relief agencies.
Besides Syria, Mr. Lavrov also addressed the sharp downturn in Moscow's relationship with the United States after Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency last year. Seemingly eager to ease the rancorous tone, Mr. Lavrov said Russia was ''interested in constructive dialogue and the development of stable, mutually beneficial cooperation.'' He also said that the Kremlin was hoping to arrange a meeting between Mr. Putin and President Obama, but had not yet received a response to an invitation extended after the American election.
Mr. Lavrov was one of a number of high-ranking officials to initially express disagreement with the idea of banning adoption by Americans, a controversial step that Mr. Putin ultimately supported, but which undermined the Foreign Ministry's painstaking negotiation of a recent bilateral agreement with the State Department regulating adoptions. At the news conference on Wednesday, though, Mr. Lavrov defended the ban.
He said American officials had refused Russia's repeated appeals for access to a Russian-born boy who had been placed with a new foster family in Florida after his adoptive parents were prosecuted for child abuse. He also said Russia ''did not see the desire'' on the part of American officials to provide Russian officials with access to the Ranch for Kids, a nonprofit organization in northeastern Montana that has hosted hundreds of Russian adoptees, and that became the focus of Russian scrutiny in 2010 after a Tennessee woman put a 7-year-old adoptee on a flight back to Moscow.
''The cases we know about are only the tip of the iceberg,'' he said. He added that Russia had no complaints about the welfare of children adopted by Italians and was working to facilitate more adoptions by French families.

HEADLINE: New Path for Trade: Selling in China

BYLINE: By JOHN GROSSMANN

 BODY:
Like many American businesses fighting to keep their prices competitive, Vision Quest Lighting turned to China about six years ago. It now imports about a sixth of the two dozen to three dozen parts required to make its lighting fixtures from there. Recently, however, the Long Island company began to see China in a different light: as a sales target. The growing economy of the world's most populous nation made it ripe for Vision Quest's architectural lighting fixtures, many custom-made for hotel and restaurant chains like Hilton and KFC.
When one such client, a clothing retailer, ordered 1,500 lights for five stores, Vision Quest's chief executive, Larry Lieberman, decided it made sense to start manufacturing lights in China. Other American clients, he reasoned, would no doubt begin placing similar orders as their chains sought to capitalize on the world's fastest-growing consumer market. And with high-quality products from the West coveted in China, Mr. Lieberman also imagined his products on display in Chinese showrooms.
And yet, selling goods in China is not easy. Mr. Lieberman made the 1,500 lights only to see them gather dust in a warehouse in Guangzhou for more than four weeks because he had not yet established a local enterprise approved to process sales. 
''The customer couldn't pick up the goods because we were still trying to set up something so they could buy them correctly and pay the right tax,'' he said.
With help from an experienced consultant, Mr. Lieberman finessed the impasse by selling through an established local company, and he remains bullish on cracking the Chinese market -- as do many other small-business owners. After all, China, according to a 2012 McKinsey & Company report, From Mass to Mainstream, will be the world's largest growth market for many years.
This small-business guide offers tips for getting started based on the experiences of entrepreneurs and small businesses that have already tried.
BILINGUAL IS NOT BICULTURAL Lou Hoffman is founder and chief executive of the Hoffman Agency in San Jose, Calif., a communications consulting company that generates more than 50 percent of its revenue in Asia. Mr. Hoffman planted his flag in China in 1999.
''I thought I was in not just another country but another universe,'' he said. ''It starts with the language, but goes much deeper. We couldn't do business on the phone or by fax. Placing our first classified ad took 14 hours. We had to do everything in person, and considering the traffic in Beijing, you could kill three hours so someone could see your face.''
Instead of dispatching a lieutenant from his California headquarters to open a satellite office in Beijing, Mr. Hoffman delayed expansion for nearly a year.
Instead, he hired a Chinese national and embedded her in his San Jose office for 10 months so she could learn his agency's culture, then carry it home with her. ''We wanted someone able to interview people in their native tongue and able to bridge the cultures, which she was able to do,'' Mr. Hoffman said.
SET UP SHOP AS A WFOE Although it is possible to scout opportunities with a so-called rep office and to do business in China by selling through distributors or by licensing products to a Chinese company, most American businesses that are serious about selling in China invest the time and money to establish themselves as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or what is known as a WFOE (pronounced WOOF-ee). ''We do probably 100 WFOEs for every rep office,'' said Dan Harris, a lawyer with the Seattle firm Harris & Moure who writes a blog about Chinese law and business. ''Legal fees for company formation, trademark and employee contracts and manuals typically run around $30,000 to $45,000.''
But the upfront investment does not stop there. Depending on the location and the type of business, the Chinese government has minimum capital requirements -- money deposited in a Chinese bank account -- that can range ''from $15,000 to millions of dollars,'' he said
And think months, not weeks, to get all of the paperwork approved. ''In China, you can't do anything last minute,'' said Savio S. Chan, president and chief executive of U.S. China Partners, which is based in Great Neck, N.Y., and which helped Vision Quest move its light fixtures out of regulatory limbo. ''It can easily take up to six months to set up a WFOE.''
LET OTHERS OPEN THE DOOR Cabot Hosiery Mills, which makes high-end recreational socks in Northfield, Vt., has edged into the Chinese market. Sought out by a Chinese distributor at an American trade show, the company has traded a bit of profit potential to test the demand for its made-in-America goods without wrangling a WFOE or staffing a sales operation.
''Right now, it's very straightforward and still small, less than 1 percent of our volume,'' said Ric Cabot, chief executive of the company, which owns the Darn Tough Vermont brand. ''But if it gets to the point where we see we're leaving too much money on the table, we might consider doing something different.''
DON'T GET KNOCKED OFF Product infringement and knockoffs are risks in China. As a result, Earl Kluft, owner of E.S. Kluft & Company in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., a maker of luxury mattresses priced from $3,500 to $70,000, watched his first attempt to tap into the Chinese hunger for premium Western brands fall apart.
''A huge manufacturer of recliners and small mattresses came to us, and we started a program under their name,'' Mr. Kluft said, explaining that the arrangement started with six mattress products named for American cities. But on successive trips to China, he started to see fewer of his products on display -- and more of other brands that looked very much like his.
''Even after we stopped selling to them, they still had my picture up,'' he said. Networking through a friend, Mr. Kluft has since signed a deal with a Chinese division of an Indonesian company that cautiously re-established a sales channel with minimal upfront investment. ''The idea is to get this up and running,'' he said. ''We charge them a royalty, so much a year for use of our name in their stores, and they buy the product at a special discount.''
Mr. Harris, the lawyer, advises getting started by finding reliable partners on the ground. ''Find them through people you know, and then pay for whatever due diligence is necessary to make sure that you have made the right choice,'' he said. ''And do all of this before you start doing business with them.''
LOOK LOCALLY BEFORE LEAPING For some entrepreneurs, help may be surprisingly close at hand. Many states -- including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Mississippi and Tennessee -- have international trade programs that offer counsel.
''We think it's hard for a small company who's never been to China to figure this out all by themselves,'' said Samar Ali, assistant commissioner of international affairs in Tennessee. ''We'll help them see if there's a need for their product in China and to think it through: Do they need to set up a WFOE? Do they need to have a presence or not? Should they go the e-commerce route? And tell them how much they should budget going forward.''
The assistance includes the use of Tennessee's China offices for meetings with potential partners and help with business-to-business matchmaking through companies the international trade program has vetted in the 10 largest Chinese cities.
Though bullish on the opportunities, Ms. Ali finds herself repeating mantras like: ''Don't go in too fast. Don't go in blind. And don't leave your common sense at home.''

HEADLINE: Japanese Trade Deficit Was $78 Billion in 2012

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan on Thursday reported a record annual trade deficit in 2012, the second straight year in the red for an exporting nation that has long built its wealth on its vast trading surpluses. 
The annual trade gap of 6.93 trillion yen (about $78 billion) was brought about by surging fuel imports and a continued slide in machinery shipments and other mainstay exports. The deficit underscores the challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces as he tries to lift the world's third-largest economy after the United States and China out of years of stagnation.
The deficit also brings to the forefront the risks that accompany Mr. Abe's bid to revive the economy through government spending, which will add to Japan's public debt, already more than twice the size of its economy. For years, export surpluses helped Japan finance that enormous debt without having to turn to foreign investors.
But that delicate balance is now unraveling. The global economic crisis set off a fall in Japanese exports, and also caused the yen to strengthen, weighing on the country's competitiveness and recovery. The prolonged shuttering of the country's nuclear reactors in the wake of the Fukushima crisis has led to a spike in Japan's imports of oil and gas. A bitter territorial spat with China has hurt exports to Japan's biggest trading partner.
The provisional data released by the Finance Ministry on Thursday showed exports continued to fall in December at a faster pace than forecast by economists, despite a weakening of the yen that should have come as a boon to exporters.
Still, economists expect trade to pick up as Japan's economic recovery gathers momentum later this year.
According to the data, Japan's annual trade deficit jumped by 170 percent from the 2.56 trillion yen shortfall it recorded in 2011 to 6.93 trillion yen. Energy imports, mainly from the Middle East, surged, machinery and car exports fell across the board. By region, Japan's exports to China tumbled by 10.8 percent, leaving Japan with a trade deficit of 3.52 trillion yen (about $40 billion) with its rising neighbor. Exports to the struggling European Union also fell by 15 percent.
Trade with the United States was brisk, however, with exports climbing 11.7 percent and imports by 2.5 percent for a 5.1 trillion yen (about $58 billion) surplus. Japanese automakers did particularly well in the United States last year, rebounding from production cuts brought about by Japan's 2011 tsunami.

HEADLINE: Individualism vs. the Common Good

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Collective Turn'' (column, Jan. 22), David Brooks suggests the necessity of balancing decentralized government and individual initiative with the need for collective action. Here in suburban Dallas such sentiments would brand him a flaming socialist. 
His call for more ''streamlining'' to liberate ''private daring'' seems to have forgotten much of recent American history. While the deregulation of the 1980s was in part necessary and successful, the stock market crash in 1929, the savings and loan scandals in the 1980s, and our recent Great Recession all suggest that our problems lie with too much deregulation and not enough collective action to guard against the abuse of private initiative. From a historical perspective, President Obama's inaugural remarks struck just the right balance.
BROOKS FLIPPEN McKinney, Tex., Jan. 22, 2013
The writer is a professor of history at Southeastern Oklahoma State University.
To the Editor:
David Brooks oversimplifies when he states that we have ''one party that talks the language of government and one that talks the language of the market'' but ''no party with new ideas about how these things might blend together.''
The Democratic Party, in passing Obamacare, embraced the use of a marketplace of private insurance offerings to achieve a public good. Not coincidentally, that health care approach originated in conservative think tanks, but we should credit Democrats with being open to the idea and carrying it forward.
Rather than being a party of government versus markets, as Mr. Brooks implies, Democrats since Franklin D. Roosevelt have favored government providing frameworks within which markets can operate more fairly and safely.
Republicans, on the other hand, seem now to reject any blending of markets and government and retreat to an unvarnished advocacy of ''free markets'' that all too often favors entrenched moneyed interests over the public good.
THOMAS R. HITCHNER Baltimore, Jan. 22, 2013
To the Editor:
David Brooks correctly emphasizes that ''reinvigorating a mature nation'' requires government simultaneously to centralize and to decentralize its responsibilities and functions. More regulation and more deregulation are required. Citizens need greater independence in their personal lives but also greater oversight to assure public safety. Public programs should encourage personal initiative while offering a safety net when individuals fail.
These competing values introduce severe tensions as collectivities mature, yet the most effective businesses and governments are capable of achieving stability and innovation jointly. Rather than arguing exclusively for one or the other, we should be working to achieve both. The importance of individual interests does not necessarily dictate less concern for the commonwealth.
As Mr. Brooks rightly concludes, at this stage in our national history, we will do better by embracing competing values.

HEADLINE: To Raise Graduation Rate, Colleges Are Urged to Help a Changing Student Body

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN; Annie Lowrey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In an effort to improve the college completion rate and fend off new regulations, a commission of the nation's six leading higher-education associations is calling for extensive reforms to serve a changing college population -- one increasingly composed of older and part-time students.
''This is the first time in the history of modern higher education in which all the communities have come together -- community colleges, research institutions, public universities and small liberal arts colleges -- and reached agreement that completion needs to be our most important priority,'' said E. Gordon Gee, the president of Ohio State University and chairman of the National Commission on Higher Education Attainment. 
The report, ''College Completion Must Be Our Priority,'' which will be released on Thursday, calls on colleges and universities to find ways to give students credit for previous learning, through exams like the College Board's College-Level Examination Program, portfolio assessments or other college equivalency evaluations. It also calls for more services and flexibility for nontraditional students, suggesting innovations like midnight classes, easier credit transfers and more efficient course delivery, including online classes.
''These are all very important things, they're all unusual, and they're things we're not doing,'' Dr. Gee said. ''We concentrate most on the admissions side of things, getting the bodies in, and there's no one in charge of seeing that they get through and graduate. I'm going to call this person the completion dean.''
Almost half of the students who begin college at a two- or four-year institution fail to earn a degree within six years.
Whether the report will lead to change is unclear. But Molly C. Broad, president of the American Council on Education, said she believed it would create a new sense of urgency.
''We have policies and practices built when colleges were filled with full-time, 18- to 22-year-old students who needed to be provided not only educational opportunities, but fed, protected, counseled and given recreation,'' she said. ''But that's not our world today, when the overwhelming majority are part-time students juggling jobs, older students, veterans, whom we need to treat fairly -- and do it on our own rather than have it done unto us.''
Dr. Gee, who called the report ''proactive and pre-emptive,'' said it reflected a broad consensus about the importance of helping more students earn degrees, as quickly as possible, but did not prescribe specific actions to be taken by individual institutions.
Another report released on Thursday, ''The American Dream 2.0,'' from a coalition of higher-education advocates, raised a similar alarm about college graduation rates, and the financial burden on those who take out student loans but do not earn a degree. ''Many students without a credential are plunged underwater financially,'' the report said. ''When students leave college with no credential and a load of debt, they may be worse off than when they entered.''
Since the job market does not favor college dropouts the way it does graduates, said Kevin Carey, director of education policy at the New America Foundation, ''it's not just enough to let people in, or even to let them in and make sure they can afford it in an abstract way.''
The ''American Dream'' report suggests making the financial aid application process simpler and more transparent, and holding both schools and students accountable for completion.
While education experts are increasingly focused on graduation rates, many students and families are not. According to the 2012 survey of first-year college students by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, students at four-year institutions significantly overestimate their likelihood of completing college on time. About 8 in 10 said they expected to graduate from their institution in four years, but national statistics show that only about 4 in 10 do so.
''Among students just starting college, there's a significant mismatch between their expectations and the reality that most students don't graduate four years later from the institution where they started,'' said John H. Pryor, managing director of the U.C.L.A. institute and an author of the annual report, ''The American Freshman: National Norms.''
''When we talk about these colleges, we call them four-year colleges, so the implication is that you're going to finish in four years,'' Mr. Pryor said. ''And even though there's been a huge push to publish the four-year graduation rates, students and families just are not that well-informed.''
This was the first time the survey, of 192,812 first-year, full-time students at 283 four-year institutions, discussed expectations of on-time graduation.
Mr. Pryor, whose son is a first-year college student, said the statistical evidence was backed up by the many college presentations he attended over the last year, not one of which mentioned the institution's four-year graduation rate.
''I'd be the guy looking it up and saying, 'Excuse me, you only have a 35 percent four-year graduation rate, so what are you doing to improve retention?' '' he said. ''But no one else seemed aware of the issue.''
The U.C.L.A. survey also found that students were feeling increasing financial pressure. Two-thirds said the economic climate had significantly affected their college choice, and 13 percent said they could not afford to attend their first-choice university, the highest percentage since that question was first asked in 2006.
Students were more likely than in the past to say that getting a better job and making more money were very important reasons for their decision to go to college, and that ''being very well-off financially'' was a goal.

HEADLINE: Europe Is Edgy As Briton Seeks To Loosen Ties

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The French are engaged in a lonely military adventure in Africa. The Germans are preoccupied with domestic elections rather than regional affairs. Unemployment in some countries is at historic highs and economies across Europe are still mired in recession.
Now Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has added to Europe's malaise, vowing to reduce British entanglement with the European Union -- or allow his people to vote in a referendum to leave the bloc altogether. 
The pledge from the British prompted swift retorts from France and Germany, which said no member has the option of ''cherry picking'' whatever European rules it wants to enforce. But it reflected a growing sense of unease, not only in Britain but across the Continent, that while the acute phase of the financial crisis has passed, the challenge to Europe's mission and even its membership has not.
Even the United States has injected itself into the matter, with an unusually public insistence that Britain, a close ally, stay in the union, fearing that its departure would heighten centrifugal forces that would weaken Europe as a diplomatic, military and financial partner.
With the threat of a sudden breakup of the euro zone appearing to recede in recent months, Europe has seen a resurgence of narrow national interests that risks swamping always-elusive common goals. The bickering is undercutting hopes in some circles that the struggle to save the euro had laid the groundwork for ''more Europe.''
''As pressure from the financial markets recedes and a sense of urgency lifts, the appetite for serious reform is melting away like butter in the sun,'' said Thomas Klau, head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ''Now that markets no longer hold a knife under leaders' throats, they are slipping back into their normal mode, which is to manage their own immediate reality.''
For Mr. Cameron, with elections coming in 2015, that means heading off a challenge from the hard-right, anti-Europe United Kingdom Independence Party while shoring up support for his government, which recently admitted that its unpopular austerity program would have to be extended to 2018, analysts said. He is also anxious to avoid the sort of ruinous intraparty split over Europe that bedeviled the prime ministerships of two of his Conservative predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and John Major.
That comes against a backdrop of declining favorability ratings for the European Union among the British -- only 45 percent last year, down from 51 percent in 2011, in polls conducted by the Pew Research Global Attitudes Project.
Mr. Cameron's speech Wednesday in London calling for a referendum had been in the works for some time but, Mr. Klau noted, it was delivered at a moment when the European Union had begun to declare victory over doomsayers who predicted the common currency and even the whole union could crumble. This mood of calm, Mr. Klau said, has given leaders ''the political space'' to turn their eyes from Europe toward more pressing and, for politicians seeking re-election, far more important domestic concerns.
The decision by President François Hollande of France to send troops to Mali to halt an advance by rebels with ties to Islamist extremists reprises a long tradition of French interventions in its former African colonies -- and has bolstered the Socialist president's previously flagging popularity.
The French move has been supported by the European Union, whose member states share French fears about the spread of radicalism across the Mediterranean. But it has superseded the bloc's own ambitions to become a serious player in global affairs and still left the French to fight mostly on their own. The union is sending some military trainers.
Europe's economic troubles, meanwhile, are far from over, with much of the Continent expected to be in recession this year. Even Germany seems to be losing momentum -- its economy contracted by 0.5 percent in the final months of last year. Elsewhere, unemployment is soaring to levels that could threaten grave social unrest, with more than a quarter of working-age people in Greece and Spain without jobs.
But the European Union, widely criticized as not doing enough to raise employment, has been struggling to put even its own economic house in order after leaders failed in November to agree on a long-term budget for the 27-nation bloc. Leaders will take another swipe at this divisive issue early next month.
After being consumed for so long by efforts to salvage the euro zone, ''leaders now think it is safe and are becoming perhaps too complacent,'' said Charles Grant, director for the Center for European Reform, a London-based research unit. ''The only time European leaders have agreed to take important steps is when there is a crisis. As soon as the crisis stops they relax.''
Germany, he said, has now backed away from tentative support for a change in the basic European Union treaties that could help the European Union forge common policies.
Already distracted by national elections next September, Germany could turn even more inward-looking as Chancellor Angela Merkel seeks to overcome her party's defeat over the weekend in a down-to-the-wire state election in Lower Saxony. She remains the dominant figure in German and European affairs, but the surprise election setback has dented her aura of invincibility.
Other leaders, tightly focused on their own domestic concerns, are stalling on critical decisions about how far they want to go in engaging with the union. President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland, for example, said Wednesday that his country should delay a decision on adopting the euro until after elections in 2015.
While the Polish economy, the biggest in central Europe, has been spared the tumult that has afflicted other nations, opinion polls show flagging interest in adopting the euro. Less than a third of Poles want to ditch the national currency, the zloty, according to recent surveys. Farther to the east in Latvia, which plans to join the euro zone next year, support for the common currency has slumped to under 15 percent in a sign of growing unease with a ''European project'' that most Latvians had eagerly embraced.
Domestic politics have regularly trumped broader European concerns throughout the six-decade history of the union and its predecessor organizations, to the dismay of those who want to see Europe live up to a commitment in the 1957 Treaty of Rome for an ''ever closer union.''
But Mr. Cameron's pledge to hold a referendum on European Union membership threatens to elevate national political calculations over common interests to an extent that has alarmed even countries that often share British concerns.

HEADLINE: Heady Returns, But Apple Finds Its Stock Falling

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
Apple on Wednesday reported the kind of quarter most big companies would envy, posting a profit of $13.1 billion and selling 28 percent more iPhones and 48 percent more iPads, its two biggest products.
Its stock sank 11 percent.
What is going on? Because of its great success in recent years, many investors have come to expect nothing short of perfection from Apple. And while it is still widely considered the most innovative company in the technology world, a maker of products that its devoted customers cannot live without, Apple is facing a range of challenges. 
It is dealing with increased competition from big rivals like Samsung and Google, and with so many people already using smartphones, the market is not quite as untapped as it once was. Apple is forging into cheaper product categories, meaning lower profit margins. And given that Apple has grown so big, with sales of more than $160 billion in the last 12 months, keeping up its heady growth rate is becoming harder and harder.
Once-euphoric investors, who pushed Apple's stock to a record high of $702.10 last September, have become nervous, and in after-hours trading on Wednesday, the stock traded at $461.30, down 34 percent from its peak.
Apple has reinvented itself several times over the last decade with groundbreaking new products, and could do so again. Television and electronic payments are among the markets where analysts believe the company could make a push, leading it to new heights.
''Apple has really been able to invent whole new markets,'' said John Gallaugher, an associate professor at Boston College's Carroll School of Management. ''That's where it differs from companies like Microsoft. I don't think the mojo of this team has evaporated.''
In a conference call with analysts, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said the company's pipeline of new products was ''chock-full.''
''We feel great about what we have in store,'' he said, without adding details.
In the meantime, though, the love affair that investors once had with Apple is clearly waning.
''There's nothing that can help the stock from sliding now,'' said Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, who said Apple's holiday sales met his own forecasts, even though they missed others' predictions.
For years, Apple has offered an unusual alchemy: it was not only a large, highly profitable tech company, but one with the rapid growth rate of a start-up. It pulled this off under the leadership of Steven P. Jobs, its former chief executive, who died in late 2011. He had a startling knack for finding new multibillion-dollar opportunities for Apple with the iPod, iPhone and iPad, but his death has accentuated concerns about the company's prospects.
A big part of Apple's challenge is that it is now so large that it seems unrealistic, mathematically, for the company to continue finding new pots of gold big enough to maintain its growth. In a recent research report, A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research, calculated that were Apple to grow for the next five years at the same rate as the last five years, its revenue would be $1.2 trillion, or about the size of Australia's gross domestic product.
One continuing concern is that the iPhone, which accounts for over half of Apple's revenue, could be smothered by smartphones running Google's Android operating system, which accounts for three out of every four handsets shipped globally.
But Apple continues to take an outsize portion of the profits in the smartphone business, and in the United States the company actually increased its share of the smartphone market over the holiday quarter, rising to 51.2 percent from 44.9 percent a year earlier, according to a study released this week by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.
On Wednesday, Apple did not appear to provide a strong enough reason for investors to warm to it again. It said its profits were flat because of higher manufacturing costs, even as revenue rose 18 percent.
Apple's net income for its fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 29 was $13.1 billion, or $13.81 a share, flat compared with $13.1 billion, or $13.87 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue was $54.5 billion, up from $46.33 billion a year ago. Those results compared to the average estimates of $13.44 a share earnings and revenue of $54.73 billion from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Apple's growth in the quarter looked anemic compared with the huge numbers it used to deliver. For the holiday quarter of 2011, in contrast, its revenue jumped 73 percent and its profit soared 118 percent.
In its financial forecasts for the current quarter, Apple provided numbers that suggest a decline of roughly 20 percent in earnings a share, according to Mr. Sacconaghi's calculations.
A number of analysts say they still believe the company's good times are not over. ''Sentiment has turned super-pessimistic on Apple, where they've gone from being able to do no wrong to suddenly being able to do no right,'' said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners. ''I tend to think the company's momentum is a heck of a lot more solid than people are concerned about.''
One factor that hurt comparisons between Apple's most recent holiday quarter and the previous one was that its 2012 quarter was a week shorter.
Headed into the holiday quarter, analysts were worried about Apple's profit margins, which the company had warned would decline as a result of a near total overhaul of the company's product line.
While new products are routine for a company like Apple, it said the number of devices it released around the holidays, like the iPhone 5, iPad Mini and new Mac computers, was unusual.
But negative sentiment has further hardened amid reports that Apple had cut orders for components with a supplier, potentially suggesting weak demand for the iPhone.
Mr. Cook cautioned that investors shouldn't place too much significance on such reports because Apple often gets its parts from multiple sources.

HEADLINE: Up Ahead: The World According To Gore

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE FUTURESix Drivers of Global Change
By Al Gore558 pages. Random House. $30.
''The Future: Six Drivers of Global Change,'' the title of Al Gore's ambitious, drily written new book, sounds like a snoozy think-tank talk. And while it's about 30 times as long, that's exactly what this volume is, a wonky overview of the forces that are remaking the world: economic globalization, the digital revolution, climate change, dwindling natural resources, shifts in the global balance of power and advances in the life sciences.
Because it bites off way more than it can plausibly digest, ''The Future'' lacks the cogency and focus of Mr. Gore's previous two books, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' his succinct, user-friendly assessment of the dangers of climate change (published in 2006 in conjunction with the movie of the same name), and ''The Assault on Reason'' (2007), his perspicacious analysis of America's ailing condition as a participatory democracy. 
Parts of ''The Future'' dealing with domestic politics, foreign policy and economics retrace ground covered in more persuasive detail by Bill Clinton (''Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy''), Zbigniew Brzezinski (''Strategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Power'') and Joseph Stiglitz (''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy'').
Other passages read like updates on Alvin Toffler's 1970 classic ''Future Shock,'' which looked at how our culture was being rocked by an avalanche of social and technological changes. And some feel like textbook excerpts, piling one historical aside on top of another, which provides some useful context but more often bogs the book down in survey-course-like digressions. (Remember our hunter-gatherer ancestors or denizens of the Stone and Bronze Ages? They're mentioned in these pages, as are historical events like the Paris Commune and the Industrial Revolution.)
The main theme in this volume has to do with Mr. Gore's conviction that ''American democracy has been hacked,'' that Congress ''is now incapable of passing laws without permission from the corporate lobbies and other special interests that control their campaign finances.'' Both parties, he says, have become so dependent on business lobbies for ''the large sums of money they must have to purchase television advertisements in order to be re-elected that special interest legislation pushed by the industries most active in purchasing influence -- financial services, carbon-based energy companies, pharmaceutical companies and others -- can count on large bipartisan majorities.''
The results, Mr. Gore goes on, can be seen in ''the ever increasing inequalities of income and growing concentrations of wealth, and the paralysis of any efforts at reform.'' Such paralysis is particularly dangerous, he says, given the challenges facing America today, like declining public education financing (at a time when schools need to adapt ''to the tectonic shift in our relationship to the world of knowledge'') and continuing high unemployment (a by-product not only of the 2008 crash, but also of globalization, outsourcing and automation).
The public's ability to express its revulsion at this state of affairs, Mr. Gore argues, ''is dampened by the structure of our dominant means of mass communication, television, which serves mainly to promote consumption of products and entertain the public, while offering no means for interactive dialogue and collaborative decision making.''
He also complains that ''virtually every news and political commentary program on television is sponsored in part by oil, coal and gas companies -- not just during campaign seasons, but all the time, year in and year out -- with messages designed to sooth and reassure the audience that everything is fine, the global environment is not threatened, and the carbon companies are working diligently to further develop renewable energy sources.''
Such remarks serve to remind the reader of a business deal Mr. Gore recently made that has ignited charges of hypocrisy and greed: selling Current TV (a channel he helped to found in 2005) for an estimated $500 million to Al Jazeera, the influential Arab news giant, which is financed by the government of oil- and gas-rich Qatar. Mr. Gore, who will reportedly make about $100 million from the deal, describes Al Jazeera in this book as ''feisty and relatively independent.''
Mr. Gore is most convincing in ''The Future'' when he refrains from editorializing and sticks to analyzing how changes in technology, our political climate and the environment are going to affect the world, often creating domino or cascadelike effects.
Much of this will be familiar to readers from news accounts and earlier books (including Mr. Gore's own), but they are useful in an all-in-one-place primer sort of way. Mr. Gore writes that ''our continued burning of carbon-rich fossil fuels'' spews ''90 million extra tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution every 24 hours'' into the planet's atmosphere, which leads to climate change and changes in Earth's water cycles, which can lead to flooding in some areas and desertification in others -- which can lead, in turn, to worsening water and food shortages, which can exacerbate civil conflict and refugee crises.
The explosive growth of the Internet and the proliferation of mobile phones in developing countries, Mr. Gore notes, has a snowball effect too: On one hand, closing the ''information gap'' in the world and offering the possibility of ''robust democratic discourse''; on the other, magnifying privacy and cybersecurity threats.
A new $2 billion facility being built in Utah by the National Security Agency will have the capacity ''to monitor every telephone call, e-mail, text message, Google search, or other electronic communication (whether encrypted or not) sent to or from any American citizen,'' Mr. Gore says. ''All of these communications will be stored in perpetuity for data mining.'' Other advances in technology and the biological sciences, he reminds us, will create a slew of legal and moral debates. For instance, the growing popularity of 3-D printing (which can produce such disparate items as prosthetic medical devices or components of a building) raises new questions about intellectual property, and copyright and patent law, while the ''Life Sciences Revolution'' -- which may give people the opportunity, say, to create ''designer babies'' by picking out traits ''like hair and eye color, height, strength and intelligence'' -- will produce all sorts of ethical dilemmas.
Mr. Gore says he's laid out a ''recommended agenda for action'' in this volume, and he mentions some familiar policy options for grappling with the climate change crisis (like cap and trade, and using tax policy to discourage CO2 emissions). But his book doesn't really offer a lot of detailed, practical ideas for coming to terms with the myriad other problems he identifies in these pages as facing America and the world in the 21st century.
Perhaps he is being vague because he hasn't entirely shut the door on running for office again. He says that ''The Future'' is not ''a manifesto intended to lay the groundwork for some future political campaign,'' but he also repeats a joke he's used in the past that deflects but does not entirely smother the possibility of running again: ''I am a recovering politician and the chances of a relapse have been diminishing for long enough to increase my confidence that I will not succumb to that temptation again.''

HEADLINE: Syracuse's Democratic Mayor Gets Under Governor's Skin

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse earned her political chops from the first Governor Cuomo, whom she served as a regional representative and speaks of with reverence.
Like any good Cuomo hand, she relishes a fight. And now she might have one with the second Governor Cuomo.
On Wednesday, Mayor Miner and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, both Democrats, continued to skirmish over the governor's approach to struggling municipalities, highlighting what had been largely behind-the-scenes frustrations among some prominent local leaders about the governor's strategy to deal with their problems. 
On Tuesday, in a speech to the Legislature, the governor said there would be no bailouts for municipalities, stating, ''We don't have the money.''
A few hours later, Ms. Miner took aim at the governor's budget, saying it raised ''more questions than answers.'' She was particularly critical of a new proposal allowing municipalities to push their pension costs into the future -- the second such state plan in the last half-decade -- saying that it amounted to continuing to kick the can down the road, and asking, ''Isn't this what got states like Illinois in trouble?''
The governor wasted little time in firing back.
On Wednesday, Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy traveled to Syracuse for a previously scheduled meeting with journalists at The Post-Standard of Syracuse.
At that meeting, Mr. Duffy suggested he had an option in mind: ''I would say to the mayor, if this is not sufficient, then I would suggest one viable option she would have is to request a financial control board,'' he said -- which would assume many of the mayor's powers.
That drew a sharp response from Ms. Miner.
''I think that's a false choice, to say to the people of New York State you either have to borrow more or give up democratic control of your city,'' she said in an interview.
Ms. Miner, 42, who was elected mayor in 2009, is known to be an ambitious politician with a combative nature that has led to clashes with fellow Democrats on her city's Common Council. But her comments were a rare expression of public dissent among Democrats, since the governor is well known to disdain public displays of disaffection.
Only last week, he instructed local party officials that he wanted the state Democratic Party to be a ''tighter'' ship. He could have hardly had Ms. Miner's comments in mind -- he handpicked her as co-chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.
But other local leaders also said that a broader strategy would help.
''Giving us new ways to borrow money, it's appreciated, and it is a life preserver,'' said Mayor Michael Spano of Yonkers. ''But it's not going to solve our problems.''
Mr. Spano has been involved in a series of talks with Ms. Miner and other prominent mayors about common problems, talks that have not always been embraced by the governor's staff.
''He's a tough guy, you know?'' Mr. Spano said of his discussions with the governor. ''You've got to respect that. He's a tough guy from the big city; I'm a tough guy from a big city -- not as big as the one he's from.''
''We all are set on a path, and at the end of this path, there's going to be a day of reckoning where we are no longer going to be able to tax our way, cut our way or borrow our way out of our problems,'' Mr. Spano said. ''And when that day comes, what are we going to do?''
The governor, for his part, has hewed to a patchwork approach. While he is creating a task force to aid municipalities that have to restructure their finances and has taken on a portion of local Medicaid costs, he has also emphasized steps aimed at deferring pain -- in addition to the pension plan, he has allowed some municipalities to accelerate future state aid payments, receiving more now and less later.
But the governor also inevitably hears pleas by mayors as entreaties for more money.
''The answer cannot be, my friends, that every municipality in the state that has a financial problem, they're going to come to Albany and ask for a check,'' Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday in a speech to the Legislature. ''If there is a fundamental economic inequity in that corporation -- that public corporation -- resolve the inequity,'' he added. ''Don't subsidize it year after year after year.''
Patrick M. Maglieri, an expert in municipal law at Harris Beach, said, ''I think probably the frustration is that this is nibbling at the edges and dealing with the cash-flow issues that municipalities are facing short term, but not running to the heart of the structural issues they face.''
''These are aging cities with aging population and aging infrastructure that are consuming a greater percentage of their revenues, and coupled with that is the declining tax base,'' he added.
Ms. Miner insisted on Wednesday that mayors were not coming to Albany with their hand out, but asking for a more comprehensive approach to their shared problems. ''What we want is a good policy solution to this structural problem,'' she said. ''Over the next two years, the city of Syracuse will not be able to close its gap on its own.''

HEADLINE: A Debt Crisis Averted, for Now

 BODY:
In an unusual recognition of reality, House Republicans backed away on Wednesday from a chaotic default crisis and dropped their ruinous demand that spending be cut on an equal basis with a rise in the debt ceiling. On a vote of 285 to 144, the House agreed to suspend the debt ceiling for three months, adding the puerile condition that the Senate's pay should be delayed until it passes a budget. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said the extension would pass his chamber and promised to come up with a budget, four years late.
For the moment, at least, the vote vindicates President Obama's strategy not to negotiate in any way over the debt ceiling. After the debacle of the 2011 debt crisis, which damaged the nation's credit rating and its standing in the world of global finance, Speaker John Boehner knew that his demand for equal cuts in spending was no longer sustainable. If the hostage that Republicans wanted to take -- the economy of the United States -- couldn't be used as a bargaining chip, it might as well be released. 
Nonetheless, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, was right to call the measure ''a gimmick unworthy of the fiscal and economic challenges that we face.'' Postponing a crisis for 90 days does nothing to reassure markets, or businesses, or ordinary bondholders worried about their investments. It does nothing to inspire confidence in voters that their elected officials are grappling with the budget in a serious way, even if, in the end, Republicans are quietly planning on raising the debt ceiling anyway as part of further spending negotiations. (The stopgap resolution that currently pays for the government runs out at the end of March, and if Republicans think they can use the debt ceiling as a cudgel in that fight, they will find a solid wall of opposition.)
Wednesday's bill doesn't even raise the ceiling; it simply suspends its enforcement, showing how meaningless the mechanism is. Now that it is clear that the ceiling can be easily eliminated, both parties should agree to do so, averting not just this crisis but all those in the future.
The issue will have to be revisited in May, but the bill at least moves the budget debate closer to where it should be: the annual appropriations process. Let each chamber put its policy priorities on the table for public examination and then hash out the differences in the full glare of the C-Span cameras.
If the House actually wants to put forth a balanced budget over the next 10 years, as Mr. Boehner vowed to do on Wednesday, let the public see what that really means: unimaginable cuts and changes to Medicare and Medicaid, and the elimination of scores of popular and vital programs that benefit both the poor and the middle class. Up to now, Republicans have been understandably wary of specifying how that would be done without raising taxes. Mitt Romney wouldn't do it, and even Representative Paul Ryan's budgets up to now wouldn't balance the budget until 2040.
Similarly, the Senate should finally go on the record with its own budget, one that combines further tax increases on the wealthy, investments in education, energy and public works, and sensible spending cuts. (It should have done so for the last four years, but too many Democrats were afraid of publicly agreeing with Mr. Obama's proposals.) Despite the grandstanding coming from the House, Mr. Reid's agreement to do so on Wednesday had nothing to do with threat of missed paychecks and everything to do with correctly reading the public mood.
Last year's election showed where voters stand in this debate. They want deficits reduced in a balanced way, without irresponsible reductions in the role of government. Dropping extortionate demands for cuts is a good first step for the House, but it still has a long way to go.

HEADLINE: Lessons From a College Student: Finding Your Fit on Campus

BYLINE: HANNAH STEINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The author, a sophomore at Barnard College, offers tips to help new college students become "involved and grounded on campus." 

 BODY:
 Hannah Steinhardt, a sophomore at Barnard College in New York City, is a former intern of The Choice. 
Two years ago, as a senior in high school, I finished my laundry list of activities on the Common App. I thought I had it all figured out, that is, until I actually got to college.
I will never forget standing on Low Steps on a hot August afternoon during orientation, surrounded by tables representing student groups. Every table had a sign-up sheet and my name was on approximately 50 of them. 
I could not believe how lost I felt - I had the map of the tables and I'd highlighted a few that sounded cool but I could not navigate the whirlwind of excited faces without feeling overwhelmed. 
I'm pretty sure I received 35 e-mails that very evening from clubs welcoming me but I honestly have never felt less included or involved.
I was confused. Why was I so unsure as to how I would spend my time in college? Where was that feeling of ownership that I'd had in high school?
I had to take a step back and consider why I had done what I'd done in high school and what I wanted to do now. Did I want to mirror high school or did I want to venture into uncharted territory? If only I'd thought about that before the activities fair!
Throughout the year, I wondered how it was possible that, after an entire year of anticipation and preparation for college, I had arrived on campus seemingly unprepared. What could I have done differently to ease the transition? 
Here are some reflections, which I hope will help high school seniors and future college applicants:

        
 Think about why you participate in each activity listed on your college application. 
        
 Remember the importance of trying new things - there's no better time than college to step out of your comfort zone. 
        
 Don't let the sheer number of organizations at your college or university overwhelm you. 
        
 Don't worry about finding your place on campus. 

It's easy to write down all of your activities as you endeavor to impress admissions officers. But it's important to give yourself the opportunity to figure out why you've devoted your time to those particular activities.You should also decide if you want to find similar opportunities in college or if you'd rather find something new. Part of the magic of college is that there are so many different places to exercise the passions that were limited to one club or opportunity in high school.Ashley Memory, the senior assistant director for undergraduate admissions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recommends that students seize "the opportunity to meet others with shared interests and better yet, find out about opportunities to try things you haven't yet considered."It may be overwhelming to try new things when your whole life is a new thing - trust me, I know what it feels like to not have an anchor - but it can be really freeing to abandon what you've always done in favor of what you've always wanted to do.Standing in a blur of tables and signs and people can be terrifying as a first-year student. It's not unusual to hear students decide to avoid the activities fair.But Ms. Memory suggests that students "take their time and do their homework by attending club meetings and activity fairs and getting to know their fellow students, who are uncommonly friendly and eager to help them adjust to college.""It's not a matter of how many things you do," said Benjamin Lamb, the assistant director for student life at Williams College, "as much as it's about how deeply and richly you engage in the things you do."You will find your place on campus. Whether in a matter of days or months or toward the end of the year, it will happen.I didn't really start to feel ownership of my college experience until the middle of second semester. It didn't happen right away but in hindsight, I can see that I was not alone in my initial discomfort. You won't be either.
I ended up pursuing a number of different clubs at first, both comfortably familiar and frighteningly new.
Camp Kesem Columbia happened first. It's a camp for children whose parents have been affected by cancer, and I spend most of my time thinking about and working on it as one of the chairwomen. Spreading the Camp Kesem love is my joy and I'd be lost without it. 
Then came Greek life, and its impact on the community that I value endlessly on campus. (For more on how going Greek can help shrink a community, visit Abby Hansen's response in her recent visit to the blog's virtual Guidance Office.) 
I know it probably sounds as if I quickly found my place, but it took a whole lot of floundering around until it finally felt right. I wrote briefly for the college newspaper. I auditioned for a singing group. I tutored a second grader.
Some of those leaps of faith have lasted; others have not. But I am now involved and grounded on campus, not to mention happy.

HEADLINE: The Debt Ceiling and Playing With Fire

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: By turning the federal debt ceiling into a political issue, the Republicans add to uncertainty, weaken the job market and invite chaos, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
Congressional Republicans are again threatening not to increase the ceiling on the amount of federal government debt that can be issued. On Wednesday, they agreed to postpone this particular piece of the fiscal confrontation, but only until May. The decision to turn the debt ceiling into a confrontation is a big mistake for the Republicans and extending the indecision is likely to prolong the agony of uncertainty and have damaging economic consequences for the country. 
I made these points at a hearing on Tuesday of the House Ways and Means Committee, but unfortunately the Republican majority seems determined to persevere with its destabilizing strategy. (The hearing can be viewed on C-Span's Web site; see the playlist on the right.) 
In most countries, decisions about government spending and revenue bring with them an implied, even automatic decision about how much debt to issue. Spending minus revenue in a year gives you the annual deficit (a flow), while government debt is a stock of obligations outstanding.
Think of it as a bathtub. Spending is water coming in from the tap, and revenue is water leaving through the drain. If there is more spending relative to revenue, there is more water in the bathtub - and the amount of water is the debt.

In the United States, for odd historical reasons, Congress makes two separate decisions, one on the flow (spending and revenue) and the other on the stock (the allowed limit on the debt, known as the debt ceiling).
But once you have decided on the rate of flow into and out of the bathtub, the stock at any given moment is a given. So what happens if Congress suddenly decides that there should be a cap on the water in the bathtub, without altering the flow in or out? 
To complicate matters, keep in mind that some of these fiscal flows have already been committed, for example, in terms of interest payments due on existing debt, salaries for active military personnel and Social Security payments. You cannot suddenly grab more revenue out of thin air.
The main problem is that no one knows what would happen if the federal debt were to hit its legal ceiling.
Would the government be forced to default on some obligations to bondholders? Would there be some other form of default - for example, in terms of nonpayment for goods and services already contracted? Or would there just be complete chaos in our fiscal affairs, a throwback to the mid-1780s, before the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and before Alexander Hamilton took the public debt firmly in hand?
In the past, the potential for confusion around binding debt-ceiling limits was well understood. The debt ceiling was therefore raised without too much fuss, and the party in opposition would typically object in principle but not put up a real fight. Plenty of other ways are available for Congress to affect revenue and spending (the flow) without throwing everything into disarray by insisting on a stock of debt that is inconsistent with previous commitments.
This changed in summer 2011 when some Republicans decided to dig in behind the idea that they could force the federal government to default if they did not get what they wanted. For some, this was about forcing big spending reductions. For others, federal government default was actually the goal; see this commentary from July 22, 2011, by Ron Paul, a Tea Party favorite who was a member of Congress at the time. (His son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, is currently opposed to increasing the debt ceiling, even on a temporary basis as agreed this week.)
In summer 2011, I warned about the effects of this confrontation over the debt ceiling, contending that it would create a great deal of uncertainty and slow the economic recovery. I particularly stressed the damage that would be done to the private sector - exactly contrary to what the House Republicans asserted they wanted. I also testified to this effect before the Ways and Means Committee on July 26, 2011, although I cannot say my arguments had any impact on Republican thinking.
Recent research by Scott Baker and Nicholas Bloom of Stanford and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago looks carefully at what has generated uncertainty about policy over the last 25 years or so. Their Web site is a must-read, as is the latest version of their paper on the topic (updated Jan. 1). This chart from their paper was a main point in my five minutes of opening verbal testimony.
They find that while the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath greatly elevated policy uncertainty in general, the debt-ceiling confrontation in summer 2011 produced the highest level of uncertainty since 1985, when their analysis begins.
Uncertainty about policy creates doubts in the minds of people about what is going to happen to the economy. The natural response in the face of heightened uncertainty is to delay making decisions - people do not go on vacation or buy a car, and business owners and companies do not hire people unless they absolutely need them.
Slap everyone in the face with such concerns after a big financial crisis and you get a slower economic recovery and fewer jobs.
Most economists would say there is no chance that the United States would ever default; this would be an act of collective insanity far in excess of anything ever seen in this country or anywhere in the world. But what really matters is not the view of analysts and commentators. The real issue is whether decision makers throughout the economy think that default or some other disruptive event could occur.
The evidence from Professors Baker, Bloom and Davis is clear. The debt-ceiling fight in summer 2011 made people more uncertain about what was to come.
This is consistent with the fact that August 2011 was a very weak month for job creation. According to the Government Accountability Office, this political confrontation also pushed up the cost of borrowing for the government. And uncertainty of this kind increases risk premiums around the world, because investors want to be compensated for higher risks. This put more pressure on European sovereign debt at an inopportune moment, pushing up yields across the troubled euro zone (including, but not limited to Greece).
In the hearing this week, the Republican line was that the debt ceiling offered a "forcing moment." This is plainly a threat; otherwise there is no sense in which it is "forcing." What is the threat? No one knows; even the three Republican witnesses could not agree on what would happen if the debt ceiling were breached.
The threat lies between some form of default and some other form of unprecedented disruption to public finances. Expect uncertainty - perhaps at the level of August 2011, perhaps even higher.
This is an irresponsible way to run fiscal policy. As Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, put it: "House Republicans continue to play with economic fire. They are playing political games and that undermines certainty."
The Republicans should take the debt ceiling off the table.

HEADLINE: Sternlicht's Starwood to Buy Distressed Debt Manager for $1.05 Billion

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The Starwood Capital Group and Starwood Property Trust, both run by Barry S. Sternlicht, agreed on Thursday to pay $1.05 billion for LNR Property, bolstering their positions in distressed commercial real estate. 

 BODY:
The real estate mogul Barry S. Sternlicht is making his latest deal. 
On Thursday, two of his companies, the Starwood Capital Group and Starwood Property Trust, agreed to pay $1.05 billion for LNR Property, bolstering their positions in distressed commercial real estate. 
The deal comes at a potentially opportune time in the industry. Big banks, particularly in Europe, have been unloading assets to raise capital and shore up their balance sheets. The largest financial institutions in Europe are expected to sell $78 billion of noncore assets this year, with many reducing their exposure to real estate, according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Mr. Sternlicht is well versed in such deal-making. After the financial crisis, Starwood Capital and other investors acquired a $4.5 billion real estate loan portfolio of Corus Bank, which had failed. He also made a run at Extended Stay Hotels in bankruptcy.
Under the terms of the deal, the Starwood Capital Group, a private investment firm, will pay $197 million for LNR's commercial property group in the United States and a piece of Auction.com. A corporate affiliate, Starwood Property Trust, a real estate investment trust, will pay $856 million for various units, including loan servicing businesses in the United States and Europe as well as portfolios of commercial mortgage backed securities and other assets.
"We are delighted to announce this transformative and highly strategic acquisition that diversifies Starwood Property Trust's revenue sources, adds significant scale to our operating platform and dramatically expands our proprietary origination capabilities," Mr. Sternlicht, the chief executive and chairman of Starwood Property Trust, said in a statement. 
Starwood expects the deal to add to earnings and cash flow in 2013 and 2014. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Republican Governors Open New Front in Tax Debate

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: Republican governors in a range of states are starting to act aggressively on taxes, setting up limited but politically ambitious and potentially telling experiments in what might be possible nationwide. 

 BODY:
 10:49 a.m. | Updated Overhauling the tax system is the subject of endless talk and little action in Washington. But as Republican governors in a range of states start to act aggressively on the issue, they are setting up limited but politically ambitious and potentially telling experiments in what might be possible nationwide.
It is not just that they are cutting taxes. It is how they are taking tentative steps toward rebalancing what kinds of taxes their states rely on.
In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindalis pushing to repeal the state's personal and corporate income taxes and make up the lost revenue through higher sales taxes. Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska is calling for much the same thing in his state. Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas wants to keep in place what was supposed to be a temporary increase in the state sales tax to help pay for his plan to lower and eventually end his state's income tax. 
Those governors and others going down the same general path are justifying their proposals on many grounds. These include making their states more competitive in attracting employers and high-skilled workers, simplifying their tax systems and resisting pressure for more government spending as their economies and tax revenues recover gradually from the recession.
For Mr. Jindal and other Republican governors who have an eye on a presidential run in 2016, there are obvious political benefits to having a robust tax-cutting record to present to conservative primary voters.
But they are also taking small first steps into a fundamental debate over what kind of tax system most encourages - or least discourages - growth in a 21st-century economy. 
In particular, they are focusing more attention on the idea, long championed mostly by conservatives but accepted up to a point by economists of all stripes, that the economy would be better served by focusing taxation on consumption rather than on income. And as they do so they are reigniting an ideological conflict about whether it is possible to move away from a system built around progressive taxation of income without benefiting the wealthy at the expense of middle- and lower-income people.
"The question of whether we should tax income or whether we should tax spending is really a proxy for a different debate," said Joseph Henchman, vice president for state projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning research organization. "Everyone agrees we'll get more growth with consumption taxes. It's just that some people prioritize fairness."
Democrats are criticizing the approach taken by Mr. Jindal, Mr. Heineman, Mr. Brownback and other Republican governors on exactly those lines. Since lower-income families spend a much greater proportion of their income than wealthier people, any shift in taxation toward sales or consumption taxes hits people on lower economic rungs relatively more heavily than upper-income households.
"These aren't pro-growth policies - they're shell games that reward the wealthiest Americans at the expense of everyone else," said Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors' Association. "They slash critical investments in education and public safety, cost us jobs, and crush opportunity for middle-class families."
It is not clear whether any of the Republican proposals will make it into law; even in states with Republican-dominated legislatures, governors face difficulty as they pursue their proposals because changing the tax code almost invariably creates losers as well as winners.
In addition to keeping a higher sales tax, Mr. Brownback has proposed that Kansas help pay for income tax cuts by rescinding deductions for mortgage interest and property tax payments, drawing opposition even from members of his own party. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia is battling to save his plan, announced this month, to end the state's gasoline tax and make up the revenues by increasing the sales tax.
And just as President Obama has raised income tax rates on upper-income families, Democratic governors including Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Jerry Brown of California and Deval Patrick of Massachusetts have supported or implemented income tax increases on the wealthy.
The shift toward greater reliance on sales taxes is not universal among Republican governors. Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma would rely largely on projections of economic growth to help offset her plan for lower rates and an eventual end to her state's income tax.
"I don't believe greater reliance on the sales tax is likely to be a broad trend in the country, although we may see it in some places," said Don Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government who tracks state fiscal policies. "In recent years voters and politicians have generally shown in a variety of ways that they have been more willing to support tax increases on higher-income taxpayers than on the broad populace."
The shift toward sales taxes in some states is incremental, and nowhere near the scale or complexity that would characterize adoption of a federal consumption tax, whether a value-added tax, a national sales tax or any of the other variations that have been proposed and debated over the years.
But where it is happening, the results could resonate in other states and in Washington. 
 "First, a broad-based consumption tax distorts economic activity less than an income tax (particularly than income taxes on business income)," R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the business school at Columbia University and a former top adviser to President George W. Bush, said in an e-mail. "Second, income taxes at the state level (particularly highly progressive ones) lead to boom and bust revenue cycles that are difficult for states to manage."
 The debates going on in the states, he said, "offer suggestions for federal tax reform, too." He specifically cited proposals for marrying a broad-based national consumption tax with a wage tax on high earners to address concerns about fairness. 
Mr. Jindal, whose status as a likely candidate for the White House in 2016 has drawn particular attention to his proposal, has signaled that he wants his plan to be revenue neutral, meaning that every dollar of revenue lost from eliminating the personal and corporate income tax would have to be made up elsewhere. The only viable source for making up most of the money is raising the state's sales tax.
"We want to keep the sales tax as low and flat as possible," Mr. Jindal said in a statement this month outlining his approach.
He has not yet settled on any specifics for changing the sales tax, and his aides say he would include safeguards to assure that lower-income people are not made worse off. "With consumption taxes, it's all in the details," said Tracy Gordon, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who follows state tax and spending policies.
By focusing on sales tax revenue, Mr. Jindal has also opened up what many economists see as a fundamental issue for states. Sales taxes were developed in an era when sales of physical goods dominated the economy.
These days, the economy is built far more around services than goods. Hair spray is taxed, but not haircuts. So if states - or one day the federal government - want to shift toward a truly broad-based consumption tax, they would have to expand the definition of what people consume.
Officials in Louisiana have indicated that Mr. Jindal is at least open to looking at broadening the scope of the sales tax to include some services, potentially creating a new avenue for rethinking the tax system on both the state and national levels.
"If the sales tax is going to stay a viable source of revenues for state governments, you have to bring in services," Mr. Henchman said. "It's not just haircuts and tattoo parlors. It's lawyers and accountants and real estate agents."

HEADLINE: The Greenest and Meanest Cars in 2013

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The Toyota Prius C tops the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy's list of greenest cars. 

 BODY:
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has produced an annual list of the "greenest" and "meanest" vehicles for 15 years. Its 2013 Greenest winner is the downsized Toyota Prius C.
The council gives cars and trucks a green score derived from Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy and emissions data. The Prius C's score of 58 (with fuel economy at 53 city/46 highway) just topped the 57 rating of the battery electric Honda Fit EV.
The Fit was among two low-volume electric cars that made the Greenest list. The other was the Ford Focus Electric. Critics have called low-volume battery electrics "compliance cars," built in relatively low numbers mainly to satisfy California's zero-emission mandates. 
Shruti Vaidyanathan, the council's lead vehicle analyst, said in an interview that the annual list was intended to exclude cars with limited production, which is one reason the highly regarded Tesla Model S, whose production is just being started, was not included in the ratings. (Ms. Vaidyanathan also said that the council did not get relevant Tesla data from the E.P.A.) But Honda's intended Fit EV delivery is definitely low volume. "Our stated plan is 1,100 Fit EVs over two years," Chris Naughton, a Honda spokesman, said in an e-mail. The car will be available for lease only, with no purchase option.
Ms. Vaidyanathan said that including the Fit EV was a judgment call, based on the popularity of the standard Honda Fit and future expectations. The Ford Focus Electric, which is 10th on the Greenest list with a score of 52, has also been distributed in relatively low numbers, but Ms. Vaidyanathan cited research indicating that it would become a mass market vehicle. 
Robyn Eagles, a spokeswoman for Honda, said that the Fit EV was not a compliance car. "We're trying to understand the market," she said in an interview. "For the first few years, production may appear low, but we're simply gauging consumers' interest in these vehicles and will adjust volumes as needed."
Wes Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, said that 693 Focus electric cars were delivered through December.
"Our intent is to make fuel economy mass-market," he said in an interview. "We expect that for a considerable amount of time our electric battery car sales will be less than our hybrid and plug-in hybrid sales. We think we've gotten hybrids to the sweet spot where they make sense for more customers, but all-electrics will take longer, and it's clearly tied to the cost of the batteries." He said the electric Focus would soon be available in 50 states.
Therese Langer, the council's transportation program director, said in an interview that her organization did not have a rule about what constitutes a mass-market vehicle. "We try to avoid putting on our Greenest list those vehicles that are clearly not relevant to the consumer market," she said.
The council said in a statement that the battery-powered Mitsubishi I-MiEV, Scion iQ and Smart Electric Drive were also not included in the survey "because of anticipated modest sales volumes."
Despite somewhat disappointing sales, the Nissan Leaf battery car is clearly aiming for the mass market, but it is not in this year's council ratings. Ms. Langer said that the group lacked relevant E.P.A. data on the 2013 Leaf. A Nissan spokesman, Steve Oldham, said in an e-mail that the new Leaf, as shown at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit with a lower-price base model, is still being tested. Reports say the 2013 Leaf is expected to have a longer range.
The Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid received an "above average" class ranking, but its green score of 49 was not high enough to make the Greenest list.
The council also scores what it calls the "meanest" vehicles for the environment, and three Ford models tied for the lowest score of 17: the flex-fuel F-350, the flex-fuel F-250 (both in their four-wheel-drive versions) and the E-350 Wagon (a van). Supercars made the list, too, including the Bugatti Veyron and Bentley Mulsanne.

HEADLINE: Alan Blinder on the Lessons of the Financial Crisis

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with the Princeton economist, a former vice chairman of the Fed, about his new book, "After the Music Stopped." 

 BODY:
Alan S. Blinder describes his new book, "After the Music Stopped," as a "second draft" of the history of the financial crisis and the government's response. He argues that many Americans still do not understand what went wrong, and he contends that the government still does not get enough credit for the successes of its policies.
Prof. Blinder, a Princeton University economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, judges that the government itself is at fault. He writes in the book, "The two secretaries of the Treasury during the crisis period, Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner, have between them barely given a single coherent speech explaining what happened and - perhaps more important - why they did what they did."
And he is concerned that the resulting combination of public ignorance and outrage will impede the government's response the next time that a bubble pops. 
The first part of the book, the account of the crisis, is lucid and entertaining. There will never be complete agreement about the causes of the crisis, not least because the stories we tell about the past are shaped by the things we want from the future. But four years later, we have reached the point where those stories can be well told.
The second part, a qualified defense of the Obama administration, reads more like a first draft of history, and it is likely to prove more controversial. The events are more recent, the recovery is still a work in progress, and we won't know how well the government has prepared to deal with the next crisis until we get there.
The following is a condensed transcript of our recent e-mail exchange:
 Q. 
 You write, "Our best hope is to minimize the consequences when bubbles go splat -- and they inevitably will." How much confidence do you have that when the next bubble goes splat, we will be ready, willing and able to contain the damage? 
 A. 
Less than I wish I had. But I'm at least hopeful that some of the lessons we've learned, and some of the actions we've taken, will make the next bubble less damaging than the last ones. For example, we now understand better the dangers that lurk in high leverage, overly complex financial instruments, and lax (or nonexistent) regulation. 
 Q. 
 While you conclude that government policies were successful in arresting the crisis, you argue that the government should have imposed stronger conditions on banks that received aid, and that it should have acted more forcefully to help people facing foreclosure. Have those failures slowed the economic recovery? 
 A. 
Yes. For example, until very recently, one major factor behind the sluggish recovery was the failure of home building to rebound. And one major reason for that was the seemingly unending waves of foreclosures. How can a builder compete with foreclosed properties coming on the market at 50 percent of construction cost? A second significant headwind is the meager snap-back in bank lending. If the government had made more lending a condition of receiving aid, that would not have changed a D performance into an A. But it might have gotten us a C+ or a B-.
 Q. 
 I was surprised by the weight you place on a third failure: poor communication. Do you believe that the policies would have been more effective if the public better understood what the government was trying to do, or just that the administration would have been able to do more if it had retained public support? 
 A. 
It's more the latter: not being able to do more. But I also believe - as a small-d democrat - that the public is entitled to better explanations when they are being used as guinea pigs in a massive socioeconomic experiment. That said, my greater fear is that rampant misunderstanding of what was done in 2008-9 will make it harder for us, politically, to cope with the next crisis.
 Q. 
 Of all the choices made by policy makers during the crisis, you express the greatest anger over Secretary Paulson's three-page TARP bill, which sought to exempt the program from pretty much any oversight or accountability. You variously describe it as an "outrage" and "an assault on the Constitution." 
 A. 
Well, first of all, let's note that the mistake was rectified quickly, in large part because of the torrent of criticism that followed. So the actual damage was limited. But the original three-pager certainly didn't instill confidence in the Paulson Treasury - at a crucial time. I was particularly angry because it showed such disrespect for the Constitution, e.g., by banning judicial review. At the height of the crisis, we needed a dose of "big government" to save us from economic ruin. The first TARP proposal gave big government a bad name.
 Q. 
 You credit the Fed for its efforts to stabilize financial markets. But you also write that the bubble in bond prices "does start with the Federal Reserve's monetary policy." How much blame, then, does the Fed deserve for starting the fire it later extinguished? 
 A. 
The "error" of holding interest rates too low for too long was only obvious after the fact, not before. In fact, the Fed had good reasons to hold interest rates very low in the early 2000s: The recovery was pathetic, and we faced a real risk of deflation. And those who place primary blame for the house-price bubble on the Federal Reserve are exaggerating so much that it smacks of a put-on. When home buyers believe that house prices will keep on rising at 10 to 15 percent a year, would, say, a half-percentage-point increase in the mortgage interest rate stop speculation?
 Q. 
 The book ends with a new version of the Ten Commandments. The second is, "Thou shalt not rely on self-regulation." You describe the very term as "an oxymoron, maybe even a cruel deception." Yet your third, fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth commandments call on financial companies to do a better job of self-regulation. The ninth, for example, says compensation should be aligned with risk. You write, "This commandment ought to be enforced by C.E.O.'s and corporate boards; but if they won't do the job, we may need the heavy hand of government." Some people would say we've let that experiment run long enough. Why prioritize improved corporate conduct? 
 A. 
In truth, we need both. I say repeatedly in the book that foxes don't make good chicken-coop guards. We need far better government regulation and supervision than we had before the crisis. But supervisors cannot be everywhere. In the regulatory game of cat-and-mouse, the mice will sometimes (often?) fool the cats. This is particularly true, I think, in the area of executive compensation. We need - or perhaps I should say, we should hope for - better management and more alert boards of directors.

HEADLINE: Older, but Not Yet Retired

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: It has become much more common for Americans over 65 to continue working, if they can. 

 BODY:
The labor force participation rate has fallen drastically in the last few years, partly because a huge chunk of the American population -- the baby boomers -- is rolling into retirement age. But the aging of Americans born from 1946 to 1964 has not actually had as big a drag on labor-force participation rates as demographers might have guessed a few decades ago. 
That's because it has become much more common for people over 65 to continue working.
According to a new Census Bureau report, in 2010, 16.1 percent of the population 65 years and older was in the labor force, meaning either working or actively looking for work. Two decades earlier, that share was 12.1 percent.
The increased labor-force participation rate for the most senior Americans is partly tied to more women joining the work force over time, though men have shown large increases too:
Within the 65-and-over population, those from 65 to 69 had the biggest bump in labor-force participation. Across both genders in this narrower age range, the rate increased to 30.8 percent in 2010 from 21.8 percent in 1990, a 9 percentage point increase. (Interestingly, the share of people from 16 to 64 who were in the labor force moved in the opposite direction during that time, falling to 74 percent in 2010 from 75.6 percent in 1990.)
People may be working longer because they are in better health in their late 60s and expect to live longer than their counterparts a couple of decades earlier. But they may also have greater financial responsibilities today than in the past. 
In 2011, of workers who said they would be delaying their retirement, 13 percent explained that they had "inadequate finances or can't afford to retire" and 6 percent gave the reason of "needing to make up for losses in the stock market," according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The share of people who said they were having to retire later than expected has also been much higher in the last few years than it was when the economy was good.
To put all these numbers in context, it's worth remembering that labor-force participation rates for people over 65 used to be much higher in the late 1940s and 1950s:
Additionally, people over 65 in the United States are far more likely to be in the labor force than people in most other developed countries, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development:

HEADLINE: Kissinger: Political Threats to Global Economy Abound

BYLINE: LIZ ALDERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The American statesman made clear that while Davos Man and Woman are concerned about global economic gyrations, political problems most threaten the world. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland - Henry A. Kissinger has never shied from unvarnished political assessments and during an hour-long address to the World Economic Forum on Thursday, the former American secretary of state delivered a list of sober warnings about rising threats on the world stage.
Executives and policymakers here, fixated on economic gyrations and the environment for deals, sat riveted as the elder statesman, speaking in his trademark slow and sonorous tone, warned of political threats to the world order. And a nuclear Iran, Mr. Kissinger said, poses perhaps the biggest near-term threat to stability and diplomacy in the Middle East. 
The United States and other Western countries have accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapons program, while Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful. Mr. Kissinger urged President Barack Obama to give negotiations with Iran a chance. At the same time, he said, Iran must ask itself whether a failure to build nuclear capability is truly a challenge to the Iranian national identity.
A nuclear Iran "is approaching," he told the gathering. So in a few years, people will have to come to a determination of how to react, or the consequences of non-reaction," he said.
Unilateral intervention by Israel would be a "desperate last resort," Mr. Kissinger added. But if Iran continues to use negotiations simply to buy time to advance its nuclear program, "the consequences will be extremely dangerous." Surrounding Arab and Gulf states, which already have nuclear power programs, could make nuclear weapons their arsenal of choice.
"If a nuclear conflict arises," Mr. Kissinger said, "that would be a turning point for human history. So negotiations must move forward."
The tension is building as conflicts elsewhere in the region rage. The war in Syria remains a challenge for Western powers. He called on the United States and Russia to work together to resolve the crisis, but to step gingerly. If the outside world intervenes militarily, he said, "it will be in the middle of a vast ethnic conflict; and if it doesn't intervene militarily, it will be caught in a humanitarian tragedy."
A number of outcomes are possible in Syria, he added, including President Assad remaining in power, a victory by Sunni rebels, or the emergence of a loose coterie of ethnic groups. Whatever the outcome, "the more the outside world competes, the worse it gets," he said referring to Russia and the West, who have often worked at cross purposes.
Turning to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Kissinger said that while a consensus has developed on a desired outcome, "no one has been able to determine how to get there."
Only one thing was clear, he added. Any settlement would "require significant sacrifices on the Israeli side from the position they now hold," he said. And "there has to be some reciprocity from the Arab side other than uttering the word 'peace.'"
As for the festering European crisis, Mr. Kissinger advocated a political solution if an economic one ultimately stumbles. "The issue that needs to be resolved is the relationship between austerity and growth. And if there is no growth, how the economic void will be
filled," he said. In diplomacy terms, the question is the extent to which countries with money are willing to help those that are still flagging.
"If the answer is negative" then the idea of European unity is called into question, he said. Europe may need to shift its approach to unity through an economic construction to one of "political construction," he said.
At the end of the day, he added, "Europe should be maintained as an idea even if the ideal solution does not emerge."

HEADLINE: Day Care and Behavior Problems, Unlinked

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: When day care is consistently good, and consistently used, any negative effect on children's behavior disappears. 

 BODY:
Time spent in day care doesn't link to problems for older children - at least, not when that day-care time is separated from the socio-political context in which the care is provided. A team of researchers from Norway, Harvard and Boston College, examining the varied research that sporadically associates an increase in hours in day care with increased behavior problems, noted that the work was all based on child-care studies done in the United States. And the United States, they argue, is a lousy place to study the impact of early child care on children.
Most parents will remember the headlines from the last round of the "Does day care harm children?" battle here in the United States: "Does Day Care Make Kids Behave Badly? Study Says Yes" (ABC). "Child Care Leads to More Behavior Problems" (Fox). "Day-Care Kids Have Problems Later in Life" (NBC). "Poor Behavior Is Linked to Time in Day Care" (The New York Times). "Bad Mommies" (Slate). 
All that (and more) from a single, small finding, published in 2007, based on a study of 1,300 U.S. children from 4\xC2 years old through the end of sixth grade. Among those children, researchers found that those who spent a year or more in day care while of preschool age were slightly more likely to become disruptive in class during elementary school.
That this study set off yet another salvo in the debate over working parents said very little about the research, and far more about the world into which that research dropped. What that headline flurry really revealed was that we, as a society, still considered "whether working parents are good for kids" a topic worthy of arguing about.
While I'm accustomed to using the words "working parents" here, the debate, of course, centered around mothers. No one questions whether fathers should work. No one questions whether moms "should" work anymore, either - instead, we fall back on questioning whether all those various forms of child care are really "good" for children, the universally recognized code for raising that politically incorrect issue.
That debate has advanced since 2007, but not far enough to institutionalize any change. Mr. Mom may be dead, but when it comes to taking the heat for sending the children to day care, the burden still falls on the - married or single, rich or poor - mom. Even the U.S. Census Bureauconsiders the mother the "designated parent," charged with caring for the children; when fathers stay home, that's (infuriatingly for parents of both sexes) "child care."
It's the fact of the debate, rather than the fact of the day care, that the research team I described above, authors of a more recent study, suggest is primarily responsible for any association between unruly behavior and time spent in day care. In Norway, where day care is subsidized, of a reasonably consistent quality, and an expected part of childhood (in 2009, 79 percent of all 1- to 2-year-olds, and 97 percent of all 3- to 5-year-olds attended publicly subsidized center care there), researchers found little evidence that more time in day care could be associated with "externalizing problems" like defiance and restlessness, in 3-year-olds (a result they hope to confirm in older children).
In other words, when all the energy that goes into debating the merits of day care is put, instead, into ensuring that day care is of a high quality and available to everyone, then any association between time spent in that care and poor behavior essentially disappears. "Whereas child care in U.S. policy is generally treated as an unintended or unfortunate consequence of workforce participation among women," the researchers wrote, "child care in the Norwegian corporatist economy is part of a broader family policy to promote maternal workforce participation and employment rights ... as well as universal access to high-quality environments for learning and development beginning in the second year of life."
That's consistent with the U.S. research as well. In 2007, Slate's Emily Bazelon contacted the author of that much-publicized earlier study, and asked her to examine the quality of care received by the children who spent more time in day care, and who had a higher-than-average incidence of bad behavior. "The kids with more reported behavior problems in elementary school were the ones who spent three or four years in day care and whose care was, on average, of lower quality."
If, when day care is consistently high quality and embraced by a society, the (already small) negative impact of time spent in that care is erased, then it's hard to argue that it's the fact of the day care itself that causes the problem. But "Socio-political Context of Upbringing Linked to Unruly Behavior in Some Children" makes for an unwieldy headline, and an obvious one. There are a whole lot of factors that play into being a child who enters low-quality day care at a very young age, and stays there. But none of them get people as worked up as "day-care kids have problems."
Which may be why this latest research study - the one showing that day-care kids are doing just fine - hasn't grabbed any major headlines at all.
