HEADLINE: Standard & Poor's President to Step Down

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Deven Sharma's decision to leave comes at a time when the ratings agency is under pressure on several fronts.

 BODY:
11:20 p.m. | Updated 
The ratings agency Standard & Poor's said late on Monday that its president, Deven Sharma, who has become the public face of the firm in the wake of its historic downgrade on the United States' long-term debt rating, will step down and leave the company by the end of the year.
The decision by Mr. Sharma to resign comes as the ratings agency is under pressure from several fronts, including an inquiry by the Justice Department into its ratings of subprime mortgage securities and a push by activist investors to break up its parent company, McGraw-Hill.
Mr. Sharma will be replaced by Douglas Peterson, a top executive at Citigroup, the company said on Monday.
The management change had been in the works for months and was unrelated to either the Justice Department's inquiry or to the emergence of the activist investors, Jana Partners and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to people briefed on the matter.
Mr. Sharma, 55, will step down on Sept. 12, but will remain with the company through the end of the year to help oversee McGraw-Hill's review of its businesses.
His replacement, Mr. Peterson, 53, is currently the chief operating officer of Citibank, the banking unit of Citigroup.
"We are pleased to welcome Doug to the important role of president of Standard & Poor's as it continues to build on the enhancements of recent years and accelerates global growth," Harold McGraw III, McGraw-Hill's chief executive, said in a statement.
He added, "As we welcome Doug, I particularly want to thank Deven for his dedicated leadership of S.&P."
One of the most recognized names in finance, Standard & Poor's is composed of two separate businesses. One is its credit rating agency, a vital cog in global capitalism that monitors the corporate world's debt issuances. The other is a unit that manages its index products like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The ratings agency's decision to downgrade the United States' long-term credit rating to AA+ from AAA on Aug. 5 set off a storm of controversy, including criticism by President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. The decision contributed heavily to the worst drop in American stocks since the financial crisis three years ago, as well as volatility that continues to whipsaw the markets weeks later. The other big ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, maintained their top-tier rating on United States debt.
At the same time, the agency is being investigated over whether it improperly rated mortgage securities in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Standard & Poor's, along with the other major ratings agencies, gave their highest ratings to bundles of troubled loans that appeared less risky during the housing boom, but have since collapsed in value.
Since the financial crisis, the agencies' business practices and models have been scrutinized by Congress, and Standard & Poor's is also being investigated by the Justice Department, people briefed on the matter have previously said. At issue is whether the agency's independent analysis was driven by profits. The Justice Department inquiry, which began before the Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States' debt, is centered on whether analysts' decisions to assign securities a low credit rating on subprime mortgage loans were overruled by business managers.
Meanwhile, the activist investors pushing for change at McGraw-Hill have recommended that Standard & Poor's ratings business appoint a "well-known independent oversight figure" to handle government relations.
But people briefed on the matter said Mr. Sharma had been considering stepping down well before the latest attacks on the company. They say that Mr. Sharma first began pondering his options after McGraw-Hill announced last November that Standard & Poor's would be split into its two component businesses.
That corporate reorganization left Mr. Sharma with less responsibility, leading him to ask about his odds of eventually becoming the company's chief executive. He was informed that such a move would be unlikely, prompting his desire to leave, one of these people said. Then McGraw-Hill began a search for his successor at Standard & Poor's, this person added.
Mr. Sharma has been with the company for just under five years, and became president of Standard & Poor's almost exactly four years ago. His appointment coincided with the beginning of one of the most controversial and tumultuous periods in the history of the 151-year-old company, which was acquired by McGraw-Hill in 1966.
McGraw-Hill's board eventually signed off on his resignation in a meeting on Monday.
That was the same day that top executives met with representatives from Jana and Ontario Teachers, who presented a plan to split the company into four groups: an education business, a media and information arm, S.&P.'s ratings and financial business and its Standard & Poor's indexes.
The investors' rationale is that the four units share little in common operationally and have different, and sometimes conflicting, capital needs. And the high-growth operations like S.&P.'s have been hidden by the low growth at divisions like publishing and education.
Many of Jana's recommendations are in line with the thinking of research analysts. According to Goldman Sachs, McGraw-Hill is undervalued by 20 percent compared with its peers.
McGraw-Hill was already reviewing its portfolio of businesses by the time Jana, a hedge fund based in New York, and the Ontario Teachers fund, of Canada, built up their stake to 5.6 percent. Mr. McGraw has said the company expects to make a major announcement in the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: Governing in the Gap

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: It's important to remember that lofty ideals can't always control for circumstances.

 BODY:
Recently I had a chance to meet the great Israeli writer David Grossman at a writer's conference in Sun Valley, Idaho (life is good). He was mostly talking about his novel, "To the End of the Land," but I was equally struck by his collection of essays, "Writing in the Dark." I was struck by this passage:
"To our great misfortune, we in Israel have been living for almost a century in a state of violent conflict, which has an enormous influence on all realms of life, including, of course, on language. When a country or a society finds itself-no matter for what reason-in a prolonged state of incongruity between its founding values and its political circumstances, a rift can emerge between the society and its identity, between the society and its 'inner voice.' The more complex and contradictory the situation becomes the more society has to compromise in order to contain all its disparities, the more it creates different systems for itself, an ad hoc system of norms, of 'emergency values,' keeping double books of its identity."
This passage nicely describes Israel, which was founded with such high ideals and now finds itself in a bloody situation. But I think it also, in a milder way, describes the Obama administration and maybe every administration. The Obama administration was elected with such high hopes and had such a lofty self-conception. Then it found itself immediately enmeshed in a financial crisis, undertaking the most remarkable policies. Then it found itself enmeshed in a series of bitter, polarized disputes.
A gap opened up between the way members of the administration conceived of their identity and the ways they actually behaved. There was a sort of double bookkeeping, forced by circumstances. They developed one set of standards for how they would like to conduct government and another for how they were compelled to.
The administration came into power swathed in the Exodus rhetoric that was borrowed from the civil rights movement. We will march together toward unity. The march will be long and hard but we will make it.
That identity is no longer relevant and it will be interesting to see how they construct a new one for the 2012 campaign. If I were presumptuous enough to offer them advice (who me?), I'd suggest they watch the Russell Crowe movie "Cinderella Man," about a boxer who'd been through a few savage rounds, but managed to persevere through hardship caused by others and himself.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Celebrates the Magic of Entertainment and the Jobs

BYLINE: ADRIANE QUINLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor went to the soundstage for the drama "Pan Am" in the Brooklyn Navy Yard to champion New York City's growing role as the place to make TV shows and movies.

 BODY:
Once upon a time in New York, the Brooklyn Navy Yard was bustling with ships, and a destination known as Idlewild Airport was home to a terminal for Pan Am. 
Those days are long gone. 
But on Monday morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg found himself in the Navy Yard, flanked by women dressed in retro Pan Am uniforms. The women were actresses from "Pan Am,'' a television drama that shoots on a soundstage at Steiner Studios in the Navy Yard, which recreates the look of Pan Am's terminal in 1963, pre-Bloomberg-era health codes (as in, you could still smoke on a plane).
Like a good location scout, Mr. Bloomberg had chosen the studios, noisy from construction vehicles working on an expansion, as the place to give a speech on how the film and television industry has become an economic boon for New York.

"New York's done very well compared to the rest of the country and it's because we've diversified our industries," Mr. Bloomberg said. The mayor said that 23 prime-time television series are shooting in the city in studios from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to Astoria, Queens. 
"These shows really are providing a great boost to our economy and creating jobs at a time when we really need them," Mr. Bloomberg said. "And in fact our growth and our production and entertainment industry is one of the reasons we create jobs at a faster clip than the rest of the nation." 
The entertainment industry in New York is a $5 billion business in New York and employs 100,000 workers. 
"We expect the industry to keep growing and we've made investments to make sure that it will, for example: here at the Navy Yard," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
Not far from where the mayor was speaking, cement trucks were whirling - filling the floors for five new commercial studios, which will double the size of the studio and create an estimated 2,000 jobs. 
While New York has a rich history of serving as a backdrop for directors who would then shoot the rest of the film on sound stages in Los Angeles, today directors use Brooklyn soundstages rather than fly West. Mr. Bloomberg noted that the producers of "Pan Am,'' which will air on ABC this fall, had even used the streets of New York to recreate Berlin in the 1960s.
Thomas Schlamme, an executive producer for the show, said that taping in New York allowed the show to tap the city's artistic resources. "Yes, we could do it anywhere," he said. "But the truth is there was a talent pool. Artistically it was greatly to my advantage. In the end you have to have the right people and the right skills." 
The mayor credited the city's role as the "intellectual capital of the country" as a reason it is so attractive to filmmakers. While Katherine Oliver, the commissioner of the mayor's office of media and entertainment, which distributes permits among other duties, spoke about the city's "customer service" and the ease of acquiring a permit in the city drew talent. 
The proliferation of television and film shoots in the city has led to complaints in some neighborhoods, particularly over cars that residents say have been towed with proper warnings. But Mr. Bloomberg said the benefits outweigh the costs. 
"Some people will be slightly inconvenienced," he said. "But it's for a short period of time. On the other hand it's how an awful lot of people - 100,000 of them make their living. And the city's job is to find that balance." 
Ms. Oliver noted that one challenge has been to help productions find what she termed "gritty neighborhoods." 
"You know what?," she said. "They don't exist anymore. It's hard to find them."

HEADLINE: Cerberus Ends $1.1 Billion Innkeepers Deal

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Cerberus Capital Management and the Chatham Lodging Trust cited a "material adverse change" in calling off a $1.1 billion deal to buy 64 hotels owned by the Innkeepers USA Trust out of bankruptcy.

 BODY:
Cerberus Capital Management and the Chatham Lodging Trust announced on Monday that they had called off a $1.1 billion deal to buy 64 hotels owned by the Innkeepers USA Trust out of bankruptcy. 
In a brief statement, the two companies said the decision arose from a determination that Innkeepers had suffered what is known as a "material adverse change" in its operating performance. Cerberus and Chatham did not elaborate on what the so-called MAC was, but said it would probably have a prolonged negative effect on the company's business.
The two companies had agreed in May to buy the hotels from Innkeepers, which operated hotels for chains like Hilton and Marriott. It filed for bankruptcy in July 2010 after buckling under a debt load that arose from its sale to Apollo Global Management. 
In June, the federal judge overseeing Innkeeper's bankruptcy case approved the sale, which was meant to lift the company out of Chapter 11 protection.
Invoking a MAC has been relatively rare since the passing of the financial crisis. Several investment firms used MAC clauses in their deal agreements to walk away from leveraged buyouts reached during the private equity boom.
Perhaps the most notable example was J. C. Flowers & Company's bitter fight to walk away from its deal to buy the SLM Corporation, better known as Sallie Mae.
In 2007, Cerberus tried to walk away from its $4 billion buyout of United Rentals -- but in that case, it did not cite a MAC as a reason to cancel the deal. Instead, it said it would pay a $100 million breakup fee. 
United Rentals retaliated with a lawsuit in November that year, but was defeated in court and forced to let Cerberus withdraw from its commitment.

HEADLINE: Conservation, Beyond Boundaries

 BODY:
Over the past 25 years, the number of conservation areas set aside for the nonhuman species has grown considerably. Globally, there are now more than 100,000 protected areas, including national parks, biological reserves and marine sanctuaries. All told, they protect slightly less than 13 percent of the land on earth and slightly more than a half-percent of the oceans, though only a minute fraction are ''no-take'' zones that bar fishing. But can these protected areas do enough to protect biological diversity? 
According to a recent survey of scientific literature published in Marine Ecology Progress Series, the answer is almost certainly no. Even as protected areas have increased, biological diversity has plummeted. The losses stem from causes that are economic and political, intentional and inadvertent, but they are wholly anthropogenic in nature. Humans directly affect roughly 83 percent of the earth's terrestrial surface and all of the aquatic realm.
Protected areas are a vital conservation tool and have helped nurse some species back to health. Their limits become obvious when you look at studies tracking aquatic predators -- tuna, sharks, seals and whales -- and endangered leatherback turtles in the Pacific Ocean.
In the case of the leatherbacks, for instance, efforts have been made to protect their critically important nesting grounds. But the turtles also forage actively over incredible distances, crossing the Pacific from Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands to the California coast. Other predators show similar ranges. Saving animals that range freely across thousands of miles will require more from us than creating safe zones at our current rate.

HEADLINE: Ford and Toyota to Work Together on Hybrid System for Trucks

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Company and Toyota Motor said on Monday that they would jointly develop a gas-electric hybrid fuel system for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles aimed at keeping larger models affordable as the automakers work to meet stricter fuel-economy standards.
The companies said they did not plan to collaborate on developing the vehicles themselves, instead using the hybrid system they develop to power separate models under the Ford and Toyota brands. The resulting hybrid trucks would go on sale later this decade, they said, without providing a more specific timeframe. 
''Clearly Ford and Toyota will remain competitors,'' said Derrick Kuzak, Ford's group vice president for research and development. ''By working together, we will be able to offer our customers more affordable technology sooner.''
In addition, Ford and Toyota said they intended to collaboratively develop new technology for information and entertainment systems in vehicles, with the goal of offering more Internet-based services and useful data to drivers. The companies already are among the industry's leaders in this area, known as telematics, and their partnership could give them enough leverage to essentially dictate the standards that other automakers use to wirelessly connect mobile phones and other devices to vehicles.
The partnership sprang from informal talks between the chief executives of the two companies, Alan R. Mulally at Ford and Akio Toyoda at Toyota, that began when the two accidentally crossed paths at an airport, according to Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota's executive vice president for research and development. Teams led by Mr. Kuzak and Mr. Uchiyamada began working together in April.
They said many specifics of the deal had yet to be determined. The companies signed a memorandum of understanding Monday and expect to enter into a formal agreement next year, after completing a feasibility study that will help them lay out more detailed plans.
Ford makes the top-selling truck in the United States, the F-150, and Toyota is the leading producer of hybrid vehicles, having sold 3.3 million since introducing the popular Prius car in 1997.
Neither company sells a hybrid truck, and other automakers have had little success doing so.
But proposed fuel-economy standards, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency last month, that would require automakers to build much more fuel-efficient vehicles in the years ahead are forcing them to explore more advanced technology. By collaborating, Ford and Toyota hope to reduce the costs and development time of such work and keep hybrid trucks from becoming too expensive or lacking in performance.
''The E.P.A. fuel standards are a big challenge for us automakers,'' Mr. Uchiyamada said through a translator. ''Trucks and S.U.V.'s are vehicles that the American society cannot do without. This collaboration we are forming with Ford is not only about lowering carbon dioxide but making light-duty trucks and S.U.V.'s more affordable.''
The hybrid system they plan to develop would be for rear-wheel-drive vehicles. The Toyota Prius and Ford's hybrids, including the Fusion sedan and Escape small sport utility vehicle, are front-wheel drive.
Ford and Toyota have not worked together on product development efforts until now, though such partnerships are increasingly common in the industry. Ford is involved in joint development efforts on some transmissions with General Motors and on diesel powertrains in Europe with PSA Peugeot Citroen.
''This is the kind of collaborative effort that is required to address the big global challenges of energy independence and environmental sustainability,'' Mr. Mulally said in a statement.

HEADLINE: President of S.&P., Its Public Face During U.S. Downgrade, Resigns

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
11:20 p.m. Updated
The ratings agency Standard & Poor's said late on Monday that its president, Deven Sharma, who has become the public face of the firm in the wake of its historic downgrade on the United States' long-term debt rating, will step down and leave the company by the end of the year.
The decision by Mr. Sharma to resign comes as the ratings agency is under pressure from several fronts, including an inquiry by the Justice Department into its ratings of subprime mortgage securities and a push by activist investors to break up its parent company, McGraw-Hill. 
Mr. Sharma will be replaced by Douglas Peterson, a top executive at Citigroup, the company said on Monday.
The management change had been in the works for months and was unrelated to either the Justice Department's inquiry or to the emergence of the activist investors, Jana Partners and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to people briefed on the matter.
Mr. Sharma, 55, will step down on Sept. 12, but will remain with the company through the end of the year to help oversee McGraw-Hill's review of its businesses.
His replacement, Mr. Peterson, 53, is currently the chief operating officer of Citibank, the banking unit of Citigroup.
''We are pleased to welcome Doug to the important role of president of Standard & Poor's as it continues to build on the enhancements of recent years and accelerates global growth,'' Harold McGraw III, McGraw-Hill's chief executive, said in a statement.
He added, ''As we welcome Doug, I particularly want to thank Deven for his dedicated leadership of S.&P.''
One of the most recognized names in finance, Standard & Poor's is composed of two separate businesses. One is its credit rating agency, a vital cog in global capitalism that monitors the corporate world's debt issuances. The other is a unit that manages its index products like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The ratings agency's decision to downgrade the United States' long-term credit rating to AA+ from AAA on Aug. 5 set off a storm of controversy, including criticism by President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. The decision contributed heavily to the worst drop in American stocks since the financial crisis three years ago, as well as volatility that continues to whipsaw the markets weeks later. The other big ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, maintained their top-tier rating on United States debt.
At the same time, the agency is being investigated over whether it improperly rated mortgage securities in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Standard & Poor's, along with the other major ratings agencies, gave their highest ratings to bundles of troubled loans that appeared less risky during the housing boom, but have since collapsed in value.
Since the financial crisis, the agencies' business practices and models have been scrutinized by Congress, and Standard & Poor's is also being investigated by the Justice Department, people briefed on the matter have previously said. At issue is whether the agency's independent analysis was driven by profits. The Justice Department inquiry, which began before the Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States' debt, is centered on whether analysts' decisions to assign securities a low credit rating on subprime mortgage loans were overruled by business managers.
Meanwhile, the activist investors pushing for change at McGraw-Hill have recommended that Standard & Poor's ratings business appoint a ''well-known independent oversight figure'' to handle government relations.
But people briefed on the matter said Mr. Sharma had been considering stepping down well before the latest attacks on the company. They say that Mr. Sharma first began pondering his options after McGraw-Hill announced last November that Standard & Poor's would be split into its two component businesses.
That corporate reorganization left Mr. Sharma with less responsibility, leading him to ask about his odds of eventually becoming the company's chief executive. He was informed that such a move would be unlikely, prompting his desire to leave, one of these people said. Then McGraw-Hill began a search for his successor at Standard & Poor's, this person added.
Mr. Sharma has been with the company for just under five years, and became president of Standard & Poor's almost exactly four years ago. His appointment coincided with the beginning of one of the most controversial and tumultuous periods in the history of the 151-year-old company, which was acquired by McGraw-Hill in 1966.
McGraw-Hill's board eventually signed off on his resignation in a meeting on Monday.
That was the same day that top executives met with representatives from Jana and Ontario Teachers, who presented a plan to split the company into four groups: an education business, a media and information arm, S.&P.'s ratings and financial business and its Standard & Poor's indexes.
The investors' rationale is that the four units share little in common operationally and have different, and sometimes conflicting, capital needs. And the high-growth operations like S.&P.'s have been hidden by the low growth at divisions like publishing and education.
Many of Jana's recommendations are in line with the thinking of research analysts. According to Goldman Sachs, McGraw-Hill is undervalued by 20 percent compared with its peers.
McGraw-Hill was already reviewing its portfolio of businesses by the time Jana, a hedge fund based in New York, and the Ontario Teachers fund, of Canada, built up their stake to 5.6 percent. Mr. McGraw has said the company expects to make a major announcement in the second half of the year.
Azam Ahmed and Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Libya and Oil Prices

BYLINE: By UNA GALANI and REYNOLDS HOLDING

 BODY:
The endgame in Libya could herald a slump in oil prices. As with the rebel advance into Tripoli, Libyan supplies to the global market could come sooner than expected. Brent crude prices slipped by as much as $3 to almost $106 a barrel at one point on Monday, before rebounding later in the day. A resolution in Libya, coupled with concerns over global growth, means tight markets could soon look oversupplied.
A return of Libyan oil production to levels before the unrest, 1.7 million barrels a day, or 2 percent of global supply, would take until 2015, according to a June estimate from the International Energy Agency. The forecast may now look too pessimistic, with the rebel-controlled Arabian Gulf Oil Company, Repsol of Spain, and Eni of Italy all suggesting that normal supply could resume much faster once the crisis is resolved. Analysts estimate that daily production could reach up to a million barrels within a year. 
Oil prices have eased almost $20 a barrel in four months. A supply increase, just as the American and European economies look vulnerable to a new recession, will further weigh on prices. And Saudi Arabia's recent effort to offset the disruption from Libya, taking production to a record high of almost 10 million barrels a day, will act to compound any supply glut, as will the International Energy Agency's release of reserves.
Yet any price slump is likely to be less severe than in 2008, when oil prices crashed by more than $100 a barrel in six months. This time around, credit lines remain open to businesses. And oil demand remains strong from certain rapidly growing countries like China, which account for almost 50 percent of total global consumption, compared with 44 percent in 2008, according to Barclays Capital.
Politics will further support prices. Investors remain alert for signs that the protest movement could spread to larger oil producers like Iran. And even if prices do continue to fall, high-spending gulf countries have an incentive to cut production quickly. Saudi Arabia's budget needs roughly $84 a barrel to break even, compared with around $50 a barrel three years ago. But with Brent prices some way off the pain threshold for producers, there's still room for adjustment.
A Murky Patent War
Today's costly technology patent wars in many ways can be pinned on the courts. Google, Apple, Microsoft and others are spending billions of dollars for the rights to the ideas powering devices like smartphones. But what they're actually buying is legal protection. The next wave of rulings ought to sync up the law with the real world.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is the exclusive forum for patent appeals, created in 1982 to keep the law consistent. But that consistency produced decisions upholding patents so broadly it was hard to tell exactly what they covered.
In the 1990s, for example, software patent approvals began. Unlike with other inventions, they required only general descriptions -- not code or other information specifying how concepts worked. The court used similarly loose standards to approve patents for business methods and certain technology.
Judges may have been trying to promote innovation. But the practical result has been overlapping claims to some of tech's most valuable ideas. It means firms like Google cannot identify all the patents that may cover, say, the Android mobile operating system. The company's chief legal officer says as many as 250,000 patents might apply to a smartphone.
That has led companies to introduce their products first and face consequences later. In the case of Android, Microsoft has asked Samsung to pay as much as $15 for each device using the software because of accusations of infringement. Microsoft is also suing in federal court to ban Motorola's Android phones.
The latest tack, though, is to deter lawsuits and royalty demands by acquiring patent portfolios. By doing so, companies can counter infringement threats with claims of their own. It is also a way to establish detente.
A more reasonable approach would be stricter approval standards. The Supreme Court seemed to agree last year when it affirmed the rejection of a proposed business-method patent. The decision comes too late for companies that have spent freely for infringement fights. But it bodes well for those that would rather use patents to promote innovation than squelch it.

HEADLINE: Where Crime Is Up Across the Board, More Police but Not Many Jitters

BYLINE: By AL BAKER; Robert Caplin for The New York Times

 BODY:
Though crime is all around him, Sal Bucak is not afraid of the streets.
True, he said, thieves last week snatched his neighbor's cellphone at the No. 1 train's entrance, down the block from their homes in Upper Manhattan. Detectives told him it was the second strike in days by criminals at the West 190th Street stop.
And yes, he said, some Catholic nuns did dial 911 two weeks earlier, after seeing a burglar sneaking into his building on Fort Washington Avenue -- one in a series of residential break-ins, usually via fire escapes and windows left open to salve a summer night's heat.
Still, Mr. Bucak said that all the shootings, killings and drug dealing that led his neighbors to call this area of Washington Heights and Inwood a mini-Vietnam two decades ago made the recent spike in crime seem tame. 
''This sudden increase in crime, in the last month or two, I'm more worried about the politicians than the break-in guys,'' Mr. Bucak, 68, a retired architect, said last week as he sat on a bench near Fort Tryon Park, looking out over the streets where he and his wife have lived for the last 30 years.
Nonetheless, for a Police Department that closely tracks shifts in crime numbers, a disquieting truth has emerged: the 34th Precinct, which covers Washington Heights and Inwood in Manhattan, is the only precinct to show an increase this year in criminal complaints in each of the seven major categories measured by the department's CompStat program. (Over all, the precinct is up 23.6 percent in major crimes.)
As crime has increased, the department has made a flurry of strategic deployment decisions involving uniformed and plainclothes officers, as well as the precinct's commander, Deputy Inspector Jose A. Navarro, who was transferred to a less exalted job in the department's hierarchy last week.
Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said early last week that Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly ''never talks about transfers.'' But several people within the department said the move reflected a numbers-driven culture in which commanders bear intense pressure to outperform past crime-fighting successes. Two people said Inspector Navarro, who took over the 34th Precinct in October 2009, endured a difficult CompStat session two weeks ago in which commanders at One Police Plaza grilled him about the area's burglary and larceny numbers.
''It sends a message to other commanders,'' one officer, who insisted on anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, said of the commander's move.
The 34th Precinct is one of 34 precincts that show an increase in overall crime from the first of the year through Aug. 14, compared with the same span a year ago; 42 precincts show a decline in crime over that period.
To be sure, the current spikes in the 34th Precinct are not in violent crime or shootings, but in burglary and grand larceny -- property crimes often involving the theft of jewelry, electronic devices like smartphones or even victims' identities.
With that in mind, a borough-wide team of plainclothes officers specially trained in investigating grand larcenies was dispatched to the 34th Precinct in early July, said Assistant Chief William T. Morris, who oversees the 12 precincts north of 59th Street. That team augmented an influx of uniformed Manhattan North Task Force officers sent in to supplement the precinct's standard patrol force.
Earlier this month, Chief Morris said, an Operation Impact zone, which had been withdrawn from the precinct in the winter, was re-established, with teams of 50 new officers and seasoned supervisors assigned to a grid of streets east of Broadway: from Wadsworth to Amsterdam Avenues, between West 181st and West 193 Streets.
Four smaller burglary zones have also been set up. In these precisely mapped hot spots, plainclothes anticrime teams move in buildings' shadows, and uniformed officers walk up and down interior staircases. Community affairs officers remind residents to lock their doors and windows. Detectives inspect secondhand dealers' licenses and urge pawn shop operators to put their written records online.
''Look at these pin maps,'' Chief Morris said on Thursday, standing over colorful maps of the 34th Precinct's burglary zones spread across his desk. ''We know where they are occurring. We know where and when to focus our resources. It's done on a day-to-day basis. It isn't just a broad-banded 'Go here; go there.' It's very scientific.''
Community leaders said they welcomed the influx of new officers, but some said they opposed the departure of Inspector Navarro. His transfer was first reported by The New York Post on Aug. 17 .
George R. Espinal, the president of the 34th Precinct Community Council, said that three Democratic elected officials -- Senator Adriano Espaillat, Assemblyman Guillermo Linares and City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez -- could not dissuade Mr. Kelly from approving the transfer, and he said that the council was gathering letters from residents opposed to it.
In one letter, Elizabeth Norment, a resident who is a spokeswoman for the Anti-Noise Coalition of Inwood, said Inspector Navarro had improved the area's quality of life. ''His departure could seriously compromise the momentum he has created in crime prevention and community relations in Inwood and Washington Heights,'' she wrote.
Mr. Linares, in an interview in his office on Sherman Avenue, outlined a rich and sometimes tumultuous history of police-community relations in Washington Heights. Though he said the current lagging economy, punctuated by high unemployment, was seemingly making people ''more desperate,'' he was committed to maintaining the neighborhood's hard-won sense of safety and public order.
''This is a community that's nowhere near where it was in the '90s, when we were in a war against drugs and violence,'' he said.
In the northern areas of the precinct, along Dyckman Street and Broadway, the influx of young professionals and college students is evident, as couples push baby strollers and families gather around restaurants' sidewalk tables. Mr. Linares said that the area had become a magnet for clubs and other businesses and that waves of Mexican immigrants had been joining the Dominicans who began arriving in great numbers several decades ago.
On Fort Washington Avenue off West 181st Street, Edwin Algarin, a real estate agent, said he feared that crime could worsen. ''All of a sudden, I don't know what's going on here,'' he said as a steady crush of traffic inched south toward the George Washington Bridge. ''Maybe we ought to send Bloomberg a message: 'Send more cops, something's wrong.' ''
Of the seven homicides in the precinct this year, four have led to arrests, and detectives are focusing on suspects in two others. The murder of Miguel Rodriguez, 21, of Yonkers, remains the most mysterious. Mr. Rodriguez was killed early on Aug. 3 outside Dyckman Furniture by a single bullet that struck the side of his head. Investigators say they believe that Mr. Rodriguez and some friends clashed with another group.
Ivan Rodriguez, 32, who works in the furniture store, said the neighborhood seemed safer than it did years ago, even with the shooting. Still, he said he wished there were more officers walking beats and standing on street corners, rather than just riding in patrol cars and making traffic stops, which is what he mostly sees.
''I feel like it can get worse than it is,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''That can definitely happen.''

HEADLINE: In Latest Deals, Big Roles for Boutique Investment Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
For merger advisers this year, it has been good to be an independent.
Two big deals last week - Google's $12.5 billion takeover bid for Motorola Mobility and Hewlett-Packard's $11.7 billion purchase of Autonomy - underscored the growing influence of boutique investment banks. Among the firms that helped propel the two transactions were Qatalyst Partners, Centerview Partners and Perella Weinberg Partners, as well as the biggest independent investment bank, Lazard.
Only Barclays Capital, which advised H.P., is a full-service bank that can lay claim to a significant role in either deal. While other big names were listed as advisers to Autonomy, nearly all were added at the last minute, according to people briefed on the matter who asked for anonymity because the discussion among the banks was private. ''Last week was a boutique week,'' said Peter Weinberg, a scion of a legendary Goldman Sachs family who co-founded Perella Weinberg. ''It's a strip of the financial services market that's experiencing secular growth.'' 
Since the passing of the financial crisis, boutique investment banks have claimed that their time has come. Their pitch is relatively simple: we sell advice and advice alone. They have no research arms or proprietary trading businesses, which trade for the bank's own account, that could lead to a conflict of interest.
Boutiques, as well as their larger publicly traded cousins like Lazard and Evercore Partners, have largely risen in the league tables so far this year, bolstered by their work on big deals like AT&T's $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA and Express Scripts' merger agreement with Medco Health Services. (Greenhill & Company and Evercore advised AT&T alongside JPMorgan Chase. Medco retained Lazard as well as JPMorgan.)
Led by the technology banker Frank P. Quattrone, Qatalyst has climbed to 29th place in Thomson Reuters' league tables as of Monday, thanks to its role as adviser to Motorola, Autonomy and others. It has earned an estimated $34.2 million in fees this year, according to Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting. Mr. Quattrone founded Qatalyst in 2008 after emerging victorious from a long legal battle against obstruction-of-justice charges. In just its second year of operations, the firm was ranked 79th and earned an estimated $14 million.
Centerview Partners, which was founded five years ago, has laid claim to a number of big mandates this year, including advising Express Scripts, Motorola and Capital One Financial in its purchase of the ING Group's American online banking arm. It is also one of three advisers to Kraft Foods in its planned spinoff of its North American grocery business. That has led to an estimated $71.7 million in fees.
To a firm, the boutiques were founded by longtime deal makers from established names - Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse among them - who say they want to recreate the investment bank of old.
Some are growing at a rapid clip. Moelis & Company was founded in 2007 by Kenneth D. Moelis, a former top UBS banker, and has embarked on a hiring spree, as well as opening offices in far-flung places like Dubai and Sydney, Australia. (It is now ranked 20th, ahead of RBC Capital Markets and the Jefferies Group, and has earned an estimated $112.3 million.)
And Perella Weinberg has built up an asset management arm that now oversees more than $8.2 billion in capital.
Still, for many of these firms the model is Felix Rohatyn of Lazard or Sidney Weinberg, Peter Weinberg's grandfather, of Goldman. Those bankers concentrated on advising clients on an array of matters, deals or otherwise. Such matters may not always become public, according to executives from these firms.
''We do consider ourselves to be consiglieres to C.E.O.'s and to boards,'' said Robert A. Pruzan, a Centerview co-founder who was formerly the president of Wasserstein Perella.
Yet each firm appears to have its own take on the independent model. Mr. Pruzan says that his firm is staked on big transactions for longtime clients like Kraft and PepsiCo, while Qatalyst has built itself up as a tech specialist that so far has fetched big premiums for the companies it sells.
But despite some claims from boutiques born after the financial crisis, such firms are unlikely to dislodge the top full-service banks from the league tables.
At No. 2 on Thomson Reuters' league tables as of Monday, JPMorgan Chase has worked on 207 deals worth $390 billion. The three top independent banks in the tables - Lazard, Evercore and Greenhill - combined have worked on 212 deals worth nearly $394 billion.
Unlike boutiques, the full-service banks benefit from their vast trading arms and other operations. They can provide a fuller picture of how the capital markets may react to a potential deal as well as the necessary financing for a transaction. Barclays Capital, for instance, committed to providing 5 billion ($8.2 billion) to H.P. for its Autonomy deal, which Perella Weinberg could not do.
And many assignments for boutiques are providing fairness opinions to boards, which generate lower fees than active deal management. While they won't turn down the work, bankers acknowledge that they seek a mix of both kinds of tasks to grow.
Still, these firms say that there can be a healthy balance between the big banks and their smaller brethren.
''The boutiques should have a meaningful share of the M.&A. market, but not half, or even close,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''The big firms have a critical role to play, particularly on the financing side.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shares Manage a Small Rise After Enduring a Long Losing Streak

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Clifford Krauss and Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Coming off four straight weeks of brutal losses, stocks ended barely higher on Monday, as investors' attention turned to the Federal Reserve's annual symposium later this week in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
After rising earlier in the session, stocks gave up most of their gains in the afternoon. Some analysts said that they expected the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to react to recent signs of weakness in the economy by announcing further, if limited, economic stimulus when he speaks on Friday at the symposium.
Measures of global financial stress that have been rising recently, like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and United States Treasury bond prices, eased. But in a sign that deep worries about global growth and Europe's debt crisis still remain, gold kept up its rapid ascent of recent weeks to close up 2.2 percent at $1,888.70. 
''Gold continues to earn its place among investors who want to be protected against growth risk and Europe risk,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
Oil, however, was buffeted by events in Libya as investors anticipated a return to international markets of one of the world's biggest oil producers. Brent crude oil prices, the European benchmark price for oil, initially dropped more than 3 percent, but at the close fell 26 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $108.36.
The American benchmark crude, which is less driven by events in the Middle East, rose $2.01, or 2.4 percent, to $84.42 for October delivery.
The Dow Jones industrial average began the day higher after optimism on Libya. By the end of the day, it was up only 37 points, or 0.34 percent, at 10,854.65.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which opened higher but flirted with losses midday, closed up 0.29 of a point, or 0.03 percent, at 1,123.82. The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.54 points, or 0.15 percent higher, to 2,345.38.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 12/32, to 100 5/32. The yield rose to 2.11 percent, from 2.07 percent late Friday.
Shares in Goldman Sachs dropped 4.7 percent. They fell sharply before the close after Reuters said that its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, had hired a prominent defense lawyer.
Shares of Hewlett-Packard, which had suffered in recent sessions, ended up 3.6 percent.
Last week, stocks in general fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street experienced more wild swings, including a 419-point drop for the Dow on Thursday.
Some analysts said that the recent sell-offs now presented a buying opportunity for investors.
''We suspect that the recent market downdraft will eventually be viewed as a buying opportunity for those who are willing to look beyond the most recent data point,'' Barclays Capital analysts said in a research note.
Traders are now focusing their attention on weekly jobless claims data expected to be released Thursday. But the main event will be Mr. Bernanke's assessment Friday of the economy.
Some Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to take some action -- perhaps the lengthening in maturity of the bonds it holds -- to depress longer-term interest rates.
''We do not expect Bernanke in his Aug. 26 address to unilaterally announce the start of a bold new easing initiative,'' Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse, wrote in a report. ''But we are looking for the chairman to hint strongly that further monetary policy accommodation is on its way.''
It was in Jackson Hole last year that, faced with similar signs of an economic slowdown, Mr. Bernanke signaled a second round of large-scale bond purchases, or quantitative easing, called QE2 for short. After the program was announced, stocks rose about 28 percent between August and February this year.
Still, many investors remain nervous about Europe and its debt problems. Even after Monday's rise, the S.& P. 500 was down 17.4 percent from its recent peak on April 29, close to bear market territory, which is defined as a drop of 20 percent.
In Europe, where losses in recent sessions have been as severe as in the United States, stocks were mixed. In Britain, the FTSE 100 closed up 1.1 percent. In Germany, the DAX was down 0.1 percent.
Some analysts warned it would not take much to push the markets back into negative territory.
''We're just seeing a natural reaction after the sharp falls at the end of last week,'' said Elisabeth Afseth, a fixed-income analyst at Evolution Securities in London. ''But the situation is still very uncertain and fragile.''

HEADLINE: Israeli Self-Defense or Tai Chi? Depends on Who's Watching

BYLINE: By CYRUS MASSOUMI. 
As told to Joan Raymond. E-mail: joan.raymond@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BUSINESS travel has always been a part of my career. I got the idea for my latest venture, ZocDoc, when I was coming back from Seattle after working on a project when I was with McKinsey & Company. It was a late-night flight and I had a horrible sinus infection. I heard this strange popping noise and then I felt like someone was sticking a spike into my ear.
The next morning I tried to get an appointment with an ear, nose and throat specialist, and everyone I called was booked for weeks. I live in New York City, which has to have the highest per capita concentration of doctors on the planet, yet I couldn't find one to take me. 
I'm a problem-solver and I figured there had to be some specialist in the city who had an opening. Now, patients can find those doctors really quickly through our Internet site. So something miserable really turned into something good.
I met my co-founder, Oliver Kharraz, a medical doctor, while I was with McKinsey. We got to know each other better when we were flying back and forth from Europe every week for about six months. We struck up a friendship. I ran my ZocDoc idea by him, and the rest is history.
When I was working as a consultant, I generally flew business class. Now, we fly coach. We have a meeting coming up in Miami, and there will be five of us going. We're only booking two hotel rooms. We give new meaning to being economical. I think that's true for most entrepreneurs. We want to pump the money back into the business, not spend it on upgraded airline tickets.
I usually don't check luggage, but on a recent business trip, I did check a bag. Of course, it was lost. If I don't shave, I get a really heavy beard pretty quickly. My shaving gear was packed in the lost bag. I know I should have put it in my carry-on, but I didn't.
Anyway, the hotel gave me a really cheap plastic razor. I'm used to using an electric razor. Two things define manhood: being able to drive a stick shift and being able to shave with a regular razor. I can drive a stick shift. I tried using the plastic razor and wound up bleeding all over the place.
We were set to speak at a health care event, and I was looking pretty beat up. Fortunately, my business partner stepped in and did the honors for me. When you're a small business, you take on many roles. He's a doctor; I felt safe.
Right after graduate school, I founded a dot-com company in Austin, Tex. I think I've always been an entrepreneur at heart.
Then the dot-com bubble burst and I was out of work. I studied Mandarin in high school, and decided to take some time to backpack through rural China on the Silk Road. I'd never been to China and never backpacked. I just needed to do something completely different. I have a lot of great memories from that time, but one sticks out.
I ran into some Israeli military guys who were there on vacation. I asked them to teach me a little Krav Maga, an Israeli self-defense technique. They said sure, and we were in the middle of a street doing these defensive moves. Next thing I knew, a Chinese gentleman joined us, and before you know it about 30 or 40 people from the town joined in. I didn't realize so many people wanted to learn Krav Maga.
They didn't. They thought we were doing tai chi.
Q.How often do you fly for business?
A. Usually about once a week, to once every other week, mostly domestic at this point.
Q. What's your least favorite airport?
A. Shreveport, La. No disrespect to the city, but I'm constantly stuck at the airport. I think I've spent four separate nights in some random airport hotel, and I still have no idea what Shreveport looks like.
Q. Of all the places you've been, what's the best?
A. I love going to exotic places where I don't hear a lot of English. I really liked Morocco. It's just very majestic, and it's the first time I've been someplace where I was told I looked like a local.
Q. What's your secret airport vice?
A. I stock up on food. I have this real fear that I'm going to be stuck on a plane with nothing to eat.

HEADLINE: Shortchanged by the Bell

BYLINE: By LUIS A. UBINAS and CHRIS GABRIELI. 
Luis A. Ubinas is the president of the Ford Foundation. Chris Gabrieli is the chairman of the National Center on Time and Learning.

 BODY:
AFTER a summer of budget cuts in Washington and state capitals, we have only to look to our schools, when classes begin in the next few weeks, to see who will pay the price. 
The minimum required school day in West Virginia is already about the length of a ''Harry Potter'' double feature. In Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Milwaukee, summer school programs are being slashed or eliminated. In Oregon and California this year, students will spend fewer days in the classroom; in rural communities from New Mexico to Idaho, some students will be in school only four days a week.
For all the talk about balancing the budget for the sake of our children, keeping classrooms closed is a perverse way of giving them a brighter future.
What's needed is more time in classrooms, not less. Our school calendar, with its six-and-a-half-hour day and 180-day year, was designed for yesterday's farm economy, not today's high-tech one. While many middle-class families now invest in tutoring and extra learning time, less-privileged children are left on the sidelines, which only widens gaps in achievement and opportunity.
Two years ago President Obama said that the ''challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom.'' Plenty of research suggests that one of the strongest indicators of scholastic achievement is the amount of actual time devoted to learning. Therefore, we need to move schools toward longer days and years. Ideally, increasing learning time by 30 percent would mean more individualized support; a more well-rounded education in a broader array of subjects, from science and foreign languages to arts and robotics; and less unsupervised after-school and summer time. For parents, it would mean a school day better aligned with the typical work day.
The good news is that more than 1,000 schools in the United States are now using expanded schedules. Almost every high-performing charter network in the country, from KIPP to Achievement First, uses significantly more scheduled time to achieve impressive academic gains, and many public schools, spurred by local initiatives, innovative state policies and federal leadership, are also adopting this promising practice.
In Boston, for example, the Edwards Middle School has gone, in five years, from the worst-performing, least-desired middle school to a model of success after it increased scheduled teaching time by 30 percent. Students there now outperform the state average proficiency rate in math and have nearly closed achievement gaps in literacy. This has occurred in a school where over 80 percent of the students come from low-income families.
Perhaps most surprising, some schools have shown that these changes can be made without spending more money. Brooklyn Generation School replaced most administrators with teachers and staggered all employees' schedules, allowing it to increase learning time by 30 percent without additional cost. Class sizes have been reduced and the burden on teachers lowered. Last spring, 90 percent of seniors graduated on time. Remarkably, when these students entered high school, only about 20 percent were at grade level.
These ad hoc efforts are great for the students involved. But we really need a more comprehensive national effort to make expanded learning time the norm in American education, especially for our neediest students, through smarter use of local, state and federal resources. More hours of learning -- not fewer -- can make a world of difference.

OPPOSITION LEADER'S DEATH
WEAKENS CANADIAN PARTY
Canada's political opposition was significantly weakened after the death of the country's New Democratic Party leader, Jack Layton. Mr. Layton, who was 61, had unexpectedly devastated Quebec's separatist movement in Parliament during an election in May and emerged as the first head of the New Democrats to become the leader of the official opposition.

RAID DEATH TOLL PASSES 600 
The death toll from a cattle raid in an estranged region of weeks-old South Sudan rose significantly, with the United Nations saying more than 600 people had been killed in a retaliatory attack that has raised fears of ethnic instability in the deeply impoverished country. Original reports had the death toll at 58, but the United Nations said the flow of information had been hampered by vast distances and poor logistics. Page A4
PROPERTY DISPUTE IN KOREA
North Korea gave South Korean tourism officials 72 hours to leave a mountain resort, saying it would start auctioning off South Korean-owned hotels, restaurants and other remnants of what used to be a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. North Korea gave the ultimatum after talks failed to resolve a dispute over whether tourism in the resort should resume and under what conditions. Page A9
TALIBAN COMMANDER KILLED
Angry villagers stoned to death a local Taliban commander and his bodyguard in southern Afghanistan after the militants killed a 60-year-old man accused of aiding the government, officials said. It was a rare reversal of brutality aimed at the Taliban and suggests a growing sense of security in an area where the insurgency has lost ground to NATO forces. Page A6

SUPREME COURT TO REVISIT
USE OF EYEWITNESS EVIDENCE
Every year, more than 75,000 eyewitnesses identify suspects in criminal investigations. Those identifications are wrong about a third of the time, studies suggest. In November, the Supreme Court will return to the question of what the Constitution has to say about the use of eyewitness evidence. Page A14
PSYCHIC FACES FRAUD CHARGES
The promise of good karma did not come cheaply for devotees of a South Florida psychic, Rose Marks, whom federal prosecutors have portrayed as the matriarch of a fortune-telling family with a lust for luxury. The government said that Ms. Marks and nine others cheated customers of $40 million in cash, goods and property. Page A16

DEBATE OVER SCHOOL'S GIFT
A $10 million gift from Lowell Milken to the U.C.L.A. School of Law has set off an internal debate at the school.

HEADLINE: On Anti-Semitism and the Mideast

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Jews in a Whisper'' (column, Aug. 21):
Roger Cohen's acute depiction of the perpetuation of British anti-Semitism recalls the description of it in ''Trials of the Diaspora,'' Anthony Julius's epic study of the topic.
''It is not Jew-hatred that we must write of,'' Mr. Julius concludes, ''but Jew-distrust ... it is a story of snub and insult, sly whisper and innuendo, deceit and self-deception.'' 
But is there not more than a touch of self-deception in Mr. Cohen's insistence that ''the task'' -- apparently, the only task -- of diaspora Jews is to condemn the ''colonization of Palestinians in the West Bank''?
Even if one shares, as I do, Mr. Cohen's concerns about the settlements, I would have thought that if diaspora Jews or others were being assigned tasks vis-a-vis Israel, a prime one would be to respond to the torrent of calumny, one-sided and often false, that is directed at that nation on the basis of supposed standards that are applied to no other nation.
FLOYD ABRAMS New York, Aug. 21, 2011
The writer, a First Amendment lawyer, has represented The New York Times.
To the Editor:
When Roger Cohen suggests that the lesson Jews should take from British class consciousness and anti-Semitism is for Israel to end the ''colonization'' of the West Bank, he mimics the bigotry he is trying to expose. Does Mr. Cohen believe that the British will stop whispering when the Israelis stop building settlements?
Anti-Semitism, like other forms of bigotry, is based not on what people do, but on who they are. To suggest otherwise is to blame the victim and ignore history.
KATHERINE L. GURVEY Lincolnshire, Ill., Aug. 21, 2011
The writer is communications director of Joint Action Committee for Political Affairs, a bipartisan political action committee dedicated to, among others, the United States-Israel relationship.
To the Editor:
Roger Cohen says Jews should know better: ''The lesson is clear: Jews, with their history, cannot become the systematic oppressors of another people.'' His reference to the plight of the Palestinians is offensive: blaming Israel. He should know better!
In 1993, Israel gave the Palestinians a chance to have their own country with the Oslo Accords. The Palestinians responded with suicide bombings and terror. Israel followed with offers in 2000 and 2008. Palestinians walked away without a counteroffer.
Since Israel won the West Bank from Jordan, the Palestinians' life expectancy has increased, their infant mortality has been reduced, and their economy has prospered. If any fingers need to be pointed, they should be at the Palestinian leadership.
MICHAEL BERENHAUS Potomac, Md., Aug. 21, 2011
To the Editor:
While I applaud Roger Cohen's call for diaspora Jews to ''be vociferous in their insistence that continued colonization of Palestinians in the West Bank'' must end, I take issue with his opposition to ''those who, ignoring sinister historical echoes, propose ostracizing Israeli academics and embrace an anti-Zionism that flirts with anti-Semitism.'' The movement for boycott, divestment and sanctions as a means to press Israel to respect human rights and international law is very specific in not targeting individual Israeli academics, but rather institutions that collaborate with the Israeli colonial enterprise in the occupied Palestinian territories.
The conflation of criticism of Israel, or Zionism, with anti-Semitism is the first refuge of the defenders of Israel right or wrong, and is belied by the active involvement of Jews in the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.
ALAN MEYERS Cambridge, Mass., Aug. 21, 2011
The writer is a member of the steering committee of American Jews for a Just Peace, Boston.

HEADLINE: Room for All 16 Grandchildren

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has never claimed to be a middle-class man of the people.
But the news that he is planning to quadruple the size of his $12 million oceanfront property in the La Jolla section of San Diego, first reported by The San Diego Union-Tribune on Saturday evening, came at a particularly awkward time. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had spent much of the previous week on the campaign trail criticizing President Obama for vacationing in Martha's Vineyard when many Americans are still out of work. 
The Union-Tribune's Christopher Cadelago reported that Mr. Romney, who was expected to attend several fund-raisers in San Diego this weekend, recently filed an application to bulldoze his 3,009-square-foot, three-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom home and replace it with an 11,062-square-foot, two-story residence. The current single-story house sits at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and overlooks a white sand beach. A date to consider the project has not yet been set.
A campaign official confirmed the report, noting, ''Construction will not begin until the permits have been obtained and the campaign is finished.'' The official also explained that the large renovation is family-motivated.
''They want to enlarge their two-bedroom home because with five married sons and 16 grandchildren, it is inadequate for their needs,'' the official explained.
And while Mr. Romney has been critical of the president's 10-day Vineyard vacation, Mr. Romney himself will actually overlap with Mr. Obama this Saturday, when he heads to Martha's Vineyard to host a $2,500-per-person fund-raiser there.
The Romney campaign pointed out that it is not unusual to see Mr. Romney in Massachusetts, and that he is simply fund-raising and then leaving, not vacationing.
''The president has responsibility for the economy and should be engaged full time with the issue of putting people back to work,'' a Romney official said.
Mr. Romney is not the first presidential candidate to encounter trouble when it comes to lavish abodes. In the 2008 campaign, Senator John McCain of Arizona stumbled when asked about the number of homes he and his wife, Cindy, owned. (The answer was at least eight.) And John Edwards, a candidate for the Democratic nomination who had fashioned himself a defender of the working class hoping to eradicate poverty, was mocked and criticized after The Carolina Journal reported that he had plans to move into a 28,200-square-foot mansion in North Carolina that was valued at more than $6 million.
For the record, the Romneys own three homes - in addition to the La Jolla house, he and his wife keep a vacation home near the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire (the whole family retired there earlier this month), as well as a town house outside Boston.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How Democrats Hurt Jobs

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
The airplane's aft section arrived early Monday morning. That's what they'd been waiting for at the final assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C. They already had the wings, the nose, the tail -- all the other major sections of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner. With the arrival of the aft, the 5,000 nonunion workers in the plant can finally begin to assemble their first aircraft -- a plane three years behind schedule and critical to Boeing's future.
The Dreamliner is important to America's future, too. As companies have moved manufacturing offshore, Boeing has remained steadfast in maintaining a large manufacturing presence in America. It is America's biggest exporter of manufactured products. Indeed, despite the delays, Boeing still has 827 Dreamliners on order, worth a staggering $162 billion. 
Boeing's aircraft assembly has long been done by its unionized labor force in Puget Sound, Wash. Most of the new Dreamliners will be built in Puget Sound as well. But with the plane so far behind schedule, Boeing decided to spend $750 million to open the South Carolina facility. Between the two plants, the company hopes to build 10 Dreamliners a month.
That's the plan, at least. The Obama administration, however, has a different plan. In April, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Boeing, accusing it of opening the South Carolina plant to retaliate against the union, which has a history of striking at contract time. The N.L.R.B.'s proposed solution, believe it or not, is to move all the Dreamliner production back to Puget Sound, leaving those 5,000 workers in South Carolina twiddling their thumbs.
Seriously, when has a government agency ever tried to dictate where a company makes its products? I can't ever remember it happening. Neither can Boeing, which is fighting the complaint. J. Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, has described the action as ''unprecedented.'' He has also said that it was a disservice to a country that is ''in desperate need of economic growth and the concomitant job creation.'' He's right.
That's also why I've become mildly obsessed with the Boeing affair. Nothing matters more right now than job creation. Last week, President Obama barnstormed the Midwest, promising a jobs package in September and blaming Republicans for blocking job-creation efforts. Republicans, of course, have blamed the administration, complaining that regulatory overkill is keeping companies from creating jobs.
They're both right. Republicans won't pass anything that might stimulate job growth because they are so ideologically opposed to federal spending. But the Democrats have blind spots, too. No, the Environmental Protection Agency shouldn't be rolling back its rules, as the Republican presidential candidates seem to want. But a fair-minded person would have to acknowledge that the N.L.R.B.'s action is exactly the kind of overreach that should embarrass Democrats who claim to care about job creation. It's paralyzing, is what it is.
The law, to be sure, forbids a company from retaliating against a union. But the word ''retaliation'' suggests direct payback -- a company shutting down a factory after a strike, for instance. Boeing did nothing like that. It not only hasn't laid off a single worker in Washington State, it has added around 3,000 new ones. Seven out of every 10 Dreamliners will be assembled in Puget Sound.
Before expanding to South Carolina, Boeing asked the union for a moratorium on strikes -- precisely because it needed to get the airplane into the hands of impatient customers. The union said it would agree only if Boeing promised never to manufacture anywhere but Puget Sound. Boeing refused -- as any company would.
It is a mind-boggling stretch to describe Boeing's strategy as ''retaliation.'' Companies have often moved to right-to-work states to avoid strikes; it is part of the calculus every big manufacturer makes. The South Carolina facility is a hedge against the possibility that Boeing's union work force will shut down production of the Dreamliner. And it's a perfectly legitimate hedge, at least under the rules that the business thought it was operating under.
That is what is so jarring about this case -- and not just for Boeing. Without any warning, the rules have changed. Uncertainty has replaced certainty. Other companies have to start wondering what other rules could soon change. It becomes a reason to hold back on hiring.
When he was asked about the Boeing case earlier this summer, President Obama said that the N.L.R.B. is an independent agency and that his hands were tied. That may be true, though it's worth pointing out that most of its top executives are his appointees. But when he gets back from vacation, he might do well looking at his own administration, instead of simply blaming the lack of jobs on the Republicans.
As for the Republicans, there are plenty of regulations that would actually help create jobs -- but which they won't pass because of their own ideological blinders. I'll be writing about that after Labor Day.

HEADLINE: Scramble Begins for Access to Libya's Oil

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- The fighting is not yet over in Tripoli, but the scramble to secure access to Libya's oil wealth has already begun.
Before the rebellion broke out in February, Libya exported 1.3 million barrels of oil a day. While that is less than 2 percent of world supplies, only a few other countries can supply equivalent grades of the sweet crude oil that many refineries around the world depend on. The resumption of Libyan production would help drive down oil prices in Europe, and indirectly, gasoline prices on the East Coast of the United States.
Western nations -- especially the NATO countries that provided crucial air support to the rebels -- want to make sure their companies are in prime position to pump the Libyan crude.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini of Italy said on state television on Monday that the Italian oil company Eni ''will have a No. 1 role in the future'' in the North African country. Mr. Frattini even reported that Eni technicians were already on their way to eastern Libya to restart production. (Eni quickly denied that it had sent any personnel to the still-unsettled region, which is Italy's largest source of imported oil.) 
Libyan production has been largely shut down during the long conflict between rebel forces and troops loyal to Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Eni, with BP of Britain, Total of France, Repsol YPF of Spain and OMV of Austria, were all big producers in Libya before the fighting broke out, and they stand to gain the most once the conflict ends. American companies like Hess, ConocoPhillips and Marathon also made deals with the Qaddafi regime, although the United States relies on Libya for less than 1 percent of its imports.
But it is unclear whether a rebel government would honor the contracts struck by the Qaddafi regime or what approach it would take in negotiating new production-sharing agreements with companies willing to invest in established oil fields and explore for new ones.
Even before taking power, the rebels suggested that they would remember their friends and foes and negotiate deals accordingly.
''We don't have a problem with Western countries like Italians, French and U.K. companies,'' Abdeljalil Mayouf, a spokesman for the Libyan rebel oil company Agoco, was quoted by Reuters as saying. ''But we may have some political issues with Russia, China and Brazil.''
Russia, China and Brazil did not back strong sanctions on the Qaddafi regime, and they generally supported a negotiated end to the uprising. All three countries have large oil companies that are seeking deals in Africa.
The European benchmark price for oil fell moderately on Monday on speculation that Libyan oil production would quickly begin rising again. Brent crude oil prices initially dropped more than 3 percent, but ended New York trading basically flat at $108.42. The American benchmark crude, which is less sensitive to events in the Middle East, rose $2.01, to $84.42.
Colonel Qaddafi proved to be a problematic partner for international oil companies, frequently raising fees and taxes and making other demands. A new government with close ties to NATO may be an easier partner for Western nations to deal with. Some experts say that given a free hand, oil companies could find considerably more oil in Libya than they were able to locate under the restrictions placed by the Qaddafi government.
Oil analysts said it was likely that oil companies, particularly Total and Eni, would compete fiercely for contracts on the best oil properties, with their respective governments lobbying on their behalf. But first the rebels will have to consolidate control over the country.
''If you don't have a stable security environment, who will be able to put their workers back in the country?'' said Helima Croft, senior geopolitical strategist at Barclays Capital.
The civil war forced major oil companies to withdraw their personnel, and production plummeted over the last several months to a minuscule 60,000 barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. That would account for roughly 20 percent of the country's normal domestic needs. The rebels were able to export a modest amount of crude that was stored at ports and sell it for cash on the international markets through Qatar.
Oil experts caution that it could take as much as a year for Libya to make repairs and get its oil fields back to full speed, although some exports may resume within a couple of months.
Since oil is far and away Libya's most important economic resource, any new government would be obliged to make oil production a high priority. That would mean establishing security over major fields, pipelines, refineries and ports. The government would also need to quickly establish relationships with foreign oil companies, some of which consulted with both the rebels and Colonel Qadaffi through the conflict to hedge their bets.
Most oil companies involved in Libya declined to comment on Monday or said they would wait to see how the security situation evolved before sending their personnel into the country.
''Clearly we are monitoring the situation like everyone,'' said Jon Pepper, a Hess vice president. ''Obviously the situation has to stabilize there before people start thinking about resuming production.''
Italy in recent years has relied on Libya for more than 20 percent of its oil imports. France, Switzerland, Ireland and Austria all depended on Libya for more than 15 percent of their imports before the fighting began.
Libya's importance to France was underscored on Monday when President Nicolas Sarkozy invited the head of the rebels' national transitional council, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, to Paris for consultations.
Even though the United States relies very little on Libya for imports, the reduction of high-quality crude on world markets has pushed up oil and gasoline prices for Americans as well.
Oil analysts say that most reports from the oil service companies, which continued to pay their Libyan crews through the war, indicate that there has been relatively little damage to most oil facilities. That suggests that production could begin to increase in a matter of weeks.
But the resumption of large-scale exports will depend on how quickly repairs can be made on the Ras Lanuf, Melitah and Es Sider oil export terminals, and how well a new government can secure fields and pipelines in areas that traditionally supported the old regime.
Rushed closings of wells when fighting spread in February, along with the lack of maintenance over the last several months, may mean that months of repairs will be needed, particularly in older, more depleted fields.
The experiences of other countries in the region offer reasons for caution. Political turmoil in Iran has reduced production for decades, oil analysts note, and it took eight years for Iraqi oil production to recover after the American-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.
Eni's chairman, Giuseppe Recchi, recently told analysts that it would probably take a year to return Libya to normal export levels. On Monday, he denied that his company would immediately send back personnel, but he told reporters that he expected the new Libyan government to respect his company's previous contracts.

HEADLINE: Mayor Praises Growth in Film and TV Jobs

BYLINE: By ADRIANE QUINLAN

 BODY:
Once upon a time in New York, the Brooklyn Navy Yard bustled with ships, and an airport called Idlewild was home to a terminal for Pan American World Airways, or Pan Am.
Those days are long gone.
But on Monday morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stood in the busy Navy Yard, flanked by women dressed in bright blue stewardesses' uniforms with matching hats. The women were actresses from ''Pan Am,'' a television drama that shoots on a soundstage at Steiner Studios in the Navy Yard that recreates the look of Pan Am's terminal in 1963.
Like a good location scout, Mr. Bloomberg had chosen the studios, abuzz with construction vehicles working on an expansion, as the place to give a speech on how the film and television industry has become an economic boon for New York. 
''New York's done very well compared to the rest of the country, and it's because we've diversified our industries,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
The mayor said 23 prime-time television series were shooting in New York City studios, in places like Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and Astoria, Queens.
''These shows really are providing a great boost to our economy and creating jobs at a time when we really need them,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''And in fact, our growth in our production and entertainment industry is one of the reasons we create jobs at a faster clip than the rest of the nation.''
The entertainment industry in New York is a $5 billion business that employs 100,000 workers.
''We expect the industry to keep growing, and we've made investments to make sure that it will - for example, here at the Navy Yard,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
Not far from where the mayor was speaking, cement trucks were whirling, filling the floors for five new commercial studios, which will double the size of the studio and create an estimated 2,000 jobs.
While New York has a rich history of serving as a backdrop for directors who would then shoot the rest of the film on soundstages in Los Angeles, directors today use Brooklyn soundstages rather than fly west. Mr. Bloomberg noted that the producers of ''Pan Am,'' which ABC will broadcast this fall, had even used the streets of New York to recreate Berlin in the 1960s.
Thomas Schlamme, an executive producer of the show, said that taping in New York allowed the show to tap the city's artistic resources. ''Yes, we could do it anywhere,'' he said. ''But the truth is, there was a talent pool. Artistically it was greatly to my advantage. In the end, you have to have the right people and the right skills.''
The mayor credited the city's role as the ''intellectual capital of the country'' as a reason it is so attractive to filmmakers. While Katherine Oliver, the commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, which facilitates filmmaking in New York, among other duties, spoke about how the city's ''customer service'' and the ease of acquiring a permit in the city drew talent.
The proliferation of television and film projects in the city has led to complaints in some neighborhoods, particularly over cars that residents say have been towed without proper warnings. But Mr. Bloomberg said the benefits outweigh the costs.
''Some people will be slightly inconvenienced,'' he said. ''But it's for a short period of time. On the other hand, it's how an awful lot of people - 100,000 of them - make their living. And the city's job is to find that balance.''
Ms. Oliver noted that one challenge has been to help productions find what she termed ''gritty neighborhoods.''
''You know what?'' she said. ''They don't exist anymore. It's hard to find them.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Obama, Libyan Endgame Is a Moment to Savor, if Only Briefly

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- President Obama was a reluctant warrior in Libya, drawn into the rebel uprising over the warnings of his Pentagon chief and his own qualms about getting the United States entangled in yet another war in the Muslim world.
Now that the rebels have seized most of Tripoli and driven Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi into hiding, Mr. Obama claimed a victory for his much-doubted strategy. But that victory is tinged by the same uncertainties that made the president so wary of getting involved in the first place. 
With Colonel Qaddafi's loyalists still fighting in pockets, the United States and its allies are confronting a chaotic, potentially treacherous transition. They must help Libya's new rulers -- people they did not know six months ago -- set up a functioning, credible government in a country divided by tribal conflicts and a dearth of state institutions.
Mr. Obama acknowledged those hurdles, interrupting his vacation here to praise the rebel advances, even as the fighting continued and the whereabouts of Colonel Qaddafi remained a mystery.
''Your courage and character have been unbreakable in the face of a tyrant,'' the president said in a somber seven-minute address. He urged the Libyan Transitional National Council, which the United States recently recognized as the country's legitimate government, to pursue a peaceful, inclusive transition to democracy.
''True justice will not come from reprisals and violence,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It will come from reconciliation and a Libya that allows its citizens to determine their own destiny.''
''In that effort,'' he added, ''the United States will be a friend and a partner.''
That could be difficult long-term partnership, analysts said. Unlike Egypt or Tunisia, which had established institutions to smooth the transition from long-time dictators, Colonel Qaddafi's ''revolution'' -- essentially a four-decade-long cult of personality -- has left little for a new government to build on.
''They are basically starting from scratch,'' said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Now will really be the test for the United States, because there are a lot of centrifugal forces that could pull this apart.''
Republicans who had criticized Mr. Obama's handling of Libya, including the presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., were more muted on Monday, with Mr. Romney shifting attention from the military campaign to the need to extradite those behind the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
While the president's tone was determinedly not triumphal, his aides insisted that the weekend's events had vindicated his strategy -- heading off mass killings in the eastern city of Benghazi, marshaling a broad coalition to press Colonel Qaddafi, giving the Libyan opposition time to take root and plan a transition, and, above all, limiting American involvement.
''All of this was done without putting a single U.S. troop on the ground,'' Mr. Obama noted.
Even now, though, he appeared less personally invested in Libya than he has in other big issues. Though he spoke to his National Security Council and to Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain before his remarks, he went right back to his vacation, playing basketball with aides. (Mr. Cameron canceled his holiday to hold meetings in London.)
At first, the president's wary approach seemed to satisfy no one -- hawks in Congress who called for boots on the ground, doves who demanded a pullout and foreign policy experts who warned of a quagmire. Those doubts only deepened as the NATO military campaign that Mr. Obama had suggested would last weeks dragged into months.
On Monday, administration officials argued that six months was not long in the context of Colonel Qaddafi's 42-year reign, and that the coalition was critically important in sustaining pressure on him.
''This was a unique operation in that the U.S. wasn't left to bear the bulk of the burden itself,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. ''The burden was spread effectively wide that we were more than able to sustain the pressure for six months, and frankly, would have been able to for many more months to come.''
For all that, Mr. Obama seems unlikely to get much political payoff from the events in Libya. Part of the reason stems from his multilateral approach -- very different, for example, from the commando raid he ordered on Osama bin Laden. That gave him a measurable bounce in the polls, though it, too, proved fleeting as anxieties about the economy crept back.
Nor is it likely to improve his relations with Republicans in Congress. Many still recall the rancorous dispute over Mr. Obama's decision not to seek Congressional authorization for the air campaign -- a decision that some administration advisers regret, and one that led the House to reject a measure authorizing the mission.
Two Republican hawks -- Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- said Mr. Obama did not deserve credit because the operation had taken too long. They attributed that ''to the failure of the United States to employ the full weight of our airpower.''
On Monday, those who supported the campaign -- largely Democrats -- offered tempered encouragement, urging the United States to step up its involvement in Libya. But several Democrats also called for the focus to turn to Pam Am Flight 103.
''The release of al-Megrahi was a total miscarriage of justice,'' said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, referring to Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi, one of the convicted masterminds of the bombing, who was released by Britain and returned to Libya.
''Seeing him participate in good health at a pro-Qaddafi rally recently was another slap in the face not just for the families of the Lockerbie victims, but for all Americans,'' she said.
Mr. Obama paid homage to those victims, as well as other Americans who had been killed by Libyan-sponsored terrorism. That subtly reinforced another point: on this president's watch, another violent strongman who vexed Washington for many years was gone.
While officials said they did not expect that to help the president in the polls especially, it could help him counter a narrative that often dogs Democratic presidents in elections.
''It helps lock in and solidify the idea that he's the guy who keeps us safe,'' one senior official said. ''Reagan targeted Qaddafi; George W. Bush targeted Bin Laden; Obama has done both.''

HEADLINE: Milken Gift Stirs Dispute At U.C.L.A.

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and PETER LATTMAN. 
Andrew Ross Sorkin, whose DealBook column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
When the U.C.L.A. School of Law announced a $10 million gift from Lowell Milken to establish a business law institute in his name earlier this month, the university described him as a ''pioneer in education reform'' and a ''leading philanthropist.''
Behind the scenes, Mr. Milken's big donation has set off an internal debate at the school. While many faculty members welcomed the money, one of the University of California, Los Angeles's top business law professors has said the gift poses deep ethical problems and reputational risks, given Mr. Milken's run-in with securities regulators two decades ago.
''The creation of a Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy will damage my personal and professional reputation, as I have devoted my career to arguing for investor protection and honest and ethical behavior in business,'' Lynn A. Stout wrote in a letter last month to the president of the University of California and U.C.L.A.'s chancellor. 
Ms. Stout, a specialist in corporate governance and moral behavior, said in an interview last week, ''I think it's somewhat distressing that so few people seem to be aware of Lowell and Michael Milken's business history.''
The Milken name is still a lightning rod on Wall Street and in legal circles. Michael Milken and his younger brother, Lowell, were central figures in creating the booming junk-bond market of the 1980s and the subsequent collapse of the investment bank where they worked, Drexel Burnham Lambert.
In a controversial deal with the government, Michael pleaded guilty to securities law violations after the government agreed to drop criminal charges against Lowell. Michael served a 22-month prison term and paid $600 million in fines and restitution.
As part of a settlement in a related civil matter, the Securities and Exchange Commission permanently barred the two brothers from the securities industry.
Lowell Milken did not admit to any wrongdoing.
Kenneth W. Graham Jr., a retired U.C.L.A. law professor, said it was a mistake to take the gift from Mr. Milken, a 1973 graduate of the school and longtime donor to it. ''To say that I was outraged would be something of an understatement,'' wrote Mr. Graham in an e-mail.
But other U.C.L.A. law professors disagree with the objections and are thrilled with Mr. Milken's largess. Since their legal woes, the Milken brothers have become prominent philanthropists, donating hundreds of millions of dollars to a variety of causes, most notably in the areas of medical research and education.
''Save for one dissident professor, the entire business law faculty is grateful for this gift,'' Kenneth N. Klee, a bankruptcy law scholar, said.
The current debate surrounding Lowell Milken's gift highlights the quandary that public universities across the country face as the fiscal woes of states have forced them to look increasingly to private corporations and wealthy alumni for financial support. Law schools are typically among a state school's most profitable graduate programs.
''We're staring down the barrel of another round of cuts in California and relying on alumni giving is essential for us to be able to provide a quality education,'' said Stephen Bainbridge, a U.C.L.A. corporate law professor. ''If it wasn't for these sorts of gifts we'd have even tighter budgetary constraints.''
When asked to respond to complaints about Mr. Milken's gift, Bonnie Somers, a spokeswoman for the Milken Family Foundation, issued a written statement.
''Basic fairness requires that individuals be evaluated solely on the basis of their own conduct and Lowell Milken's life of accomplishment and service speaks for itself,'' her statement said. She added that the foundation respected the fact that U.C.L.A. ''understands that in the United States of America, its citizens are presumed innocent until proven otherwise.''
Lauri Gavel, a law school spokeswoman, also issued a written statement: ''Only one member of the business law faculty has expressed anything less than gratitude - and that concern was surprising, given that this professor was involved early in the process, has been a beneficiary of the donor's philanthropy, and did not raise objections until quite recently.''
This is not the first time a Milken has generated controversy at U.C.L.A. In 1994, the university severed its ties with an education company controlled by Michael R. Milken that planned to sell videotapes of a lecture series he gave at the school. The company agreed to remove any identification of U.C.L.A. from the tapes after the school said it received many complaints from state officials who did not want the university's name associated with Mr. Milken.
While Lowell Milken's gift was the capstone of the law school's $100 million fund-raising campaign, several other benefactors made donations and in return had buildings, conference rooms, professorships and scholarship funds named in their honor.
Mr. Milken is not the only leading donor in the current campaign that has tussled with regulatory authorities. The capital drive also led to the creation of the Stewart and Lynda Resnick Endowed Fund in Support of Public Interest Law. The Resnicks are the Beverly Hills beverage industry entrepreneurs who own Fiji Water and Pom Wonderful.
Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission filed a civil lawsuit against the Resnicks, accusing them and their company, Pom Wonderful, of making ''false and unsubstantiated claims'' that their pomegranate juice product helped reduce the risk of heart disease and erectile dysfunction.
Jill Gottesman, a spokeswoman for Pom Wonderful and the Resnicks, which are fighting the charges, has called the government's allegations ''completely unwarranted.''
Law professors unaffiliated with U.C.L.A. say that even though the economic environment makes it challenging for public schools to finance vital programs, they need to consider the potential risks in accepting private money. Thane Rosenbaum, a law professor at Fordham University, said that U.C.L.A.'s gifts from Mr. Milken and the Resnicks reflect a kind of ''academic cynicism.''
''Here is a major law school, with state funding in California deteriorating, now taking its money from people engaged in questionable behavior,'' said Mr. Rosenbaum. ''It's unbecoming to a great university.''
Other schools have in the past refused money, or taken other actions, when their benefactors have become involved in corporate wrongdoing. In the 1980s, Princeton returned money from Ivan Boesky to build a Jewish Center after the government charged the Wall Street financier with insider trading crimes. Seton Hall removed the name of L. Dennis Kozlowski from an academic building in 2005, after the conviction of the former Tyco chief executive for looting his company.
Inside the halls of U.C.L.A., the protests of Ms. Stout, a tenured professor whose most recent book is ''Cultivating Conscience: How Good Laws Make Good People,'' has caused consternation among her colleagues.
Mr. Bainbridge, the corporate law professor, said that though he considered Ms. Stout a friend, he disagreed with her position.
''I believe that Lynn genuinely thinks that this hurts the school by giving Milken the U.C.L.A. imprimatur of being a good guy and an ethical person,'' said Mr. Bainbridge.
''I think it's unfortunate that we're dragging up stuff that happened a quarter of a century ago - and for which any debt to society has long been paid - to taint something that is going to help our students tremendously.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Weighing Race and Hate in a Mississippi Killing

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
JACKSON, Miss. -- No one disputes that James Craig Anderson, a middle-aged black family man with a quick wit and a demanding sense of style, was robbed, beaten and then run over by a group of white teenagers in a motel parking lot early one morning in June.
But as the case builds -- charges against the young man accused of driving the Ford pickup that hit Mr. Anderson were raised to capital murder on Friday, and the F.B.I. is now involved -- significant questions remain.
Was the killing of Mr. Anderson premeditated racial violence? An act indicative of a deep cultural divide? 
Or was the behavior of Deryl Dedmon, the slight, blond teenager who could be facing the death penalty, simply an anomaly born of anger, alcohol and teenage stupidity, as some close to the case suggest?
Beyond those questions, many here are asking whether Mr. Anderson's death will prompt a deeper discussion of race relations in a state that has struggled mightily to move beyond its past.
''Racism has always been part of the lifestyle in Mississippi in one form or another,'' said Dr. Timothy Summers, 68, a Jackson psychiatrist whose father opened a black-owned savings and loan in Mississippi in the 1950s.
''There still is that component of our culture that very much likes to hold on to how things have been in the past,'' he said. ''That group, however, doesn't represent the broader cross section of people who are good and honest but perhaps too naive, perhaps too quiet, too complacent in looking at racism.''
Although they lived just 15 miles apart and spent Sundays in church, Mr. Anderson, 48, and Mr. Dedmon, 19, could not have led more different lives.
Mr. Dedmon liked his high school agriculture classes, but not as much as he loved hanging out with friends at a drive-in restaurant in the largely white suburban county where he lived, his friends say. He was the joker among a group for whom country music, Bible verses, Bud Light and pickup trucks serve as the cultural markers.
Mr. Anderson was a good country cook, a gifted gardener and always genial, his family said. He liked his job on the assembly line at the Nissan plant north of Jackson, where he had worked for about seven years.
''If you met him, the first thing you were going to see was that grand piano smile,'' said his eldest sister, Barbara Anderson Young.
He made a point of taking care of old people and children and was helping his partner of 17 years, James Bradfield, raise the 4-year-old relative for whom Mr. Bradfield has legal guardianship. He sang tenor in the choir at the First Hyde Park Missionary Baptist Church and was so good ''he'd have you falling out,'' Mr. Bradfield, 44, said.
And if friends or relatives were not dressed well enough for an event, he would tease them into changing into something nicer.
No one is sure why Mr. Anderson was in the parking lot at the Metro Inn at 5 a.m. on June 26. He might have been at a party, Mr. Bradfield said. He was by his truck when two carloads of teenagers pulled off the interstate, according to prosecutors, who cited video from a motel security camera and statements from witnesses. Family members say he might have lost his keys, which have not been returned to them.
The video shows some of the teenagers, who prosecutors said had been at a party earlier that night, running back and forth between their cars and Mr. Anderson. He was beaten repeatedly and robbed, the district attorney said. Items like a cellphone, a ring and his wallet were taken, according to interviews with family members.
Then, one car drove off. But an F-250 pick-up -- driven by Mr. Dedmon, the prosecutor said -- pulled out of the parking lot and ran over Mr. Anderson as he staggered along the lot's edge. The murder charge against Mr. Dedmon was raised to capital murder after District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith of Hinds County said he had evidence that Mr. Dedmon had robbed Mr. Anderson.
Why the teenagers drove across the Pearl River to that tough section of Jackson is at the heart of the case, which will be presented to a grand jury in a few weeks as a racially motivated crime, Mr. Smith said. There was no indication that Mr. Anderson's sexual orientation was a factor in the crime.
John Rice, 18, is the only other person charged, his accusation one of simple assault. Mr. Smith and national civil rights groups believe they were seeking out a black person to harm. Witnesses told the police that one teenager yelled ''white power'' and that Mr. Dedmon, using a racial slur, later bragged about hitting Mr. Anderson.
Morris Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, is working with the family and their lawyer, Winston J. Thompson III. Mr. Dees said his group was investigating whether some of the teenagers involved may have loose ties to a gang with white-supremacist leanings. Mr. Smith is taking a more cautious approach.
''I don't think there are aggressive gangs out there beating up black people,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I do think because of the political and economic structure and the re-engineering of society, it appears that certain parts of the country and Mississippi feel their culture is under attack.''
The Rev. Brian Richardson of Castlewood Baptist Church in Brandon, Miss., who went to Mr. Anderson's funeral and has become close to the family, believes Mr. Dedmon is a product of his upbringing and a culture that does not do enough to stop bullying.
In an interview at his church in a nicely kept section of the county where Mr. Dedmon was raised, Mr. Richardson, who is white, said Mr. Dedmon had called his son, Jordan, 18, derogatory words for homosexual and mocked his friendship with black students when they were in high school together.
Mr. Richardson said he had raised the issue with school officials, and once had to deal with the police when Mr. Dedmon and some other boys drove to the family home.
The Richardsons point out that while racism is not unique to the Deep South, a deep streak of ''us and them'' exists.
''There is a subgroup that takes the Southern country-boy thing to another level,'' Jordan Richardson said.
Mr. Dedmon's lawyer did not respond to requests for an interview, but friends and family of some of the young people involved say the death was an accident.
At the Sonic Drive-In in Rankin County, where redneck can be a term of pride among the young whites who hang out nightly, the young people do not see Mr. Anderson's death as a hate crime. And they say they are not racists.
''They don't know how bad this hurts us,'' said Shanna Brenemen, who attends Brandon High School and was close to Mr. Dedmon.
Although a conversation with them might be laced with racial slurs, they point to black friends, including some running Tater Tots and limeades to the cars parked at the drive-in. The way people are portraying them is simply wrong, they said.
''We're just country, and whoever comes here, we welcome everybody,'' said Mr. Dedmon's younger sister, Tiffany, who will be a junior at Brandon High School. ''This whole thing is getting blown out of proportion.''
In a letter he sent her from his jail cell, Mr. Dedmon said he had committed himself to Jesus. He warned his sister away from trouble. ''I want you to get in the Bible for real,'' he wrote. ''I don't want you to end up like this. I thought drinking was fun but look where it got me. And seriously choose your friends wisely, Tiff. My so-called friends got me in here.''
For Mr. Bradfield and Mr. Anderson's siblings, the case is nothing but a hate crime. Jackson, for its part, has been slow to publicly address the case. Mayor Harvey Johnson, who is black, issued his first public statement on the matter last week. A public vigil was held on Aug. 14. A few hundred people marched from a nearby church to the motel parking lot and placed a wreath on the grassy spot near the curb where Mr. Anderson was hit.
Perhaps interest in the case was muted, people close to the family and in the community said, because Mr. Anderson's family had been slow to come forward.
Although the family has created the James Craig Anderson Foundation for Racial Tolerance, they wanted to protect themselves from the media scrum and political opportunism that would surely come from a fist-pounding demand for justice, said Mr. Thompson, the lawyer. Mr. Anderson's family and others wonder why only two of the seven teenagers were charged. And perhaps the toughest question of all: Could such a potent strain of racism exist in a city that has worked for decades to overcome it?
''The Help,'' a film that explores the relationships between black maids and their white employers in the 1960s, sold out several shows during its debut weekend here.
People walking out of a theater an hour after the vigil last week said that although Jackson has changed in some ways, racism remains.
''It's still here,'' said B. J. Quick, 50, a black man who saw the movie with his girlfriend, who is white. ''It's just under the surface more.''

HEADLINE: Lobsters Find Utopia Where Biologists See Trouble

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
For lobstermen working the Gulf of Maine, this is a golden age.
Maine lobsters, prized for their succulence and briny sweetness, are so abundant, and so lucrative, that they support fishing communities up and down the coast.
And that is just the problem, says Robert S. Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine.
In a paper in the current issue of Conservation Biology, he and a team of researchers say the lobstermen, their communities and the state economy are caught in ''a gilded trap,'' in which short-term profit outweighs long-term social and environmental risks. 
Where once a number of food species thrived in the gulf, lobsters now provide 80 percent of Maine's seafood income. Inflation-adjusted revenue from lobstering has quadrupled since 1985, the scientists write.
In an interview, Dr. Steneck said the coast had grown so dependent on lobster abundance that if anything damages the species -- as has happened in recent years in nearby waters -- ''we are stuffed.''
The researchers call for new steps to restore diversity in the gulf, and with it the economic diversity of coastal communities -- even if the steps reduce lobster catches somewhat. But in a gilded trap, they write, ''large financial gain creates a strong reinforcing feedback that deepens the trap.''
According to the state's Department of Marine Resources, Maine lobstermen landed almost 94.7 million pounds of lobsters in 2010, worth about $313 million, up from 20.1 million pounds in 1985. (Mandatory reporting requirements have been in effect only since 2004; that year, the haul was 71.6 million pounds.)
Only a few decades ago, Dr. Steneck said, the Maine fishery included cod, hake, haddock, halibut and swordfish, many of them lobster predators. Intense fishing has just about eliminated most of them. Meanwhile, baited traps provide lobsters with a steady food supply.
That has created an artificial ecosystem in which lobsters are ''hyperdense.'' Dr. Steneck said this kind of single-species crowding can be disastrous in the event of outbreaks like the parasite infestations and shell disease that severely reduced lobster yields in southern New England waters.
''Those things happened in an area that is more economically diverse than most of the coastline of the Gulf of Maine,'' Dr. Steneck said. He called the situation in Maine ''the equivalent of putting all your investments in a single stock.''
David Cousens, president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, said in an interview that the abundance of lobsters resulted from ''an unbelievably strong conservation ethic'' among lobstermen, who on the whole adhere scrupulously to regulations like those requiring that juvenile lobsters and egg-bearing females be released from traps. Others who study the situation agree.
Mr. Cousens, a lobsterman in South Thomaston, dismisses comparisons with lobster crashes farther south. ''It's a totally different thing,'' he said, noting that Maine waters are colder, richer in oxygen and less plagued by pollution.
Still, he agreed that ''if we got disease in the lobster fishery or we had a major glitch, there would be a lot of people impacted.''
''Everyone is relying on lobsters,'' he said.
In their paper, the researchers say a crash might so alter the gulf ecology that it could lead to years or even decades of low lobster yields. And that could end up changing the rugged face of the Maine coastline, said Charles S. Colgan, an economist at the Muskie School of Public Service at the University of Southern Maine, who was not involved in the new study.
''The pressure for development of the shoreline for other than fishing-related purposes is huge,'' he said. ''High-amenity real estate, which is waterfront, has its own demand.''
If lobstering falters, even briefly, he said, ''this working waterfront issue would be a critical problem.''
He added, ''Bob is right to remind people that simply saying, 'We'll just keep the lobster industry the way it is' is a dangerous approach.''
Mr. Colgan said diners might not notice if Maine suddenly stopped producing so many lobsters. ''There is not much difference between a Prince Edward Island lobster and a Maine lobster in your lobster roll,'' he said, adding that he suspects about half the ''Maine lobster'' sold in the world comes from somewhere else.
''But in communities along the coast it would be huge,'' he said.
Dr. Steneck said that increasing biodiversity by encouraging stocks of groundfish like cod might lead to reduction in lobster abundance. ''If you are bringing cod back to this ecosystem,'' he said, ''that's like bringing wolves into your flock.''
But Mr. Cousens said such efforts had been unsuccessful anyway, and added: ''The whole ecology of the gulf has changed. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.''
Robin Alden, executive director of the Penobscot East Resource Center, which aims to support Maine's fishing communities, says that whatever the answers, the questions are timely and important.
''I don't think there's a lobsterman on the coast who isn't concerned about this rapid expansion of catch,'' she said. ''It's a little spooky.''

HEADLINE: Why Flash Is the Future of Storage in Data Centers

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: Flash storage is making inroads in data-center computing, and a start-up may help accelerate the trend.

 BODY:
Flash memory has taken over the world of consumer computing as the storage technology used in iPods, iPads, smartphones and digital cameras. 
It is light, fast, energy-efficient and increasingly inexpensive when used in the comparatively small doses required by consumers.
Flash had made inroads in data-center computing, but mainly for specialized applications and in hybrid systems. What has held up the advance of flash for industrial-strength computing has been price. It has traditionally been 5 to 10 times more expensive to store a comparable chunk of data on flash than on hard disks.
But the cost handicap is eroding. And a start-up, Pure Storage, that is opening its business on Tuesday, makes a strong claim for the changing economics of flash. 
It asserts that its flash-and-software technology can store data for less than the cost of hard-disk storage. In addition, data access and retrieval is 10 times faster, and its systems use 10 times less power and space than conventional hard-disk storage.
A couple of early customers are impressed, and so are a few analysts who got briefings recently. 
Take Pure Storage's claims with a large grain of salt, to be sure. But the company, founded in 2009 and based in Mountain View, Calif., points to the direction data-center storage is headed, whether Pure Storage is a big success or not.
Scott Dietzen, the chief executive, is refreshingly candid on that point. "Our recipe is not going to be unique to Pure for the long term," he said. "But this change is going to come. This market is going to tip."
Pure Storage is joining a growing crowd of start-ups seeking to bring flash storage to the data-center market. Their ranks include Violin Memory, Nimbus Data, Nimble Storage, Tintri and WhipTail Technologies.
Fusion i-o, a flash-storage start-up, had a successful public offering in June. And the giant of the data storage industry, EMC, has an initiative, called Project Lightning, to accelerate its move into flash.
For its part, Pure Storage has attracted ample funding: an additional $30 million fund-raising round announced on Tuesday brings its total to $55 million from venture capitalists, individual investors and Samsung, the big Korean maker of flash chips.
The company's leadership team is deep in technical talent, with veteran experts in storage-management software and flash design from Veritas, Yahoo and Apple. Mr. Dietzen, a co-founder of Zimbra and former chief technology officer at BEA, holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon.
Pure Storage says it achieves gains in the economics of flash partly by using less-costly consumer-grade chips that are surrounded by smart software so its systems attain data-center-level reliability.
Second, Pure Storage has developed sophisticated software that reduces the amount of data that must be stored. This code parses the data coming in and recognizes duplicate blocks, so those do not have to be stored repeatedly. The technique is called in-line deduplication.
At Fenwick & West, a law firm based in Silicon Valley, the Pure Storage technology made it possible to store 50 to 90 percent less data than with conventional storage, said Matt Kesner, the chief information officer.
In test deployments of server applications like e-mail, the lawyers, who often send and open huge attachments, noticed the difference. 
"For the users, everything happened instantaneously," Mr. Kesner said, adding that when the test ended and the firm went back to the older storage technology, "the lawyers complained." 
At eMeter, which makes software for handling and analyzing the data flowing from utility smart meters, the Pure Storage flash systems sharply improved the computing performance on data-intensive chores. "We're talking about pure speed and transfer rates," said Bryan Bond, a senior systems administrator for eMeter.
Flash stores data in the cells of semiconductor chips instead of on spinning magnetic disks. The data-storing density of hard disks has improved at an extraordinary pace, like the exponential improvement in microprocessors over the years. But the performance bottleneck has been the scant improvement in the speed of finding and transferring the data from the spinning disks -- the mechanical side of hard-disk storage.
As companies grapple with a flood of new data -- from the Web, social networks, sensors and video -- the constraint of traditional storage only becomes greater. That, analysts say, is a crucial reason flash will sooner or later become a mainstream technology in data centers.
"It will become increasingly difficult to do tomorrow's work with today's storage technology," said Mark Peters, an analyst at Enterprise Storage, a research firm. "Flash is the only way to deal with big data-crunching challenges ahead."

HEADLINE: Toyota Says Camry Is 'Reinvented' for 2012

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The automaker staged a multi-location debut for the newest version of its top seller, pledging to beat unnamed competitors on performance, fuel efficiency and value.

 BODY:
"That's the most excitement that we've ever had for the introduction of a new model," Bob Carter, the Toyota division group vice president and general manager, said from a production lot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, Calif. A troupe of dancers, skateboarders and contortionists had taken their leave just seconds earlier. Mr. Carter did not specify, however, whether the excitement was generated by, or for, the new model in question.
The 2012 Camry was introduced Tuesday by Mr. Carter in Hollywood via Webcast, and by various Toyota executives across the country in a coordinated debut. Dealers are expected to receive the refreshed sedan in October.
The Paramount razzle-dazzle may have seemed unsuited to the Camry, which has relied on humble attributes like quality and value to outsell every car in the United States for 13 of the last 14 years. (Toyota leased the honor in 2001 to the Honda Accord.) The new car does not need to reaffirm the Camry's position in the midsize sedan firmament; the 2011 model was on track to be the highest-selling vehicle in the country for a 10th consecutive year, Mr. Carter said. However, the Camry is no longer the sine qua non of its segment.
To compete with manufacturers that went unnamed in Mr. Carter's address, Toyota is adhering to a more-for-less mantra. Each trim level on the Camry will offer improved power, fuel efficiency and comfort, Mr. Carter said, at prices below those of their 2011 equivalents.
For 2012, the base LE starts at $22,500, the sportier SE at $23,000, the more luxurious XLE at $24,725, the Hybrid LE at $25,900 and the Hybrid XLE at $27,400. Destination chargers are not included.
The base engine, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, produces 178 horsepower and is offered exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Though the E.P.A. has yet to certify the numbers, Toyota says that the engine and transmission combine for an average 25 m.p.g. in urban and 35 m.p.g. in highway driving. The hybrid produces 200 horsepower with the same engine and the brand's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, and Toyota expects that model to return 40 m.p.g. around town. The SE, meanwhile, receives a 3.5-liter V-6 producing 268 horsepower. Fuel-economy estimates for the V-6 are 21 m.p.g. city, 30 m.p.g. highway.
Mr. Carter went out of his way to state that performance and efficiency ratings would be "as good or better than competitors' V-6s or turbo 4-cylinder engines," an apparent dig toward the Hyundai Sonata, whose 2.0T 4-cylinder engine has endeared that sedan to automotive journalists and shoppers looking for a more spirited drive for their midsize dollar.
To tease out the Camry's claims to improved performance, Toyota announced that the 2012 model would be the official pace car at the Daytona 500 Nascar race next year. Denny Hamlin, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing in the Sprint Cup series, piloted a Camry dressed in pace-car livery onto the Paramount Studios lot during Tuesday's presentation. Another example was displayed at Citi Field in Flushing, Queens, home of the Mets baseball team.
Though Mr. Carter called the Camry's body "100 percent new," consumers may have difficulty perceiving the differences between the 2012 model and its predecessor, which was introduced in 2007. The head- and taillights now have sharp, darting creases that could be traced, if armed with a broad definition of brand genealogy, to the Lexus LF-A supercar. Otherwise, few changes are outwardly apparent in the Camry's styling.
Entune, Toyota's in-car telematics system, figures prominently in the Camry equipment list, as does a raft of safety features, including 10 standard air bags and the brand's Star Safety System, a suite of functions comprising stability control, traction control and various braking-assist features.
The 2012 model will be expected to protect its predecessor's market share against the Sonata as well as the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. Outliers like the new Volkswagen Passat and Kia Optima, as well as entries from domestic brands like the redesigned 2012 Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion, will also try to to chip away at, if not outright threaten, the Camry's sales position.

HEADLINE: A Returning Solider Answers the Inevitable Question: 'Why?'

BYLINE: JONATHAN RAAB


HIGHLIGHT: A loaded query has an answer that is not simple.

 BODY:

That seems like a simple question. But it is a loaded one. Why would want to go back to a conflict, let alone one that has been raging for almost 10 years, first as front-page news and now as a side story to political discussion about the national debt? Why would any sane person want to return to risk life and limb in a war that has no clear objective and faltering popular support? 
Why does anyone want to go back to I.E.D.s, rockets, machine guns, explosions in the middle of the night, long hours, brutal desert sun, icy winter winds, long marches under heavy packs, endless hours of tedium, boredom, pointless work details, angry locals, children with outstretched hands begging for pens or water, crappy food, no sleep, sand in every crevice, overbearing officers, fragos, rude P.O.G.s, messed-up paperwork, ambiguous letters from lovers, poor leadership, missed birthdays, missed graduations, missed parties, lost jobs, failed businesses, lost opportunity, broken hearts, unemployment, alcoholism, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder? 
How, when faced with the choice to deploy again, or to get out and live a comparably soft civilian life with all the comforts Western civilization and its opulence can offer, does a veteran choose the former?

The question hangs in the air, floating like a wisp of smoke over the sounds of children playing kickball, the hissing of freshly opened beers and the soft wind. If anyone is listening to the conversation, they will get extra quiet for a moment to hear the secret. Because there has to be a secret, if someone is going to go back to a war, a thing on the surface so noble (but so foolish), to justify another year without friends and family and several years to follow of cold conversations and uncomfortable, averted eyes that say let's change the subject.
When someone asks, I realize that I have about 30 seconds to condense years of frustration, painful memories, self-justifications, introspection, conversations with comrades, insecurity, guilt, resentment and humble prayers into an answer that is honest and accessible. Because the moment I open my mouth, interest and comfort begin to wane. 
When I start to speak, I am weighed down by all of this. How can I say that I would feel guilty if I did not go, or, even, the full truth, I would hate myself if I did not go again, to someone who has never worn combat boots? How can I make a statement about my own choices about war, risk, sacrifice and death, without making an inherent value judgment about their own?
I have taken to saying that I am going back because "chicks dig the uniform." It is simpler that way. 
How do I tell people that I do not want to look back on my generation's legacy and see the wreckage of a self-absorbed Facebook culture? How can I say that I often feel alone when in bars and surrounded by people, and when we talk about our petty concerns, I feel hollow and angry at myself for not being in the fight?
How can I not come across as some self-righteous, look-at-me jerk? 
 I that jerk?
How can I explain the hours I have spent watching or reading the news, seeing video or photographs of men with overloaded packs on their backs, rifles or machine guns in their hands, and a grim weariness etched across their too-young faces, and wanting to be there with them? What sense does that make, especially when here in America I am safe, fat and (supposedly) happy? How can I think this, knowing how messed up the military can be, or how bad my last deployment was? How can I look past a broken promotion system, garrison-centric attitudes and the lipstick-on-a-pig polices that hamper our war effort?
Are the wars about bringing American-style democracy to the people of Afghanistan? Are they about rooting out Al Qaeda? Are they about putting a Wendy's in Kabul or Baghdad?
I cannot control what our government says this is or is not about. But for me, and for many other veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is about the job. The job is protecting our nation and protecting one another. It is about experiencing a sense of exhilaration and pride that is unmatched in the civilian world. It is about assuming hardships that most people would not even consider and doing it with a sharp salute and a sense of purpose. 
It is about fighting the enemies of our nation. It is about seeing the looks of joy on the faces of our loved ones when we get home. It is about remembering those who went outside the wire (or just went to the chow tent) and did not come back. It is about all of the men and women in the combat support hospitals, in Germany, in Washington, or in Everytown, U.S.A., recovering from or living with the physical and emotional wounds of war.
It is about thousands of people who died in New York City simply because they went to work one Tuesday morning.
It is about seeing a man like Salvatore A. Giunta stand before our president and our nation to receive the highest honor conferred to our fighting men and women - the Medal of Honor - and hearing him give the credit not to himself, but to the men who stood with him when everything went to hell.

I have spent too many moments at work, at school, or by myself in my room with a cold beer in my hand thinking about how difficult it would be to go back. As comfortable as my life is here, I had grown weary of the daily slog of work and feigning interest in polite conversation with people who seemed distant or dishonest about their perspectives on military service.
When I left Afghanistan in 2008, I did my best to forget about how difficult my deployment had been. I had been a combat adviser working with the Afghanistan National Police. I was upset at the Army for not supporting our mission (logistically, in personnel, or in any real strategic sense), tolerating corruption, and ignoring its own doctrine. Some people didn't come home (or come home whole) because of poor leadership.
That deployment had left me bitter and angry, and those feelings had stained or ruined relationships with people I loved. I knew that if I had really changed - and I believe I have - then I would have to stop feeling sorry for myself. I would have to do something.
I began to have conversations with old war buddies - usually over a couple of beers - about doing it again. Some of them were angry that I would consider joining back up. A few of the older N.C.O.'s were not surprised at all.
I began to exchange news stories, opinion articles and book suggestions with one of the former platoon leaders of my old company. He was about to assume command of the unit, and he invited me to the change-of-command ceremony.
I showed up at the armory wearing jeans and a hoodie with my hands in my pockets. All around me soldiers worked to prepare the drill hall for the ceremony. It was not long before a few of the veterans of the unit recognized me and began to tease me as they shook my hand.
"Couldn't keep you away, huh Raab?"
"Get out while you still can, Sarge!"
"I knew you'd be back!"
I answered them with a flurry of gruntspeak: insults, curses and suggestions on where they could shove any re-enlistment contract. To an outsider, this would have seemed like hostility. 
It was not.
"Do you want to stand in formation with third platoon?" my old platoon sergeant asked. "We'll make a place for you."
"No, thanks," I said, lying through my teeth.
As the ceremony began, I watched the various platoons form up. I sat with the incoming commander's girlfriend and parents as an "honored guest," where I could not have felt more out of place.
The men snapped to attention, tall and straight, and it was everything I could do not to do the same.
I listened to the speeches of the officers and watched the company guidon pass to the hands of the incoming commander. I knew then that, if they were going, I was going to go, too. But it had taken me a long time to admit that I couldn't stand by and let them go without me, and it took a lot of thought, a lot of conversations and a lot of prayer to reach a point where I was O.K. with risking everything one more time.
Why do you want to go back?
It is about knowing that I traded another year of my prime to go stand and face hardship and the enemy like a man, faithful not in politics or policy, but in God and the infantrymen in my platoon. It is about trying to be something more than what our culture tells us is important or cool. It is about shrugging off the anger that sometimes bubbles up when I think about how so few have given so much for so many.
It is about doing something of consequence, if not on the political level, then on the personal. It is about standing alongside, serving with, working for, and leading some of the greatest men that I will ever know - men to whom words like honor, brotherhood and duty are said without snickering irony or shame.

Because I can help. And, in so doing, be helped myself.

HEADLINE: Taking Stock of Campus Sustainability

BYLINE: DYLAN WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Already attuned to environmental concerns, more colleges and universities are addressing broader issues of sustainability.

 BODY:
Colleges and universities across the country have quickly taken to measuring their environmental footprint: energy efficiency, consumption levels, renewable energy targets, number of green buildings, recycling rates, water use and even the prevalence of sustainability curriculums. But in this rush to go green, two of the three sustainability pillars have remained largely in shadow.
"In the U.S., unlike much of the world, the organizing paradigm of sustainability [began] with an environmental orientation and then added on environmental justice and ecological economics," said Paul Rowland, executive director of the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), in a recent e-mail exchange. "This is a historical root that has been difficulty to shake." 
The recent profusion of university sustainability offices is perhaps best reflected in the rise in membership to AASHE, which has grown by more than 2,200 percent in the past five years, with more than three-quarters of campus sustainability positions created since 2007.
David Orr, a self-described "loving critic of higher education" and professor and special assistant to the president at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, takes a more critical view of the situation. "Colleges and universities haven't rigorously and energetically challenged their role in planetary deterioration," said Dr. Orr. "They have been under-performers relative to the challenges humans are going to face and are already facing."
Under Dr. Orr's guidance, the Oberlin Project was launched in the summer of 2009 to implement a vision of what he calls full-spectrum sustainability. "In essence, we set a compass on the campus center and drew an eight-mile radius, then asked what it would take to build up this whole region."
The project focuses on five goals, including the creation of a 20,000-acre agricultural green belt and an educational partnership among four local schools. Oberlin College is directly invested in the redevelopment of a 13-acre green arts district and hotel downtown, which Dr. Orr used to exemplify the integration of sustainability goals. The hotel restaurant will feature food and produce from 35 local farms; local teenagers will be able to find jobs on these farms and at the hotel, which will host a culinary school; and local banks will lend capital to new businesses opening around the hotel. 
Ultimately, said Dr. Orr, through the alliance between Oberlin and the larger community, "we want to change the DNA of the college and the city to create a model of full-spectrum sustainability."
Julian Agyeman, professor of urban environmental policy and planning at Tufts University, also challenges colleges to "broaden and redefine sustainability and then measure what matters within that definition." Students enrolled in one of his courses recently devised a measure of campus sustainability that includes tenure and earnings by ethnicity, average income disparity between the highest and lowest paid Tufts community members, and the number and frequency of hate crimes on campus or involving the outside community.
 "These are a part of what makes a community sustainable as much as the number of wildflower meadows or the amount that's being recycled," said Dr. Agyeman, who also emphasized the importance of building coalitions within the campus and between colleges and the larger community.
"The integration of social justice has been difficult in part because there is a tendency on campus to think that existing diversity efforts have covered that issue," said Dr. Rowland. And yet an AASHE survey in 2010 of staffing in college sustainability offices found that 92 percent of employees who responded were white. 
"We ultimately need to inspire conversations that include a lot of people across a lot of boundaries," said Dr. Orr. University initiatives, to be truly sustainable, "must be embedded in a much bigger vision."
In the case of the Oberlin Project, their local work is propagating through a national network of organizations, including 15 military bases. "We want to bring together all of these ideas," said Dr. Orr. "I see the Oberlin Project as a lab, as the point of the spear in this movement. If we're successful at developing a robust network, then we have something: a bottom-up conversation that is incredibly powerful."

HEADLINE: A New Private School Doesn't Take Rejection Easily

BYLINE: JENNY ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: Avenues, which sees itself as a top-tier private school when it opens next year, is courting some families who have decided their children will go elsewhere.

 BODY:
When it comes to applying to private schools, New Yorkers often have to learn to live with rejection. Some who were accepted early at Avenues, the new for-profit school set to open in Chelsea in 2012, face a different problem: They are being actively pursued.
In a letter to one family whose children were accepted but declined to enroll, the school's president, Alan Greenberg, explained in great detail - three single-spaced pages - why they were making a big mistake.
"This is going to be the most important new school ever opened," Mr. Greenberg wrote, "anywhere in the world." He called the administration of the school, to serve kindergarten to grade 12, "the most talented leadership team ever," and said there was little comparison between Avenues and the schools the children were currently attending, which he described as "fine."
"I don't in any way mean this to be demeaning," he wrote. "But I would not be forthcoming or truthful if I did not say there is absolutely no comparison."
The letter was shared with The New York Times on the condition it not be published in full and the family not be identified.
Avenues is the brainchild of Chris Whittle, the founder of Edison Schools, a company that tried to make money from privatizing public school management. Eventually, he plans to open 20 campuses around the world.
The school broke ranks with other New York City private schools and instituted an early admission process: more than 1,200 students have already applied for the planned 1,300 spaces; according to the letter to the family, many were turned away, including 100 kindergarten applicants. "We could have completely filled "K" two times over just from our early admissions applications," it said, "not counting the many hundreds of applications we will undoubtedly receive in regular admissions."
Mr. Greenberg couched his courting of the family as concern for their children's welfare. "More than anything we hope that you will conclude that this is in your children's interest, as we all care deeply about the impact we can make on our student's lives," he wrote. "By the way, it should be clear our motives are not economic."
The letter went on to refer to Avenues as one of the very few top-tier school offerings anywhere downtown, though the school does not yet exist. Also without evidence is Mr. Greenberg's prediction that the children's chance of acceptance in the future is "just about nil" since demand will be so great. Most top schools reject 30 kindergarten applicants for every one they take, he noted.
In an interview, Mr. Greenberg said few families received such letters, which were personalized with the children's names and current schools. "It had to be a family we knew well and we thought the applicant would be a fabulous applicant for Avenues," he said, adding that the school wanted these applicants to return to meet again with the school's leaders and reconsider.
After all, Avenues' early applications "represent more than any new school in history," according to the letter. When asked the source of the statement, Mr. Greenberg said it was Avenues' research on New York City schools - though most of them open with only a few grades, not 12, making such comparisons tricky. "To our knowledge," he said, the assertion was accurate. "Could there possibly be one in India? Maybe."

HEADLINE: China Overtakes U.S. in PCs

BYLINE: VERNE G. KOPYTOFF


HIGHLIGHT: More personal computers were shipped to the Chinese market than to the American market in the last quarter.

 BODY:
China has reached yet another milestone in its rise as a consumer of technology by becoming the biggest market for personal computers.
In the second quarter, manufacturers shipped 18.5 million PCs in China compared with 17.7 million in the United States, according to IDC, a market research firm. It is the first time that shipments in China have exceeded those in the United States.
The shift reflects China's growing appetite for electronics and the increasing wealth of its huge population. However, it is likely just a temporary phenomenon - at least this year. 
The United States is expected to remain the top market for the full year with 73.5 million PC shipments versus 72.4 million in China, IDC said. Shipments in the United States typically rise in the fourth quarter because of the holidays - offsetting a slower pace the rest of the year - while China's contracts after the traditional summer discounts. 
In 2012, however, China is expected to lead the annual ranking. 
In any case, the market for PCs in the United States in weak because of the economy and the growing consumer appetite for tablets, which are not included in IDC's PC shipment estimates. PC shipments in the United States fell 4.2 percent in the second quarter to 17.8 million while shipments in Asia-Pacific, including China, grew 13 percent to 30.1 million.
"China's lead in the PC market is a huge shift that reflects the rising fortunes of emerging markets as well as the relative stagnation of more mature regions," said Loren Loverde, program vice president, Worldwide PC Tracker for IDC. "While the immediate economic circumstances in the U.S. and other markets had a significant impact on the timing of China's move to the lead, they have not changed the trend, but accelerated it."

HEADLINE: The Rich Can Afford to Pay More Taxes

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The issue is not whether the wealthy should pay more, but how best to accomplish it, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Warren Buffett's commentary in The New York Times on Aug. 15 has opened a new front in the continuing debate on whether taxes should be raised to reduce projected budget deficits. 
Mr. Buffett asserted that the well-to-do could easily shoulder a higher burden. Specifically, he proposed an increase in the current 35 percent top rate for those making more than $1 million and a further increase on those making more than $10 million. He also proposed taxing dividends and capital gains as ordinary income (currently, they are taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent).
Conservative groups such as the Tax Foundation pooh-pooh the idea of raising tax rates on the rich, asserting that there isn't enough money available to bother with. 
On Friday, however, the respected Tax Policy Center published estimates showing that the potential revenue would have a significant impact on projected deficits. It looked at several options, including a 50 percent top rate on incomes over $1 million and changes to the taxation of dividends and capital gains.
As one can see, the revenue potential depends critically on what baseline is assumed. That is because the top tax rate is already scheduled to rise to 39.6 percent on incomes over $380,000 in 2013. Moreover, dividends on corporate stock would go back to being taxed as ordinary income. And capital gains would go back to being taxed at a maximum rate of 20 percent.
The larger question is how much the well-to-do should pay. According to the Internal Revenue Service, in 2008, those in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, with incomes over $380,000, had an effective tax rate of 23.3 percent. In 1986, a year when the real gross domestic product grew a healthy 3.5 percent, their effective tax rate was 33.1 percent. It has been much lower every year since.
If this group were still paying 33.1 percent, federal revenue would have been more than $166 billion higher in 2008 alone. That would be enough to reduce the budget deficit by about 10 percent this year. If the top 1 percent of taxpayers had continued to pay the same effective tax rate they paid in 1986 every year from 1987 to 2008, the federal debt today would be $1.7 trillion lower.
Of course, these are not hard numbers. If the effective tax rate had stayed at 33.1 percent on the top 1 percent of taxpayers all these years, their behavior would undoubtedly have changed. 
And it probably would have been impractical to maintain a higher rate on just the top 1 percent of taxpayers without having had higher rates on many of those below that percentile. But it does show the order of magnitude of how much revenue has been sacrificed from tax cuts on those with very high incomes.
Some will argue that those tax cuts bought higher economic growth, but that is very doubtful. Growth was stronger in the 1990s when the relative revenue loss was small and was dismal during the George W. Bush administration, when two-thirds of the aggregate revenue loss occurred.
It is not class warfare to suggest that the richest 1 percent of people in society pay one-third of their income to the federal government, as they did under Ronald Reagan. Keep in mind that dividends were taxable as ordinary income every year of his administration, and in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 he supported taxing capital gains as ordinary income as well.
Higher effective tax rates on the rich could even be achieved without raising the top tax rate bracket to 50 percent, as it was under President Reagan. There are many tax preferences that largely benefit the well-to-do that could be scaled back to avoid raising marginal rates. 
The important thing is for people to accept that we can no longer afford such low effective tax rates on those with the greatest capacity to pay at a time when total revenues as a percentage of G.D.P. are at their lowest level in 60 years and we are facing a debt crisis. The issue is not whether the rich should pay more, but how best to accomplish it.

HEADLINE: S.&P.'s New President, a Crisis Troubleshooter

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Coming from Citigroup, Douglas L. Peterson has had a history of dealing with crises -- a background that could help the embattled ratings agency.

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's incoming president, Douglas L. Peterson, is stepping into a ratings agency challenged on many fronts.
But he has found himself in difficult positions before.
Mr. Peterson is taking over S.&P. from Deven Sharma at a time when the agency is dealing with outcry over a ratings downgrade of United States debt, inquiries over its rating of subprime mortgage securities and activist pressure on its parent company, McGraw-Hill. (A Citigroup internal memorandum has more about Mr. Peterson's departure.)
Since last year, he has worked as chief operating officer of Citigroup's retail and commercial banking unit. But he has one item on his resume that shows he knows how to deal with a crisis: his stewardship of Citi's Japanese operations after its private bank there was accused of securities law violations.
In May 2004, Mr. Peterson was appointed by Citi's then chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, as the point man to handle the fallout. The Japanese government eventually decided to withdraw the Citi unit's operational license, forcing the firm to close the unit down.
Mr. Peterson was called to testify before Japan's upper house of Parliament -- the first foreign witness called before a legislative committee -- and he and Mr. Prince offered deep bows of apology to Japanese regulators at a public press conference later that year. 
After that scandal, he built up Citi's presence in Japan, especially after the firm became the first foreign bank to obtain a local operating license. Citi purchased the country's third-largest brokerage, Nikko Cordial, in a$10.8 billion deal that required a great deal of sensitivity.
But the bank's dreams of establishing a sprawling universal bank in Japan faded after the financial crisis and it needed to raise fresh capital. Mr. Peterson oversaw the dismantling of Citi's Japan operations, including the Nikko businesses. 
"Just a week or two after reaffirming Citi's commitment to Japan, Vikram says we're splitting," a bank executive told MarketWatch in 2010, referring to current Citi chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit. "It could have made him [Peterson] look like a liar, or like he was out of touch, but he didn't let himself get bogged down in that -- he said O.K. and played the hand he was dealt."
Mr. Peterson returned to the United States that year to take on another operational challenge, helping to rehabilitate Citi's huge retail and commercial lending arm, Citibank.
He is a lifelong Citi veteran, having joined the company in 1985 in its Buenos Aires arm. Before heading to Japan, he was the firm's chief internal auditor.

Here is the internal Citi memo:
To: Senior Management
From: Gene McQuade
Date: August 22, 2011
Re: Doug Peterson
After 26 years of service to Citi, Doug Peterson has announced that he is leaving the company to become President of the ratings agency Standard & Poor's.
Doug was hired out of business school in New York and began his career in Argentina as a corporate banker. He went on to become the country manager in Costa Rica and then Uruguay. In 2001, he was appointed the Chief Auditor of Citigroup after having led the successful enterprise-wide integration of the Internal audit teams after the merger of Citicorp and Travelers. In 2004, he was named CEO of Citigroup Japan and oversaw the entire franchise covering Capital Markets, Corporate & Investment Banking, Global Transaction Services and Retail Banking. His broad experience, ability as a leader, and his success in Japan are some of the reasons he was asked to return to New York in 2010 to become the Chief Operating Officer of Citibank, N.A.
Doug's enthusiasm and great nature have made him a mentor and friend to many over the years. While we are happy for him and wish him well in his new role, we are sorry to see him go.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Media Account Goes Into Review

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: General Motors is placing in review its assignments to handle media planning and buying around the world.

 BODY:
General Motors is placing in review its assignments to handle media planning and buying around the world, the bulk of which are handled by three major media agencies.
The total amount of money that G.M. spends each year to run advertising around the world for its cars, trucks and other vehicles was not immediately available. By some estimates, it could total more than $3 billion.
In the United States, the company spent an estimated $2.13 billion on ads in 2010 and an estimated $2.16 billion in 2009. The assignments to create ads for G.M. products are not part of the review.

The media review was announced unexpectedly on Tuesday afternoon through a statement e-mailed to reporters by the G.M. communications department.
According to the statement, G.M. plans to contact "several global media companies" to ask them to take part in the review. They were not identified in the statement.
In the United States, media planning and buying are handled by the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe. Starcom MediaVest absorbed what had been two dedicated Publicis units that had worked on media tasks for G.M., one called G.M. Mediaworks and the other called G.M. Planworks.
In Europe, media planning and buying are handled by the Carat division of the Aegis Group. And in Latin America, media planning and buying are handled by the Universal McCann unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
G.M. works with a total of 20 media agencies around the world; those three handle most of the volume.
The media assignments in countries in which G.M. operates as part of joint ventures, like China and India, are not included in the review.
"We're looking for an innovative model that helps us become more effective in leveraging global marketing opportunities more efficiently," Joel Ewanick, vice president and global chief marketing officer at G.M., said in a statement that was included in the e-mail sent to reporters.
"We will make a comprehensive assessment of all options before reaching a decision," Mr. Ewanick said, "and in fact, may end up validating our current approach."
Translation: the review could conclude with no agency being dismissed and no new agencies hired.
The rethinking of G.M.'s media agency lineup is part of a "normal review of business processes," according to the statement. The assignments being reviewed include planning and buying for all media aimed at consumers, among them television, print, digital, search engine optimization and social media.
G.M. has, of course, been reassessing practically all its business processes since its bankruptcy during the recession. The top executive ranks went through a shake-up and the company discontinued venerable brands like Pontiac.

HEADLINE: 'Glee' Cast Helps Fashionistas

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The cast members of "Glee" are the stars of a music video that is the centerpiece of the promotional plans for the annual event known as Fashion's Night Out.

 BODY:
It is a long way from William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, to Manhattan, Milan or Paris. But the glee-club members of McKinley High are helping the fashion industry promote its annual shop-till-you-drop evening.
Of course, they are not actual glee-club performers, but rather the actors who play them on the Fox Broadcasting series "Glee."
Those cast members, along with Jane Lynch, who portrays their principal nemesis on the show, are the stars of a music video that is the centerpiece of the promotional plans for the annual event, known as Fashion's Night Out.
The third Fashion's Night Out is to be held on Sept. 8 in cities around the world and will feature special events and sales sponsored by stores and designers.

In the video, the cast members and Ms. Lynch dance, sing, cavort and walk the runway in haute couture from the likes of Prada, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Dries Van Noten.
The song on the soundtrack to which they perform is, appropriately enough, the 1980 David Bowie tune "Fashion."
The video, which can be watched on YouTube, is to make its official debut on Tuesday night during a rerun of the Lady Gaga episode of "Glee." The video is tentatively scheduled to appear at around 8:30 p.m. Eastern time.
The video was created by Trey Laird of Laird & Partners, the New York agency that specializes in fashion advertising campaigns. The effort was commissioned by the Fashion's Night Out organization and Vogue magazine, part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications.
The campaign for the first Fashion's Night Out, in 2009, featured designers and fashion-friendly celebrities like Sarah Jessica Parker. The campaign for last year's event featured fashion models.
"When Anna and I talked this year," Mr. Laird said in a phone interview, referring to Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, "we liked the idea of a performance" as the focus of the campaign.
"As fashion becomes more of a pop-culture influence," Mr. Laird said, it made sense to consider using the cast of "Glee" because the series is "such a pop-culture phenomenon."
After approvals were obtained, Mr. Laird said, from Ryan Murphy, the creator of "Glee," and Mr. Bowie, the video was filmed in Manchester, England, where the "Glee" cast was appearing as part of a concert tour.
Just about every major cast member takes part in the video except for Matthew Morrison, who plays the teacher who leads the glee club. The actors include Dianna Agron, Chris Colfer, Darren Criss, Kevin McHale, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Chord Overstreet, Mark Salling and Harry Shum Jr.
Ms. Lynch carries the bullhorn used by her "Glee" character, Sue Sylvester, and declares at the end of the video, "Now get out and shop!"
For all the adulation of "Glee," there has recently been something of a backlash against the show's seeming ubiquity in the media. And a recent 3-D film of the "Glee" cast's concert tour was a notable flop at the box office.
"I don't think it's overexposed," Mr. Laird said.
"There's a huge fan base," he added, that "brings in an excitement, an energy."
Mr. Laird pointed to youtube.com, where the video was uploaded with no advance publicity; it has already been watched more than 221,800 times.
Mr. Laird also took issue with contentions that Fashion's Night Out, which began during the recession as a way to stimulate retail sales, has outlived its usefulness.
"Fashion's Night Out is an exciting thing, a positive thing," he said. "It gets people out and about and interested in the stores and what's in the stores."
"Whatever we can do to continue that is a good thing," he added.
In addition to the presence on YouTube and on "Glee," plans call for the video to be streamed on fashionsnightout.com, fox.com and vogue.com. The video is also to run on Taxi TV screens, Mr. Laird said, and on signs in Times Square.
On Sept. 8, the video will again appear on the Times Square signs, he added, as well as in selected stores taking part in Fashion's Night Out. Also, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Michele and other "Glee" figures may be in New York on Sept. 8 to participate in the event, Mr. Laird said.

HEADLINE: In Fed's Move on Capital One Deal, a Test of Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve must weigh in on Capital One's proposed purchase of ING Direct, and it could have a broad impact on what Dodd-Frank means for the nation's biggest banks.

 BODY:
Capital One is the latest bank accused of being "too big to fail."
A proposed $9.2 billion purchase of the online bank ING Direct would make Capital One the fifth-largest bank in the United States with more than $200 billion in deposits.
But before this acquisition can be completed, it requires clearance from the Federal Reserve, Capital One's chief regulator. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the Federal Reserve weigh the systemic risk of the combined company. If the risk outweighs the benefits of the transaction, the deal must be blocked.
The Fed has yet to decide what constitutes a systemically risky acquisition. So its decision on Capital One could have a broad impact on what Dodd-Frank means for the nation's biggest banks.
Community interest groups led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which oppose the deal, say that Capital One is already classified under Dodd-Frank as systemically important since it has more than $50 billion in assets. Why should any such bank be allowed to get bigger?
Moreover, Capital One is likely to use ING Direct's deposits to finance its main business: credit card issuance. And Capital One is moving to expand significantly in this debt-driven consumer credit sector. Earlier this month, Capital One announced the acquisition of HSBC's $30 billion credit card portfolio in the United States. After the HSBC deal, Capital One will remain the United State's fifth-largest credit card issuer, but its market share will rise to about 9 percent from 7 percent.
National Community suggests that this will result in ever more credit cards at high-interest rates being pushed to American consumers who presumably can't fend for themselves.
Because the Federal Reserve has yet to spell out its own "too big to fail" guidelines, Capital One has proposed its own test to the Fed. Capital One looks at bank size and its interconnectedness and importance to the financial system. Not surprisingly, Capital One fails to meet this criteria. The bank rightly notes that after the two acquisitions, it would still be a pipsqueak next to Bank of America, the largest United States bank with $2.26 trillion in assets. Capital One will have only a measly $300 billion or so. How could this increase systemic risk?
Moreover, Capital One argues that it does not engage in the complex type of banking that a Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley does, like writing derivatives. Capital One is going to be a simple, deposit-taking institution that lends money primarily on credit cards.
Some analysts have said that the ING Direct acquisition will make Capital One sounder because it will provide Capital One a more stable source of financing for its lending activities than borrowing in the short-term lending market.
Who is right?
Clarity, if not an answer, may have come inadvertently from National Community. The coalition argues that Capital One's application to acquire ING Direct is suspect because Capital One refuses to lower its credit standards to extend Federal Housing Administration-insured loans to people with credit scores of 580. This is the lowest credit score allowed by the F.H.A. National Community contends that this is discriminatory against members of minority groups because they tend to have lower credit scores and have been hit harder by the financial crisis.
Capital One has responded by agreeing to lower its credit score requirements by 2012. For National Community, this is not enough, because Capital One's F.H.A. loan volume is relatively flat in growth. Capital One is now a bit player with less than 1 percent of the F.H.A. loan market. National Community wants the combined entity to make more of these loans, since they help people who could not otherwise afford a mortgage.
So National Community is arguing that Capital One should take more risk when making home loans, but less risk in getting bigger and offering credit cards. Remember, the financial crisis was caused in significant part by excessive, and sometimes predatory, subprime lending. Capital One may not be predatory, but the borrowing National Community wants is lower down on the subprime scale and will create more risk.
Perhaps National Community's apparently contradictory position can be reconciled by saying that it is distinguishing between good debt to buy a home and bad debt in the form of consumer credit.
The Capital One acquisition is thus really about what type of banking system we want. Do we want a large banking system that has a significant focus on consumer credit? Or do we want smaller banks focused on communities and mortgage lending? And do we want to steer our banks away from certain types of lending?
Dodd-Frank left these questions unanswered. Congress was also unable to decide what it wanted from its banking system, so it kicked the can to the Fed.
In truth, the ING Direct acquisition does not appear to increase Capital One's systemic risk materially. Capital One will still be a relatively small bank. One could even argue that allowing this midsize bank to get a little bigger might create a real competitor to steal away assets and downsize the banks that are truly way too big, like Bank of America. And many argue that we need big banks in a $14 trillion economy. The real issue is their prudent operation.
As for Capital One's ability to issue yet more credit cards, this may be a problem, but the government is still grappling with the nation's addiction to credit cards, as well as the real benefits in the form of credit this lending provides.
This is why the Federal Reserve's decision on what constitutes a systemically risky acquisition will be so important. Does it extend beyond the size of a bank and its interconnectedness to how the economy works? Because of this issue, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, has requested that the Federal Reserve hold public hearings on the matter.
Whether or not a public hearing is necessary, the Federal Reserve should be particularly careful. It needs to put forth a definition that ensures that the banking system is adequately monitored under the current definition for systemic risk. The rules it makes for Capital One could govern the entire banking system going forward. For these rules will naturally extend to other Dodd-Frank provisions that allow the Fed to break up banks that pose a similar threat.
But so far, the Federal Reserve has said almost nothing about how it will apply these rules. This is no way to run a banking system. Whether or not the Fed approves the Capital One/ING Direct transaction, it is time for the Fed to run public hearings on what exactly Dodd-Frank means for our banks and what we as a country want from them.
It has been nearly three years since the banking system nearly collapsed, and we still have not confronted the real banking issues raised by the financial crisis. What type of banks do we really want and need?

HEADLINE: Fears About Bid Rock Temple-Inland's Shares

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The stock falls after a lawsuit accuses Temple-Inland of stripping assets from Guaranty Financial before it spinning it off.

 BODY:
Shares of Temple-Inland, the target of a $3.3 billion hostile offer by the International Paper Company, plunged on Tuesday after a lawsuit accused Temple-Inland of helping cause the failure of a Texas bank. 
The litigation stems from Temple-Inland's ownership of the bank, the Guaranty Financial Group, which it spun off in 2007. Two years later, Guaranty collapsed after sustaining huge losses on mortgage-backed securities. The bank was seized by regulators and most of its assets and deposits were sold to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria of Spain.
The news of the lawsuit, filed on Monday in the United States District Court in Dallas, unnerved investors who have been betting on International Paper winning Temple-Inland, a corrugated packaging maker. Since International Paper announced its cash offer of $30.60 a share on June 7, Temple-Inland's shares had risen 18 percent before Tuesday. 
But on Tuesday, amid worries about possible legal liability, shares of Temple-Inland fell as much as 23 percent, before trading down 16 percent, at $20.88 in late trading. 
In a research note on Tuesday afternoon, Citigroup said there was already uncertainty about the success of an International Paper takeover given the economy and the protracted nature of a hostile bid. For Temple-Inland's management, the note said, "the lawsuit provides a significant distraction at a sensitive time."
International Paper's tender offer is scheduled to expire on Sept. 8. 
Kenneth L. Tepper, the trustee for the liquidation trust of Guaranty, filed the lawsuit, accusing Temple-Inland, several of its directors, its affiliates and the directors of the bank of "fraudulently looting GFG [Guaranty Financial Group] and the bank of assets exceeding one billion dollars."
Temple-Inland, the trustee's lawsuit says, operated Guaranty like "a captive finance arm of Temple-Inland's manufacturing operation." After stripping the bank, the lawsuit says, Temple-Inland spun off "the fatally crippled and doomed-to-fail GFG and its subsidiaries as separate stand-alone corporations."
Temple-Inland in a statement on Tuesday said that the lawsuit's claims were without merit and that the company would vigorously defend itself.
"We have previously disclosed that the liquidating trustee may file such a claim against us and that we do not believe that we have any liability related to the spinoff of Guaranty Financial Group," Temple-Inland said.
In the takeover battle, Temple-Inland is being advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
International Paper is being advised by UBS, which has also committed financing, Evercore Partners and the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.

HEADLINE: Pataki Visit Stirs Speculation About Presidential Bid

BYLINE: GERRY MULLANY


HIGHLIGHT: Former New York Gov. George E. Pataki considers a presidential bid.

 BODY:
Former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who has considered running for president in the past, is again mulling a bid for the Republican nomination and is planning a high-profile appearance in Iowa this weekend.
Mr. Pataki, 66, who served three terms as governor, from 1995 through 2006, is scheduled to attend a Republican picnic in Des Moines on Saturday. Organizers said they expected that he would clarify his intentions at the event.
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, David M. Catalfamo, said on Tuesday that the governor was seriously weighing seeking the nomination. Mr. Catalfamo declined to comment on whether Mr. Pataki would make a formal declaration soon.
"President Obama's wrong decisions on the economy and his failed leadership on debt, coupled with a lack of real solutions being offered by the current Republican field of candidates, has Governor Pataki seriously considering getting in the race," Mr. Catalfamo said in an e-mail message.
But signs pointed to a possible announcement by Mr. Pataki at a fundraiser to be held by the Polk County Republican Party on Saturday, which is expected to draw several presidential candidates, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Representative Ron Paul of Texas.
Pataki aides informed organizers of the event on Monday that Mr. Pataki would attend. Darrell Kearney, finance director for the Polk County Republican Party, said he was told that Mr. Pataki would discuss his 2012 plans there.
"I asked them if he was going to announce that he was going to run, and the response was 'very seriously considering it,' and that he was going to have something to say about that on Saturday," Mr. Kearney said in a telephone interview. "I got the impression that he was not a candidate now, but he might be a candidate by the end of the week."
It has been more than a decade since Mr. Pataki began cultivating a national profile, and he weighed seeking the Republican nomination in 2008 before deciding against it.
Mr. Pataki is considered a long-shot candidate for the Republican nomination, in part because his moderate stances on some social issues, especially abortion, are not in tune with those of many primary voters. While Mr. Pataki pushed through major tax cuts in his first year as governor, his later years saw sizable increases in state spending, which could diminish his appeal among Republican voters intent on reining in the federal budget.
Mr. Pataki has returned to public view in recent months as honorary chairman of No American Debt, which favors reducing the federal debt and has been critical of President Obama's fiscal policies.
So far this year, Mr. Pataki has made several visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, another early voting state in the 2012 contest. His group has aired television commercials in both states in which he appears.

Mr. Pataki has returned to public view in recent months as honorary chairman of No American Debt, which favors reducing the federal debt and has been critical of President Obama's fiscal policies.
So far this year, Mr. Pataki has made several visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, another early voting state in the 2012 contest. His group has aired television commercials in both states in which he appears.

HEADLINE: Can We Judge Economic Success? Perry Versus Obama

BYLINE: GARY GUTTING


HIGHLIGHT: It's extremely difficult to know whether a politician deserves credit for the state of the economy.

 BODY:
Is Barack Obama responsible for our current economic problems? Should Gov. Rick Perry of Texas get credit for his state's relative prosperity through the Great Recession? Investor's Business Daily thinks the answers are clear: "By almost every measure, Texas has done far better over the past two and a half years under Perry's stewardship than the nation as a whole has done under Obama's." Specifically, says I.B.D., since Obama's term begin in 2009, Texas has surpassed the United States as a whole in adding jobs, lowering unemployment and increasing economic growth and wages. 
Logically, of course, this is a fallacy: assuming that just because Obama and Perry were in office, they were , respectively, for what happened to the economies of the United States and Texas. Obama supporters make the same mistake when they note that the economy has significantly improved since he took office and conclude that he should get credit for this. In fact, they compound the mistake when they go on, as David Axelrod has, to argue that Texas's economic success under Perry has been due to increased oil prices and military spending and not to Perry's policies. That may be so, but then Obama supporters cannot consistently claim that Obama automatically gets credit for improvements in the national economy. The problem is how to move from correlation (B occurred after A) to causality (A brought about B). 
Even if we agree that the person in charge deserves some credit (or blame) for the state of the economy, it doesn't follow that different policies would have produced a significantly different result. Obama's stimulus and bailout programs may have helped reverse the decline in gross national product, but that doesn't mean that conservative tax-cuts and relaxed regulation would not have had a similar effect. Conversely, Obama's policies might have worked in Texas as well as Perry's. 
Of course, it is often easy to see that a particular policy produced a short-term economic effect: Obama's cash-for-clunkers program caused an increase in car sales. But it is much more difficult to determine what effect an administration's overall policies had on long-run economic health. Expert economic analysis might in principle produce some creditable conclusions. But there is little chance of a consensus among economists on such an analysis, particularly when political stakes are high. We ordinary citizens are left with no reliable professional guidance. 
Moreover, given the immense complexities of economic life, even the most theoretically sound policy will require a lot of luck to succeed. Natural disasters, new technologies, the discovery of new natural resources and economic turmoil in other countries can all reverse the best thought-out policies. Even the most careful economic analysis is likely to conclude that uncontrollable factors play a major role.
But we Americans, at least, are loath to recognize the profound role of luck in human affairs. We know that luck can always intervene, but our instinct is to praise or blame the people involved. Athletics provides some of the clearest examples: the winners of close contests between evenly matched teams are almost always just luckier than the losers. But we seldom ever admit this - how often do you see a headline like "State Lucks Out Over Tech"? - and instead insist on thinking that the winners tried harder, had better coaching, were better conditioned, etc. Similarly, we are unmoved by statistical studies suggesting that when players are "hot" this is usually just a random deviation, a matter of luck.
This disdain for luck leads us to insist on a cause even when the evidence supports merely a correlation. We want to believe that the president or the governor must be responsible for a good or bad economy. More generally, we simply assume that good leaders are precisely those who experience success. All else being equal, for example, Obama will likely win reelection if and only if the economy significantly improves over the next year. But a victory or defeat for this reason would show our irrationality as voters.
I am not saying that we can never make rational judgments about a political leader's success. It can be easy to see, for example, that a president has (or has not) passed a legislative program, negotiated a treaty or rallied the nation in a time of crisis. My point is just that it is extremely difficult to make the case that a political leader deserves credit or blame for the state of the economy.
The coming presidential campaign will offer ample opportunity to make solid judgments of candidates based on their knowledge and experience in economic policy and the intelligence of their economic proposals. But there will also be much pointless fretting about the health of the economy as a touchstone of Obama's success or failure. Particularly demoralizing is the thought of a close election, with everything depending on the final October unemployment reports.

HEADLINE: Why Another Democrat Wouldn't Do Better Than Obama in 2012

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Obama may be losing popularity, but for Democrats turning to another candidate might be a bad idea. 

 BODY:
You know that a president is having a rough time when you start to see speculation that his party would be better off if it replaced him on the ticket.
There has been more of this recently: the political scientist Matthew Dickinson argued that Democrats would improve their chances if Hillary Clinton defeated Barack Obama in a primary challenge. The astute Ed Morrissey of the blog Hot Air wondered if Democrats might benefit if Mr. Obama simply declined to run for a second term.
President Obama's re-election bid is in quite a lot of trouble, with falling approval numbers and sour economic forecasts. But it's probably mistaken to assume that those problems would just go away if Democrats replaced him with another candidate.
The evidence, if anything, points in the opposite direction: Mr. Obama is more popular than his policies, and probably gives the Democrats a better chance of maintaining the White House than another Democrat would. Three pieces of data to consider:
First, Mr. Obama's personal favorability ratings -- which continue to average about 50 percent -- are considerably higher than his approval ratings, which are now around 40 percent. It's not uncommon for favorability ratings to track a point or two ahead of approval ratings -- but this is a particularly large gap. Voters remain reasonably sympathetic to Barack Obama, the person, even if they're growing less and less thrilled with his performance.
Can Mr. Obama use that sympathy to persuade hesitant voters to give him another chance? Well, we'll see. But usually when a party would be better off disposing of its incumbent, it's because these numbers run in the opposite direction: the candidate has some personal liability that is overshadowing his policy positions. Textbook examples would include former Senator Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican whose old age (and apparent symptoms of senility) concerned voters, or retiring Senator John Ensign of Nevada, who has been involved in a series of scandals. Mr. Obama, by contrast, is young and healthy and has probably had fewer scandals than any recent president.
The second statistic is Mr. Obama's approval ratings, which, although now rather poor, are no worse than you would probably expect from the sour mood of the country. In fact, for most of his first term, the opposite had been true. Based on the precedent established by past presidents, Mr. Obama's approval ratings had been several points higher than they "should" have been based on questions about whether the country was headed in the right direction.
Mr. Obama's approval ratings have slipped now -- but so has the national mood, with recent polls suggesting that only about 17 percent of Americans think the country is on the right track. (The number was closer to 30 percent two months ago.) Mr. Obama's approval ratings, at 40 percent, may not win him re-election -- but seem tolerable by comparison.
To be sure, an argument can be made that Mr. Obama himself bears some responsibility for the pessimistic national mood -- particularly in recent weeks, as the latest decline in confidence seems to have as much to do with political as economic factors. If nothing else, Mr. Obama has failed so far to persuade voters that America's best days are ahead of it.
Then again, approval numbers are down for essentially all incumbent politicians. Quite a few Americans have been tolerant of Mr. Obama's performance despite their concerns about where the country is headed.
Finally, it's worth recalling the last major election in which Mr. Obama on the ballot: last November's midterms, in which Democrats lost 63 seats in the House. Although Mr. Obama's approval rating was middling at the time -- about 45 percent -- that's a somewhat worse loss than would have been expected based on his approval ratings alone.
The implicit assumption here, of course, is that another Democrat would not be able to shed Mr. Obama's liabilities on the economy. Relatively few voters blame Mr. Obama personally for the performance of the economy -- they're simply sick and tired of the poor numbers all the same. Another Democratic candidate would not magically turn 9.2 percent unemployment into 5.2 percent unemployment.
Nor is it likely that another Democrat would advocate policy positions that differed substantially from Mr. Obama's, which are very close to those of the typical Democrat in Congress. Few Democrats argued against the need for economic stimulus. The health care proposals advanced by Ms. Clinton and John Edwards during the 2008 campaign were not much different from Mr. Obama's now-unpopular one. Few Democrats have any ideas about how to substantially reduce unemployment that could pass through the Republican Congress.
So the message would be mostly the same -- but would be delivered by a Democrat who was probably no more effective a messenger than Mr. Obama, and who would lack the aesthetic and tactical advantages of being an incumbent president.
Instead, if Mr. Obama declined to run for a second term, Democrats would have to deal with questions about why their president had quit on the job, something which would be read as an admission of failure and which would make his record even harder to defend. The two most recent presidents who declined to run for another term while they were eligible for one, Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, both saw their successors lose their elections despite a prosperous economy.
Certainly, Mr. Truman and Mr. Johnson had other concerns to deal with, like the Vietnam and Korean Wars. But Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey were attacked on those issues just as an incumbent might have been.

HEADLINE: C.F.T.C. Hires Top Derivatives Lawyer

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Gary Barnett, head of the derivatives practice at Linklaters in New York, will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's first director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight.

 BODY:
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the newly appointed overseer of the $600 trillion derivatives market, has hired a top private-sector lawyer to head its new unit charged with policing the complex securities. 
Gary Barnett, who currently leads the derivatives practice at Linklaters in New York, will join the regulatory agency as its first director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight. The C.F.T.C. recently created the division with new powers granted under the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory law enacted last year.
The appointment comes at a pivotal time for the agency, which has struggled to scrape together funds for a long-awaited hiring spree. 
Under Dodd-Frank, the agency for the first time has broad new authority over swaps, the derivative contracts often tied to the value of commodities, interest rates or mortgage securities. The long unregulated swaps market was at the center of the financial crisis. 
"Gary Barnett comes to the C.F.T.C. with a vast knowledge of the swaps market," Gary Gensler, the agency's chairman, said in a statement. The new swaps division, he added, also "will provide necessary oversight of this market."
Over the last year, the agency has proposed dozens of new derivatives regulations, including a plan that would require many swap contracts to be traded on regulated exchanges. Ultimately, the law requires the commission to finalize more than 50 new rules.
But to do so, Mr. Gensler said he needs to ramp up the agency's hiring, which has been on hold amid budget uncertainty. Without a flood of new staff, the agency has had to delay many Dodd-Frank rules for up to six months. Mr. Gensler also warned that, without new staff, the C.F.T.C. will struggle to oversee the swaps market. 
The agency hopes to avoid that with the hiring of Mr. Barnett, who before joining Linklaters was the co-head of the securitization and derivatives practice at Shearman & Sterling.
"His derivatives expertise will be essential to leading the C.F.T.C's new division, which will be integral to implementing the Dodd-Frank provisions that will lower the risk of the swaps market to the overall economy," Mr. Gensler said.

HEADLINE: Big Banks' Success Can Be a Hazard

BYLINE: By ROB COX and ANTONY CURRIE

 BODY:
To hear the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation tell it, the banking industry is returning to fine fettle. The number of institutions on the agency's problem list fell for the first time in nearly five years. Bank failures are down. Loan books even grew slightly. So the crisis in America's financial system is officially coming to an end.
Yet although in aggregate the industry looks in better shape, the reality is more complicated. America's biggest banks are indeed recovering nicely. But they are doing so at the expense of the country's thousands of smaller institutions. 
Consider the F.D.I.C.'s latest statistical data release. The country's 106 banks with assets of more than $10 billion increased their share of industry assets to a record 79.1 percent. That has made them more efficient and allowed them to increase their earnings some 20 percent faster than smaller banks in the second quarter.
A higher concentration of banking assets is not necessarily a problem. America should not really need 7,513 banks to efficiently allocate credit to businesses and consumers. Canada does it with just a handful. But it does create some hazards.
First, America's smaller banks are still the primary providers of capital to small businesses, which are in turn the main engine of job creation. Fewer banks issuing less credit to small businesses is hardly an ideal recipe for bringing down the country's 9.1 percent unemployment rate.
Second, as big banks increase in size, so does the potential damage to the economy and the government's finances should they fail. And that in turn increases the chances that policy makers and regulators become less inclined to actually let them fail and turn instead to hazard-ridden bailouts -- the very thing that recent reforms were supposed to prevent.
This too-big-to-fail menace is clear in the F.D.I.C.'s figures. The small fry are paying, on average, almost 50 percent more than the largest banks for deposits that finance their loan books. This gap makes it easier for the big to outrun and poach from the small. That may fatten up the industry's headline numbers, but not without some risk.
A Stock Is Mired
Bank of America's shareholders are resigning themselves to life on skid row. Fears of a dilutive capital increase have helped send the stock down to just 30 percent of book value. The worries may prove overblown. Even so, Bank of America's long-running mortgage woes have moved a seemingly endless list of litigants ahead of equity investors in the pecking order.
On Monday, a judge allowed mortgage bondholders to challenge an $8.5 billion settlement the bank struck with 22 institutional investors in June. The deal to cap repurchase claims from the government-owned mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac does not look as solid as when it was sealed in January.
What's more, state attorneys general are still battling over whether the foreclosure fiasco settlement should include future immunity for banks involved. Other cases keep emerging, like American International Group's $10 billion lawsuit earlier this month. Throw in heightened concerns about more losses if the economy dips back into recession, and hopes of a turnaround for Bank of America shareholders look even more remote.
Despite all this, the bank is in better shape than in 2008. It has twice as much capital, some 50 percent more reserves against loan losses and at least another $20 billion set aside for mortgage claims. With $400 billion in cash and easy-to-sell securities on its balance sheet, the bank should be able to weather a liquidity crisis.
Bank of America, under the leadership of Brian Moynihan, also has significant profit potential, in theory. Analysts estimate it could earn $15 billion next year. There are assets to sell, including its $17 billion stake in China Construction Bank. Including tax benefits and balance sheet restructuring, there should be enough to raise its Tier 1 common equity ratio under new capital rules to 9 percent by the end of 2013, according to Credit Suisse.
That would put Bank of America on a solid capital footing six years ahead of the Basel III deadline. But that is also the problem. If all those funds are needed to shore up the firm, benefits for shareholders are further postponed. Until the legal claims can be resolved and Bank of America's exposure to more losses clarified, the stock looks set to stay in the gutter.

HEADLINE: Giants-Jets Home Now MetLife Stadium

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
One after another, MetLife was asked to buy stadium and naming rights. And each time, it said no.
Nothing was better, year after year, than having the MetLife blimp, Snoopy 1, floating above major sports events. Nothing produced a better return on investment. 
''The blimp is a flexible, roving stadium,'' said Beth Hirschhorn, MetLife's chief marketing officer, ''which is why it was difficult for any property to compare.''
MetLife made a big leap beyond Peanuts characters and airship advertising a few years ago when it became one of four cornerstone partners at New Meadowlands Stadium. The home of the Jets and the Giants was still in blueprints at the time, but Hirschhorn thought that owning the equivalent of marketing real estate at the stadium was worth the life insurer's investment of $7 million to $8 million a year.
But on Tuesday, MetLife took the next step and it acquired the name of the stadium.
MetLife Stadium joins a region populated by CitiField, Prudential Center and Red Bull Stadium. Its deal is for 25 years and is worth $17 million to $20 million annually.
The money will be split between the Giants and the Jets, who financed construction of the stadium.
Why would a widely recognized insurer need to have its name on the stadium?
Three reasons, Hirschhorn said: for the media exposure that a stadium in the New York market with two N.F.L. teams and a Super Bowl in 2014 can bring; for the connection that it will have with fans; and for the dynamism that football brings to the stodgy world of life insurance.
''MetLife has near ubiquitous brand awareness,'' Hirschhorn said. ''This helps raise our top of mindedness.''
The Giants and the Jets have searched for nearly three years to find a company to buy the stadium's naming rights since almost selling them to Allianz, a German insurer, for more than MetLife is paying. After a report in The New York Times about Allianz's ties to the Third Reich, the advanced talks fell apart.
Then the recession hit, which dampened the naming-rights market and forced teams to bide their time in hopes that a corporation would pay what they were charging.
''We reached out to hundreds of companies,'' said John Brody, principal of global sales and business development at the Wasserman Media Group, which helped the teams find a buyer for the stadium name. ''MetLife is a company with the ideals the teams desired.''
Among the other companies solicited beside MetLife were the stadium's other cornerstone partners: Bud Light, Verizon and Pepsi.
Steve Tisch, the chairman of the Giants, said, ''I can't honestly remember a company that we got to first base with'' until MetLife.
The deal was signed in time for announcers to start calling it MetLife Stadium for Saturday night's Jets-Giants game, but it will be a few weeks until the four giant illuminated signs outside the stadium will be erected. And at MetLife's section of the stadium, a statue of Lucy Van Pelt trying to throw a pass.

 BODY:
STOCK WOES A number of factors are weighing on Bank of America's stock as it skids toward levels it has not seen since the credit crisis. Most notable among them, its troubled mortgage division has racked up billions of dollars in legal bills and they are still growing. 
But some analysts say the problem comes down to the market perception that the bank needs more capital. Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, above, is insisting the bank does not need to raise capital, but the market clearly disagrees. SUSANNE CRAIG
and BEN PROTESS
BIG MAC The private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management and its partner, the Chatham Lodging Trust, say they have terminated their $1.1 billion acquisition of 64 hotels from Innkeepers USA Trust, arguing that a material adverse change has occurred.
A deal-breaking move like this, the Deal Professor says, makes it feel as if we are back in the financial crisis, when these efforts were all too common. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF
A NORMAL DEFENSE In the world of white-collar crime, news that a corporate executive is retaining a lawyer for representation in an investigation is about as interesting as pointing out that the sun rises in the east.
However, since it was the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, shareholders got spooked and the investment bank lost nearly $2.7 billion in market value on Tuesday. But this is an overreaction, according to White Collar Watch. PETER J. HENNING

HEADLINE: Cleaner Harbor Has a Downside: Pests That Plague Park Construction

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Over the next few years, New York City plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on shoreline parks, in possibly the biggest burst of waterfront-park construction in its history. Some of that money will buy things like new lawns, ball fields and even skateboard parks, but most of it will pay for something far more prosaic: concrete pilings.
At the newly reopened East River Park, $65 million of the total $83 million spent on the park went to infrastructure work, including replacing 14,000 rotted timber pilings with 715 concrete supports, encased in steel for good measure. And at Brooklyn Bridge Park, officials are now spending $11 million to encase more than a thousand pilings beneath Pier 5 in concrete. The cost to do all 12,000 pilings at the park in the next few decades -- $200 million.
''The icing on the cake, the part that people enjoy, is actually the least expensive part of a project,'' said Joshua Laird, the assistant commissioner for planning and parklands for the city's Department of Parks and Recreation. 
Behind the higher costs is a paradox: The significantly cleaner harbor, despite recent sewage problems, has created a problem for parks officials by allowing two marine pests -- shipworms and gribbles -- to flourish. Together, they attack wood pilings; the gribbles, which are tiny crustaceans, chew from the outside, while shipworms, larger mollusks, bore tunnels within.
''We literally have a clean harbor, but it's causing incredible devastation to the physical infrastructure of the waterfront, and it's costly to repair and replace,'' said Adrian Benepe, commissioner of the city's park's department.
The city has tried to save disintegrating timber pilings in the past, with things like chemical treatments and plastic wrap, but to no avail. Engineers say that reinforced concrete is the best material to withstand the wood-ravaging invertebrates below and support the throngs of parkgoers above. As the public hungers for greater access to the long-elusive waterfront, parks officials first have to shore up a hidden support network across the city's more than 500 miles of coastline.
Pouring concrete underwater is expensive, however. According to city estimates, hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent in recent years on pier construction, and work to be done in just the next five years is expected to cost an additional $300 million.
Indeed, much has been accomplished. At Hudson River Park, which stretches for fives miles from Battery Place to 59th Street, nearly a dozen new piers with reinforced concrete pilings were built atop the remnants of old ones.
Along the waterfront there is still evidence of the plastic sheeting the city had wrapped around wooden pilings in the 1990s in an unsuccessful effort to keep out marine borers. (The plastic wrap actually made the problem worse.)
There were also a few attempts at making pilings from recycled plastic, but the results were problematic. The city's first all-plastic pier, built from 1.5 million recycled plastic bottles at Tiffany Street in the Bronx, was heralded as a breakthrough when it opened in 1995. But it caught fire and melted the following year when struck by lightning.
Marine borers have bedeviled port cities and boat captains for centuries. ''The gribbles are the marine version of termites,'' said Ed Enos, superintendent of the aquatic resources division at the Marine Biological Laboratory, a research and education center in Woods Hole, Mass. ''And the shipworms have a well-adapted mouth that can scoop out and break down wood fibers.''
As pollution fouled the waters around New York City during the 20th century, the problem went away.
On a tour of the city's waterfront last week, Robert K. Steel, deputy mayor for economic development, told how New York, at its most polluted, was jokingly called a ''clean harbor'' by the shipping industry. ''The water was so dirty that as you brought your ship in, all of the organisms on the bottom of the boat would be killed,'' he said. ''So your boat would leave 'clean.' ''
Today, with less wood over all in the harbor, the borers seem to be worse than ever. ''We've seen explosions of marine borer activity in the remaining timber pilings,'' said Daniel A. Zarrilli, senior vice president for maritime operations at the city's Economic Development Corporation.
One of the largest new riverfront projects is the East River Waterfront Esplanade, which will eventually run for two miles north from the tip of Lower Manhattan. The first two-block section, from Wall Street to Maiden Lane, opened in July. The Economic Development Corporation has so far spent $26 million on infrastructure improvements, including a new pier and piling reconstruction.
Mr. Laird, the assistant parks commissioner, said that dozens of piers had collapsed over the decades, the victims of marine borers as well as old age and incessant waves. In 1995, marine organisms were blamed when a 70-foot section of a city-owned wharf plunged into the East River near 15th Street.
Once a pier falls to the river bottom, Mr. Laird said, it is much harder to win regulatory approval to replace it. ''The final frontier for park expansion in the city are these old maritime industrial sites,'' Mr. Laird said. ''But it's a fight against time.''
That is one reason city officials are eager to begin reconstruction of the Waterside Pier, a former Consolidated Edison site supported by timber pilings on the East River. Just south of the United Nations, the crumbling one-acre pier is scheduled to become a waterfront park.
The Economic Development Corporation recently chose an engineering firm to design the rehabilitation, which is expected to cost $13 million. The landscaping above will require additional money. ''The structure there is so far gone that it will have to be a complete rebuild,'' Mr. Laird said.
At Brooklyn Bridge Park, workers this summer are stabilizing Pier 5, which is supported by about 3,000 timber pilings. An analysis revealed that about half needed immediate repair. Starting last year, technicians and divers began the laborious process of fitting a steel cage and fiberglass mold around each piling, then pumping in concrete. An independent inspector must approve the work at each step of the way.
The piling work and other marine repairs on Pier 5 will enable the construction of three playing fields, a concession building and picnic areas. A single piling encasement can cost from $7,000 to $30,000, depending on a number of factors.
''That's one of the most challenging things to explain: that a great majority of what we're spending money on is for things that aren't really visible,'' said Jennifer Klein, director of capital operations at Brooklyn Bridge Park. ''It's a huge part of what we have to do in order to build on top.''

HEADLINE: Reports Point to Slowdown in China and Germany

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and BETTINA WASSENER; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Bettina Wassener from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Surveys of industrial managers released Tuesday showed that growth could be slowing in China and Germany, raising questions about whether two of the world's most dynamic economies could continue to underpin global output and compensate for weakness in the United States and the rest of Europe.
The data do not yet point to a recession in the fragile euro zone, economists said, and indicate only a moderate cooling of torrid Chinese growth. And several analysts noted that the economic indicators were actually less negative than many had expected. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear that Europe cannot expect to grow its way out of the sovereign debt crisis, which has become a weight on the world economy.
''A return to recession is possible,'' Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, wrote in a note, referring to the European data. ''This is bad news for governments' ability to rein in public deficits.'' 
Germany has Europe's most powerful economy, and has been helping the euro zone to grow despite the burden caused by excessive debt in countries like Greece and Italy. China is a crucial market for German machinery and cars, so a slowdown there will also be felt in Europe.
While not expecting a recession, Violante Di Canossa, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note that the data ''remains consistent with sluggish growth.'' She said that the industrial survey for Europe pointed to a slowdown similar to the one in 2003, when there were several quarters of minimal economic improvement, rather than a sharp downturn.
A survey of manufacturers in China showed Tuesday that factory activity had probably contracted slightly in August, as concerns mounted that the country's exports might decline because of high debts and slowing economies in Europe and the United States. The findings underpin the widely held perception that the giant Chinese economy is growing at a more moderate, yet still robust, pace.
The findings of the poll of Chinese purchasing managers, published by HSBC and with a final figure due next week, showed a reading of 49.8 for August, a touch below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, as Beijing's efforts to cool down the pace of growth began to bear fruit.
For the past year and a half, Chinese policy makers have been working to rein in booming growth and the sharp price rises that have accompanied it. Formerly free-flowing bank credit has become harder to obtain, for example, as banks have been instructed to lend less.
Despite being below 50 for the second consecutive month, the HSBC index indicated that China's economy remained on a firm footing. The August reading was an improvement from the 49.3 recorded in July, while a subindex measuring new export orders rose to a three-month high.
The data suggest that China will not suffer a hard landing akin to the sharp slowdown seen in late 2008, Qu Hongbin, a China economist at HSBC, wrote in a note Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a survey of purchasing managers' expectations for output in the euro zone was unchanged at a nearly two-year low, according to preliminary estimates, but was not as bad as analysts had expected.
A separate poll of economists also showed a sharp deterioration in expectations for the euro zone and Germany.
Official statistics last week showed that growth in the second quarter came nearly to a standstill in the euro zone as well as in Germany and France, the region's two largest economies.
Fear that Europe is headed for another slowdown, which would compound the sovereign debt crisis, was responsible for driving down stock markets last week. On Tuesday, by contrast, many of Europe's main stock indexes gained for a second straight day.
A preliminary reading of the euro zone P.M.I. composite output index, compiled by Markit, an information provider in London, was unchanged from July at 51.1. The euro zone manufacturing P.M.I., a gauge of the mood among manufacturers, fell to 49.7 from 50.4 in July, a 23-month low. A reading below 50 suggests that the economy is stalling.
''This drop does not compare with the collapse seen in late 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers,'' Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note. ''Nevertheless, the purchasing managers' index does confirm that the euro zone economy is hardly growing now.''
Ms. Diron of Ernst & Young said the slowing growth exposed how vulnerable Europe and especially Germany were to foreign markets.
The survey ''suggests that core Eurozone countries are still very dependent on demand from the rest of the world,'' Ms. Diron wrote. ''At a time when the outlook for the U.S. economy is darkening and emerging markets are slowing, such a dependence on the external environment is a source of weakness.''
Concerns about slowing growth in the United States and Europe, both important markets for goods made in China, have clouded the outlook for Chinese exporters.
Rising wages across the country have also added to manufacturing costs, eroding some of the competitive advantage that China has long had over manufacturers in other parts of the world.
''Debt crises in developed countries are bringing rising pressure and challenges to the vast emerging market countries, including China,'' Jiang Yaoping, the Chinese deputy commerce minister, said in a statement Tuesday.
Mr. Qu of HSBC, however, emphasized that the drag on overall growth would probably be limited, given that China's growth was increasingly driven by domestic demand.
''We are still expecting the economy to grow by around 9 percent for the year as a whole, despite Beijing's ongoing credit tightening at home and turmoil in markets overseas,'' Mr. Qu wrote Tuesday.
One consolation from the data is that they point to easing inflationary pressure at the same time that oil prices are declining. If inflation is less of a worry, the European Central Bank will not feel as compelled to continue raising official interest rates. In addition, the E.C.B. may find it easier to sustain measures intended to support weaker banks and hold down borrowing costs for countries like Spain and Italy.
Separately, the ZEW indicator of economic sentiment, a survey of analysts by the Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany, also showed a sharp drop in expectations for growth in the euro zone and Germany.
''The fear of a recession in the United States together with the downgrade of the credit rating of U.S. bonds has further increased macroeconomic uncertainty,'' the center said in a statement.
The German central bank argued Monday that much of the recent deceleration in Germany and Europe was due to exceptional factors, like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that temporarily disrupted supplies of auto parts. The central bank said in its monthly bulletin that, although growth is clearly slowing, there was no evidence of a recession ahead.
''All in all there are still many signs that the global recovery is intact and that growth in the coming year will be robust,'' the central bank said.
The data were released as investors remained skeptical whether European government leaders had a handle on the debt crisis.
The finance ministers from France and Germany, Francois Baroin and Wolfgang Schauble, met Tuesday in Paris to work out details of a European tax on financial transactions. The tax reflects the leaders' determination to make banks share the cost of the debt crisis, but may be ill timed given that investors worry another financial crisis is in the making.
Money market indicators show that banks are reluctant to lend to each other, because they fear for each others' solvency.
Bettina Wassener reported from Hong Kong.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Budgets Continue to Shrink, the Lines Will Grow in California Civil Courts

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Lines at a courthouse are kind of like hurt feelings in a divorce: they are expected, they are unavoidable, but, hopefully, they are dealt with quickly.
For the romantically estranged residents of San Francisco, however, the wait for a divorce may soon drag on longer than the life span of most Hollywood marriages, as a series of cutbacks threatens to cripple the civil courts. Under a plan unveiled last month and due to take effect this fall, San Francisco will close 25 courtrooms, reduce clerks' hours and lay off more than 175 employees, effectively bringing much of the business of the court to a crawl.
Katherine Feinstein, the presiding judge of San Francisco Superior Court, said the average time for a divorce would be at least 18 months. All manner of other civil matters -- small claims, civil and class-action lawsuits, probate and conservatorship cases, and big-money complex cases -- will also probably take longer to settle.
''The civil justice system in San Francisco is collapsing,'' Judge Feinstein said. 
But San Francisco is hardly alone in seeing hours or services cut; other California counties have already made cuts or are expected to soon.
Judge Steve White, who presides over Superior Court in Sacramento, the state capital, said a shrinking staff had already caused the number of service windows at family court to be reduced to 2 from 10, leading to waits of five to six hours.
''People bring lawn chairs,'' Judge White said. And while San Francisco's cuts have not yet taken effect, on Monday lines were already forming before open windows. Nicole Carson, 21, had been waiting for nearly four hours with her 7-month-old daughter, Essence, on her lap outside the Superior Court's Family Law Self-Help Center, hoping to file paperwork to get full custody of her daughter and child support from the girl's father.
''This is the third day I've come here,'' Ms. Carson said. ''I had no idea it would be this hard.''
The cutbacks stem from a $350 million reduction in financing for the state's judicial branch -- the largest cut in California's history -- in the 2011-12 budget, part of a penurious spending plan endorsed by Gov. Jerry Brown, who has made taming California's money problems a priority. Gil Duran, a spokesman for the governor, said the cuts were unfortunate, but were part of ''immense fiscal challenges that require sacrifice at every level of state government.''
As constitutional officers, judges cannot be laid off. But as anyone who has ever entered a courtroom can attest, much of the heavy lifting is done by the support staff.
''It's not that we don't have the judges to do the work, we do,'' said Judge Feinstein, the daughter of Senator Dianne Feinstein. ''We won't have the clerical staff to back us up. We won't have the papers.''
Dozens of judges and court officers had written to Mr. Brown, a Democrat, to say that the cuts would ''render precarious our democratic ideal of justice for all.'' And the cutbacks will lead to all manner of other effects, lawyers say.
Marinus H. Goossens, whose legal practice in San Francisco focuses on estate planning and family law, said the slowdowns could create a ripple effect, as hearings were pushed back and divorce and other monetary settlements were delayed.
That, in turn, could lead to delays by clients in making all kinds of economic decisions.
''A pending case means legal uncertainty,'' Mr. Goossens said, ''and people don't like uncertainty. Uncertain periods lead to people keeping their wallet closed.''
The cuts could also jeopardize the paying of traffic tickets, which would mean lost revenue for the judiciary. Runners who file cases at courthouses are often paid by the number of cases they file, so longer lines mean longer waits and fewer paydays.
The delays will make already painful, scary and expensive processes all the more taxing, said Diane Wasznicky, the president of the Association of Certified Family Law Specialists.
''It's horrendous for people whose only legal resource is to use the system,'' Ms. Wasznicky said.
Even those not involved in knock-down, drag-out fights were finding delays, prompting them to seek alternate solutions. Elizabeth Toumi, for example, was at the San Francisco court on Monday with her former husband to change the child custody agreement for their two children, ages 5 and 6. Frustrated by the lines, Ms. Toumi -- who is unemployed -- said she finally went online and figured out how to do the paperwork herself, without lawyers or assistance from the court.
On the policy-making level, meanwhile, the cutbacks have also laid bare a simmering tension between the civil and criminal courts and the courts' administrative arm. (In California, financing for the courts is allocated through the state's Judicial Council, a 21-member group made up of judges, legislators and lawyers, along with other nonvoting members.)
While the courts still receive the bulk of the money, judges accuse the Administrative Office of the Courts of ''sucking revenues'' with a variety of construction, computer and other projects.
''The dollars are not being delivered to where the rubber meets the road,'' said Judge David Lampe of Kern County, north of Los Angeles, a member of the board of the Alliance of California Judges, a group of some 400 state judges that was formed in 2009 in response to a previous round of cuts.
Philip Carrizosa, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the Courts, said that he understood the judges' complaints but that they were ''misinformed and mistaken in blaming the A.O.C.'' because the Judicial Council had the final decision on all financing.
''We're just staff,'' Mr. Carrizosa said. ''They're judges.''
A spokeswoman for the council, Lynn Holton, also defended the Administrative Office of the Courts, saying that the council included trial and appellate judges who had gone along with the cuts made to the trial courts.
''In budget times like these, there are no winners,'' Ms. Holton said in an e-mail message.
Indeed, while criminal cases will continue, even constitutional guarantees for a speedy trial could be put to the test, meaning potential dismissals of less serious charges. But, Judge White said, ''even what are considered minor charges can be very serious in terms of public safety. Drunk driving, for example.''
Meredith Grier, meanwhile, a paralegal at San Francisco Superior Court who is facing a layoff in September, said she expected to see an increase in people coming to court to file civil actions in hopes of beating the lines, and filling her in-box with more forms than she can count.
''It's just like sand,'' Ms. Grier said. ''It just continues to fill.''

HEADLINE: Lacoste Recasts Itself in Its Own Prestige

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
LIKE other companies, Lacoste sponsors professional athletes, including reportedly paying tennis star Andy Roddick more than $5 million annually to wear the brand while competing.
But in a twist, the brand also recently began outfitting noncelebrities, including the wait staff, bus boys and valets at the Hamptons location of Nobu -- the upscale Japanese restaurant chain co-owned by Robert De Niro -- in clothing featuring the Lacoste logo, an open-jawed crocodile.
''As a consumer, you're sitting there and Lacoste is all around you,'' said Charlie Walk, a partner at RJW Collective, a marketing agency based in Manhattan that works with Lacoste. ''But it's not in your face screaming to you that there's a branded moment here in the middle of your meal -- it's an elegantly disruptive activation.'' 
Employees at the Soho House and two Hotel Gansevoort locations -- all in Manhattan -- also are wearing clothing provided free by Lacoste. Outfitting concierges and waiters is representative of a broader effort to reinvigorate Lacoste, which some may associate with a bygone preppy era.
''It's an iconic brand with a ton of history, but in the last few years I think it lost touch with the next generation,'' said Mr. Walk. ''It felt kind of stagnant -- you respected the croc but you weren't really sure who it was touching, how it was connecting with you.''
Over the last year, the agency has pursued a strategy of ''aligning the brand with key cultural zeitgeists and influencers,'' according to a promotional document summarizing its efforts.
Focusing on fashionable markets like New York, Miami and Los Angeles, promotions have included Lacoste-branded food trucks that prowled the streets of Miami and handing out 3,000 red rubber crocodiles in Manhattan.
Online, the brand partnered with Jared Eng, the fashion and celebrity blogger who publishes JustJared.com and JustJaredJr.com, to produce online videos where Mr. Eng interviews celebrities. The first, released in July, features Leighton Meester, the ''Gossip Girl'' star, and garnered a combined 300,000 views on Mr. Eng's sites and on YouTube.
Rene Lacoste, who competed on the French Davis Cup team, was competing in Boston in 1923 when the team's captain promised him an alligator suitcase he coveted if he won a tennis match. The incident, as well as his tenacity on the court, earned him the nickname the Crocodile, and Mr. Lacoste soon appeared at matches in a white blazer with a crocodile sewn on the chest pocket.
Finding long-sleeved white shirts that were traditional tennis wear uncomfortable, Mr. Lacoste caused a stir when, around 1927, he begin wearing short-sleeved shirts that had been custom-made for him. While inspired partly by oxford cotton shirts worn by polo players, his were instead made from a more breathable cotton knit.
The brand claims that when it was first sold to the public in 1933, the crocodile sewn on the chest of the shirt was the first time a logo appeared on the outside of an article of clothing.
After its popularity surged with the preppy trend of the 1980s, the brand went mainstream, making cheaper versions available in bargain retailers like Wal-Mart, then floundered, even withdrawing from the American market for a few years in the early 1990s.
Over the last decade, the brand has endeavored to re-establish itself as a prestige brand, with largely positive results, although sales were flat beginning with the economic downturn in 2008. But so far in 2011, sales are up 25 percent over last year, according to Steve Birkhold, the United States chief executive of the company.
Counterintuitive as it may sound to the foreclosed-upon and unemployed, Mr. Birkhold attributes that uptick to actually charging more: in 2009, about 30 percent of merchandise was sold at full price and 70 percent at a discount, while in 2010, 60 percent was sold at full price and only 40 percent at a discount.
The company is re-establishing Lacoste as ''a distinctive premium brand,'' Mr. Birkhold said.
No longer available in bargain retailers, Lacoste is maintaining its presence in mainstream department stores like Macy's and Dillard's while looking to grow more aggressively in premium retailers like Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's and, particularly, in its own retail stores. About 70 percent of the company's sales in America come from its own physical and online stores, said Mr. Birkhold.
The company spent $7.5 million on advertising in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
To promote the Fifth Avenue flagship store, which reopened recently after closing in February for renovations, Lacoste is timing several promotional events to coincide with Fashion Week in September.
Beginning around noon on Sept. 8, about 80 people in red polo shirts will begin walking toward the store from all directions and handing out postcards with a coupon for $50 polo shirts (they retail for $90 for men, $80 for women). When they converge, a polo shirt 17 feet high by 12 feet wide -- with an eight-inch crocodile logo-- will be displayed on the facade.
Lacoste ''started off as very chic and la-di-da and the Frenchness played very well,'' said Allen P. Adamson, author of ''BrandSimple'' and ''BrandDigital,'' about the company in its heyday. ''But then it got to be everywhere and all of the sudden it was embarrassing and almost a cliche to be wearing it.''
The challenge for Lacoste was that ''once a brand is too mass and loses its panache, it's really hard to get the genie back in the bottle,'' he said.
Against those odds, Mr. Adamson said that the new approach of the brand, including outfitting employees at a restaurant and chic hotels, was working.
''Getting the brand to be in the right place at the right time is the right approach,'' Mr. Adamson said. ''The consumer is so jaded and the marketplace is so cluttered today that it's more about what a brand does than what a brand says.''

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Must Face WaMu Suit, Judge Rules

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
A federal judge has ruled that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has to face a $10 billion lawsuit tied to the failure of Washington Mutual Bank. 
The judge refused the F.D.I.C.'s request to dismiss the lawsuit, which had been brought by the Deutsche Bank National Trust Company over bad mortgages that were securitized by Washington Mutual.
Washington Mutual, or WaMu, was seized by the Office of Thrift Supervision in September 2008 in one of the biggest bank failures in American history.
The F.D.I.C. was appointed receiver and immediately sold the bank to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion.
The Deutsche Bank unit sued in 2009, arguing that loans that had been pooled into mortgage bonds did not meet the underwriting standards that had been promised by WaMu, causing investors to lose billions of dollars.
A Senate committee report this year said WaMu's mortgage securitization was ''polluting the financial system'' with bad home loans and was partly to blame for the 2008 financial crisis.
The F.D.I.C. argued that it should be dismissed from the lawsuit and that Deutsche Bank should bring its claims against JPMorgan, which assumed WaMu's liabilities as well as its assets.
JPMorgan has denied that it assumed any WaMu liabilities.
The judge, Rosemary Collyer of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, denied the government agency's request last week. She said it would be ''improvident and premature'' to dismiss the F.D.I.C. from the lawsuit after refusing a similar request by JPMorgan.
A spokesman for the F.D.I.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HEADLINE: In Fed's Decision on Capital One Deal, a Test of Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Capital One is the latest bank accused of being ''too big to fail.''
A proposed $9.2 billion purchase of the online bank ING Direct would make Capital One the fifth-largest bank in the United States with more than $200 billion in deposits.
But before this acquisition can be completed, it requires clearance from the Federal Reserve, Capital One's chief regulator. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the Federal Reserve weigh the systemic risk of the combined company. If the risk outweighs the benefits of the transaction, the deal must be blocked.
The Fed has yet to decide what constitutes a systemically risky acquisition. So its decision on Capital One could have a broad impact on what Dodd-Frank means for the nation's biggest banks.
Community interest groups led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which oppose the deal, say that Capital One is already classified under Dodd-Frank as systemically important since it has more than $50 billion in assets. Why should any such bank be allowed to get bigger? 
Moreover, Capital One is likely to use ING Direct's deposits to finance its main business: credit card issuance. And Capital One is moving to expand significantly in this debt-driven consumer credit sector. Earlier this month, Capital One announced the acquisition of HSBC's $30 billion credit card portfolio in the United States. After the HSBC deal, Capital One will remain the United State's fifth-largest credit card issuer, but its market share will rise to about 9 percent from 7 percent.
National Community suggests that this will result in ever more credit cards at high-interest rates being pushed to American consumers who presumably can't fend for themselves.
Because the Federal Reserve has yet to spell out its own ''too big to fail'' guidelines, Capital One has proposed its own test to the Fed. Capital One looks at bank size and its interconnectedness and importance to the financial system. Not surprisingly, Capital One fails to meet this criteria. The bank rightly notes that after the two acquisitions, it would still be a pipsqueak next to Bank of America, the largest United States bank with $2.26 trillion in assets. Capital One will have only a measly $300 billion or so. How could this increase systemic risk?
Moreover, Capital One argues that it does not engage in the complex type of banking that a Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley does, like writing derivatives. Capital One is going to be a simple, deposit-taking institution that lends money primarily on credit cards.
Some analysts have said that the ING Direct acquisition will make Capital One sounder because it will provide Capital One a more stable source of financing for its lending activities than borrowing in the short-term lending market.
Who is right?
Clarity, if not an answer, may have come inadvertently from National Community. The coalition argues that Capital One's application to acquire ING Direct is suspect because Capital One refuses to lower its credit standards to extend Federal Housing Administration-insured loans to people with credit scores of 580. This is the lowest credit score allowed by the F.H.A. National Community contends that this is discriminatory against members of minority groups because they tend to have lower credit scores and have been hit harder by the financial crisis.
Capital One has responded by agreeing to lower its credit score requirements by 2012. For National Community, this is not enough, because Capital One's F.H.A. loan volume is relatively flat in growth. Capital One is now a bit player with less than 1 percent of the F.H.A. loan market. National Community wants the combined entity to make more of these loans, since they help people who could not otherwise afford a mortgage.
So National Community is arguing that Capital One should take more risk when making home loans, but less risk in getting bigger and offering credit cards. Remember, the financial crisis was caused in significant part by excessive, and sometimes predatory, subprime lending. Capital One may not be predatory, but the borrowing National Community wants is lower down on the subprime scale and will create more risk.
Perhaps National Community's apparently contradictory position can be reconciled by saying that it is distinguishing between good debt to buy a home and bad debt in the form of consumer credit.
The Capital One acquisition is thus really about what type of banking system we want. Do we want a large banking system that has a significant focus on consumer credit? Or do we want smaller banks focused on communities and mortgage lending? And do we want to steer our banks away from certain types of lending?
Dodd-Frank left these questions unanswered. Congress was also unable to decide what it wanted from its banking system, so it kicked the can to the Fed.
In truth, the ING Direct acquisition does not appear to increase Capital One's systemic risk materially. Capital One will still be a relatively small bank. One could even argue that allowing this midsize bank to get a little bigger might create a real competitor to steal away assets and downsize the banks that are truly way too big, like Bank of America. And many argue that we need big banks in a $14 trillion economy. The real issue is their prudent operation.
As for Capital One's ability to issue yet more credit cards, this may be a problem, but the government is still grappling with the nation's addiction to credit cards, as well as the real benefits in the form of credit this lending provides.
This is why the Federal Reserve's decision on what constitutes a systemically risky acquisition will be so important. Does it extend beyond the size of a bank and its interconnectedness to how the economy works? Because of this issue, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, has requested that the Federal Reserve hold public hearings on the matter.
Whether or not a public hearing is necessary, the Federal Reserve should be particularly careful. It needs to put forth a definition that ensures that the banking system is adequately monitored under the current definition for systemic risk. The rules it makes for Capital One could govern the entire banking system going forward. For these rules will naturally extend to other Dodd-Frank provisions that allow the Fed to break up banks that pose a similar threat.
But so far, the Federal Reserve has said almost nothing about how it will apply these rules. This is no way to run a banking system. Whether or not the Fed approves the Capital One/ING Direct transaction, it is time for the Fed to run public hearings on what exactly Dodd-Frank means for our banks and what we as a country want from them.
It has been nearly three years since the banking system nearly collapsed, and we still have not confronted the real banking issues raised by the financial crisis. What type of banks do we really want and need?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Some Builders Are Ready for the Wave of Seniors

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
EAST NORTHPORT, N.Y. -- When the housing market collapsed in 2008, construction of retirement and assisted-living housing ground to a halt, just as it did in most commercial real estate sectors, as access to capital evaporated. But a few companies kept their development teams intact in the recession, and are now building new facilities and expanding their operations. And as lending loosens, they say, they are poised to benefit from the housing needs of America's aging population.
The developers who have grown in these lean years tend to be small to midsize regional operations that know their local markets well, had a strong portfolio before the crash and have been able to persuade banks to lend despite the dour economy. They also tend to invest in assisted-living rental properties, which are tied to health care rather than personal housing choices.
''It's certainly not for everyone, but there are companies that really understand the markets and submarkets, and they're very adept at building,'' said David S. Schless, president of American Seniors Housing Association, an industry trade group. 
Demand for nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and retirement communities is expected to balloon in the next two decades as baby boomers retire and the incidence of progressive illnesses like Alzheimer's disease increases. The number of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to double to 71 million by 2030, and 7.7 million of them will suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a 50 percent increase from today, according to the Alzheimer's Association.
''It's a great time to develop senior housing,'' said Marilynn K. Duker, the president of Brightview Senior Living, a developer based in Maryland that has completed five new facilities since 2008 and has three others under construction. ''As long as we can continue to get capital and have the ability to afford it, it's an opportunity and there isn't a lot of competition.''
The inventory of housing for older people has not been keeping pace with demographics, especially in regions like the New York metro area. New York has the fewest number of such units, including retirement communities and assisted-living facilities, available relative to the number of households with residents over the age of 75 of all the top metro markets in the country, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industry, an industry research group.
At the height of the housing boom, there was a nationwide surplus of retirement and assisted-living housing, but with construction bottoming out, demand is now outstripping supply. New construction starts in such housing have dropped by 53 percent since the crash and now make up just over 1 percent annually of the senior housing inventory, according to the National Investment Center.
''That is pretty much an all-time low,'' said Jerry L. Doctrow, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ''There's not much coming in the pipeline at all.''
Here in East Northport, a town on Long Island, a 100-bed assisted-living facility developed by the Engel Burman Group that opened in March is already 50 percent full. With a lush, landscaped circular driveway, the $35 million property, called the Bristal at East Northport, resembles an upscale hotel in some ways. The lobby has a concierge and a fireplace, and opens onto a dining room with linen-covered tables. The three-story building provides residents with a library, a swimming pool, a small putting green and a billiard room. Room costs range from $3,400 a month for a shared suite to $6,000 a month for a room in the 32-bed dementia ward.
This is the seventh Bristal on Long Island built by Engel Burman, and the first since 2007, when the company sold its other Bristal properties for $320 million to Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT, of Canada, and another real estate investment trust owned by ING Real Estate Australia. A noncompete agreement expired in February, allowing Engel Burman to open the doors at the East Northport facility.
Engel Burman has several other projects under way, including the Seasons, a $150 million, 404-unit retirement community 30 minutes away in East Meadow that was financed in late 2007 before the housing market crash. At prices starting at $389,000 for a two-bedroom townhouse, all but five of the first 212 units built have been sold.
''We're from Long Island. We know the island. We know the locations. We are still very bullish on Long Island,'' said Steven Krieger, a co-founder and principal at Engel Burman.
The company is building elsewhere in the region, as well. Four properties are under contract in New York and another in northern New Jersey. The company plans to develop new assisted-living facilities at all of them. Engel Burman financed the East Northport facility with industrial development agency tax-exempt bonds, an unusual choice in an industry that generally relies on bank lending. But the company has long relied on such bonds to finance their assisted-living facilities, and without them, Mr. Krieger said, the project might not have been built at all, because of the difficulty of securing a bank loan.
When the market crashed, the company's bond buyer, Oppenheimer Funds, was still willing to work with them. But the rates were much higher.
Industrial development agency bonds also come with strings attached. Engel Burman must set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents and 90 percent of the residents must have previously lived within a five-mile radius of the facility, or have an immediate family member who currently does.
Bank financing may come with fewer restrictions, but getting it is no easy feat. In 2009, for example, Ms. Duker of Brightview spent nine months trying to finance a 180-unit retirement housing development in Marlton, N.J.
A year earlier, she said, it would have taken her about three weeks to secure financing. But by 2009, her go-to bank was reluctant to invest in real estate. In the end, a small regional bank agreed to finance the $33 million development.
The faltering economy changed the calculus for many older Americans. Fewer have moved into retirement communities, and many in need of assisted-living arrangements moved in with family, changes that badly bruised industry giants. One, Erickson Retirement Communities, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2009 and was subsequently acquired at auction by Redwood Capital Investments. Sunrise Senior Living, another industry leader, shut down its development arm and sold some assets to manage its debts. ''Everything is much stricter than it ever used to be, and that makes it that much harder'' to build, said Wayne Kaplan, the president of Premier Senior Living, an owner and operator of properties in New York, Ohio and Florida.
Because assisted living is tied to health care, it is an attractive option for skittish banks just beginning to loosen their purse strings. Unlike hotels and residential high-rises, assisted-living facilities can attract government underwriting, which make them safer bets. And assisted-living property owners have a very low default rate: less than 1 percent, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industry.
''That kind of financial performance gives banks confidence that senior housing is different from other sectors of the real estate sector,'' said William Pettit, president and chief of Merrill Gardens, a developer in Seattle that is opening a senior housing development in San Diego next month. ''There's a fundamental demand that has continued throughout the recession.''

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Fell Again in July

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The housing market is showing little sign of recovery, with sales of new homes in the United States down again in July, according to the latest government data.
Sales of new homes reached an annual rate of 298,000 in July, down from a rate in June that was revised to 300,000 from 312,000, the Census Bureau report said. The July figures fell short of analysts' expectations for a rate of 310,000. 
The median sales price of a new home was $222,000 in July, also down from the previous month. The stock of new homes for sale at the end of July was 165,000, the lowest this year, and would last slightly more than six months at the current sales rate.
For months, most indicators of the housing market have suggested bleak conditions. The number of permits issued to builders of single-family houses has also declined.
Patrick Newport, United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said that his company had forecast that sales of new homes would fall to a record low this year, 319,000, compared with 321,000 in 2010.
''It has gotten worse for builders,'' Mr. Newport said. ''They are stuck in a market where they cannot sell new homes.''
In addition, demand for new homes is stagnant despite record low mortgage interest rates, and competition from foreclosures continues to cloud the sector, said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc.
''This suggests that prices will continue to edge lower at the bottom end of the market even as demand for these homes picks up a bit,'' Mr. Shapiro said.
The sales rate in July came close to the record low of 281,000 in February, and the level of inventories in recent months this year has been the lowest recorded since December 1967, he wrote in a research note.
''We are just bouncing along the bottom,'' Mr. Shapiro said in a telephone interview. ''There is no indication out there that anything is improving. It is bouncing along at historic lows at this point.''
Economists said it would take a turnaround in the American job market to return some vitality to the housing sector.
''We need job growth but in conjunction with that, housing prices have got to stop dropping,'' Mr. Newport said.
Still, one analyst said that the market was showing the potential to recover in the years ahead despite weakness in the monthly data. The analyst, Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial, noted that median and average prices were higher in July compared with a year ago.
''Generally we are forming a base in the housing sector this year,'' he said. ''On aggregate, I think that conditions are solidifying at historically low levels. We are unlikely to go any further down.''
Mr. Price said, ''As the economy does recover, and you get less competition from foreclosure sales, the market is poised for a relatively solid rebound in the years ahead.''

HEADLINE: Addressing the Justice Gap: The poor need representation and thousands of law school graduates need work

 BODY:
Most low-income Americans cannot afford a lawyer to defend their legal interests, no matter how urgent the issue. Unless they are in a criminal case, most have no access to help from government-financed lawyers either. 
In civil proceedings like divorces, child support cases, home foreclosures, bankruptcies and landlord-tenant disputes, the number of people representing themselves in court has soared since the economy soured. Experts estimate that four-fifths of low-income people have no access to a lawyer when they need one. Research shows that litigants representing themselves often fare less well than those with lawyers. This ''justice gap'' falls heavily on the poor, particularly in overburdened state courts.
There is plenty the government, the legal profession and others can do to improve this shameful state of affairs. With the economic downturn, only around two-thirds of law school graduates in 2010 got jobs for which a law degree is required, the lowest rate since 1996. That leaves the other third -- close to 15,000 lawyers -- who, with financial support from government and the legal profession, could be using their legal expertise to help some of those who need representation.
While the Constitution requires that defendants in criminal cases be provided a lawyer, there is no such guarantee in civil cases. The Legal Services Corporation, created by Congress, gives out federal grants that provide the bulk of support for legal aid to the poor. Over the decades, that budget has shrunk -- it was $404 million in 2011, about one-third less than it was 15 years ago, adjusted for inflation. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed reducing that to $300 million for 2012. The cut would be devastating; the budget should, instead, be increased.
Half of the people who seek help from legal aid offices are already turned away. Some offices are so understaffed that they must engage in triage, so that in, say, domestic abuse cases, they will only assist someone seeking a restraining order against a violent partner if that person is in immediate danger of being hurt again.
State bar associations could help address these needs by requiring lawyers to report their pro bono service -- such disclosure would likely increase many lawyers' service to the recommended 3 percent to 5 percent of their paid work. Another step is to allow nonlawyers into the mix. The American Bar Association has insisted that only lawyers can provide legal services, but there are many things nonlawyers should be able to handle, like processing uncontested divorces.
Legal education must also change. The Carnegie foundation recommends that all law students be given experience in public advocacy, of which providing legal services is one kind. At the same time, law schools should expand loan forgiveness programs for legal services lawyers. A few have such programs, but most schools do not -- and not enough schools view tuition as a source to help support future legal-services lawyers.
The justice gap is widening. Government, law schools and the profession need to work together to redesign and fortify the grossly deficient legal services system.

HEADLINE: Fewer Banks In the U.S. Considered To Be at Risk

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The number of banks on the government's list of institutions most at risk for failure fell in the second quarter, the first drop since before the financial crisis began. 
Twenty-three lenders came off the list of so-called problem banks during the second quarter, bringing the total to 865, according to data released Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Not all the troubled lenders will inevitably fail, but the F.D.I.C. considers them most at risk, making the quarterly update one of the clearest measures of the banking industry's health.
It was the first decrease in the number of problem banks since the third quarter of 2006.
The report also contained other signs of improvement. There were 48 bank failures in the first half of 2011, far fewer than the 86 failures in the first six months of 2010. Last year's total of 157 collapsed banks was the highest since the last severe recession, in the early 1990s.
And the F.D.I.C. insurance fund that protects the nation's depositors showed a surplus for the first time in two years. It stood at $3.9 billion, compared with a negative $1 billion balance at the end of the first quarter.
Still, the magnitude of problem banks -- roughly one of every nine lenders -- remains relatively high. And the number could rise again if the economy suffered another downturn, a prospect that seems increasingly likely amid all the grim data that has surfaced in the weeks since the list was compiled at the end of the June.
Martin J. Gruenberg, the acting F.D.I.C. chairman, played down that risk in some of his first public remarks since being nominated to run the agency in June.
''Banks have continued to make gradual but steady progress from the financial turmoil and severe recession that unfolded from 2007 and 2009,'' Mr. Gruenberg said in a statement.
Beyond the drop in problem lenders, there were other signs that the industry was getting back on its feet. The nation's 7,513 banks and savings institutions reported a total profit of $28.8 billion in the second quarter, up nearly 38 percent from a year ago and the eighth consecutive quarter that earnings have increased. Bank losses continued to ease, while loan balances rose -- albeit slightly -- for the first time since the second quarter of 2008.
Much of the uptick in lending could be attributed to loans made to businesses and other financial institutions. Real estate lending continued to be very weak.
Total revenue fell for the second quarter in a row. Fee income declined as more stringent regulations curbed overdraft charges and other penalty fees, while interest income was lower because of an increase of money in low-yielding accounts at Federal Reserve banks.
The recent market turbulence from the debt crises in Europe and the United States continues to weigh on the industry. Deposits increased almost 3 percent during the second quarter, with the bulk of the cash going into the nation's largest banks.
''Recent events have reminded us that the U.S. economy and U.S. banks still face serious challenges ahead,'' Mr. Gruenberg said in the statement.

HEADLINE: Shake-Up In Mortgage Investigation

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Eric T. Schneiderman, the top prosecutor in New York, was removed on Tuesday from a committee of state attorneys general investigating mortgage abuses.
In recent months, Mr. Schneiderman has voiced concerns over a proposed settlement between major banks and a coalition of federal and state officials over claims of foreclosure abuses. He has come under increasing pressure to approve the deal. 
The Iowa attorney general's office is leading the investigation and on Tuesday sent an e-mail to other lawyers involved in the investigation to announce the decision. ''Effective immediately, the New York attorney general's office has been removed from the executive committee of the robosigning multistate,'' a lawyer from the Iowa office wrote, using the shorthand for the investigation, which is looking into so-called robo-signing of mortgage documents and other abuses.
Mr. Schneiderman has said that he opposes any deal that gives participating banks a release from other litigation surrounding their mortgage activities. Attorneys general from other states have also questioned aspects of the deal, including Beau Biden of Delaware.
Mr. Schneiderman ''has and continues to raise important and legitimate concerns about the scope of the releases being demanded by the banks as part of the multistate settlement, concerns he and I have raised for many months with our colleagues,'' Mr. Biden said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, said that New York had been a member of the executive committee since it was formed in October 2010. But he said that New York declined to be part of a smaller negotiation committee formed in June 2010.
Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said the attorney general was ''committed to a comprehensive resolution that will provide homeowners meaningful relief to stay in their homes, allow the housing market to begin to recover, and get our economy moving again.''
Mr. Kanner also said that ''investigations by attorneys general cannot be shut down by efforts to settle quickly and those responsible must be held accountable.''

HEADLINE: New Camry, Spruced Up But Still Free of Flash

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- Toyota unveiled a revamped, lower-priced Camry on Tuesday that it hopes will retain its nearly decade-long dominance as the best-selling car in the United States and help the company regain some of the respect and momentum that has evaporated in recent years.
So important is the new Camry to Toyota's recovery that the company's president, Akio Toyoda, traveled to Kentucky so he could drive the first completed car off the assembly line and proclaim ''100 percent confidence'' in the work of his designers and engineers. 
''You might say that this is an opportunity to show the world again what Toyota is all about,'' Mr. Toyoda said. He called the Camry, which accounted for 22 percent of Toyota's sales in the United States last year, ''a symbol of Toyota's success.'' It has been the best-selling car in the United States for nine consecutive years.
The 2012 Camry, scheduled to reach dealerships in early October, cannot arrive soon enough for Toyota, which was the world's largest automaker from 2008 through 2010 but is on pace to rank third this year, behind General Motors and Volkswagen. The company suffered serious damage to a once-impermeable reputation after recalling millions of vehicles to address concerns that some were accelerating out of control. More recently, it has struggled to overcome production disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March.
In addition, rivals in Detroit and elsewhere have begun building considerably more excitement around their vehicles than Toyota, whose lineup has generally been composed of bland but worry-free models. The new Camry, likewise, is not flashy or groundbreaking but designed to rekindle sentiments among shoppers that Toyota is a dependable choice, analysts said. Camry sales are down 8 percent this year in the United States, and Toyota's sales over all are down 7 percent.
Toyota is planning the Camry's largest-ever marketing campaign starting Oct. 17, a months-long blitz that includes having the car featured prominently during the Super Bowl in February, according to Robert S. Carter, a Toyota group vice president. The company introduced the new model on Tuesday on a Hollywood backlot filled with hundreds of performers, broadcasting the ceremony to gatherings in New York, Michigan and the Georgetown, Ky., plant where Mr. Toyoda appeared.
Toyota is seeking to regain some of its lost market share by increasing the car's fuel economy and dropping the price of some Camry trim levels by as much as $2,000 below the current versions. In the past, Toyota could command higher prices than most competitors because customers were willing to pay more for the quality and reliability its name represented.
But the Camry is up against much stiffer competition than when it first arrived 28 years ago, and even compared with just five years ago when the current generation was introduced. G.M. and the Ford Motor Company, formerly also-rans in the midsize car segment, now sell much more formidable models in the Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion. Sedans from Hyundai and Nissan also have been poaching customers from Toyota.
The new Camry will be the first model to offer Toyota's new information and entertainment system, called Entune -- the type of feature that has helped Ford and others attract new customers.
Toyota said it re-engineered 90 percent of the Camry's components and that the outside is entirely new, but the car looks similar to its predecessor and remains essentially the same size, albeit with a roomier interior.
''None of the vehicle's improvements will stop certain enthusiasts from scoffing at the 2012 Toyota Camry and its less-than-revolutionary suit of new clothes, but enthusiasts never sat square in Toyota's cross hairs to begin with,'' said Dan Edmunds, director of vehicle testing at the automotive research Web site Edmunds.com. ''As ever, the Camry is aimed at the heart of the market where value, fuel economy, safety, quality and comfort reign supreme.''

HEADLINE: Allies of Strauss-Kahn Express Relief, but His Role in France Remains Unclear

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- Prominent members of France's Socialist Party expressed relief that Dominique Strauss-Kahn would soon be a free man after he was cleared Tuesday of charges of attempted rape in New York. But his political career is clearly damaged by the months of investigation and notoriety, and no one publicly urged him to run for the presidency, even though a party primary is only seven weeks away.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn may yet have a role to play, however. He continues to command respect for his economic knowledge as a former finance minister and managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and his endorsement of another candidate will carry weight in the coming Socialist primary. It is highly likely that his voice will be important during the presidential campaign itself, as an adviser to the candidate and as a critic of the policies of President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
A Socialist victory next year could bring Mr. Strauss-Kahn into government as a minister, and a Socialist defeat might make him even more important in a party that would be seeking a new rationale.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn said Tuesday that the judge's decision to dismiss the charges, at the prosecution's request, was the end of a personal nightmare. After thanking his family, friends and supporters, he said that he was eager to go home and that he would ''speak more forcefully when I return to France.''
On Tuesday, Martine Aubry, a leading Socialist candidate who is close to Mr. Strauss-Kahn and his wife, Anne Sinclair, said the news ''is a happiness, a relief,'' an end to what she called his ''nightmare.'' She said that he remained ''useful to France,'' but that ''we should let him speak for himself'' about his plans.
Ms. Aubry's candidacy emerged after the charges against Mr. Strauss-Kahn precluded his own. Francois Hollande, a rival, pointed out that he had declared his own candidacy before Mr. Strauss-Kahn's arrest; others noted that the Hollande campaign began with Mr. Strauss-Kahn as a target.
Mr. Hollande also expressed relief, saying that he was ''delighted for Dominique Strauss-Kahn, his friends and family for this denouement that comes after three months of unbearable ordeal and twists that were extremely hard to live through.'' Echoing Ms. Aubry, Mr. Hollande said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn's ''experience and expertise will be useful to his country.'' Asked if Mr. Strauss-Kahn would run for the presidency, Mr. Hollande said, ''That's up to him.''
Members of Mr. Sarkozy's party and government welcomed Mr. Strauss-Kahn's freedom. Defense Minister Gerard Longuet called the last few months ''a tremendous waste,'' adding, ''So much competence, culture, knowledge, charm should merit more than this painful affair, which will stick with him.''
In the field of ideas, ''people will always listen to him,'' Mr. Longuet said. ''In the field of political responsibility, I think it will be much harder for him.''
Jean-Francois Cope, the secretary general of Mr. Sarkozy's party, the Union for a Popular Movement, described Mr. Strauss-Kahn's ordeal as ''a particularly heavy judicial test,'' while noting that that the U.M.P had always insisted that justice be allowed to run its course without prejudgment.
There were also critics of the outcome, most notably women, who noted that Mr. Strauss-Kahn still faced an accusation of attempted rape in France and that victims of sexual attacks might now be less likely to go to the authorities.
''Bad news for justice and for women'' was the judgment of Marie-George Buffet, a Communist legislator and former government minister. The New York prosecutor's decision to drop the case ''poses great risks to women's rights, returning to a time when rape victims were a priori guilty, when rape was not considered a crime,'' she said.
The group Osez le Feminisme or Dare Feminism, said in a statement that ''the 'credibility' of plaintiffs -- a key word these last few months -- is constantly put into question in matters of rape.''
''However, we say it once again: There is no such thing as a good or bad victim. Nothing that a woman has done or said in the past should permit us to minimize the damage she has suffered.''
Gerard Grunberg, a political scientist who studies the left in France, said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn's ''image in public opinion is very damaged'' and the Socialist Party itself, already annoyed with him for ruining an important political opportunity to challenge Mr. Sarkozy and with its primary soon, ''does not want to have this collective occasion spoiled.''
''I believe that he can no longer claim a leading role in French politics,'' Mr. Grunberg said. ''Neither the public nor the party want to see him back on the front line.''
In an editorial, the left-leaning newspaper Le Monde said that like Bill Clinton, ''whose presidency was tarnished by the Monica Lewinsky affair, he is above all a victim of his own imprudence.'' Whatever the merits, the newspaper said, the case ''lifted the veil on aspects of his personality, his relations with women and with money,'' and noted that the decision not to prosecute was not a declaration of his innocence.
Many also noted that a civil case against him is still pending in New York, as is another complaint filed by a French writer, Tristane Banon, who said he tried to rape her in 2003. French prosecutors are investigating. Her lawyer, David Koubbi, said that Ms. Banon's case and credibility were not damaged by the events in New York and that Ms. Banon ''is combative'' and ''saddened'' by what happened to the accuser in New York, Nafissatou Diallo, ''because she believes her.''
And Ms. Diallo's Paris lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial, said he had filed a complaint against an ally of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, accusing the ally of trying to bribe a woman who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Strauss-Kahn in order to persuade her not to testify in the civil suit.

HEADLINE: Moody's Cuts Japan's Rating One Notch, Citing Its Giant Debt

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Moody's, the credit ratings agency, lowered Japan's credit rating by one notch on Wednesday, warning that frequent changes in administration, weak prospects for economic growth and its recent natural and nuclear disasters made it difficult for the government to pare down its huge debt.
Hours after the downgrade, the government announced a $100 billion credit facility to help the Japanese economy ride out a spike in the yen in recent weeks amid the global market turmoil, which has battered Japan's export-led economy. 
''Taking into account that there is a lopsided rise in the yen, I felt that swift measures were needed,'' Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, told reporters.
Moody's Investors Service lowered Japan's grade by one step to Aa3, the fourth-highest rating, the company said in a statement.
The downgrade brings Moody's rating for Japan in line with Standard & Poor's, which lowered the country's grade by one notch to AA-minus in January, the fourth highest on its scale. Moody's had put Japan on review for a downgrade in May.
The action comes after a round of downgrades by major ratings agencies of sovereign debt, and amid concern that the debt crisis in Europe could escalate. On Aug. 5, S.& P. cut the sovereign debt rating of the United States for the first time in the country's history.
Markets in Tokyo largely shrugged off the downgrade, the latest in a line of many.
Trust in Japanese government debt ''remains unwavering,'' Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, told reporters after the downgrade.
Still, the move, a week before the country's ruling party is to select a new prime minister, could put additional pressure on the incoming administration to balance budgets. The government financing of the recovery from the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis is expected to reach as high as 10 trillion yen ($130 billion).
Even before the disasters, Japan's debt was expected to soar to almost 220 percent of its gross domestic product next year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which would rank it as the largest debt-to-G.D.P. ratio in the world. Japan, however, has long been able to borrow at low nominal rates because of unwavering appetite by domestic investors for government debt.
Moody's said that it was worried by large budget deficits and the buildup of government debt. Frequent change in leadership had prevented the government from pursuing long-term fiscal reform, the agency said, while the recent disasters had delayed recovery. Meanwhile, weak prospects for economic growth were also hampering efforts to curb the country's debt burden, the agency said.
Deflation and sluggish growth has long weighed on Japan's economy, eroding the country's tax base and forcing the government to issue debt to finance its budget. Meanwhile, spending on pensions and social welfare has soared as the country's population ages.
The global economic crisis further darkened Japan's economic outlook, as has the recent tsunami and nuclear accident. Global market turmoil in recent weeks has also wreaked havoc with the Japanese economy, driving up the value of the yen and hurting its export-led economy.
The credit facility unveiled on Wednesday aims to spur Japanese spending on corporate acquisitions and resources overseas, according to a statement released by the Finance Ministry.
By spending yen for dollars and other currencies, the ministry hopes that the currency will weaken somewhat. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters because it makes their goods less competitive and erodes the value of their overseas earnings when repatriated into yen.
The ministry also said it would step up monitoring of currency markets by asking financial institutions to report on positions held by their currency dealers.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan, meanwhile, is expected to step down by the end of the month amid criticism of his handling of the response to the disasters, making way for Japan's fifth prime minister in six years.
Mr. Noda, the finance minister, is among a field of candidates to replace Mr. Kan. He has supported more aggressive steps, including raising taxes, to tackle the country's debt. Debate over Japan's finances has been sidelined by the country's recovery and reconstruction needs, however.

HEADLINE: Oil Reserves Sidestep U.S. Vessels

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In its hurry to transport millions of barrels of oil from federal stockpiles to stabilize world oil prices earlier this summer, the Obama administration has repeatedly bypassed federal law by allowing nearly all the oil to move on foreign-owned vessels, drawing protests from domestic maritime operators.
The domestic ship owners say that 46 times the administration has waived the Jones Act, a 90-year-old law requiring purely domestic cargo to move on United States-flagged ships except under extraordinary circumstances. Only once this summer has oil from the reserve moved on American barges. 
Even as unemployment hovered over 9 percent, the administration approved dozens of applications to transport nearly 30 million barrels of domestic crude oil within the borders of the United States on tankers employing foreign crews and flying the flags of the Marshall Islands, Panama and other countries.
The move, which saved time and money for the oil companies that bought the oil, took potential work from more than 30 American cargo vessels and as many as 400 sailors, American ship owners said in recent days.
''This has literally flabbergasted the American maritime industry,'' said Christopher Coakley, vice president for legislative affairs at the American Waterways Operators, an association of domestic ship and barge operators. ''The idea was to create American jobs and help the economy. But all the profit from the sale of the oil has gone to traders and oil companies and all the profit from movement of the oil has gone to foreign shippers and crewmen, and that's galling.''
In late June, the Obama administration, acting in concert with the 27 nations of the International Energy Agency, released the oil from the Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make up some of the shortfall caused by the conflict in Libya. The administration said it wanted to get the oil to market quickly to lower prices and ensure supplies for the summer travel season. To meet that goal, it set very short deadlines for transporting the crude.
To waive the Jones Act, the president must find that there is a national security emergency and that domestic carriers are not available in a timely manner. The cutoff of oil from Libya and a lack of large-capacity American tankers provided the legal rationale for circumventing the law.
Representative Peter T. King, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said that it appeared that the administration had met the formal requirements for waiving the Jones Act, but he questioned the political and economic wisdom of doing so.
''The spirit of the law is when possible, use a U.S. vessel, especially in tough economic times,'' Mr. King said. ''I think it has to hurt the American economy, hurt the maritime industry and affect American jobs.''
The government originally issued a blanket waiver, allowing the oil buyers to use foreign ships without prior approval, as it had when it released oil from the strategic reserve after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When the industry protested the proposed blanket waiver in June, the administration said it would review each application. To date, there have been 47 shipments of oil from the caverns in Texas and Louisiana where the petroleum reserves are stored, according to maritime industry officials. One 150,000-barrel shipment moved on a domestic barge.
Most of the shipments were to East Coast refineries from loading points in the Gulf of Mexico.
Administration officials said that the oil was sold in large lots, most of them 500,000 barrels or more, and the dozen or so oil companies and traders that bought them found it faster and more economical to move the oil on 500,000-barrel capacity ocean-going tankers rather than on American-owned coastal barges. With only a couple of exceptions, the coastal barges tend to hold 150,000 barrels or less.
Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, said that the administration tried to accommodate the domestic maritime industry by lowering the minimum lot size and by considering individual waivers. The administration would have preferred to use American ships but they were not available, he said.
In an e-mailed statement, he said: ''Due to the volumes requested by the purchasing companies and the focus on getting this oil to U.S. markets as quickly as possible, the Department of Homeland Security -- working with the Maritime Administration and the Department of Energy -- determined that individual Jones Act waivers were appropriate since the U.S. fleet had only small barges available, and the buyers bid on the basis of larger, more efficient tankers.''
OSG, a shipping company based in New York, transported oil for three of the oil companies that bought crude from the petroleum reserve. It moved one shipment on an American-flagged barge and three on large tankers that are registered in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Morten Arntzen, the company's chief executive, said that the United States was not an oil-exporting country and therefore did not have the capacity to move large shipments of oil on short notice. He said that a relatively large sale from the petroleum reserve was a rare event and that it did not make sense for domestic oil shippers to maintain fleets of tankers.
''The United States hasn't been exporting oil for decades, so this isn't a cargo movement anybody positions their fleets for,'' he said.
Government officials said that since 1995, 39 American-flagged large-capacity tankers had been taken out of commission, leaving only nine such ships, which generally are used on runs to the West Coast from Alaska. None were available on the short timeline dictated by the government, officials said.
The maritime operators said there was sufficient domestic shipping capacity available, although it would have required breaking the oil shipments into smaller lots, increasing the cost and prolonging delivery times.
Mr. Coakley of the Waterways Operators said that domestic jobs should have been more important than the speed of delivery.
''The urgency of that timeline is ridiculous when you consider that today, two months after the sale of the oil, almost 10 million barrels of the 30 million barrels released hasn't yet been transported,'' he said.
Mr. King said, ''I don't see this as a partisan issue. But I would think a Democratic administration would be making some effort to help American workers.''

HEADLINE: Pataki to Visit Iowa as He Weighs a White House Bid

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who has considered running for president in the past, is again mulling a bid for the Republican nomination and is planning a high-profile appearance in Iowa this weekend. 
Mr. Pataki, 66, who served three terms as governor, from 1995 through 2006, is scheduled to attend a Republican picnic in Des Moines on Saturday. Organizers said they expected that he would clarify his intentions at the event.
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, David M. Catalfamo, said on Tuesday that the governor was seriously weighing seeking the nomination. Mr. Catalfamo declined to comment on whether Mr. Pataki would make a formal declaration soon.
''President Obama's wrong decisions on the economy and his failed leadership on debt, coupled with a lack of real solutions being offered by the current Republican field of candidates, has Governor Pataki seriously considering getting in the race,'' Mr. Catalfamo said in an e-mail message.
But signs pointed to a possible announcement by Mr. Pataki at a fundraiser to be held by the Polk County Republican Party on Saturday, which is expected to draw several presidential candidates, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Representative Ron Paul of Texas.
Pataki aides informed organizers of the event on Monday that Mr. Pataki would attend. Darrell Kearney, finance director for the Polk County Republican Party, said he was told that Mr. Pataki would discuss his 2012 plans there.
''I asked them if he was going to announce that he was going to run, and the response was 'very seriously considering it,' and that he was going to have something to say about that on Saturday,'' Mr. Kearney said in a telephone interview. ''I got the impression that he was not a candidate now, but he might be a candidate by the end of the week.''
It has been more than a decade since Mr. Pataki began cultivating a national profile, and he weighed seeking the Republican nomination in 2008 before deciding against it.
Mr. Pataki is considered a long-shot candidate for the Republican nomination, in part because his moderate stances on some social issues, especially abortion, are not in tune with those of many primary voters. While Mr. Pataki pushed through major tax cuts in his first year as governor, his later years saw sizable increases in state spending, which could diminish his appeal among Republican voters intent on reining in the federal budget.
Mr. Pataki has returned to public view in recent months as honorary chairman of No American Debt, which favors reducing the federal debt and has been critical of President Obama's fiscal policies.
So far this year, Mr. Pataki has made several visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, another early voting state in the 2012 contest. His group has aired television commercials in both states in which he appears.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Rallies, Fueled By Hope Fed Will Act

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julia Werdigier, Jack Ewing and Bettina Wassener contributing reporting.

 BODY:
After weeks of uncertainty, the markets finally seemed to seize the day.
Stock indexes powered ahead on Tuesday as investors sought buying opportunities on cheap stocks as they bet that weak economic data would support the possibility of further stimulus from the Federal Reserve. It was at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last year that Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, signaled further stimulus in light of a similar slowdown of the American economy.
''The market is down so much in the last week or two,'' said Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones. ''When the risk seems to come down a bit, many investors get back in it.'' 
The broader market rose more than 3 percent and represented the second consecutive day of gains in stocks this week.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 38.53 points, or 3.43 percent, at 1,162.35. The Dow Jones industrial average added 322.11 points, or 2.97 percent, to 11,176.76. The Nasdaq composite index added 100.68 points, or 4.29 percent, at 2,446.06.
The 10-year benchmark Treasury bond fell 14/32 to 99 23/32, pushing the yield up to 2.16 percent, from 2.11 percent late Monday.
In recent weeks, the stock market in the United States has been swept with turmoil, swinging from gains to losses in increments of hundreds of points. Analysts have attributed as influences recent soft economic data, downward revisions of growth estimates, the impact of the S.& P. credit rating downgrade on United States debt, and growing uncertainty over the euro zone sovereign debt crisis.
Many analysts say investors are waiting for policy makers to lay out plans for their response to the European sovereign debt issues and the economic headwinds in the United States.
One development occurred Aug. 9, when the Federal Reserve made a rare promise to hold short-term interest rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, and said it would continue to consider other measures to support the economy. Some analysts said investors were now trading on that possibility before Mr. Bernanke's speech at the central bank's symposium in Jackson Hole.
Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial, said the markets appeared to have interpreted recent weak economic data as presenting an opportunity for the Fed chairman to clarify his options and expand on the Aug. 9 statement.
''Right now expectations are going up,'' Ms. Krosby said. ''What they want to hear from him is we want to be there.''
Still, with the recent unpredictability, many analysts questioned whether the bargain-hunting and surge in stocks would last. The main indexes are still down significantly for the month. The Dow, for instance, is still nearly 8 percent lower in August and more than 3 percent for the year.
''One thing about these markets right now is you get oversold conditions the same way you get overbought conditions,'' Ms. Krosby said.
Stocks had been trading solidly higher for most of the day but lost momentum over a sudden shock of a different kind: shortly after the East Coast earthquake around 2 p.m., the Dow lost about 50 points, but traders shook off their jitters quickly.
Markets in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region also rose as new economic data helped support a feeling that those economies were not as badly off as believed. Major European stock markets were up about 1 percent, after a survey of purchasing managers' expectations for output in the euro area showed no change, at a nearly two-year low.
In addition, a survey of manufacturers in China showed factory activity had probably contracted slightly in August. The findings underpin the widely held perception that the giant Chinese economy is growing at a more moderate, yet still robust, pace than many other places.
Expectations grew that the fighting in Libya could last longer than expected, setting back hope for a recovery of oil output there. Oil settled more than 1 percent higher at $85.44.
The energy index on the S.& P. was up more than 4.5 percent. Shares of Halliburton rose 7.8 percent, to $40.20, and Exxon Mobil shares rose nearly 5 percent, to $73.66.
Tuesday heralded both good and bad reports. Sales of new homes fell for the fourth consecutive month in July, according to Census Bureau data, showing a bigger-than-forecast drop. And a Federal Reserve survey of manufacturing activity in the Richmond, Va., region showed its overall index declined in August, along with optimism about future activity.
Gary R. Thayer, the chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said he believed that the markets rose anyway because it was likely they had discounted, or priced in, the already weak economy.
''What we are seeing is a little bit of a relief rally, and for a lot of very negative news,'' Mr. Thayer said. ''Traders were starting to buy after a few days of consolidation, and it started to attract other people into the market. A lot of people are starting to look at later in the week, when we could hear positive news from the Fed.''

HEADLINE: Markets Will Look for Hints in Bernanke's Words

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve chairman speaks at an annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this Friday, markets will be searching for something, anything, that indicates whether more stimulus is on the way.
It was just a year ago, after all, that the economy was in almost exactly the same position: pitifully slow job and output growth, fears about another financial shock from Europe's debt crisis, warnings of a double-dip recession. And a year ago, at this same conference, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, pointedly described all the weapons the Fed had available to rescue the economy -- you know, just in case.
Several months later, the Fed opened its arsenal and began a major asset-purchasing program intended to stimulate growth.
Given Congress's unwillingness to engage in more fiscal stimulus -- in fact, it plans to pull back on spending -- analysts and investors are wondering whether history will repeat itself, especially if the economy deteriorates further. Stock markets have been rallying this week, partly on hopes that Mr. Bernanke may signal more monetary stimulus is on the way, or at least under what conditions more stimulus would be likely. Broad stock indexes gained 3 percent or more on Tuesday, with the Dow industrial average pushing back above 11,000. 
Among the options Mr. Bernanke is expected to lay out on Friday would be engaging in another round of major asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, which is meant to lower long-term interest rates; lowering the interest rate the Federal Reserve pays banks on their reserves; and extending the maturity structure of the Fed's current portfolio of Treasuries, which analysts expect to be the most likely course of action. All these potential strategies would be intended to encourage more lending, among other goals, and thereby increase growth. The Fed might also raise its medium-term target for inflation, which would discourage banks, businesses and consumers from sitting on their cash, and so induce them to spend more.
But beyond such potential options, the announcement of a clear monetary policy road map seems unlikely. Fed speeches are constructed to cause minimal market excitement -- either good or bad -- and there are reasons to think Mr. Bernanke's speech may be especially noncommittal.
First, only two weeks ago the board's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets benchmarks on interest rates, severely dimmed its economic forecasts and took the unusual step of pledging to keep short-term interest rates near zero through at least mid-2013. It seems unlikely that the Fed would make major news so soon after that announcement, economists say.
''I don't think the picture has changed all that much from two weeks ago,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. ''Suggesting more is in the pipeline already would smack of panic.''
Moreover, Mr. Bernanke could not unilaterally make a major policy change; he would need to seek approval from other Fed officials. Such consensus has become more challenging, since the composition of voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee has changed since last year.
Last year there was one steady dissenter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City president, Thomas M. Hoenig. Mr. Hoenig consistently voted against keeping short-term interest rates near zero for so long, and voted against the second round of quantitative easing begun by the Fed last November.
The voting members of the committee rotate each year, and now there is not one but three strongly hawkish voices: Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser and Richard W. Fisher, who are the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Dallas, respectively. These three voted against the Aug. 9 announcement keeping short-term interest rates low through mid-2013, and so seem unlikely to endorse further easing measures.
There is also mounting political pressure from outside the Fed -- on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail -- against expanding the central bank's balance sheet.
Another reason Mr. Bernanke may be especially reluctant to signal commitment to further monetary stimulus is that inflation has picked up. Monetary stimulus, after all, generally increases inflation since it pumps more money into the economy and chases prices higher.
Last year, when economists gathered at Jackson Hole, the most recent consumer price index report had shown prices to have risen over the previous year by 1.2 percent. With inflation so low -- and below the Fed's target rate of inflation -- many economists worried that the country could descend into a deflationary spiral akin to the one seen during the Great Depression, and more recently in Japan. With the threat of deflation, another round of quantitative easing seemed prudent, or at least less risky.
Today, though, consumer prices are 3.6 percent higher than a year ago, softening the case for further monetary stimulus. The Fed has a dual mandate, maximum employment and stable prices; even if Fed policy makers believe further easing might help employment, they may be reluctant to compromise the other half of their mandate.
The final reason Mr. Bernanke may be reluctant to go further is that it is not clear how powerful more monetary stimulus would be. And it is not just anti-Fed types like the presidential candidate Rick Perry who doubt the usefulness of more easing; Ph.D. economists are skeptical too.
''At this point you're really pushing on a string,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight.
Economists are still debating the effectiveness of the quantitative easing program begun last November, raising questions about the potency of yet more asset purchases.
Quantitative easing is supposed to help lending (and thereby growth) by pushing down long-term interest rates, which are already quite low. It is not clear that lowering them further would do much to encourage lending, especially since many companies do not see a need to borrow primarily because demand is so weak, and not because credit is expensive.
The other way that quantitative easing is intended to help spur growth is by encouraging investment in riskier assets, like stocks, because the return is so low on long-term Treasuries. If investors flee to these assets -- as they did last year, following the Jackson Hole speech -- that could raise the price of these assets, causing consumers to feel richer and so more comfortable with spending.
Commodity prices are higher today than they were a year ago, though, and policy makers may worry about pushing them even further up. If energy and food prices rise again, that would actually discourage consumers from spending.
For these reasons, many economists say they believe that, should the Fed engage in more stimulus, it will be unlikely to select quantitative easing as its weapon. But the other options, too, present their own hurdles, and many are still untested.
In the end, economists say, any additional Fed action may depend on what seems most politically palatable, even though the central bank is officially an independent entity. And that logic seems to point to changing the maturity of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet.

HEADLINE: In Visit to Japan, Biden Seeks to Inspire Recovery

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
NATORI, Japan -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with survivors of the Japanese tsunami and spoke at an airport that was reopened just a month after the disaster with American military help, in a visit aimed at highlighting strengthened ties with Japan.
Mr. Biden was on the final leg of an eight-day trip to Asia that was dedicated mostly to improving relations with China, whose rising economic and political power is a challenge to the United States. In recent years, China has overshadowed Japan, which was mired in two decades of stagnation even before an earthquake and a tsunami struck the country on March 11, causing widespread damage and meltdowns at a nuclear plant. 
Those disasters and a series of misjudgments and blunders in coping with them have shaken Japan to the top. Naoto Kan, the embattled prime minister, told his cabinet that he would probably resign next Tuesday, clearing the way for a new prime minister and cabinet to be chosen, according to the economics minister, Kaoro Yosano. Ministers were told to ''do their best with their remaining affairs and prepare for a handoff,'' Mr. Yosano quoted Mr. Kan as saying on Tuesday.
Even before the disasters in March, Mr. Kan, 66, had been unpopular, criticized for his perceived haplessness in both foreign and economic policy. In a telephone poll conducted Saturday and Sunday by the Kyodo News agency, only 16 percent of the 1,016 voters surveyed approved of Mr. Kan's cabinet, despite its policy of phasing out nuclear power in Japan, which 75 percent of respondents said they wanted the next administration to follow.
Under the circumstances, Mr. Biden used the first of his two days here as a counterbalance, offering reassurances that the United States remains committed to its disaster-stricken ally. He emphasized the two nations' economic and military ties, at times sounding almost as if he were giving a pep talk.
Mr. Biden said it was in the United States' interest for Japan to recover and help lift the sagging global economy. ''Some around the world are betting on the decline of America and the inability of Japan to recover,'' Mr. Biden said at a speech at the Sendai Airport. ''They are making a very bad bet.''
The airport showcases the good will created by the American military's large relief efforts after the earthquake and tsunami, which left some 20,000 people dead or missing. American forces worked with Japanese military personnel to reopen the airport after a 10-foot surge of seawater covered the runway with mud and mangled cars and stranded more than 1,000 people in the terminal.
''I'm proud that our military was given the privilege to join your forces'' in repairing the airport, Mr. Biden said in his speech.
In a meeting with the prime minister earlier in the day, Mr. Biden praised the dignity and perseverance of the Japanese people in the face of the disaster, and received Mr. Kan's thanks for the American relief efforts.
Relations between the two countries frayed a bit last year during a dispute over an American air base on Okinawa. But on Tuesday, Mr. Biden repeatedly spoke of friendship and said he had no doubt Japan would have come to America's aid if the tables had been turned.
Mr. Biden spent several hours in Natori, a town made famous by video clips, broadcast worldwide, of the tsunami tearing through homes and farm fields. He joined the town's mayor in laying a bouquet of white flowers in front of a shattered home near Natori's ravaged waterfront, and visited a community center that had served as a refugee center after the disaster.
Mr. Biden seemed relaxed, making jokes about his thinning hair and holding a young boy for several minutes in one arm as he shook hands with survivors. The Japanese applauded him and seemed genuinely touched. ''I feel gratitude that he would come all the way here to support us,'' said Katsuko Suzuki, 79.
At several points during the visit, Mr. Biden said Americans had been moved by the survivors' stoicism and quiet courage.
''The American people admire the spirit of the Japanese people,'' he said. ''Disaster met its match in the legendary industriousness and perseverance of the Japanese people.''
The country's governments have not persevered so well. Whoever succeeds Mr. Kan will be Japan's sixth prime minister in five years. The new cabinet will inherit daunting challenges, including Japan's largest reconstruction effort since World War II; radiation problems over a wide swath of the nation; a soaring yen that is battering the country's export-led economy; an aging population; and burgeoning debts. Mr. Kan's Democratic Party controls Parliament's more powerful lower house, but not the upper house, leading to political gridlock on many issues.
Likely candidates to succeed Mr. Kan include a former foreign minister, Seiji Maehara; the finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda; and the trade minister, Banri Kaieda. Mr. Maehara, 49, an outspoken foreign policy hawk, is seen as a front runner, though he is still mired in a political donation scandal that forced him to resign in March.
Mr. Kan had said he would step aside after three major bills, on renewable energy, public debt and supplemental spending, were approved by Parliament. The spending bill passed in July, and the other two are likely to be passed by the end of the month.

HEADLINE: Obama, Tiger, Golf And Politics

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Despite the carping by critics, I'm glad the president went on vacation because one of the most useful things he could do right now is play golf -- a lot of golf -- but not that friendly foursome thing with his aides that he usually does. No, real golf: Match play, head to head, with real money on the line. Match-play golf is a great teacher. As any good golfer will tell you, the first rule of match play is this: Never play not to lose. Do not wait and hope for your opponent to make a mistake. Always play the course, always play to win and always assume your opponent will do well -- will make that long putt -- so you have to do better. 
For months now, Obama has been playing not to lose, keeping his own plans for a ''Grand Bargain'' on debt, deficits, taxes, jobs and investment vague, while waiting for the Republicans to say crazier and crazier stuff -- like promising the return of $2-a-gallon gasoline, or insisting that climate change was made up by scientists to get research grants (but politicians taking millions from oil companies can be trusted to tell us the truth on this issue), or that Texas has a right to secede. But while the G.O.P. candidates have been obliging the president with their nuttiness, it has not helped Obama's poll ratings.
Many Americans can see that most of these G.O.P. candidates are closer to professional wrestlers than politicians -- with their fake body slams and anti-Obama bluster. All they are missing are the Tarzan outfits. This is the silly season. But I would not assume that Republicans won't come up with more serious candidates when it counts, or that some of these candidates won't move to the center. I would definitely assume that they'll do better.
That's why the last few months have been so worrying to Obama supporters. Obama surprised everyone by broaching the idea during the debt negotiations of a ''Grand Bargain'' -- roughly $3 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade and $1 trillion in tax increases -- as a signal to the markets that we're getting our fiscal house in order. It was absolutely the right idea -- as long as it is coupled with investments in infrastructure, education and research -- but House Speaker John Boehner could not deliver his Tea Party-led G.O.P. caucus.
Yet rather than flesh out his Grand Bargain in detail and take it on the road -- and let every American everywhere understand and hear every day that he had a plan but the Republicans wouldn't rise to it -- Obama dropped it. Did he ever try to explain the specifics of his Grand Bargain and why it was the only way to go? No.
This left his allies wondering whether he was committed to it -- and really did have his own party on board for it. And it left his opponents thrilled and setting the agenda themselves. It is why Obama's recent bus tour fell flat. People don't want to cheer just the man anymore. They want to cheer the man and his plan -- a real plan, not just generalities and tactics to get him re-elected with 50.0001 percent and no real mandate to do what's needed to fix the country now.
Without his own Grand Bargain on the table -- imprinted on the mind of every American -- Obama has been left playing defense, playing to get the least-bad deal, or playing not to lose. That's what's producing all the ''What happened to Obama?'' talk and its silly variants. (He's a loser; he's not very bright; he's Jimmy Carter.)
It's all nonsense. Obama is smart, decent and tough, with exactly the right instincts about where the country needs to go. He has accomplished a lot more than he's gotten credit for -- with an opposition dedicated to making him fail. But lately he is seriously off his game. He's not Jimmy Carter. He's Tiger Woods -- a natural who's lost his swing. He has so many different swing thoughts in his head, so many people whispering in his ear about what the polls say and how he needs to position himself to get re-elected, that he has lost all his natural instincts for the game. He needs to get back to basics.
It's crazy what's happening in America today: We're having an economic crisis and the politicians are having an election -- and there is almost no overlap between the two. The president needs to bring them together. But that can only happen if he stops playing not to lose and goes for broke himself. Our problems are not insoluble. We need a Grand Bargain -- where each side gives something on spending, taxes and new investments -- and we're on our way out of this.
Run on that, Mr. President: At best you'll generate enough public pressure (now totally missing) to shame sane Republicans into joining you, and we'll get a deal, and at worst you can run in 2012 on a platform, which, if you win, will actually give you a mandate for the change the country needs.
Meanwhile, Mr. President, on a rainy day, rent the movie ''Tin Cup.'' There is a great scene where Dr. Molly Griswold is trying to help Roy ''Tin Cup'' McAvoy, the golf pro, rediscover his swing -- and himself. She finally tells him: ''Roy ... don't try to be cool or smooth or whatever; just be honest and take a risk. And you know what, whatever happens, if you act from the heart, you can't make a mistake.''

 BODY:
On Aug. 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida, causing record damage; 55 deaths in Florida, Louisiana and the Bahamas were attributed either directly or indirectly to the storm.
Scenes of the storm's aftermath were surreal - row upon row of houses looked as if they had been crushed by giants or leveled by bombs. Entire subdivisions were reduced to seas of broken boards and shattered glass.
The New York Times article about the impact of the storm described the event: "Suddenly, the landscape was fantastical: tall palm trees yanked out of the ground with balls of roots and turf still attached, leaving lawns looking like pockmarked green carpets. In places, it was as if a giant, mad wood-chopper had hacked its way through cypresses, pines and palms. In other places, roofs had been sheared away like sardine-can lids and sailboats grabbed from the water and dropped randomly on what had been dry land."
Before Hurricane Andrew reached land, more than one million people were evacuated from their homes. The storm's relatively limited human toll is likely the result of these extensive evacuation procedures.
Hurricane Andrew's legacy, however, is the economic toll it took on the state of Florida. Until Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Andrew was the costliest natural disaster in United States history, causing an estimated $30 billion in damage. Additionally, a quarter of a million people were left homeless in the wake of the storm, as their houses were destroyed or inaccessible.
The storm not only changed the lives of Florida residents, but it also changed insurance policy and construction codes. While not all of the damaged and destroyed property was covered by insurance, residents filed 600,000 legitimate claims. This resulted in insurance companies paying out $16 billion to their customers, which led to the bankruptcy of 11 insurance companies and the decimation of the surpluses held by 30 others.
Because of the number of private insurers who fled the area, lawmakers created the Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association to ensure coverage for residents living in "hurricane-prone areas."

Nearly two decades after Hurricane Andrew, The New York Times reported on an continuing debate regarding the federal government's role in protecting states during climate catastrophes.
Proponents of "The Homeowners Defense Act," a bill proposed in the House and Senate to ensure availability of homeowners' insurance for catastrophic events, argued that making the federal government a re-insurer would stabilize the rising prices of homeowner policies.
On the other side of the debate, the article reported:
The Competitive Enterprise Institute believes the bill would undermine the private insurance market and burden taxpayers with huge new costs. The Sierra Club, meanwhile, says the bill would subsidize insurance rates, thus encouraging coastal development while reducing natural defenses against rising seas and stronger storms. 
As the worldwide number of climate catastrophes rises, to what degree do you think local and federal governments should be responsible for protecting their inhabitants against loss and damage from natural disasters? Why?

HEADLINE: Betterment Adds International Investments to Portfolio

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Investment site Betterment has added international funds to its portfolio.

 BODY:
Betterment, a simplified investment service for investors who aren't multimillionaires, has expanded its portfolio to include international stock funds.
In a recent Your Money column about efforts to serve smaller investors, Ron Lieber credited Betterment, which invests in a mix of exchange-traded funds, for its openness to serve anyone, regardless of how much they have to invest. But he warned that a glaring drawback was that Betterment's portfolio lacked international stock funds-a risky choice given the state of the American economy.
That weakness has been addressed, Jon Stein, the company's chief executive, said in a recent e-mail update. As of last month, Betterment's portfolio includes international exposure through the addition of two new exchange-traded funds: Vanguard Europe Pacific and Vanguard Emerging Markets.
All new clients have the international funds, while existing clients are being transitioned into the new holdings over a period of months.
Does Betterment's addition of international investments make the service more attractive to you?

HEADLINE: Over the Cliff

BYLINE: LINDA GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A lesson in reasonable limits that the Supreme Court's current conservative majority should heed.

 BODY:
I fell into a Supreme Court time warp the other day. Preparing to teach a seminar this fall on the court under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger - the court of the 1970s to mid-'80s - I picked up for the first time in many years a decision from 1978, First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti. The case is not well-known today, although it should be. It was the decision that really opened the door to corporate money in politics, leading 32 years later to a very well-known case: Citizens United. 
The Bellotti decision declared unconstitutional a Massachusetts law that prohibited corporations from spending money to influence the outcome of a public referendum that did not directly concern the corporation's own business. Two years earlier, in Buckley v. Valeo, the court had held that in the context of campaign finance, money equals speech. Now the Bellotti majority described corporate spending on public referendums as speech that lay "at the heart of the First Amendment's protection."
"If the speakers here were not corporations, no one would suggest that the state could silence their proposed speech," the majority observed, insisting that speech did not lose its constitutional protection "simply because its source is a corporation." The vote was 5 to 4. What gripped me - what made me feel like an archeologist unearthing the artifacts of a vanished civilization - was one of the dissenting opinions.

This dissenting justice did not take issue with a corporation's status as a "person" in the eyes of the law (as Mitt Romney recently reminded a heckler at the Iowa State Fair). But corporate personhood was "artificial," not "natural," the justice observed. A corporation's rights were not boundless but, rather, limited, and the place of "the right of political expression" on the list of corporate rights was highly questionable. "A state grants to a business corporation the blessings of potentially perpetual life and limited liability to enhance its efficiency as an economic entity," the dissenting opinion continued. "It might reasonably be concluded that those properties, so beneficial in the economic sphere, pose special dangers in the political sphere ... Indeed, the states might reasonably fear that the corporation would use its economic power to obtain further benefits beyond those already bestowed."
Noting that most states, along with the federal government, had placed limits on the ability of corporations to participate in politics, the dissenting justice concluded: "The judgment of such a broad consensus of governmental bodies expressed over a period of many decades is entitled to considerable deference from this Court."
The dissenter was Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist. What a difference three decades makes. 
There were three other dissenters from the Bellotti decision - Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr., whose signature on Justice White's dissenting opinion is worth a brief digression. A First Amendment champion of his day, Justice Brennan originally accepted the assignment to write the majority opinion in the Bellotti case, overturning the prohibition. But he changed sides within weeks, persuaded that his original instincts about the case were wrong and, as he explained to his colleagues, concerned that striking down the Massachusetts law would "inevitably call into question" efforts to deter and detect corporate corruption. 
Justice Brennan's switch - to the position that liberals occupy today - is an interesting historical footnote that I don't believe has been previously reported. (My source is a memo from Justice Brennan to the other justices, contained in the Potter Stewart papers in Yale's Sterling Memorial Library.) But it's the dissenting opinion of the Burger court's most conservative member that most clearly illuminates the dangerous path the current conservative majority is pursuing. 
It is an article of faith within the Roberts court majority that of course corporations have full speech rights when it comes to public affairs - and they have something rapidly approaching full speech rights when it comes to selling their wares as well, since the doctrine hammered out during the Burger years that recognized "commercial speech" but assigned it a lower level of protection is close to collapse. It's all just speech now. 
Further, the court's speech-protective instincts appear increasingly to serve a deregulatory agenda. A particularly egregious recent example came in June, when the court struck down a Vermont law that prohibited pharmacies from selling to data-mining companies information about the prescriptions that individual doctors were writing. Such information is of great value to pharmaceutical companies, which buy it from the data-miners and use it to select particular doctors for visits by "detailers" who, armed with knowledge of a doctor's practice and preferences, can be more effective advocates for the company's products. Vermont defended its law both as protecting medical privacy and preventing sales pitches for brand-name drugs when less expensive generics would do. 
To the majority in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., the law amounted to state-imposed "viewpoint discrimination," targeting particular "speakers and their messages for disfavored treatment." The fact that the pharmaceutical sales force uses the information so effectively made the law all the more problematic. "The state has burdened a form of protected expression that it found too persuasive," Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority. "This the state cannot do."
In dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer argued that the majority was subjecting ordinary commercial speech to an "unprecedented" degree of scrutiny in a way that "threatens significant judicial interference with widely accepted regulatory activity." Justice Breyer said the decision "opens a Pandora's Box of First Amendment challenges to many ordinary regulatory practices." And referring to Lochner v. New York, the 1905 Supreme Court decision that summoned a constitutionally protected "right of contract" to block government regulation, he added: "At worst, it reawakens Lochner's pre-New Deal threat of substituting judicial for democratic decision making where ordinary economic regulation is at issue."
Not only in commercial speech, but in the area of pure political speech as well, the current majority threatens to drive the First Amendment off a cliff. In June, the court struck down a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns, adopted by Arizona voters in a public referendum 13 years ago in response to corruption scandals. As an incentive to accept public financing, without fear of being outspent by a wealthy, privately financed candidate, the system offered a publicly financed candidate an extra dollar for every dollar that the opponent spent above the law's cap on public money. 
This system placed a burden on the wealthy candidate's speech amounting to something like a fine, Chief Justice Roberts wrote for the majority in Arizona Free Enterprise Club v. Bennett. "Such basic intrusion by the government into the debate over who should govern goes to the heart of First Amendment values," he said, concluding: "Laws like Arizona's matching funds provision that inhibit robust and wide-open political debate without sufficient justification cannot stand."
In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan argued that the Arizona system "discriminated against no ideas and prevented no speech." The law "fostered both the vigorous competition of ideas and its ultimate object - a government responsive to the will of the people," she said, adding that Arizonans "deserve better" than a Supreme Court that stood in the path of electoral reform.
Earlier this month, the American Bar Association traveled north to Toronto for its annual meeting. Doing some homework for a panel I was to moderate, I came upon Section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, added in 1982 to the country's mid-19th century constitution. Section 1, the "limitation clause," makes the Charter's many guarantees subject "to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." A Canadian judge assured me that this requirement of "proportionality," as various European constitutions with a similar principle refer to it, is invoked constantly and forms the basis for Canadian constitutional interpretation. 
Proportionality strikes me as worth considering in preference to the arid absolutism that seems to have taken hold of the United States Supreme Court. I wonder what William Rehnquist would say. The old chief, who died in 2005, was a master at seeing around corners, and he lived long enough to see the prediction he made in 1978 come true. 
Early in his 34-year Supreme Court tenure, Associate Justice Rehnquist held many positions far enough to the right that they could accurately be described as extreme for their day. As chief justice, he mellowed. I wouldn't presume to say whether he changed his mind, but he did change his tone, and with some regularity placed the court's institutional welfare above his own policy preferences. 
That was most apparent in his 2003 majority opinion in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, which called a halt (perhaps permanent, perhaps not) to the Rehnquist court's federalism revolution of the 1990s. In case after case, a narrow majority had invoked federalism principles to hold that states could not be required to give their employees the protections of various federal anti-discrimination statutes. The series of cases at least suggested that the core civil rights protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act might themselves be in play. The subject of the Hibbs case was the Family and Medical Leave Act. The challenge to its application to state employees came closer to the core than any of the earlier cases. But this time, the chief justice blinked, writing a paean to the virtues of a law that, by giving both male and female employees time off to care for sick family members, protected against sex stereotyping by making clear that care-giving was not simply women's work. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg still jokes that when she showed the Rehnquist opinion to her husband, he asked her whether she had written it. 
The Hibbs decision can be seen as an exercise in setting reasonable limits: this far, but not over a cliff. As to whether today's judicial conservative orthodoxy recognizes any limits, we'll soon see.

HEADLINE: Changing Fuels, Taylors Chase Their Own Mileage Mark

BYLINE: ROBERT PEELE


HIGHLIGHT: Helen and John Taylor, who in 2009 established a fuel economy record for driving the 48 contiguous United States, set another mark this week, averaging 64.4 m.p.g. in a Chevrolet Cruze Eco.

 BODY:
When we last saw Helen and John Taylor back in 2009, they were breaking the fuel economy record for driving the 48 contiguous states, setting a mark of 67.9 miles per gallon in a Volkswagen Jetta TDI.
On Tuesday, they finished another tour of the continental United States, this time in a 2012 Chevrolet Cruze Eco, averaging 64.4 m.p.g. to establish a new mark for a gasoline-powered vehicle. (The Jetta TDI was diesel fueled; Guinness, which confirmed the Taylors' 2009 record, does not distinguish between the two fuels, though diesel engines are generally more fuel efficient.)
The Taylors drove the same route they did in 2009, altering only the locations of the start and finish. The drive began on Aug. 1 in Burbank, Calif., and ended in Las Vegas after 9,564.2 miles. All told, they used 148.5 gallons of gas, with a total cost of $541.24. The Taylors drove at least 30 miles in each state, they said; the Cruze's fuel tank was sealed between each refueling, and independent witnesses were on hand at each checkpoint to help log their journey.
While Guinness will not officially recognize the couple's effort, the 64.4 m.p.g figure does exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's mileage estimate of 42 m.p.g. for the Cruze Eco by more than 50 percent and easily exceeds the recently announced corporate average fuel economy standard goal of 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025.
The Taylors were not preoccupied with breaking the 2009 record, they said. Instead, they wanted to show motorists what can be achieved by driving in a more mileage-conscious fashion. They said they believe that regular drivers can easily achieve a 10 to 20 percent decrease in fuel costs by following their tips for greater fuel economy.
"This has given us an opportunity to reach out to a wider audience, because the majority of drivers in the United States use gasoline," said Helen Taylor of their most recent 48-state tour. "We want to encourage the American motorists to try to beat the record."

HEADLINE: Seattle's Intiman Theater Takes Step Toward Reopening

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: Seattle's Intiman Theater, which laid off its entire staff and closed its doors in April, has taken a first step toward reopening.

 BODY:
Seattle's Intiman Theater, which laid off its entire staff and closed its doors in April, has taken a first step toward reopening, hiring a consulting artistic director to come up with a plan to present to potential backers and the theater's creditors, the Seattle Times reported. 
For now, the board has hired Andrew Russell, 28, the theater's former associate producer, through Oct. 1. If he and the board succeed in raising enough money to implement his plan, which will involve presenting a "micro-season" next summer, then he will be kept on and the board will begin to hire other staff.
Intiman, which rose to national prominence under Bartlett Sher, winning a regional theater Tony Award in 2006, closed as the result of a financial crisis caused by years of expanding budgets and inconsistent fundraising. Kate Whoriskey, who succeeded Mr. Sher as artistic director last year, was laid off with the rest of the staff in April and has since returned to New York.
In an interview with the Seattle Times, Mr. Russell hinted at a vision that was substantially different from Mr. Sher's or Ms. Whoriskey's, emphasizing local artists and sharing Intiman's theater with other local arts groups.
"We're returning to the core impulse of what Intiman was at the start - a place created by theater artists, not run by one godlike director," Mr. Russell said. 
Seattle Shakespeare Company has already announced plans to present half its 2011-2012 season in Intiman's theater.

HEADLINE: Art Institute of Chicago Names New Director

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The Art Institute of Chicago has named Douglas Druick, a curator there for 26 years and the chair of two departments, as its new director, the institute announced on Wednesday.

 BODY:
The Art Institute of Chicago has named Douglas Druick, a curator there for 26 years and the chair of two departments, as its new director, the institute announced on Wednesday. Mr. Druick, 66, has been the acting director since June 30, when the former director, James Cuno, departed to become the president and chief executive of the J. Paul Getty Trust in Los Angeles. 
Reached in the director's office on Wednesday morning, Mr. Druick, who previously led the prints and drawings and European painting and sculpture departments, said that he felt his intimate knowledge of the museum gave him "a very good perspective of the ways we can grow." He said that his goals included changing gallery installations, hiring a new education director, pursuing the production of online catalogs and expanding the ways that technology is used to provide both on-site and remote access to the collection. 
Mr. Druick described the institute's financial position as sound, saying that its endowment was up almost 24 percent over the last fiscal year and individual contributions had also increased since the recession. He said it was too early to say whether the institute, which opened a new Renzo Piano-designed wing in 2009, would take on any new expansion projects, but added that "museums have to continue to think about the future, and we're no exception." 
Asked about his own future and how long he planned to be in the job, given his age, he said he planned to stay "a very long time." He added: "I wake up every morning anxious to be in the office and totally energized by this new position, and I have lots and lots of plans."

HEADLINE: Gas Is Cheaper, but We're Still Driving Less

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: The latest weekly report from MasterCard shows that gasoline consumption is down in the United States despite a recent drop in prices.

 BODY:
Driving less? Perhaps stubbornly high gasoline prices are getting you down. All the bad economic news may be holding you back from shopping or eating out as much. Or maybe you don't have a job to drive to in the morning.
Obviously, you are not alone. MasterCard SpendingPulse put out its weekly gasoline report Tuesday, and demand for gasoline is going south fast. For the week ending Aug. 19, demand for gasoline at gas stations across the country was down by 4.2 percent compared to the same week a year ago. In week-to-week terms, it's down 0.8 percent, despite the fact that gasoline prices have been edging down lately. In fact, the average price for a gallon of regular was down 4 cents from the week before, but still nearly a third higher than a year ago.
The four-week moving average in gasoline consumption is down 3.8 percent from last year, so the one-week drop is not an aberration.
If you care about pollution and energy usage, this is good news, of course. The country is consuming at least two million barrels of gasoline a week less this summer than last. But as an economic indicator, less gasoline pumped means fewer miles driven and less economic activity. That might be gloomy enough to make more people want to stay at home.

HEADLINE: Ristretto | Los Angeles Coffee Crawl

BYLINE: OLIVER STRAND


HIGHLIGHT: Where to find terrific coffee in one of the largest cities in the world.

 BODY:
The intrastate rivalry between Los Angeles and San Francisco doesn't make much sense if you live outside of California. Or really, if you don't live in the Bay Area. I grew up in one city and went to college a BART ride away from the other, so I feel qualified to paint a picture of the two with broad strokes: Los Angeles is crazy about San Francisco, and San Francisco wishes Los Angeles would go away.
This might explain why one of the great coffee cities in the world has almost nothing to do with one of the largest cities in the world, even though the two share a coastline and a couple of highways. You would think that at least one of the Bay Area's superb small-batch roasters would send a Sprinter south, set up shop and give millions of Angelenos a taste of what they've been missing, but no. San Francisco would much prefer to let Los Angeles figure things out on its own.
And so they did. Chicago's Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea took a stucco storefront on Sunset Boulevard in Silverlake and became the home team. Since its arrival four years ago, Intelligentsia has opened a total of three coffee shops and a roaster, training a generation of baristas and managers who are going on to start new projects. The Los Angeles coffee scene, which always had good style, now has the substance to back it up.
The newcomer that has the coffee nuts buzzing is Handsome Coffee Roasters. Founded in April by three Intelligentsia alums - Chris Owens, Michael Phillips (the 2010 World Barista Champion, the only American to win the title) and Tyler Wells - Handsome is only beta-testing coffee right now; the plan is to open a coffee shop this fall in its warehouse on the eastern edge of Downtown. In the meantime, you can find the coffee if you know where to look.
The Handsome team has big plans for the city. Until those come to fruition, I compiled a short list of the most outstanding coffee I found in Los Angeles on a recent visit. I should note that even though I went to many of the coffee shops on my to-do map, I didn't make it to the Inland Empire and Klatch, one of Roast magazine's "Roasters of the Year" for 2009, or to Cafe de Lechein Eagle Rock; Drip Bar wasn't dripping when I was in town.
Also, an addendum: Cafecito Organico and La Mill have their shortcomings, but both are worth a visit. Go to the Cafecito Organico in Silver Lake for the laid-back feel of a taco stand - sit outside under a corrugated awning or at one of the tables next to the palm trees and the "No Parking" sign. Go to La Mill in Silver Lake for the Hollywood Regency redux: lacy landscapes on the walls, stools in green pleather, a gold espresso machine polished to a high sheen.
Ristretto: Los Angeles Map
Terrific coffee can be had at any of the shops below:
Bru Coffee Bar
brucoffeebar.com
1866 North Vermont Avenue (Los Feliz), Los Angeles; (323) 664-7500.
An echo chamber in Los Feliz. It feels like an art gallery turned coffee shop, with well-made espresso drinks and drip coffee brewed to order; beans from San Francisco's Ritual Coffee Roasters.
Coffee Commissary
coffeecommissary.com
801 North Fairfax Avenue (Fairfax District), Los Angeles; (323) 664-8633.
Serious coffee, with style to spare. Order a frothy latte and sit outside, or stand at the counter and down a shot of single-origin espresso pulled on a Strada. Beans are from Portland's Coava Coffee Roasters, San Francisco's Sightglass Coffee Roasters and Seattle's Victrola Coffee Roasters. Shares an address with Lindy & Grundy, the butcher shop that has everybody talking.
Cognoscenti Coffee at Proof Bakery
3156 Glendale Boulevard (Atwater Village), Los Angeles; (213) 986-6624; milstudio.com
So much going on in so little square footage. The tiny (and excellent) Proof Bakery turned over some of its limited counter space to Cognoscenti Coffee, which has multiple espresso machines, multiple brewing devices, multiple roasters: Coava, Santa Rosa's Ecco Caffe, San Francisco's Four Barrel Coffee Roasters, Handsome. It's madness; it's fantastic.
Espresso Cielo
espressocielo.com
3101 Main Street, Santa Monica; (310) 314-9999
A pretty, almost precious coffee shop two breezy blocks from the beach. There are well-crafted espresso drinks (beans are from Vancouver's 49th Parallel), iced coffee from a Japanese slow dripper. The customers seem to belong to healthier, more attractive universe: a chiseled man ordering at the counter, a woman in a gauzy sundress and cowboy boots nursing a cappuccino.
Espresso Profeta
espressoprofetala.com
1129 Glendon Avenue (Westwood Village), Los Angeles; (310) 208-3375.
A Westwood Village standby that keeps its focus. The coffee operation is tiny, a two-group Synesso in the front pulling shots of Seattle's Espresso Vivace. There's ample seating on the sidewalk, in the back and on the overgrown patio in front.

Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea
intelligentsiacoffeeandtea.com
3922 West Sunset Boulevard (Silver Lake), Los Angeles; (323) 663-6173.
1331 Abbot Kinney Boulevard (Venice Beach), Los Angeles; (310) 399-1233.
55 East Colorado Boulevard, Pasadena; (626) 578-1270.
The gold standard for Los Angeles coffee. Each location has a distinctive character: the theatricality of the espresso machine podiums at Venice Beach, the high counters and craft beers at Pasadena. The original in Silver Lake remains my favorite - deep arches and Spanish tiles, preternaturally talented baristas working behind the marble counter.
Paper or Plastik
paperorplastikcafe.com
5722 West Pico Boulevard (Mid-City), Los Angeles; (323) 935-0268.
A dance studio with a coffee shop in front that's become a gathering place for a neighborhood better known for auto body shops. The room has a muscular rawness - exposed wood trusses, tables with complicated metalwork. The beans are from Intelligentsia and Ecco; the baristas know how to baby the Synesso.
Spring for Coffee
springforcoffee.com
548 South Spring Street (Gallery District), Los Angeles, no telephone.
817 South Los Angeles Street (Garment District), Los Angeles, no telephone.
More reasons to spend time Downtown. The tiny Spring for Coffee on Spring Street spawned an even smaller location in the narrow lobby of a beat-up building on Los Angeles Street. The original carries coffees from Portland's Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Ritual and Intelligentsia; the new coffee bar gets its beans from Oakland's Blue Bottle Coffee.
An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that Cafe de Leche was in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles. It is in Highland Park.

HEADLINE: Local and National Stimulus

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Stimulus spending in one locality probably just displaces spending from other areas, an economist writes.

 BODY:
It's a lot easier to move spending from one area to another than it is to create spending anew. That's why it may be too much to ask the federal government to use its ability to spend to get the recovery going.
In 2009 the New York Yankees opened their new stadium on the north side of East 161st Street, replacing the historic stadium on the south side of the street. Not surprisingly, 2009 spending by consumers, news organizations and entertainment businesses, among others, on the north side of East 161st Street was a lot more than it had been in years past. It all started from the Yankees' spending at the new location.
So a spending advocate might assert that this episode is proof that spending by one organization can stimulate spending by others, because the spending by the others on the north side of the street surged at exactly the same time that the Yankees started having their people work there.
Of course, such an analysis is flawed, because it ignores what happened on the other side of the street. Much of what happened north of East 161st Street was just a displacement of activity from the south side, rather than a creation of new activity. Even the construction workers building the stadium may well have been drawn from other tasks.

This pattern is not special to the Yankees' move. A number of studies have shown that consumer spending associated with a sports team to a large degree displaces spending in other areas and displaces spending on other leisure activities; a family is unlikely to conclude that because there's a new team in town or a new stadium, it should sharply increase its spending on entertainment. 
Yet ignoring the displacement effects is exactly what Paul Krugman and Dean Baker have done in their praise of recent studies that use "cross-state variation in stimulus spending per capita to estimate the employment effects of the stimulus," studies comparing states that received more stimulus to states that received less. 
Spending from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (a.k.a., the "stimulus") could be very much like the stadium spending -- a locality that received more stimulus spending merely enjoyed a displacement of activity into its area from localities that received less spending, and that nationally little or no additional spending occurred as a result of the legislation.
If you want to know about the national effects of the stimulus, at least part of the analysis has to look at the nation as a whole. The same is true of the national effects of changes in labor supply. If one group suddenly becomes more willing to work, it is possible that the group solely takes jobs from the rest of the population, with no new jobs being created for the nation as a whole. 
That's why, in addition to looking at the experiences of specific groups and specific regions, I have examined the effects of supply and demand on national employment. (Professor Krugman and Dr. Baker assert in so many words that I ignore national employment, though my papers on the subject look very much at national aggregates. For example, see Figure 3 and Figure 6 of this paper and Table 2, Table 3, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 or Figure 5 of this paper).
I found, for example, that national employment increases during the summer precisely because young people are more willing to work. Not surprisingly, the summer surge of young job seekers does seem to reduce employment of the rest of the population, but the net national effect is still almost a million more jobs in the summer.
For now, it appears that government spending reduces private spending, even while it may benefit specific regions or groups.

HEADLINE: Google Reaches $500 Million Settlement With Government

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: The agreement ends an inquiry into the search engine's practices on illegal ads for online pharmacies.

 BODY:
Google will pay $500 million to settle federal government charges that it has knowingly shown illegal ads for fraudulent Canadian pharmacies in the United States, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday.
The federal investigation, which was first revealed in May, found that Google was aware that some Canadian pharmacies that advertised on its site failed to require a prescription for substances like the painkiller Oxycontin and the stimulant Ritalin. Google continued to accept their money and assisted the pharmacies in placing ads and improving their Web sites, according to the Justice Department.
Illegal online pharmacies have been a challenge for regulators, because the Internet makes it easy for them to operate under the radar and emerge under different names when they get shut down.
Search engines like Google drive much of the traffic to these sites, say researchers who study online pharmacies. Web sites are liable for advertising that breaks federal criminal law.
Since 2009, when it became aware of the investigation, Google has taken significant steps to chase illegal pharmacies from its site.
"Google does have a responsibility in this regard," said Susan E. Foster, director of policy research and analysis at Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. "To the extent that they continue to allow ads for illegal pharmacies, they're aiding and abetting the problem and profiting from it as well."
In a statement Wednesday, Google said that it banned advertising of prescription drugs in the United States by Canadian pharmacies "some time ago." The statement continued, "However, it's obvious with hindsight that we shouldn't have allowed these ads on Google in the first place."
In a statement issued by the Justice Department, James M. Cole, a deputy attorney general, said, "This settlement ensures that Google will reform its improper advertising practices with regard to these pharmacies while paying one of the largest financial forfeiture penalties in history." 
The $500 million fine covers both revenue that Google earned from the illegal advertisers and revenue that the rogue Canadian pharmacies received from American customers buying controlled drugs. Google had said in May that the fine decreased its quarterly profit by 22 percent.
Under the settlement, Google also acknowledged that it had improperly aided the rogue pharmacies, and it agreed to strict compliance measures.
The online ad business for health care and pharmaceutical companies is expected to be $1.6 billion this year, up 24 percent from $1.3 billion last year, according to eMarketer, a digital marketing research firm.
Google has been fighting rogue online pharmacies since 2003, and Sheryl Sandberg, former vice president for global online sales at Google and currently the chief operating officer at Facebook, testified before the Senate in 2004 that Google had the problem under control.
According to a former Google executive, who would speak only anonymously because the person was not authorized to discuss the business, said Google did not turn a blind eye to the pharmaceutical advertising, but rather played a game of Whac-A-Mole with the rogue pharmacies.
Over the last two years, Google has made changes to crack down on rogue pharmacy advertisers.
After Google became aware of the investigation, it has required that all Canadian pharmacy advertisers be certified by the Canadian International Pharmacy Association and has specified that they can advertise to Canadian customers only. American pharmacy advertisers must be certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.
Google had previously relied on the private firms Square Trade and PharmacyChecker.com to certify pharmacy advertisers, but according to PharmacyChecker.com and the Justice Department, advertisers that never applied nonetheless appeared on Google.
Google has also always monitored ads shown for drug-related keywords, like "painkiller" or "Ritalin." But Michael Zwibelman, litigation counsel for Google, has described its policing efforts as "an ongoing, escalating cat-and-mouse game."
"As we and others build new safeguards and guidelines, rogue online pharmacies always try new tactics to get around those protections and illegally sell drugs on the Web," Mr. Zwibelman wrote in a company blog post last year.
The investigation, which was led by officials from the United States attorney's office for the District of Rhode Island, headed by Peter Neronha, and the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, began during an unrelated financial fraud investigation, the Justice Department said.
The target of that inquiry fled to Mexico and began illegally advertising drugs through Google's AdWords program. After he was apprehended, he began cooperating with the government, which created undercover Web sites to advertise the illegal sale of drugs on Google.
Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the settlement showed that the United States government was taking an increasingly active role in regulating the Web. "They're going out of their way to cut off these bad actors internationally and enlisting U.S. enterprises to help them in that fight," he said.

HEADLINE: Romney Doesn't Shy From Corporations Remark

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney reiterates controversial comments likening corporations to people.

 BODY:
KEENE, N.H. -- No, seriously, corporations are people, too.
At a town hall here on Wednesday, Mitt Romney reiterateda controversial statementhe made earlier this month at the Iowa State Fair - "Corporations are people, my friend," he said at the time - voluntarily alluding to his corporations-as-people comments in a response to a question about what he would do to fix the economy.
"I made the point the other day," Mr. Romney said. "Corporations, they're made up of people. They're just groups of people who come together for work."
He explained: "And when you say tax corporations, the steel and the vinyl and the concrete, those things don't pay taxes. Only people do. So high taxes on corporations is high taxes on people, and people are going to go places where taxes aren't too high."
Mr. Romney also defended the health care plan he pushed forward as governor of Massachusetts, saying, "I'm not going to back away from the fact that I signed that bill."
He was responding to what was apologetically prefaced as "a difficult question," when an audience member stood to ask, "A lot of people like myself are wavering on the sidelines saying I'd like to vote for you, but if you do Mass. health care, what's to stop you from doing that when you're the president?"
Mr. Romney began by refuting the president's health care plan, but said that the Massachusetts plan was the correct decision for his state.
"I will oppose Obamacare, that's No. 1, and on Day 1, I'll direct the secretary of health and human services to grant a waiver to all 50 states of Obamacare," Mr. Romney said, repeating a promise he frequently makes on the campaign trail. "What we did in Massachusetts, I'm not going to apologize for it, because it was right for Massachusetts."
Mr. Romney began the town hall echoing his stump speech, in which he sounds a positive note about the nation's future - "It is the people of America that make America the great nation that we are!" he said - and reminds voters that he has spent 25 years in the private sector.
"I spent four years in government - I joke that I didn't inhale," Mr. Romney said to the crowd of more than 100 people, before opening the room to questions with, "Now comes the fun part!"
Over the course of an hour, Mr. Romney fielded several questions on immigration and the volatile situation in the Middle East.
"In the case of Syria, the president should have, instead of calling Assad a reformer, as the secretary of state did just a few months ago, he should have made it very clear, 'This guy is a killer of his own people,' " Mr. Romney said. "And we should have been very clearly on the side of saying, 'We in the United States oppose the leadership of Syria.' "
Still, before addressing Syria specifically, he said, "Military involvement, kinetic response, should be involved only when there's a significant American interest at stake."
Mr. Romney also reiterated his criticismTuesday of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for comments the vice president made in China that seemed to condone the country's controversial one-child policy.
"His statement shocks the conscience," Mr. Romney said. "His lack of understanding of brutality, of forced sterilizations, of force abortions, is simply unacceptable. It is reprehensible and astonishing, and I can only imagine the vice president will have to do, as he's done so many times in the past, acknowledge that he was wrong and apologize."
Mr. Romney began the day with a flurry of campaign e-mails announcing some key endorsements, as well as four new members to his Iowa team.
Most notably, Mr. Romney picked up Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman who had worked for Mr. Romney in 2008, but had signed on with former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign as a national co-chairman. Mr. Weber will serve as a special adviser on policy, offering advice on both foreign and economic policy to Mr. Romney.
"It is an honor to again work with Mitt Romney," said Mr. Weber in a statement issued by the Romney campaign. "At such a critical time in our nation's history, it is important that we have someone with his background to lead the country. After three years of failed policies, Mitt Romney's record of leadership is what we need to strengthen the country both at home and abroad."
The Star-Tribune in Minnesota first reportedMr. Weber's endorsement.
Mr. Romney also picked up two other Pawlenty backers - Dallas County Recorder Chad Airhart and State Representative Linda Miller both joined his Iowa leadership team.
The former New Hampshire State Senate president, Tom Eaton, who introduced Mr. Romney at his town hall in Keene, also endorsed Mr. Romney Wednesday, saying he was doing so because he was concerned about the future of his young grandson, who stood beside him.
After the town hall, Mr. Romney plans to hold a business round table in Claremont, N.H., this afternoon and another town hall in Lebanon, N.H., this evening.

HEADLINE: The Price of a Jersey Sets Rugby Fans Against Adidas

BYLINE: By JONATHAN HUTCHISON

 BODY:
AUCKLAND, New Zealand
WHEN the All Blacks, New Zealand's national rugby team, revealed late last month the shirts the team would wear for the Rugby World Cup, which begins here in September, it was a proud moment for Adidas, the designer of the uniform and the chief sponsor of the team.
''The All Blacks jersey is one of the most powerful symbols of New Zealand pride, worn by the most successful sports team in the world,'' David Huggett, the Adidas country manager for New Zealand, said in a news release heralding the introduction of the uniform.
But in the days that followed, fans in New Zealand, where rugby takes precedence over all other sports, discovered that the shirts were being sold online in the United States for about half the local price of 220 New Zealand dollars, or $182, and in Britain for only slightly more than the United States price. 
The discrepancy was picked up by local news outlets, which questioned why New Zealanders were being asked by Adidas, a German company, to pay so much more than consumers in other countries for the official shirt of their own team.
The headline for a story on The New Zealand Herald's Web site on Aug. 4 read: ''All Black jersey reaction: 'You're ripping off the NZ public.' '' The article detailed complaints from readers posted on the paper's social networking pages.
A controversy had begun to build, bringing the vociferous passions of sports fans into conflict with the financial logic of a multinational company. For Adidas, it became a lesson in the risks of associating a corporate brand with a national obsession.
It is not uncommon for companies to charge different rates for the same product in different countries, but Mike Lee, a senior marketing lecturer at Auckland University who specializes in consumer attitudes toward brands, said the Adidas situation was different because the All Blacks were seen by many in New Zealand as a sacrosanct national treasure.
A few days after the initial outcry, the furor escalated when news outlets reported that Adidas had told Internet retailers selling to international markets to remove New Zealand from their delivery options.
''At that point I think the whole thing took sort of a nasty turn,'' Dr. Lee said. ''It went from simply a question of economics and costs to an ethical issue of corporate hegemony.''
Adidas has since apologized for that decision and withdrawn the instruction, saying it had intended only to protect New Zealand retailers.
Still, the level of national outrage rose further. Adidas met with retailers but refused to reduce its wholesale price. So the retailers took action themselves.
The country's largest sporting goods chain, Rebel Sport, announced on Aug. 9 that it would cut the retail price in its shops to 170 New Zealand dollars, leaving itself only a ''very, very slim'' margin, according to its managing director, Rod Duke.
The price reduction, also carried out by some smaller retailers, was welcomed by many fans, and Rebel Sport's stock of the jerseys has nearly sold out, Mr. Duke said. He said he thought that although his company was bearing the financial burden of the price cut, Adidas would suffer in the long term from damage to its brand, which would hurt future sales.
''We've had a number of customers come into the stores, throw Adidas products on the floor and say, 'Look, you might as well burn this,' '' Mr. Duke said.
The value of Adidas's sponsorship deal for the All Blacks shirts has never been made public. When it was signed in 2008, The National Business Review reported that it was similar in size to the company's contract with the German soccer club Bayern Munich and Nike's deal with the Inter Milan soccer club. The newspaper said that would place the contract's value at 21 million to 28 million New Zealand dollars a year.
Juli Clausen, a spokeswoman for the New Zealand Rugby Union, declined to disclose the size of Adidas's investment in the sport in New Zealand, citing commercial sensitivity, but said the 11-year deal was worth ''hundreds of millions of dollars.''
Despite the discontent among fans and retailers, the controversy does not appear to have hurt Adidas's revenue in the short term. The company said the jerseys had been selling well, with ''very strong'' orders from New Zealand retailers.
However, Mr. Duke said that many customers had said they were planning to cover up the Adidas logos on their All Blacks jerseys.
One disgruntled fan, Reece Palmer, appeared on ''Campbell Live,'' a current-affairs television program, handing his Adidas shirt to a reporter who symbolically returned it to the company's head office.
Even the prime minister, John Key, stepped into the fracas. ''I'd like to believe that New Zealand consumers get a fair deal and that they're not taken advantage of just because they're here in New Zealand,'' Mr. Key said.
After being accused of trying to avoid the issue, Adidas representatives gave television interviews, apologizing for the ''distraction'' and insisting that the prices were in line with similar products. The representatives also emphasized the company's investment in rugby in New Zealand, but their arguments did not quell public anger.
Adidas said it had canceled a corporate event scheduled for Aug. 11 in light of the public relations predicament and removed branding from six company vehicles after staff members received threats and gestures from members of the public.
The company apologized for letting down fans and acknowledged that it had ''underestimated public attention on accessibility to fans of the jersey in a World Cup year,'' Mr. Huggett, the country manager for New Zealand, said in an e-mail response to questions.
''We poorly handled the outpouring of concern from fans about the price,'' he said. ''We will have to win back the trust of fans that were angered by our behavior, but we are committed to doing that and our support to the All Blacks and to sport in New Zealand in general will not be compromised.''
Dr. Lee, the marketing lecturer, said the remaining question was how much long-term damage this would do to the brand and its sales.
''Part of the brand personality now is probably seen as slightly aloof and arrogant, detached from the local market which it supposedly supports,'' he said, although he added that, in time, people might forget the furor.
Adidas has sponsored the All Blacks since 1999, and in 2008 the company signed a deal with the New Zealand Rugby Union to remain the principal sponsor until 2019.
''By then, I don't think anyone will even remember this, to be honest,'' Dr. Lee said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Orders for Manufactured Goods Increased in July, Led by Aircraft and Autos

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for aircraft and autos last month drove up demand for long-lasting manufactured goods, the government said Wednesday. Outside of those categories, businesses invested less in factory goods. 
The Commerce Department reported that overall orders for durable goods, products that are expected to last at least three years, rose 4 percent in July, the biggest increase since March. Demand for autos and auto parts jumped 11.5 percent, the most in eight years. Aircraft orders, a volatile category, soared 43.4 percent, after falling 24 percent in June. Excluding transportation goods, orders rose just 0.7 percent.
A critical category that tracks business investment plans fell 1.5 percent, the biggest drop in six months. That suggests businesses are pulling back on spending. Orders in all other major categories dropped, including computers, electronic goods and machinery.
Auto production is rebounding after a slowdown caused by the Japan earthquake. The Federal Reserve reported last week that factory output rose 0.6 percent in July, mostly because of an increase in auto production.
A big order by American Airlines helped raise the aircraft sector. American Airlines ordered 100 new Boeing 737 planes with fuel-efficient engines in July.
Manufacturing has been a major source of economic growth since the recession officially ended in June 2009. But it began to slump this spring, along with the broader economy.
Orders fell in April and June, partly because of supply disruptions stemming from the earthquake in Japan. And a spike in gas prices earlier this year cut into consumer spending, reducing demand for big-ticket items like computers, appliances and furniture.
Several recent reports suggest the sector could be slowing further. A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region contracted in August by the most in more than two years. A Richmond Fed survey released Tuesday and a New York Fed survey last week also pointed to slowdowns in those areas, although not as severe as the Philadelphia region.
Economists predicted further weakness, even as temporary factors fade. Falling stock prices and fear of another recession may persuade consumers and businesses to hold back on big purchases. That could slow orders for industrial machinery, electronic goods and appliances.

HEADLINE: Options Dim For Museum Of Folk Art

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When the American Folk Art Museum opened its new building on West 53rd Street in December 2001, it was widely hailed as a sign of hope, both for the museum and New York.
Here was evidence the city could recover from the terrorist attack of a few months earlier: a shiny bronze structure smack in the heart of Midtown that would be the first major art museum to open in Manhattan since the Whitney Museum in 1966.
Today that building is owned by another institution. The museum has defaulted on its construction bonds, moved into its old, smaller space near Lincoln Center and is talking of dissolving and transferring its collections to another institution.
The final outcome still is not clear. But the museum's descent into financial trouble is a parable about how poor decisions and unfortunate timing can undermine even the most noble of ambitious undertakings. 
In its effort to build an impressive new space, the museum sought to create a showcase for one of the country's premier collections of folk art, a field that typically has not attracted the attention or donors commanded by other visual arts. The museum's objectives were undone, however, by its inability to draw the crowds it had anticipated or the wealthy contributors whose support it desperately needed. Even as the museum's budget in a new building grew, its support from donors fell off, a problem that only grew more critical as the stock market declined.
In 2000, when it was still operating in its modest site at Lincoln Square, the museum drew some $6 million in contributions as it sought to raise the money needed to finance its new Midtown home. Last year, as it fought for survival and ran a nearly $4 million deficit, the museum could raise only $3.3 million from donors.
''There could have been more efforts around development,'' said Brooke Davis Anderson, the museum's former contemporary curator. ''We never quite became a fund-raising machine, the way most museums are. It was consistently a missed opportunity.''
Billie Tsien, an architect who designed the new building, said the museum's capacity to raise money was in part limited by its subject matter; New York's movers and shakers do not tend to collect quilts and weathervanes.
''The big money collectors do not sit on that board; it's not sought after,'' Ms. Tsien said. ''Being on the board of the Folk Art Museum doesn't inch you up two more rungs on the social ladder.''
Ms. Tsien's design for the building, which she did in conjunction with Tod Williams, also drew criticism from some who suggested it did not create spaces suitable for the hanging of art. Before the building opened, consultants had predicted it would draw 255,000 visitors by 2005. Today, nearly six years later, the museum is drawing 160,000 a year.
Linda Dunne, the museum's interim director, said that neither unrealized ticket revenue nor architectural designs had much to do with the museum's money woes.
''Admissions is not what funds museums,'' Ms. Dunne said. ''It never balances your operating budget. Donations do.''
Asked to analyze the museum's missteps, Laura Parsons, the museum's president, said in an e-mail message: ''I, as well as some of my board colleagues, would love the opportunity to give you a fuller and richer picture of the museum's story. Now is not the time, however.''
Founded in 1961, the folk art museum has amassed some 5,000 objects of traditional folk art, along with a collection of outsider art, including several thousand drawings, books and related material by Henry Darger.
A decade ago the museum borrowed $32 million to finance the construction of its new building by issuing bonds through New York City's Trust for Cultural Resources, a public benefit corporation that helps cultural institutions borrow money for capital projects.
The new building in New York was to be a flagship for an often overlooked field, but the debt payments on the bonds were significant, about $3 million a year. In 2009 the museum defaulted on the debt, the first institution ever to do so that borrowed through the trust.
Three months ago it sold the building to the neighboring Museum of Modern Art to pay off that debt. The building has been closed since July 8, and the museum is now operating from its smaller Lincoln Square site while its leadership discusses a possible transfer of its collections to the Smithsonian Institution in conjunction with the Brooklyn Museum.
A decision to dissolve the museum and transfer its collections would require the approval of both the New York State attorney general's office and the State Department of Education.
''This is still all in the hands of their board of trustees,'' said Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian's spokeswoman. ''It's a terrific collection, and we would love to see it on public display.''
If the Smithsonian receives the collection, the board is considering having the Brooklyn Museum display some of it in the long term.
Stacy C. Hollander, the folk art museum's senior curator, said she was wary of transferring the collection to these institutions. ''Neither one would fulfill the function of a stand-alone folk art museum,'' she said. ''We are so much more than the sum of our collections. We've played a very pivotal role in the development of this field. The contribution in terms of the scholarship would no longer occur, and that would be a tragedy.''
Some aspects of the museum's predicament have been outside its control. The recession, for example, was not kind to cultural organizations that depend on investment earnings and donor generosity to survive.
On another front, the museum's former chairman, Ralph O. Esmerian, was sentenced to six years in prison for fraud in July. He had been its board president from 1977 to 1999, as well as one of its biggest patrons, and he had promised to donate his collection of folk art, including a version of Edward Hicks's ''Peaceable Kingdom.'' But in 2008 the painting was put up for auction because Mr. Esmerian had also used the work as collateral against money he owed.
And from its inception, the plan for the new building was founded on the idea that its proximity to MoMA would help.
''We relied perhaps too heavily on a survey which said we would benefit from being next to MoMA -- our attendance would escalate so much that our admissions would fund the costs of the building,'' said Ms. Anderson, the curator who left last year for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. ''That didn't happen.''
Instead much of West 53rd Street was closed off from 2002 to 2004 for MoMA's renovation.
Some say the 30,000-square-foot building -- with a sculptural facade and spiraling sequence of galleries -- was not an easy environment for exhibitions. But the design has garnered praise from some critics.
Mr. Williams conceded that the building ''was certainly a challenging place to hang art'' and said he regretted not giving the museum more arresting signage. ''From the onset, we believed a quiet facade was appropriate,'' he said. ''Looking back, I would tell you we needed to be more aggressive.''
Some staff and board members are now trying to come up with alternatives to closing. One proposal would keep the museum open at Lincoln Square in a reimagined form.
Ms. Anderson suggested that maybe other museums could create endowment funds that would support a curatorial office of the Folk Art Museum in each institution. This would also help the field's continuing efforts to bring folk art into mainstream museum collections, she said.
If the museum does survive, it will clearly be in a more modest form. It has ceased publishing Folk Art Magazine, and some of its exhibition catalogs are published only online these days. Its staff, which once numbered 50, is down to a dozen, and its budget has shrunk to $7 million from $10 million in 2009.
Ms. Dunne is finding solace in small things, like a boom in attendance at the Lincoln Square site since the West 53rd Street building closed.
''People are lining up,'' she said, ''waiting to get in.''

HEADLINE: Chamber of Commerce, on Business and the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Surely They Can Read a Spreadsheet'' (editorial, Aug. 21) suggests that business leaders are part of the problem, not the solution, in addressing the nation's economic and financial challenges. We couldn't disagree more strongly. 
Since the onset of the financial crisis, the United States Chamber of Commerce and its members have had only one priority: creating jobs. To create jobs, we need pro-growth policies and the certainty necessary to invest and hire. Today, we have neither.
The chamber has been extraordinarily aggressive in advocating for common-sense policies to grow our economy, create millions of jobs and restore financial responsibility.
We've supported increased infrastructure investment, greater American energy production, a doubling of United States exports in five years through free-trade agreements, sensible changes to our regulatory system and comprehensive tax reform that broadens the tax base, simplifies the code and increases government revenues without raising rates.
We are voicing our support for comprehensive entitlement reform as well -- not to gut the programs, but to save them from certain insolvency.
The chamber and the business community are hardly being irresponsible.

HEADLINE: Geologists Sharply Cut Estimate Of Shale Gas

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal geologists published new estimates this week for the amount of natural gas that exists in a giant rock formation known as the Marcellus Shale, which stretches from New York to Virginia.
The shale formation has about 84 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered, technically recoverable natural gas, according to the report from the United States Geological Survey. This is drastically lower than the 410 trillion cubic feet that was published earlier this year by the federal Energy Information Administration.
As a result, the Energy Information Administration, which is responsible for quantifying oil and gas supplies, has said it will slash its official estimate for the Marcellus Shale by nearly 80 percent, a move that is likely to generate new questions about how the agency calculates its estimates and why it was so far off in its projections. 
The decision by the agency to lower the estimates comes amid growing scrutiny from Congress about how the administration calculates its numbers and why it depends on outside and industry-tied consultants to produce some of its reports.
Accurate estimates are important for lawmakers who are making long-term decisions about subsidies and policies relating to the nation's energy mix. They are also essential for landowners and investors as they decide where and whether to lease their land to drillers or invest in gas companies. Some market analysts say that the large differences between public estimates for natural gas resources provide further evidence that there may be more risk and uncertainty involved with gas drilling than many investors realize. Amid growing questions about the administration's research, Howard K. Gruenspecht, the agency's acting director, appeared before Congress in July to reiterate that, despite some uncertainties, his agency's estimates were accurate.
But on Tuesday, the administration said it would sharply downgrade those estimates. ''We consider the U.S.G.S. to be the experts in this matter,'' said Philip Budzik, an operations research analyst with the Energy Information Administration, according to Bloomberg, which was the first to report the decision by federal officials to downgrade their estimates. ''They're geologists; we're not. We're going to be taking this number and using it in our model.''
A spokesman for the administration added that while the new estimates were very important, drilling costs and well performance may have a larger impact on future natural gas production.
The new federal numbers are also much lower than the roughly 350 trillion cubic feet estimated to be technically recoverable in the Atlantic region, home to the Marcellus Shale, by the Potential Gas Committee, a nonprofit group of industry experts and academics, in an April report. Still, industry association officials cheered the new report.
Kathryn Z. Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, described them as ''further affirmation that the Marcellus Shale will continue to safely produce prolific amounts of clean-burning American natural gas for generations to come.'' The new estimates are much higher than the last assessment by the Geological Survey in 2002. Those estimates -- which suggested the Marcellus contained only about two trillion feet of recoverable gas -- were provided before new technology had drastically increased drilling for natural gas in shale formations.
In their report this week, federal geologists focused on ''resource'' estimates, which refer to the amount of gas that is in the ground and technically can be extracted. They did not focus on what are known as ''reserve'' estimates, which refer to how much of this gas can be profitably extracted from the ground. The geologists also did not discuss how high gas prices will have to rise before companies can make enough money to justify increased drilling.
Natural gas resource estimates like those produced by the federal Geological Survey and the Energy Information Administration have been criticized by market analysts and energy experts because they often give an overly optimistic and simplistic view of how useful natural gas will be as a source of fuel that can replace oil and coal. Resource estimates often include gas in pockets that are so small or so deep that it may never be drilled or produced at any price. The gas may also be in areas that are off limits or impractical to drill.
In April 2010, the Energy Information Administration revised its methodology for estimating natural gas production. Despite the change, some energy analysts say that in Texas significant discrepancies remain between the federal numbers and estimates produced by state regulators. Some energy analysts have also faulted regulators in Pennsylvania, which is the only gas-producing state to publish oil and gas production data every six months rather than providing it monthly. This practice, according to the energy analysts, limits the ability to accurately assess well performance and provide more exact long-term estimates for how much gas that part of the shale formation can actually produce over time.
''If the country is going to embrace natural gas as the fuel of the future,'' said Bill Powers, the editor of the Powers Energy Investor, an energy research publication, ''there needs to be a lot more transparency in how these estimates are calculated and a more skeptical and informed discussion about the economics of shale gas.''

HEADLINE: If Texas A&M Is the SEC's 13th Team, Who's No. 14?

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

 BODY:
After a week of revelations involving Ponzi schemes, prostitutes and illicit payments, college athletic directors, presidents and television executives are now focusing on the really ugly mess facing college sports.
Before a Yahoo investigation into allegations made by a Miami booster stole all of the attention, the college sports world was bracing for the possibility of a huge realignment thanks to Texas A&M's potential move to the Southeastern Conference from the Big 12. While there is a chance that legal gymnastics, Texas politics or cold feet by the presidents of the SEC universities could hold up the deal, most are operating on the assumption that it is likely to happen. That includes the Big 12, which has already formed an expansion committee to find a replacement for Texas A&M.
That leaves the identity of which university will become the 14th SEC member and when that will be revealed as the biggest questions in college sports, with many administrators predicting that the answer could trigger the land grab narrowly avoided last summer. Whatever conference Team No. 14 comes from, that league would probably have to react. And if the SEC becomes the first major league to expand to 14 members, there will be pressure on the Big Ten and the Pacific-12, which have 12 each, to grow. 
''If Texas A&M is the only move, Armageddon is avoided temporarily,'' said an athletic director in a Bowl Championship Series conference, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''If there is a 14th team, then does all of a sudden every commissioner respond in some form or fashion?''
As for when Texas A&M will move, the probable answer is soon but not imminent. If it were to join the SEC for the 2012-13 academic year, it would have to make the move by early fall in order for the move to be logistically feasible.
A high-ranking SEC official said he did not expect any movement on Texas A&M within the next week, because he said the university was busy working out the legal issues involved with leaving the Big 12.
''They have to unencumber themselves from the Big 12,'' the official said.
There have been some recent voices opposing the move, including from Vanderbilt, but it does not appear that enough resistance has been built up to prevent it from happening.
''I think it's a matter of timing and substance,'' the SEC official said. ''Who is it and when is it done? I don't think the SEC has any strong opinion against expansion. Likewise, we're not under any pressure to expand.''
As for the identity of the 14th member and when it might be added, the official said that the SEC was not opposed to the idea of adding Texas A&M and then waiting before bringing in another university. While he said that the league's athletic directors had been assured that they would eventually have to take a 14th member to assure schedule balance, the moves to add a 13th and 14th university are not necessarily paired.
''The asymmetry couldn't be long term,'' the official said. ''I think that you could do it for a while.''
The question of who the 14th member will be is the biggest in college sports. Virginia Tech would make the most sense in terms of its television market, the quality of football program and the culture of its relatively remote campus in Blacksburg. Recently there has been speculation about universities like North Carolina and Maryland because current SEC members don't want another university from their state joining the league. But the SEC official said any discussion of specific universities was premature.
''We have had zero conversations about 14,'' the official said. ''And we won't. I think the issue will be, Does Texas A&M want in? And if so, do we want to take them?''
The official acknowledged that because of the length and structure of the SEC's current television contract, adding Texas A&M and a 14th member would not be financially beneficial from a rights standpoint.
Texas A&M and Team No. 14 are expected to receive a pro rata share equal to what the SEC's 12 current universities are making: an average of about $18 million in league payouts. (Individual universities can make more money from their separate television deals.)
The SEC deal, which ends in 2025, has a few windows when it can be renegotiated but no one from the SEC or the networks expects any radical change.
So the notion that Texas A&M will see a significant financial gain by going to the SEC is not true. While the SEC offers more long-term security, the Big 12 could end up with a television deal in four years that surpasses the annual payout of the SEC, according to Joel Lulla, a New York-based lawyer who is the Big 12's television consultant. Starting next season, A&M is guaranteed $20 million of total revenue from the Big 12. Once the Big 12 negotiates its deal that expires in four years, Texas A&M would be poised to make more money. Texas A&M also has to deal with a potentially significant buyout that will be in the neighborhood of $15 million.
''Economically, unless the SEC opens their TV deals to the extent where they make more than a pro rata increase, it makes no sense at all,'' Lulla said.
The potential Texas A&M move has been driven at the presidential and regent level, as evidenced by Athletic Director Bill Byrne being overseas when news of the Aggies' possible move broke. The college sports world is now fixated on whether Texas A&M can jump through the legal hoops it needs to leave the Big 12 for the SEC, and, more important, who will eventually join them.

HEADLINE: America's Sweatshop Diplomacy

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GORDON. 
Jennifer Gordon is a professor of labor and immigration law at Fordham.

 BODY:
ACCORDING to the State Department, the J-1 visa Summer Work Study program, which allows foreign students to work in the United States for a few months, is meant to promote ''lasting and meaningful relationships'' between the students and Americans.
Try telling that to the more than 300 J-1 holders who went on strike at a Hershey's distribution plant in Pennsylvania last week, with the support of the National Guestworker Alliance. These engineering majors and future lawyers from places like Turkey, Moldova and China came hoping to travel and speak English, but spent the summer packing and lifting heavy pallets of Kit-Kats, often on overnight shifts and for meager pay. 
The America that the Hershey's workers have seen is surely not the one the J-1 visa was created to promote. But perhaps it is the America we have become. Hershey's business strategy is a microcosm of the downsizing and subcontracting that so many American companies have pursued during the past few decades in search of ever cheaper labor.
The J-1 visa, also known as the exchange visitor visa, has its roots in the cold war. In 1961, Congress created a program for international students and professionals to travel here, with the goal of building good will for the United States in the fight against Communism. The program, which became the J-1 visa, thrives today -- but not as Congress intended.
Instead, it has become the country's largest guest worker program. Its ''summer work travel'' component recruits well over 100,000 international students a year to do menial jobs at dairy farms, resorts and factories -- a privilege for which the Hershey's students shelled out between $3,000 and $6,000. They received $8 an hour, but after fees and deductions, including overpriced rent for crowded housing, they netted between $1 and $3.50 an hour. Hershey's once had its own unionized workers packing its candy bars, starting at $18 to $30 an hour. Now the company outsources distribution to a non-union company that hires most of its workers from the J-1 program.
The Pennsylvania workers are not alone. Recent exposes by journalists and advocates have found similar abuse of J-1 visa holders at fast food restaurants, amusement parks and even strip clubs.
Though the number of J-1 visa holders admitted to the United States swelled from 28,000 in the program's first year to more than 350,000 in 2010, and the government made minor changes to the program earlier this year, the State Department has never established a sufficient oversight system. Instead, it hands that responsibility to organizations it designates as sponsors, who profit from the arrangement and so have no incentive to report abuses.
Other guest worker programs -- themselves often avenues for exploitation -- are managed, however ineffectually, by the Departments of Homeland Security and Labor. They require employers to offer international workers the same wages as local workers in comparable jobs and to attest that no local workers are available. Not so with the J-1 visa.
Indeed, the J-1 program is attractive to employers because it is uncapped and virtually unregulated; companies avoid paying Medicare, Social Security and, in many states, unemployment taxes for workers hired through the program. One sponsor authorized by the State Department even offers a ''payroll taxes savings calculator'' on its Web site, so potential employers can see how much they would save by hiring J-1 visa holders rather than American workers. Visa holders can be deported if they so much as complain, and cannot easily switch employers.
At a minimum, the government should preclude the use of the J-1 program as a way to obtain workers at below-market rates. If the program continues, it should be reformed to explicitly incorporate worker protections, including the right to organize, and should be supervised by the Department of Labor.
But last week's strike, and the resulting uproar over J-1 visas, should also lead us to rethink the downward spiral of job quality to which such programs contribute. To recover from economic distress, this country needs not only more jobs, but good jobs, with living wages, full workplace rights and meaningful freedom to organize. That goal will remain out of reach as long as easily abused guest-worker programs exist. Among other things, Congress should pass the proposed Power Act, which protects immigrants who report workplace abuses from being deported.
In a way, the students at Hershey's got more insight into the realities of the American economy than they ever could have expected. Unfortunately, it's an insight unlikely to foster the sort of ''lasting and meaningful relationships'' that Congress intended -- or the United States needs if it is to promote decent work in a global economy.

HEADLINE: Build a 2nd Restaurant In the First's Shadow?

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
Red Iguana is a family-owned Mexican restaurant in Salt Lake City. Founded in 1985 by Mexican immigrants Ramon and Maria Cardenas, the restaurant describes its menu of moles, chile verde and enchiladas as ''pre-Hispanic food, imperial Aztec cuisine and Moctezuma's table.'' Besides its sit-down restaurant business, the 130-employee company also has catering and fast-food operations.
THE CHALLENGE To expand to a new location while surviving a disruptive public works project -- a light rail line down the middle of Red Iguana's street -- just as the restaurant was experiencing a rush of business from being featured on the Food Network's ''Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.''
THE BACKGROUND In 1965, Ramon and Maria Cardenas moved from the San Francisco Bay Area, where they were working in a restaurant, to Salt Lake City, where they took over a restaurant called Casa Grande. Their decision to not modify Maria's recipes from Chihuahua for the American palate may have slowed growth at first. ''People were not used to their kind of Mexican food,'' said their daughter, Lucy. In the first years, annual revenue was about $25,000, but Maria and Ramon gradually built a following. 
In 1970, they moved Casa Grande downtown. Revenue continued to grow until urban decay and a recession hit in the early 1980s. By 1984, Ramon was forced to take a cooking job in Park City to make ends meet, while Maria ran Casa Grande. In 1985, Ramon returned to open a four-table restaurant called Red Iguana in Salt Lake City's working-class west side. The restaurant did so well -- it pulled in some $300,000 in its first year -- that Maria was able to close the ailing Casa Grande. After a fire burned down the new restaurant in June 1986, Ramon reopened 10 blocks away at the current location.
The reasonably priced Red Iguana developed a cultlike following. Its revenue grew every year, hitting $1.9 million in 2003. But in 1998, Maria grew ill and required Ramon's full-time care, which forced Lucy to make regular visits from Portland, Ore., to oversee the business. After Maria died in 2002 and Lucy's brother died of a brain aneurysm in 2004, Ramon decided to sell. ''He was exhausted and ready to throw in the towel,'' said Lucy's husband, Bill Coker.
It was a delicate moment: Lucy and Mr. Coker wanted to take over the business, but they had to convince Ramon to look past his strict views of gender and family. ''Because he was a son, a man, my father would have given my brother the business,'' Lucy said. ''But we bought it from my dad. We got lawyers and accountants involved.'' Plus, she added, ''he wanted to sell the business to me, not me and my husband, because it's family. It was at times painful.''
After paying Ramon $560,000 for the company in 2005, Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker sped up an incipient modernization drive, improving the electrical system and buying the parking lot next door. Ms. Cardenas, who had worked as a wait staff trainer at various Hard Rock Cafes, had already brought in a computer system, which had helped professionalize the staff. ''I wanted to turn it into full service, not, 'Wham, bam, here you go, here's your check,' like in a diner,'' she said. To improve food consistency, she had her father cook each dish in front of her chefs so they could write down the recipes, which they had never done before for fear of recipe theft. Revenue increased to $2.7 million in 2006 and $3.8 million in 2008.
In 2008, the ''Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'' appearance and news of the coming light rail project changed the business's direction irrevocably. Scheduled to start in 2010, the multiyear project had the potential to dissuade customers from visiting and, during its most intense periods, close the restaurant -- a huge loss for a one-location business that had been serving 700 people a day.
THE OPTIONS When Mr. Coker saw the lines outside his restaurant, he thought of Sammy Davis Jr. Mr. Coker, 63, had spent 37 years in the entertainment business, and in the early 1980s he had worked as an assistant director and production manager on a series of Burt Reynolds buddy comedies. On ''The Cannonball Run,'' Mr. Coker had worked with Mr. Davis, Dean Martin and Roger Moore, stars who had become so popular, he believed, that they had lost their identity. While driving Red Iguana's branded van around town, he began to hear from locals who had stopped coming to the restaurant because of the long wait and out-of-state crowds. ''My experience in the entertainment industry taught me that that kind of popularity can flip and become a negative,'' Mr. Coker said, ''and once it becomes a negative you become Planet Hollywood.''
To relieve that tension, he decided, Red Iguana would add a second location. Upscale developers had been trying to lure Red Iguana to their new malls and suburbs, but Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker owned a house a few blocks from their business and looked upon it as a child. ''I love being able to get to my business so fast,'' Ms. Cardenas said. ''I felt as the owner of the Red Iguana, I couldn't live anywhere else.''
While deciding on a location for their second restaurant, they heard about a warehouse for sale for $259,000 just two blocks from their first restaurant. The barrel-roof building was the definition of industrial chic, with a concrete pad that could be used for patio dining and with views of a power station and its three 320-foot smokestacks to the west and the cityscape and snowcapped Wasatch Mountains to the east. But to get the money to buy and develop the location, they would have to convince Zions Bank and the Salt Lake City Office of Economic Development that it was a good idea to build a sister restaurant two blocks from the first. The lenders were skeptical.
The restaurant owners had to make several choices quickly, before the rail construction began.
WHAT OTHERS SAY Danny Meyer, founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, which includes Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern: ''Though it has worked for some -- Nobu, Nobu Next Door -- I would absolutely not advise repeating the same concept so close to the first. It's confusing to patrons, and you may inadvertently hurt morale as staff members will invariably feel they might not be working in the better of the two.''
Anton Schulte, co-owner of Bistro Daisy in New Orleans: ''I would probably just hunker down financially and try to weather the business interruption storm. I don't know their financials but, at the level of business that they say they are at, I would assume they have a little bit of money in reserves.''
Charles Phan, owner, The Slanted Door and other restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area: ''I would strictly look to expansion only if you have a niche in the market that needs to be filled or you're bringing something new to the table and it is interesting to you and the customer. I wouldn't do it just because there are extra people around the corner. For me, it never works to redirect somebody to a second location with the same name.''
THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on Red Iguana's choice on the You're the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and in this space, we will explain how things have worked out for Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker.

HEADLINE: Chasing Rare Earths

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Kantaro Suzuki contributed reporting from Tokyo and Jonathan Ansfield from Beijing.

 BODY:
CHANGSHU, China -- China has long used access to its giant customer base and cheap labor as bargaining chips to persuade foreign companies to open factories within its borders.
Now, corporate executives say, it is using its near monopoly on certain minerals -- in particular, scarce metals vital to products like hybrid cars, cellphones and energy-efficient light bulbs -- to make it difficult for foreign manufacturers of high-tech materials to build or expand factories anywhere except China. Companies that continue making their products outside the country must contend with tighter supplies and much higher prices for the materials because of steep taxes and other export controls imposed by China over the last two years.
Companies like Showa Denko and Santoku of Japan and Intematix of the United States are adding factory capacity in China this year instead of elsewhere because they need access to the scarce metals, known as rare earths.
''We saw the writing on the wall -- we simply bought the equipment and ramped up in China to begin with,'' said Mike Pugh, director of worldwide operations for Intematix, who said the company would have preferred to build its new factory near its Fremont, Calif., headquarters. 
While seemingly obscure, China's policy on rare earths appears to be directed by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao himself, according to Chinese officials and documents. Mr. Wen, a geologist who studied rare earths at graduate school in Beijing in the 1960s, has led at least two in-depth reviews of rare earths this year at the State Council, China's cabinet. During a visit to Europe last autumn, he said that little happened on rare earth policy without him.
China's tactics on rare earths probably violate global trade rules, according to governments and business groups around the world.
A panel of the World Trade Organization, the main arbiter of international trade disputes, found last month that China had broken the rules when it used virtually identical tactics to restrict access to other important industrial minerals. China's commerce ministry announced on Wednesday that it would appeal the ruling.
No formal case has yet been brought concerning rare earths because officials from affected countries are waiting to see the final resolution of the other case, which has already lasted more than two years.
Karel De Gucht, the European Union's trade commissioner, cited the industrial minerals decision in declaring last month that, ''in the light of this result, China should ensure free and fair access to rare earth supplies.''
Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the commerce ministry, reiterated at a news conference on Wednesday in Beijing that China believed that its mineral export policies complied with W.T.O. rules. China's legal position, outlined in W.T.O. filings, is that its policies qualify for an exception to international trade rules that allows countries to limit exports for environmental protection and to conserve scarce supplies.
But the W.T.O. panel has already rejected this argument for the other industrial minerals, on the grounds that China was only curbing exports and not limiting supplies available for use inside the country.
China mines 94 percent of the world's rare earths and accounted for 60 percent of the world's consumption by tonnage early this year. But if factories continue to move to China at their current rate, China will represent 70 percent of global consumption by early next year, said Constantine E. Karayannopoulos, the chief executive of Neo Material Technologies, a Canadian company that is one of the largest processors in China of raw rare earths.
For the last two years, China has imposed quotas to limit exports of rare earths to about 30,000 tons a year. Before that, factories outside the country consumed nearly 60,000 tons a year.
China has also raised export taxes on rare earths to as much as 25 percent, on top of value-added taxes of 17 percent.
Rare earth prices have soared outside China as users have bid frantically for limited supplies. Cerium oxide, a rare earth compound used in catalysts and glass manufacturing, now costs $110,000 a metric ton outside China. That is more than four times the price in China, and up from $3,100 two years ago, according to Asian Metal, an industry data company based in Pittsburgh.
For most industrial products that are manufactured in China using rare earths and then exported, China imposes no quotas or export taxes, and frequently no value-added taxes, either.
Companies do that math, and many decide it is more cost-effective to move to China to get cheaper access to the metals.
''When we export materials such as neodymium from China, we have to pay high tariffs,'' said Junichi Tagaki, a spokesman for Showa Denko, which announced last month that it would sharply expand its production of neodymium-based magnetic alloys, used in hybrid cars and computers, in southern China.
The company saves money by manufacturing in China instead of Japan because the alloys are subject to no Chinese export taxes or value-added taxes, he said.
Big chemical companies are also shifting to China the first stage in their production of rare earth catalysts used to refine oil into gasoline, diesel and other products. They are moving after Chinese state-controlled companies grabbed one-sixth of the global market by offering sharply lower prices, mainly because of cheaper access to rare earths. Chemical companies are also working on ways to cut the percentage of rare earths in catalysts while preserving the catalysts' effectiveness.
Production of top-quality glass for touch-screen computers and professional-quality camera lenses, now done mostly in Japan, is also shifting to China because it requires rare earths.
Factories are moving despite worries about the theft of trade secrets. Intematix takes elaborate precautions at a factory completed last month here in Changshu, 60 miles northwest of Shanghai, where the company manufactures the rare earth-based phosphors that make liquid-crystal displays and light-emitting diodes work. While Intematix hired Chinese scientists to perfect the industrial processes here, only three know the complete chemical formulas.
China's timing is excellent, said Dudley J. Kingsnorth, a longtime rare earth industry executive and consultant in Australia. Mines being developed in the United States, Australia and elsewhere will start producing sizable quantities of rare earths in the next few years, so China seems to be using its leverage now to force companies to move.
''They're making the most of it, and they're obviously having some success,'' he said.
Until Western governments, business groups and media began pointing out the W.T.O. issues, Chinese officials had repeatedly stated that the rules were intended to encourage companies to move production to China. They switched to emphasizing environmental protection as the trade issues became salient.
China stepped up enforcement this summer of mining limits and pollution standards for the rare earth industry, which has reduced supplies and pushed up prices in China, although not as much as for overseas buyers. The crackdown may help China argue to the W.T.O. that it is limiting output for its own industries.
But other countries are likely to say that the crackdown is temporary and that previous crackdowns have been short-lived.
Charlene Barshefsky, the former United States trade representative who set many of the terms of China's entry to the W.T.O. in 2001, wrote in an e-mail that one problem was that W.T.O. panels did not have the power to issue injunctions. So countries can maintain policies that may violate trade rules until a panel rules against them and any appeal has failed.
Even then, the W.T.O. can order a halt to the offending practice, but it usually cannot require restitution for past practices except in cases involving subsidies, which are not directly involved in the rare earth dispute.
China is offering carrots as well as sticks to persuade foreign companies to move factories to China. Under China's green industry policies, the municipal government of Changshu let Intematix move into a newly built, 124,000-square-foot industrial complex near a highway and pay no rent for the first three years.
Intematix pays $400 to $500 a month (2,500 to 3,000 renminbi) for skilled factory workers like Wang Yiping, the 33-year-old foreman on duty on a recent morning here. It pays $500 to $600 a month (3,000 to 3,500 renminbi) for young, college-educated chemical engineers like Yang Lidan, a 26-year-old woman who examined rare earth powders under an electron scanning microscope in a nearby lab.
It was also relatively cheap to buy the factory's 52-foot-long blue furnaces, through which rare earth powders move on extremely slow conveyor belts while superheated to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit. With many Chinese suppliers competing, Intematix paid 10 to 20 percent of American equipment prices, said Han Jiaping, the factory's vice president of engineering.
Still, Mr. Pugh said that the company's decision to build the factory in China was based not on costs but on reliable access to rare earths, without worrying about quotas or export taxes.
''I think this is what the Chinese government wanted to happen,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Online Enterprises Gain Foothold as Path to a College Degree

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Harvard and Ohio State are not going to disappear any time soon. But a host of new online enterprises are making earning a college degree cheaper, faster and flexible enough to take work experience into account. As Wikipedia upended the encyclopedia industry and iTunes changed the music business, these businesses have the potential to change higher education.
Ryan Yoder, 35, a computer programmer who had completed 72 credits at the University of South Florida years ago, signed up with an outfit called Straighterline, paid $216 to take two courses in accounting and one in business communication, and a month later transferred the credits to Thomas Edison State College in New Jersey, which awarded him a bachelor's degree in June. 
Alan Long, 34, a paramedic and fire captain, used another new institution, Learning Counts, to create a portfolio that included his certifications and a narrative spelling out what he had learned on the job. He paid $750 to Learning Counts and came out with seven credits at Ottawa University in Kansas, where he would have had to spend $2,800 to earn them in a traditional classroom.
And Erin Larson, who has four children and works full time at a television station but wanted to become a teacher, paid $3,000 per semester to Western Governors University for as many classes as she could handle -- plus a weekly call from a mentor. ''Anywhere else, it would have cost three arms and legs,'' said Ms. Larson, 40, ''and as a certified procrastinator, I found that weekly call very useful.''
For those who have the time and money, the four-year residential campus still offers what is widely considered the best educational experience. Critics worry that the online courses are less rigorous and more vulnerable to cheating, and that their emphasis on providing credentials for specific jobs could undermine the traditional mission of encouraging critical thinking.
But most experts agree that given the exploding technologies, cuts to university budgets and the expanding universe of people expected to earn postsecondary degrees, there is no end in sight for newfangled programs preparing students for careers in high-demand areas like business, computer science, health care and criminal justice.
Chester E. Finn Jr., a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, predicted that all but the top tier of existing universities would ''change dramatically'' as students regained power in an expanding marketplace.
''Instead of a full entree of four years in college, it'll be more like grazing or going to tapas bars,'' Mr. Finn said, ''with people piecing together a postsecondary education from different sources.''
While many students at the nascent institutions offer glowing reviews and success stories, a recent study by Teachers College at Columbia University that tracked 51,000 community college students in Washington State for five years found that those with the most online course credits were the least likely to graduate or transfer to a four-year institution. And traditional professors like Johann Neem, a historian at Western Washington University, see places like Western Governors University as anti-intellectual, noting that its advertising emphasizes how fast students can earn credits, not how much they will learn.
''Taking a course online, by yourself, is not the same as being in a classroom with a professor who can respond to you, present different viewpoints and push you to work a problem,'' Professor Neem said. ''There's lots of porn and religion online, but people still have relationships and get married, and go to church and talk to a minister.''
But Anya Kamenetz, whose 2010 book, ''DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education,'' tracks the new wave of Web-based education efforts, says the new institutions will only continue to improve and expand. ''For some people, it will mean going from a good education to a great one,'' she said. ''For others, it will mean getting some kind of education, instead of nothing.''
The emerging menu of new offerings is startlingly varied, as are the institutions. One unaccredited nonprofit startup, University of the People, gives English-speaking high school graduates a chance to study business or computers free, with volunteer teachers. There are also budding joint ventures between brick-and-mortar campuses and online entities, like Ivy Bridge College -- a collaboration between Tiffin University, a nonprofit school in Ohio, and Altius Education, a commercial business, offering two-year online degrees transferrable to dozens of partner four-year colleges. And there are grass-roots nonprofits like Peer 2 Peer University, where people start study groups on topics as diverse as JavaScript and Baroque art.
Nationwide, almost three quarters of college students attend public institutions, and commercial career colleges like the University of Phoenix and Kaplan now make up almost as much of the remaining quarter as traditional nonprofit private universities like Stanford or Duke. Many of the emerging models are far cheaper than the publicly traded career colleges, some of which have come under scrutiny over the last year for leaving students with mountains of debt and credentials of little value.
Most are still new and very small, making it hard to locate students who have used them, other than those referred by the businesses themselves.
And it is too soon to know which will take off, or what might come along to overtake them.
''I'm just waiting for a Wikipedia University, with high-quality, online, open-source courses provided by a variety of different people,'' said Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economics professor who directs the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. ''Or the moment when someone like Bill Gates creates Superstar University, finding the best professors for the 200 courses that a good liberal arts college offers, and paying them $25,000 each to put their classes online.''

HEADLINE: Seattle's Intiman Theater Steps Toward Reopening

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Seattle's Intiman Theater, which laid off its entire staff and closed its doors in April, has taken a first step toward reopening, hiring a consulting artistic director to come up with a plan to present to potential backers and the theater's creditors, The Seattle Times reported. 
For now, the board has hired Andrew Russell, 28, the theater's former associate producer, through Oct. 1. If he and the board succeed in raising enough money to implement his plan, which will involve presenting a ''micro-season'' next summer, then he will be kept on and the board will begin to hire other staff.
Intiman, which rose to national prominence under Bartlett Sher, winning a regional theater Tony Award in 2006, closed as the result of a financial crisis caused by years of expanding budgets and inconsistent fund-raising. Kate Whoriskey, who succeeded Mr. Sher as artistic director last year, was laid off with the rest of the staff in April and has since returned to New York.
In an interview with The Seattle Times, Mr. Russell hinted at a vision that was substantially different from Mr. Sher's or Ms. Whoriskey's, emphasizing local artists and sharing Intiman's theater with other local arts groups.
''We're returning to the core impulse of what Intiman was at the start - a place created by theater artists, not run by one godlike director,'' Mr. Russell said.
Seattle Shakespeare Company has already announced plans to present half its 2011-12 season in Intiman's theater.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Jubilant Return Home

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
DAVISON, Mich. -- A quarter-mile from where he used to sell apples from a roadside stand to help his family make ends meet, Tim Thomas stood on the 50-yard line at his old high school football stadium Wednesday -- the Stanley Cup, the Conn Smythe Trophy and the Vezina Trophy in the foreground -- facing bleachers full of fans, friends and family.
''I wanted to say thanks to the people who always believed in me, even when others didn't,'' Thomas said. ''Thanks for sharing this day with me.''
The best hockey player in the world may not be Sidney Crosby or Alex Ovechkin, or any other young, glamorous forward. It may be a 37-year-old goalie who did not even become an N.H.L. starter until six years ago, after years of obscurity in Europe and the minors, a quiet man who grew up in a family that sometimes struggled in this tidy small city and in nearby Flint, best known for its abandoned homes and factories. 
Thomas went home to Davison on Wednesday, taking with him the Cup and the other trophies he won in a record-breaking season with the Boston Bruins. About 2,500 people turned out at the Davison High School stadium, about half the population of the city, to salute the hometown boy who made good the hard way.
''We were never poor poor, but we were never rich, either,'' said Thomas's father, Tim Sr., 57. ''We always paid the bills.''
The story of how Thomas's father and his mother, Kathy, hocked their wedding rings to pay for one of Tim's many trips to tournaments while he was growing up was told often last season. It was told as Thomas compiled an N.H.L.-record .938 save percentage on his way to becoming the oldest player in league history to be named the most valuable player of the playoffs.
''It's O.K., she has a nicer ring now,'' Tim Sr. said about the long-ago sale, which netted $150.
It was years before his son found out.
''We never told him about it because we didn't want him to feel bad,'' said Tim Sr., who was also paying for his other son's hockey-playing days. ''It was one of those things you're forced to do when the economy is tough.''
Michael Moore, the documentary filmmaker and graduate of Davison High, noted that the Flint area suffered from unemployment as high as 29 percent when General Motors began closing factories two decades ago.
''I think there's a work ethic where people are very used to a hardscrabble existence,'' Moore said Wednesday. ''And they know that no one is coming to rescue us. The cavalry is not on the way to pull us out of the position we're in. So we have to sort of do that ourselves.''
Tim Sr. was a car salesman, but his career began ''at the beginning of the end of the economy in the Flint area,'' as he put it, when the American auto industry was starting its long decline.
Growing up, Tim and his younger brother, Jake, lived in Flint, Detroit and Davison as their father took jobs at various dealerships. By the time Tim got to middle school in Davison, the family lived in a little house on Cypress Street. For a couple of years when Tim Sr. didn't have a job, they had a fruit stand in a nearby parking lot and even sold fruit door to door.
One time Ken Morrow, a Davison High graduate who won the Olympic gold medal in 1980 and four straight Stanley Cups with the Islanders, happened by the stand.
''I tried to sell apples to him, but I didn't try very hard -- I just wanted to get his autograph,'' Thomas said. ''I was embarrassed.''
Times may have been tough for the Thomases, but there was always hockey and family.
Barely old enough to walk, Thomas played constantly with a soft stick and soft ball. Soon his father put him in pads, ''and they nearly tore up the apartment,'' said an uncle, Bill Thomas. Not long after, he graduated to more competitive games with his father and uncles.
''We always played garage hockey,'' Tim Sr. said. ''He couldn't stand to have me score on him. I'd put one in on him to the upper corner and say, 'He shoots, he scores!' And the little guy would say, 'You're offside!' ''
When Thomas was old enough to skate, he was already showing preternatural talent.
''The first time I ever saw him play, he was 5 years old, in Flint,'' Bill Thomas said. ''The other kid playing goal came out first and fell down on the ice. Then Tim came out, skated a pirouette and did a leg save. He was so far ahead of anyone else.''
One of the Flint rinks was known as Iceland, and Tim Sr. would leave his son there for hours. Already Thomas had the traits that mark his style now -- acrobatic skills, graceful skating and a visceral aversion to being beaten.
Within a couple of years he was playing on travel teams with the likes of Brian Rolston, the Flint native who went on to win a Stanley Cup with the Devils in 1995.
But travel hockey is expensive, and with a precarious income, Thomas's parents decided that their son would just play high school hockey, which in Michigan is regarded as second tier and not a viable path to a professional career.
So Thomas shone at Davison High. ''He was just phenomenal -- how aggressive and emotional he plays now, that's how he was back then,'' said Jeff Pugmire, a Davison teammate.
''Seeing him now is just the same Timmy I remember, flopping around -- he'll be on his belly and the next thing you know he'll be swinging his stick back there blocking a backdoor shot. And you'd just stare and say, 'Did that kid do that?' ''
These days Thomas's unorthodox style is often compared with the acrobatics of the great '90s goalie Dominik Hasek. But ''that's the way Timmy played back then, before anyone knew Hasek,'' said Al Sumner, who shared the goaltending duties when he was a senior and Thomas was a sophomore.
Thomas led Davison to its first championship. He made 62 saves in a six-overtime playoff game and was selected All-State. But no one took him seriously. After graduation, he joined a Michigan junior team, the Lakeland Jets, as a spare goalie, finally getting a chance when the other two goalies were hurt. He did well enough to be invited to the Olympic Festival, which his team won.
''He was 19,'' his father said. ''Up until then he never had a scout look at him, but after that his career finally started to happen.''
But Thomas's story still had many twists and turns ahead: four years at the University of Vermont, with two all-American selections; minor league stints in Birmingham, Ala.; Houston; Hamilton, Ontario; Detroit and Providence, R.I.; and stints with three clubs in Finland and one in Sweden.
Finally, in 2005-6, after winning championships in Finland and starring in the American Hockey League, Thomas got a regular N.H.L. job with the Bruins. He won the Vezina in 2009 as the league's best goalie but was almost traded last year when his performance fell off slightly because of a hip injury.
''We thought he was traded,'' Tim Sr. said. ''We sold our house and moved into an apartment because we were going to move,'' he added, referring to the house he and Tim's mother had in the Boston area to be near Tim, his wife and three children.
But Thomas won his job back in 2010 and put together one of the best seasons ever had by an N.H.L. goalie.
Bobby Reynolds, another Flint-area player who played in Europe, was not surprised at the turnaround.
''Timmy had a die-hard work ethic, always trying to get better,'' he said. ''Did it surprise me that he came back from Europe and did so well? No. Does it happen often? Absolutely not.''
Moore, who was in Davison this week to celebrate his father's 90th birthday, saw what Thomas meant to Davison during the Bruins' Stanley Cup run.
''Everyone in the area was cheering for the Bruins, because there's very little to cheer about in the area,'' he said. ''To have good fortune smile upon us a second time, to have two Stanley Cup winners -- Ken Morrow and Tim Thomas -- that went to our high school, I mean, how many small towns have that?''
Thomas's day in Davison was relatively low key. He and his family attended a parishioners-only reception at his old church in nearby Burton before coming to the high school, where he spoke about his long path to the top of the hockey world.
''You can do whatever you want if you're willing to work long enough and hard enough at it,'' he said. ''It's kind of the American dream, so to speak, but a lot of people have kind of given up on that.''
At his Cup celebration at the high school stadium, Thomas said he hoped his story of perseverance, of scrapping his way up through the ranks, could serve to help others.
''The Stanley Cup is awesome, but there's a more important thing to focus on,'' he said. ''It's not the easiest time in the United States right now. There a younger generation with high unemployment. They need hope. They need to be inspired.''
Over at the Iceland rink in Flint, where Thomas skated so many times, that inspiration is already happening.
''His picture is up on the wall,'' said Heidi Shelton, who works at Iceland. ''You see kids looking at it and saying, 'Hey, he's from here, he's the one who won the Stanley Cup.'
''It gives the kids dreams.''

HEADLINE: In Mountain Village, Cuomo Finds Respite

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. -- The first sighting came in March: there he was, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, forsaking his usual suit and tie for blue jeans and a pair of Oakley sunglasses, pumping gas at a Mobil station here.
A month later, there he was again: walking down Main Street, steps from Village Hall, enjoying a hot slice from a local pizza joint.
Now, after seven and a half months in office, Mr. Cuomo is hoping once again to come to this picture-perfect Adirondack village, this time as the final part of his first vacation as governor, a two-week respite from Albany that was briefly interrupted by an earthquake and may now be cut short by a hurricane.
Mr. Cuomo, vacationing with his girlfriend, the Food Network host Sandra Lee, and his three daughters, has spent much of the last week in the Hamptons. On Thursday, he is scheduled to attend the opening day of the New York State Fair in Syracuse and a fund-raiser in Skaneateles; after that, he plans to return to Albany to assess the threat from Hurricane Irene, at which point he will decide whether to postpone his planned weekend in the North Country. 
Mr. Cuomo's visits to this region have shined a brightening spotlight on a quiet lakeside community that ranks among the state's lesser-known tourist attractions. Residents are eagerly awaiting the governor's next visit -- though not too eagerly, they promise, lest they scare away their most famous visitor.
''We don't want to ruin a good thing,'' said Clyde Rabideau, the village mayor.
For Mr. Cuomo and his family, the allures here are fishing; shopping and dining in nearby Lake Placid; and this year, they hope, rafting in the upper reaches of the Hudson River.
And there is the fact that Saranac Lake is in New York. Mr. Cuomo has conspicuously avoided leaving the state since he became governor, straying no farther than the New Jersey section of the Palisades Interstate Parkway, which is often used by travelers between New York City and points upstate.
''You can have the best vacation of your life right here in the state of New York,'' the governor said in an interview last week, imploring a reporter to make the Adirondacks the destination of his next vacation. ''I see no reason to go anywhere else. It's my state, and I'm sticking with it.''
New York's governors have a long history of escaping the Executive Mansion in Albany for favored retreats: Hugh L. Carey had a summer home on Shelter Island, while Eliot Spitzer went to his country house in Columbia County and David A. Paterson enjoyed the Hamptons.
Mr. Cuomo's father, Mario M. Cuomo, was an outlier: he rarely left the capital. But the younger Mr. Cuomo, who divides his time between Albany and the home he shares with Ms. Lee in Westchester County, has increasingly staked a claim to this picturesque pocket of the Adirondacks -- at least for day trips.
The craggy High Peaks of the Adirondacks provide a dramatic backdrop in all directions. Mountain-themed inns are as regular as mileposts, and even the most pedestrian edifice -- the local state police barracks, the canopy of a gas station -- is clad in weathered cedar shakes. Dotting this village are dozens of so-called cure cottages, Queen Anne-style and Colonial Revival-style homes featuring airy porches that were built in the early 20th century for tuberculosis patients.
About 10 miles east of here, Lake Placid is a larger tourist attraction, largely thanks to the enduring fame, and sports facilities, from the two times it hosted the Winter Olympics, most recently in 1980. Upscale boutiques line the main lakeside thoroughfare, peddling Vera Bradley handbags, scented candles and homemade fudge.
On a recent trip to the area, Mr. Cuomo took his daughters skiing on nearby Whiteface Mountain. On another visit, the family dined at Great Adirondack Steak and Seafood, a popular Lake Placid restaurant where the specials the other night included sockeye salmon and locally made carrot cheesecake. Ms. Lee is known to be particularly fond of local merchants like Adirondack Decorative Arts and Crafts; when she visited here earlier this year, Ms. Lee told workers that she was shopping for Adirondack-themed items for her so-called tablescapes on her Food Network show.
''The governor came in too, but he was preoccupied on his phone,'' the store's owner, Greg Peacock, said.
Ms. Lee told US Weekly earlier this year that Saranac Lake was her favorite vacation spot -- along with Capri, Italy. (She also identified her favorite flower as the daffodil, prompting Mayor Rabideau to invite her to preside over the village's annual daffodil festival.)
Mr. Cuomo has made the Adirondacks a regular vacation spot ever since he first came to this area as a teenager with his younger brother, Chris, who is now an ABC News correspondent. Last year, during his campaign for governor, Mr. Cuomo took his three daughters and one of his nieces fishing on Lower Saranac Lake; their biggest catch was a three-and-a-half pound smallmouth bass.
''I've been all across the country; the Adirondacks are a national treasure,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''It renews me. It just gets you in touch with nature and it's just one of the really special places on the planet -- period.''
He has made several visits since taking office. In March, the local newspaper, The Adirondack Daily Enterprise, spotted members of the governor's security detail and followed them to the Mobil station -- where Mr. Cuomo emerged from a black Cadillac Escalade and fueled up. (''It's beautiful here,'' he exclaimed, probably referring to the region, not the gasoline station.)
A month later, Mayor Rabideau spotted the governor strolling through Saranac Lake's small downtown -- which, with an independent bookstore, an old-fashioned pharmacy and several art galleries, has a certain frozen-in-time quality.
''We love the governor here,'' Mr. Rabideau said the other day as his deputy mayor, Jeff Branch, piloted a pontoon boat up Lake Flower, the first in a series of interlinking lakes in the area that are bordered by dense foliage and hidden-away lake houses, or camps as they are known in upstate parlance.
Mr. Rabideau said Mr. Cuomo's visits to this village of 5,400 had proven beneficial. In the mayor's sidewalk chat with the governor, he mentioned that he was trying to persuade a biotechnology company to move here; a few days later, state economic development officials were on the case. (By now, any grumbling that the governor's austerity budget cut state aid to the Saranac Lake Central School District by 7 percent has long subsided.)
Dan Bullis, 24, who works at Blue Line Sports, an outdoors store here, said the governor made a good choice about where to visit, given the peace and quiet and the variety of fish to catch, including largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye and lake trout.
Mr. Bullis, unfurling a map of the area, noted all of the waterways that a fisherman can gain access to only by canoeing across a nearby lake and then carrying a canoe through the woods to the desired lake or pond -- a practice known as portage. ''He could be the only one on the water,'' he said.
A few doors down, at Rice Furniture, where an Adirondack chair and ottoman set sells for $299, Barbara Rice, 46, reminisced about previous Cuomo sightings. She agreed that the governor picked a good place to relax.
''We don't have paparazzi here,'' Ms. Rice said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with an article about Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's vacationing in the Adirondacks misidentified the location where two men were shown jogging. They were near Mirror Lake in the Village of Lake Placid, N.Y., where Mr. Cuomo has shopped and dined -- not in Saranac Lake, N.Y.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. and Union to Hold a Rare Session

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
Lead negotiators for the N.B.A. and its players union will hold a bargaining session next week -- just the second since the lockout began -- with an unofficial deadline fast approaching to save the start of training camps. Four people involved in the talks said the sides planned to meet in New York, although the day and the location were still being arranged. They might not be in a conciliatory mood when they arrive. 
Union leaders are still steaming over comments made by Commissioner David Stern in a recent podcast with ESPN.com's Bill Simmons. In the interview, Stern insinuated that players were not well informed on the issues. He also framed the economic debate in terms that the union considered misleading -- most notably an assertion that players were being asked to take a pay cut of just 8 percent.
''It's not true,'' Maurice Evans, a member of the union's executive board, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. He added, ''Blatantly, it's just lying.''
The N.B.A.'s proposal calls for an 8 percent cut in the first year, but it virtually freezes player salaries for the next six years, for a total reduction of $7.6 billion in player salaries, according to the union.
''Once you explain that to the guys, the guys understand more fully what's separating us and why we don't have a deal,'' Evans said from Chicago, where the union is holding a membership meeting Thursday. Union leaders have been holding meetings across the country to keep players informed -- and to correct the record when necessary, they say.
''While we haven't heard Maurice Evans's remarks, I can confirm that we last proposed $2 billion in total player compensation for next season, an 8 percent reduction from last season,'' the N.B.A. spokesman Mike Bass said.
Officials on both sides of the labor divide have pointed toward Labor Day as a key milestone, because training camps are scheduled to open the week of Oct. 2.
Next week's bargaining session may be the first critical moment of the two-month standoff.
''I think so,'' Evans said. ''Hopefully, the owners will have some kind of sense of urgency, sooner rather than later, for everybody's sake.''

HEADLINE: After Arab Revolts, Reigns of Uncertainty

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID; Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.

 BODY:
DJERBA, Tunisia -- The idealism of the revolts in Egypt and Tunisia, where the power of the street revealed the frailty of authority, revived an Arab world anticipating change. But Libya's unfinished revolution, as inspiring as it is unsettling, illustrates how perilous that change has become as it unfolds in this phase of the Arab Spring.
Though the rebels' flag has gone up in Tripoli, their leadership is fractured and opaque; the intentions and influence of Islamists in their ranks are uncertain; Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi remains at large in a flight reminiscent of Saddam Hussein's; and foreigners have been involved in the fight in the kind of intervention that has long been toxic to the Arab world.
Not to mention, of course, that a lot of young men have a lot of guns. 
No uprising is alike, but Libya's complexities echo in the revolts in Bahrain, Syria and, most of all, Yemen, suggesting that the prolonged transition of Arab countries to a new order may prove as tumultuous to the region as Egypt's moment was stirring.
Unlike at the start of the year, when the revolutionary momentum seemed unstoppable, uncertainty is far more pronounced today, as several countries face the prospect of stalemate, sustained conflict or power vacuums that may render them ungovernable. Already in Yemen, militant Islamists have found a haven. Across the region, the repercussions of the uprisings are colliding with the assumptions of the older, American-backed system: control of oil, the influence of a reactionary Saudi Arabia, an Arab-Israeli truce, and the maintenance of order at the expense of freedom in a region that for decades has been, at least superficially, one of the world's most stable.
In just the past week, Colonel Qaddafi lost his capital, Tripoli; the United States and European countries called on President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to step down; the president of Yemen, still recovering from burns suffered in an attack, has promised to return; and the relationship between Egypt and Israel descended into crisis, to the jubilation of many Egyptians who saw a more assertive government as a windfall of Mr. Mubarak's fall.
''There is going to be a transfer of power in our societies, and a new order has begun to take shape in the region,'' said Michel Kilo, an opposition figure in Damascus, Syria.
Already, Israel has begun to face what it feared the revolts might unleash: foreign policies in the Arab world that reflect deep popular resentment over the plight of Palestinians. The most puritanical Islamists, known by their shorthand as Salafists, have emerged as a force in Egypt, Libya, Syria and elsewhere, with suspicions that Saudi Arabia has encouraged and financed them. Alliances have begun to be redrawn: Turkey and Syria's growing partnership ruptured over Mr. Assad's ferocious crackdown, which has provoked international condemnation but shows no signs of ending.
As with all the revolutions, the fall of the leaders will be seen as the easiest step in a long, rocky and wrenching struggle to build anew.
''The question of the successor government in Libya is going to prove far more difficult than ousting the old government,'' said M. Cherif Bassiouni, an expert in international law who has led human rights commissions in Bahrain and Libya.
Nothing feels certain these days, not least in Egypt and Tunisia, and conversations about the uprisings often mention the French Revolution, which required long years to usher in a new order. No one talks in terms of months about these revolts, given the seismic forces at play, from the empowerment of Islamists to the economic trauma.
''We're heading toward the unknown,'' said Talal Atrissi, a political analyst in Lebanon. ''The next era will witness battles and conflicts between actors inside countries bent on crushing each other and proving their existence on the political scene.''
''It will be full of challenges, large and severe,'' he added.
As unpredictable as Libya's revolution may prove, it still unleashed jubilation across the region. Yemen's beleaguered government flooded the capital with troops over the weekend to stanch more demonstrations inspired by Colonel Qaddafi's fall. On Al Jazeera, images of the Libyan leader were interspersed with lines from a song played during Egypt and Tunisia's revolts: ''I am the people, the people of honor and struggle,'' sang Um Kalthoum, an Egyptian diva of another era. In Damascus, an activist saw the intertwined fates of Mr. Assad and Colonel Qaddafi, who in a defiant message broadcast Wednesday called the people who overthrew him rats and traitors.
''We don't want a merciful end for Qaddafi and his sons,'' said Aziz al-Arabi, a 30-year-old Syrian. ''Please keep him alive. We'd love to see them humiliated.''
Across the region, young people who have driven the revolts have shared vocabulary as well as tactics. ''Irhal,'' or leave, has skipped from Egypt to Yemen and Bahrain, where in the streets of Sitra, strewn with rocks from nightly clashes with the police, protesters have made it plural -- not only must the king go, but his family as well. Walls there read ''silmiya,'' or peaceful, recalling similar slogans in Syria. Residents there have imported the Egyptian term ''baltagiya'' to describe the state-sponsored thugs they face.
Iran's revolution a generation ago was followed by a grinding war with Iraq, the birth of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the politicization of Shiite Muslims across the Persian Gulf. The Arab world is now embroiled in three revolutions (Tunisia, Egypt, Libya) and three full-fledged revolts (Syria, Yemen, Bahrain).
''Sometimes instability is a necessary evil, and you need it to have stability,'' said Shadi Hamid, director of research at the Brookings Doha Center, a project of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and that is based in Qatar. ''To dislodge a brutal dictator is going to require bloodshed.''
So far, Libya's revolution seems the most uncertain. Even now, parallels are being drawn to the fall of Mr. Hussein, who cast a long shadow before he was captured over a country whose divisions deepened, then erupted into civil war. The remnants of his regime were long underestimated, by Americans and others, until they contributed to an insurgency that remains a searing lesson in imperial folly.
''Some compare post-Qaddafi Libya to post-Saddam Iraq,'' wrote Bashir al-Bakr in the leftist Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar. ''The Libyans, according to that view, will not be in charge of their own decisions. They will find themselves shackled by heavy commitments, and they will lack the ability to escape them at the present.''
For many in the region, foreign intervention has deprived Libya's revolt of the luster enjoyed by Egypt and Tunisia, inspiring suspicions, as in Iraq, that the West simply covets its oil. As Sateh Noureddine, a columnist, put it in another Lebanese newspaper, Al-Safir, NATO's support ''will not be for free, and Libya will pay for it.''
In that, he captured the ambiguity over what represents opposition these days in the Arab world, old labels defying their old assumptions. Syrian rebels denounce Hezbollah, which prides itself on its resistance to Israel. Bahrain withdrew its ambassador from Damascus as it carried out a crackdown on its Shiite majority that smacks of apartheid. And Colonel Qaddafi, in his message, praised his loyalists as revolutionary youths.
''Forward, forward,'' he cried, his trademark refrain for never-ending struggle.

HEADLINE: Modest Expectations Urged on Deficit Cuts

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- The Congressional Budget Office sharply reduced its projection of total deficits over the next decade after the recent deficit-reduction deal between President Obama and Congress, yet it warned on Wednesday that the extension of Bush-era tax rates and other policies would more than offset those savings.
The report from the nonpartisan budget office underscores the high stakes for a special 12-member Congressional committee created to figure out by December how to achieve up to $1.5 trillion of the $2.4 trillion in maximum 10-year savings promised by the deal. 
It comes as Mr. Obama and Democrats, like many economists, are calling for a mix of larger long-term deficit reduction measures with immediate additional job creation measures. While the latter would add to deficits in the short term, proponents argue that they would prevent another recession and avoid the associated costs in lost revenues and safety-net spending. But Republicans oppose any stimulus measures or long-term increases in tax revenues.
The budget office, in its annual summer snapshot of the nation's fiscal health, projected annual deficits from the 2012 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, through 2021 totaling $3.5 trillion. That is just over half of the $6.7 trillion shortfall it forecast in March.
About two-thirds of the difference reflected projected savings from the bipartisan deficit deal; the rest was due to technical and economic revisions. The lower deficits would leave the nation's accumulated public debt at $14.5 trillion in 2021, or 61 percent of the gross domestic product -- a level that many economists consider the maximum level of debt that is sustainable in a growing economy.
But such projections ''understate the budgetary challenges facing the federal government in the coming years,'' Douglas Elmendorf, director of the budget office, wrote on its Web site.
Annual deficits would be $5 trillion higher for the decade, or a total of $8.5 trillion, assuming the White House and Congress continue several policies as in years past -- keeping the lower income-tax rates of 2001 and 2003, which already were extended by two years last December; adjusting the alternative minimum tax annually so it does not hit middle-class taxpayers, and blocking a mandated cut in Medicare payments to doctors. The result would be deficits averaging 4.3 percent of gross domestic product instead of 1.8 percent, the budget office said; economists generally say annual deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product.
The higher deficits would bring total public debt through 2021 to 82 percent of gross domestic product rather than 61 percent, higher than in any year since 1948 when debt peaked after World War II.
Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats have called for ending after 2012 the Bush-era rates on annual taxable income above $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals. That would save about $1 trillion over the decade, including interest. But they want to extend a one-year payroll tax cut, some business tax cuts and emergency unemployment aid.
The budget office as expected said the deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, would be $1.3 trillion.
At 8.5 percent of gross domestic product, it will be the third consecutive deficit exceeding $1 trillion; as a percentage of the economy, the three deficits spanning the end of the George W. Bush administration and the Obama administration are the largest of the past 65 years.
That ''stems in part from the long shadow cast on the U.S. economy by the financial crisis and the recent recession,'' Mr. Elmendorf wrote. ''Although economic output began to expand again two years ago, the pace of the recovery has been slow, and the economy remains in a severe slump.''
The current deficit could be the peak, but only for the short term. The budget office repeated a longstanding warning: While annual shortfalls will decline through the decade -- presuming the economy recovers -- deficits will climb after 2021 to unsupportable levels as the aging population and rising health care costs drive up spending for Medicare and Medicaid.
Each party seized on the latest report to buttress its position, evidence of the partisan divide facing the special House and Senate budget committee.
''The C.B.O. outlook underscores the need for the joint committee to propose a plan to help put America back to work, coupled with a blueprint to reduce the long-term deficit,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democratic member of the panel.
Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and the House majority leader, said, ''Despite a nearly trillion dollar so-called stimulus program, this administration's policies have resulted in anemic growth, record unemployment and underemployment, and millions of Americans remain out of work.'' All the Democrats offer, he added, ''is lofty rhetoric, tax hikes and more of the same stimulus spending.''

HEADLINE: Qaddafi Leaves Behind Little That Can Guide Libya in His Absence

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's stranglehold on Libya appears to have ended after 42 years, even if his whereabouts remain elusive. But through countless erratic decrees and iron-handed purges, he carved deep scars into every facet of Libyan life. The mystery and speculation swirling about him marked a fitting close to a quixotic reign.
Colonel Qaddafi, who was a 27-year-old junior officer when his coup deposed King Idris in September 1969, viewed himself as a desert philosopher, and he declared that his political system of ''permanent revolution'' would replace both capitalism and socialism.
But over the years, that revolution also swept away nearly every institution that could challenge him -- or guide the country when he was gone. By the time he was done, Libya had no parliament, no unified military command, no political parties, no unions, no civil society and no nongovernmental organizations. His ministries were hollow, with the notable exception of the state oil company. 
''This is my country!'' he roared in a televised speech when the revolt first erupted in late February, shaking his fist and pounding the dais. ''Muammar is not a president to quit his post! Muammar is the leader of the revolution until the end of time!''
By Wednesday, rebels tried to tighten their control over the country, putting a nearly $2 million bounty on his head and sending fighters toward one of his last strongholds, Surt. The uprising condensed into six harrowing months an ever more destructive version of the erratic rule that Colonel Qaddafi imposed on Libya over the previous four decades. He clung to power and refused to accept the rejection of his own people, railing against a spectrum of outside conspiracies from Islamic fundamentalists to rejuvenated colonialism. The country of six million people and vast oil wealth, meanwhile, gradually disintegrated.
To ensure his singular role, Colonel Qaddafi had long wielded violence both at home and abroad. He financed and armed a cornucopia of violent organizations, including the Irish Republican Army, the Red Army Faction in Europe and African guerrilla groups. His government was linked to terrorist attacks, most notoriously the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. He became an international pariah.
Colonel Qaddafi terrorized and intimidated Libyans by spasms of violence at least once a decade.
In the late 1970s and early '80s, he eliminated even mild critics through public trials and executions. Kangaroo courts were staged on football fields or basketball courts, where each of the accused was subjected to intense interrogation, often begging for mercy while a crowd howled for death. The trials were televised live to make sure no Libyans missed the point.
The bodies of one group of students hanged in downtown Tripoli's main square were left there to rot for about a week, opposition figures said, as traffic was rerouted to maximize the number of cars forced to pass by.
''Qaddafi's ability to have survived so long rests on his convenient position in not being committed to a single ideology and his use of violence in such a theatrical way,'' said Hisham Matar, the author of ''In the Country of Men,'' a novel that depicts the devastation of normal life under Colonel Qaddafi. ''He deliberately tried to create a campaign that would terrorize the population, that would traumatize them to such an extent that they would never think of expressing their thoughts politically or socially.''
In the beginning, though, he brought them relative prosperity.
Libya had been desperately poor, living off the meager proceeds from exporting scrap metal left over from major World War II battles until oil was discovered in 1959. But a decade later, Libyans had touched little of their wealth.
The 1969 coup changed that. The new Libyan government forged a profound global change in the relationship between the major oil companies and the producing countries, forcing the oil giants to cede majority stakes in exchange for continued access to Libya's oilfields. Libya also demanded a higher share of the profits. The pattern was emulated across the oil-producing states.
With the increased revenue, Colonel Qaddafi set about building roads, hospitals, schools and housing. Life expectancy, which was 51 in 1969, is now over 74. Literacy leapt to 88 percent. Per capita annual income grew to above $12,000 in recent years, though that is markedly lower than the figure for many countries endowed with vast oil income.
But Colonel Qaddafi's mercurial changes in policy and personality kept Libyans off balance for much of his rule.
To consolidate his power, he eliminated or isolated all the 11 other members of the original revolutionary command council. Strikes or unauthorized news reports resulted in prison sentences, and illegal political activity was punishable by death. Western books were burned, and private enterprise was banned. Libyan intelligence agents engaged in all manner of skulduggery, reaching overseas to kidnap and assassinate opponents.
Colonel Qaddafi's bankrolling of terrorist organizations set him on a collision course with the West.
''He made his entire career, at least internationally and with the Arab world, by being the bad boy,'' said Lisa Anderson, the president of the American University in Cairo. ''He loved being provocative.''
In the early 1980s, after Colonel Qaddafi tried to extend Libya's territorial waters across the Gulf of Sidra, President Ronald Reagan closed the Libyan Embassy in Washington, suspended oil imports and shot down two Libyan fighters.
In London in 1984, gunshots from the Libyan People's Bureau, as the embassy was called, killed a policewoman and wounded 11 demonstrators. In April 1986, Libyan agents working in the embassy in West Berlin were linked to the bombing of La Belle disco there, killing two American servicemen and a Turkish woman and wounding 200 people.
Mr. Reagan retaliated 10 days later by bombing targets in Libya, including Colonel Qaddafi's house in his compound at the Bab al-Aziziya barracks in Tripoli. Colonel Qaddafi said his adopted daughter Hanna was among at least 15 killed, although some Libyans suggested that he had adopted her posthumously.
In 1988, in the deadliest terrorist act linked to Libya, 259 people aboard the Pan Am flight died when the plane exploded in midair. The falling wreckage killed 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie. In an echo of that operation, Libyan agents were believed to have been behind the explosion of a French passenger jet over Niger in West Africa in 1989, killing 170 people.
Nearly a decade of international isolation started in 1992, after Libya refused to hand over two suspects who had been indicted by the United States and Britain in the Lockerbie bombing. The United Nations imposed international economic sanctions, and when his fellow Arabs enforced them, Colonel Qaddafi turned away from the Arab world. He began his quest to become leader of Africa, a goal he came closest to achieving in 2009 when he was named the chairman of the African Union for a year.
In 1999, Libya finally handed over two Lockerbie suspects for trial in The Hague under Scottish law and reached a financial settlement with the French. The international sanctions against Libya were lifted in 2003 after it accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and agreed to pay $2.7 billion to the families of the Lockerbie victims and two victims of other attacks.
Tripoli truly began to emerge from the cold after the Sept. 11 attacks against the United States by Al Qaeda. Colonel Qaddafi condemned them and shared Libya's own intelligence gathering on the organization with Washington. After the American-led invasion of Iraq, Colonel Qaddafi announced that Libya was giving up its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including a covert nascent nuclear program obtained from a clandestine Pakistani network, and said it would cooperate with the international community in destroying its stockpile.
A former military officer, Colonel Qaddafi, 69, adopted a string of titles over the years -- the Brother Leader, the Guide to the Era of the Masses, the King of Kings of Africa and, most often, the Leader of the Revolution.
But he always presented himself as beloved guide and chief clairvoyant rather than the ruler. Indeed, he seethed when the popular uprising inspired by similar revolutions next door in Tunisia and Egypt sought to drive him from power.
He tried to crush the uprising with the same violence he had wielded to stay in power, deploying tanks and bombs against not only the rebels but also unarmed civilians.
The mounting death toll prompted NATO to intervene, and the West extended diplomatic recognition to the often chaotic and rivalrous rebel government. Early rebel victories settled into a standoff, but the freezing of Libyan assets, continued NATO assaults and mounting defections took an increasing toll.
As the opaque circle around Colonel Qaddafi shrank, his sons played ever more significant roles as his advisers, but it was never clear that he had anointed any one of them as his successor. He was believed to play one against the other, granting and then withholding favor, just as he did with anyone who might challenge his authority.
After months of inconclusive fighting, the assault on Tripoli that at last drove Colonel Qaddafi from power unfolded at a breakneck pace. Insurgents captured a military base of the vaunted Khamis Brigade, where they had expected to meet fierce resistance, then sped toward Tripoli.
While pockets of Qaddafi loyalists fought pitched battles in Tripoli neighborhoods, rebels captured the Bab al-Aziziya compound that was the symbol of his power, and Colonel Qaddafi said in a radio address that he had withdrawn from the compound as a tactical maneuver. He and his heir apparent, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, were still at large.
But Libya's post-Qaddafi future looked to be as volatile as its past. There was still no clear plan for political succession or for maintaining security in the country. Colonel Qaddafi's long attempt to eliminate the government left Libya in shambles, its sagging infrastructure belying its oil wealth.
''It has been 30 years of decay at a time when the world itself was completely transformed,'' Ms. Anderson said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain for Third Day, and Gold Falls

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julia Werdigier and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Financial stocks led the broader equities market on Wall Street higher on Wednesday, as investors weighed data about the United States economy and their expectations for a gathering later this week of Federal Reserve officials.
With a late-day surge, all of the sectors of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed higher, led by a nearly 3 percent rise in financial stocks, capping off a day that wavered between modest gains and losses.
It was the third consecutive session that the major indexes had pushed ahead, partly as investors scooped up stocks that had become cheaper after recent sell-offs. Gold futures fell more than 5 percent, or more than about $100 an ounce, on the Comex in New York, and prices of the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell. 
Some investors have been betting on the likelihood of more stimulus from the Federal Reserve, whose chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will speak at the Fed's symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday. Mr. Bernanke outlined stimulus options at the same meeting in 2010 in response to the economic slowdown.
At the close of trading, the S.& P. was up 15.25 points, or 1.3 percent, at 1,177.60. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 143.95 points, about 1.3 percent, at 11,320.71. The Nasdaq composite index was up 21.63 points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,467.69.
The rally in stocks eased demand for bonds. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 7/32, to 98 16/32. The yield rose to 2.29 percent, from 2.16 percent late Tuesday.
''You are seeing a lot of people, rightly or wrongly, sitting on the sidelines until they see what Bernanke says in Jackson Hole,'' said Brian Lazorishak, portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel, before the day's final kick.
''People are adopting a wait-and-see attitude,'' he added.
The financial sector was led by Bank of America, up about 11 percent at $6.99.
Bloomberg News reported that the bank had sent a memo to employees dismissing speculation that it was considering a merger with JPMorgan Chase, and described as ''just wrong'' a report that it needed to raise as much as $200 billion.
Gold, which sagged sharply on Tuesday only to rise in Asian trading, fell further on the Comex exchange. It was down $104.20 to $1,754.10 an ounce for the August contract. The metal had been used as a safe haven in recent market volatility and risen to record nominal highs, and some analysts saw Wednesday's decline as a technical reversal.
Jeffrey Nichols, the managing director of the American Precious Metals Advisors, said that the recent run-up in gold had been ''so large in magnitude and fast'' that ''to have a significant correction here really makes sense.''
''Some of the rally was a function of speculative demand by short-term-oriented institutional traders,'' he said, adding that the consequence would be for them to sell, take profits and move on to other instruments. But he said that the long-term economic outlook was basically unchanged.
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that overall orders for durable goods rose 4 percent last month, the biggest increase since March. But a category that tracks business investment plans fell 1.5 percent, the biggest drop in six months.
Analysts noted that, considering recent talk of another recession, it would take more than one economic data point to convince investors that the economy was on solid footing. But Abigail Huffman, director of research at Russell Investments, added that some of Wednesday's early gains may have been a result of the durable goods numbers and the market's momentum from the previous day.
Stocks in Europe rose as some investors bet that the Federal Reserve would act soon to strengthen the economy and that the sharp stock market drops earlier this month were overdone.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed 1.8 percent higher in Europe, while Germany's DAX index increased 2.7 percent and France's CAC 40 index rose 1.8 percent.
Stock markets in Asia slipped as investors took in the downgrade by Moody's Investors Service of its rating on Japanese government debt.
The Nikkei 225-stock index ended down 1.1 percent at 8,629.61 points. Similarly, the yen remained persistently strong in the international currency markets, hovering at about 76.60 yen per United States dollar.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 1 percent lower by midafternoon, the Straits Times index in Singapore fell 0.4 percent, and in India, the Sensex was down 0.8 percent by the afternoon.

HEADLINE: Japan to Offer Billions in Loans to Help Weaken the Yen

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan took steps on Wednesday to help its economy ride out a surge in the yen, which has battered the country's export-led economy. 
The government announced a $100 billion loan fund to spur Japanese spending on corporate acquisitions and resources overseas, according to a statement released by the Finance Ministry. The ministry also said it would step up monitoring of currency markets by asking financial institutions to report on positions held by their currency dealers.
''Taking into account that there is a lopsided rise in the yen, I felt that swift measures were needed,'' Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, told reporters.
But the action had little immediate effect on the yen and could underscore just how difficult it might be for the government to sway the huge foreign exchange market. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters because it makes their goods less competitive and erodes the value of their overseas earnings when repatriated into yen.
Under the loan program, the government will send foreign currency reserves to the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, which will then make loans to commercial banks so they can help companies with overseas investments. By spending yen for dollars and other currencies, the ministry hopes that the currency will weaken somewhat.
The yen was little changed, with the dollar trading at 76.96 yen late in New York, up slightly from 76.64.
The second part of the government's action is an effort to curtail speculation that officials think might be contributing to moves in the yen. Mr. Noda has indicated recently that the government will act against speculators seeking short-term profits.
The Bank of Japan issued a statement in support of the measures.
''The Bank of Japan will continue to carefully monitor the effects of developments in the foreign exchange market on the future course of economic activity and prices,'' it said.
The government's announcement came hours after Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, lowered Japan's credit rating, warning that frequent changes in administration, weak prospects for economic growth and its recent natural and nuclear disasters have made it difficult for the government to pare down its huge debt.
Moody's lowered Japan's grade by one step to Aa3, the fourth-highest rating, the company said in a statement.
The downgrade brings Moody's rating for Japan in line with that of Standard & Poor's, which lowered the country's grade by one notch to AA in January, the fourth-highest on its scale. Moody's had put Japan on review for a downgrade in May.
The move, a week before the country's ruling party is to select a new prime minister, could put additional pressure on the incoming administration to balance budgets. The government financing of the recovery from the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis is expected to reach as high as 10 trillion yen ($130 billion).
Moody's said that it was worried by large budget deficits and the buildup of government debt. Frequent change in leadership had prevented the government from pursuing long-term fiscal reform, the agency said, while the recent disasters had delayed recovery. Meanwhile, weak prospects for economic growth were also hampering efforts to curb the country's debt burden, the agency said.

HEADLINE: Epicenter Of Quake Owes Name To the Earth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
MINERAL, Va. -- Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia didn't feel the earth move on Tuesday as he ate dinner at a Jerusalem restaurant during a Congressional fact-finding trip.
But it took only minutes for the news that this little town in his district was the epicenter of an earthquake to slingshot around the globe and reach Mr. Cantor, the House majority leader, and 30 of his colleagues in Israel.
''All of them, over a matter of 10 minutes, I would say, had received either a Twitter or an e-mail,'' Mr. Cantor said after taking a flight home to inspect the damage with the state's governor. 
More than 100 years before the earth started shaking here, it was the earth -- or, more precisely, what the town's fathers found in it -- that put Mineral on the map.
This crossroads in central Virginia was Tolersville then. But the discovery of pyrite, sulfur and lead turned it into a booming little town, and by 1902 it was incorporated and named after the only thing anybody knew it for.
It got a new, global distinction on Tuesday, when television screens all over the world were suddenly showing a map of Virginia, with Mineral (pop. 450) at the center.
The quake did little more than rattle nerves up and down the East Coast, but here at the epicenter, many of the town's aging buildings were severely damaged.
The high school, which opened last week, will be closed at least until Labor Day because of huge cracks in the walls, fallen ceiling tiles and a roof that may not be safe. The town hall, which also serves as the area's motor vehicle office, was also closed, after its brick facade crumbled. Business owners and residents woke up Wednesday facing another day of arguing with insurance adjusters who matter-of-factly said that most of them lacked earthquake coverage.
The North Anna Power Station -- a nuclear power plant about eight miles away -- was shut down right after the earthquake as a precaution. The emergency was canceled Wednesday morning, but the plant remained offline while the reactors were inspected.
''It's not the kind of thing that we're used to in Virginia,'' Gov. Bob McDonnell said after inspecting damage with Mr. Cantor on Wednesday. The governor said there was about $1.7 million, including private donations, in an emergency fund, and pledged: ''We will do the things that we can do through existing state resources and creative private resources.''
That may not be enough for the residents of Mineral, who spent Wednesday cleaning up the mess.
The floors of Ginger and Charles Gittman's home were covered with glass and porcelain. Mrs. Gittman, 54, said the broken items included china that had been her grandmother's.
Mike Leman, the co-owner of Main Street Electrical and Plumbing, was outside, weeding around a propane tank, when the ground shook. ''The whole tank lifted up and then came back down,'' Mr. Leman recalled.
The ensuing excitement was like nothing he had ever seen there before.
''When you come to Mineral, if you blink, you went through the town,'' Mr. Leman said, laughing. ''We were excited that we just got our first traffic light. When people come here from out of town, people say there's nothing here.''
That is not literally true. There is the post office, the church, the water tower and the fire station. There are also a bunch of businesses along Main Street, including Mr. Leman's. The town has a ''D.M.V. Select'' office, which can provide license plates, transfer titles, and do everything else a full-fledged motor vehicle office can except issue drivers licenses. It is, a local official related proudly, the second-busiest such mini-office in the state.
''It's a pretty tough town; the mining and all,'' said Edwin Keller, 60, who grew up in Mineral, was mayor for 12 years and is also a former fire chief. ''But real friendly and good people.''
Mr. Keller sat in his home just off Main Street on Tuesday evening, fresh cracks running down his walls and pieces of his chimney sitting on his freshly cut lawn. .
The heyday of the shaft mining that made Mineral famous ended in the 1920s, Mr. Keller said, when strip mining in Louisiana began to provide a cheaper, faster supply of the same minerals.
Recently, the town has been affected by the sluggish economy. But last week, the town's elders broke ground for a new town office. And Mineral recently annexed a bit of property from surrounding Louisa County -- the better to attract commercial development.
Residents of Mineral trying to calm their nerves on Tuesday evening found it wasn't easy, as aftershocks continued to rock the town. Even as Mr. Keller was sitting in his den talking to a reporter, an aftershock hit, sending him and his guests scurrying for a doorway.
As he stood in the archway between his den and the hallway, he asked, ''How long do these things last?''
Geologists say aftershocks could continue for months.
Mineral's new fame is likely to last only 15 minutes.
But even as the aftershocks faded, folks were wringing their hands about another disaster on the horizon, this one coming from the southeast.
As of Wednesday, Hurricane Irene was forecast to strike the East Coast. Directly in one of its possible paths: Mineral, Va.

HEADLINE: Tax Measures to Confront French Debt Are Proposed

BYLINE: By SCOTT SAYARE and STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- With sluggish growth and the European debt crisis threatening to deepen France's budget deficit, the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday announced a wide-ranging series of tax measures intended to generate an extra 11 billion euros, about $15.9 billion, in revenues for 2012, an election year.
This year's budget is also expected to be bolstered by an additional $1.4 billion, Prime Minister Francois Fillon said at an evening news conference. 
Mindful of the downgrade of American debt this month and the troubles in other European economies, Mr. Sarkozy has said he is committed to hitting lower debt targets for the next three years in order to keep the confidence of the markets and maintain France's triple-A credit rating. But with French growth forecasts slipping -- Mr. Fillon announced newly reduced projections of 1.75 percent for 2011 and 2012 -- the government has been obliged to scramble to find alternative revenue sources.
''We have set ourselves on a trajectory,'' Mr. Fillon said. ''That trajectory commits us.''
The measures largely involve the closing of tax loopholes for larger corporations and the wealthy, some of whom will also face a small tax increase. Mr. Fillon also announced a partial reversal of a much-trumpeted 2007 reform exempting workers and employers from taxes on overtime pay. As one of Mr. Sarkozy's campaign promises -- part of the inspiration for the campaign slogan ''Work more to earn more'' -- the measure was designed to undermine the Socialist-passed 35-hour week.
The measures, which also include taxes on alcohol, tobacco and sugary drinks, were finalized at a last-minute cabinet meeting Wednesday. They will be debated by Parliament next month.
Hard times bring resentment, and even Mr. Sarkozy has felt the need to further tax the richest in France. The higher tax on the wealthy -- a 3 percent increase on total annual income and capital gains of more than $720,000, to remain on the books until the deficit dips to just 3 percent of gross domestic product -- is expected to bring in about $288 million annually. While that is not a major dent in the $15.9 billion Mr. Sarkozy is seeking to generate for the 2012 budget, it is likely to be welcomed by the public.
After a similar call by the American billionaire Warren E. Buffett, 16 of France's wealthiest people signed a petition urging the government to tax them more to in a period of austerity. Signatories to the petition, published this week in Le Nouvel Observateur, include the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt (who was questioned by the police last year about suspected tax evasion), the company's chief executive, Jean-Paul Agon, and the chief executive of Total, the energy company, Christophe de Margerie.
The group called for a ''special contribution'' in these difficult times but not a tax rate so high as to encourage the rich to quit France for overseas tax havens.
''We are conscious of having benefited from a French system and a European environment that we are attached to and which we hope to help maintain,'' said the petition.
The current French budget was written with optimistic growth forecasts of 2 percent for 2011 and 2.25 percent for 2012. But G.D.P. grew only 0.9 percent in the first quarter this year, and not at all in the second, meaning that tax receipts will be lower and debt will be a higher proportion of the smaller G.D.P.
With a fiscal deficit of 7.1 percent of G.D.P. in 2010, the government has pledged to reduce it to 5.7 percent this year and to 4.6 percent in 2012, before reaching 3 percent in 2013. With the measures announced Wednesday, Mr. Fillon said France might exceed its goal for next year, reaching a deficit level of 4.5 percent.
In recent weeks, Mr. Sarkozy has also pressed France and his European counterparts for a ''golden rule,'' a constitutional amendment that would require future governments to seek to reach a balanced budget within five years. That stance, along with Wednesday's tax measures, signal a shift in Mr. Sarkozy's fiscal policy, political analysts say.
Several of Mr. Sarkozy's emblematic policy stances have fallen victim to the economic downturn. In June, Mr. Sarkozy gave up on the ''fiscal shield'' he had championed, a rule ensuring that French taxpayers paid no more than 50 percent of their earnings to the state. Fiscal prudence and a firm and steady hand may prove a winning approach for 2012, Mr. Sarkozy has concluded, and he has already sought to cast his Socialist opponents as irresponsible spendthrifts.
They have countered by noting that Mr. Sarkozy's calls for sober spending and national belt-tightening are hardly longstanding positions. Arnaud Montebourg, a Socialist lawmaker and a candidate in the presidential primaries, has called the French deficit ''the bastard child of the right, a mixture of ideological choices and payoffs for its electoral clients.'' Such complaints are widespread among the opposition and much of the electorate, where Mr. Sarkozy's approval ratings have lately hit historic lows.
In an op-ed article Wednesday in Le Monde, Jerome Cahuzac, the Socialist president of the finance committee at the National Assembly, cast Mr. Sarkozy's call for a ''golden rule'' as purely political. Since Mr. Sarkozy became president in 2007, the government has created more than $28 billion in additional tax exemptions, Mr. Cahuzac wrote, saying, ''The authorities of the country ought, urgently, to cease playing with our collective destiny in the hopes of saving their own.''

HEADLINE: Romney Stands By Corporations Remarks

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts stirred a bit of a tempest when he said on the campaign trail in Iowa that ''corporations are people, my friend.'' Some called the remark tone deaf, saying it fed into the perception of him as an out-of-touch millionaire. 
But on the campaign trail Wednesday in Keene, N.H., Mr. Romney showed no signs of distancing himself from the remarks.
''I made the point the other day,'' he said at a town-hall-style meeting, voluntarily alluding to his earlier remarks in response to a question about what he would do to fix the economy. ''Corporations, they're made up of people. They're just groups of people who come together for work.''
He explained: ''And when you say tax corporations, the steel and the vinyl and the concrete, those things don't pay taxes. Only people do. So high taxes on corporations is high taxes on people, and people are going to go places where taxes aren't too high.''
Mr. Romney also defended the health care plan he pushed forward as governor of Massachusetts, saying, ''I'm not going to back away from the fact that I signed that bill.''
He was responding to what was apologetically prefaced as ''a difficult question,'' when an audience member stood to ask, ''A lot of people like myself are wavering on the sidelines, saying, 'I'd like to vote for you, but if you do MassHealth care, what's to stop you from doing that when you're the president?' ''
Mr. Romney said that the Massachusetts plan was the correct decision for his state, and he pledged to fight efforts to carry out that new federal law if elected president. ASHLEY PARKER

HEADLINE: North Korea Is Said to Weigh Nuclear Test Moratorium

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS and CHOE SANG-HUN; Seth Mydans reported from Moscow, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has agreed to consider a moratorium on nuclear weapons tests and production, and said he would return to stalled six-party talks on the nation's nuclear program, the Russian presidential press secretary told the Russian news media on Wednesday.
Mr. Kim made the agreement at a meeting with President Dmitri A. Medvedev in the southern Siberian city of Ulan Ude, where he is stopping on a weeklong trip in his armored train. 
''They confirmed their willingness to go back to the negotiations without preconditions,'' the press secretary, Natalya Timakova, said after the meeting.
''In the course of the talks, North Korea will be ready to resolve the question of imposing a moratorium on tests and production of nuclear missile weapons,'' she was quoted as saying.
Washington and Seoul have demanded that North Korea announce such a moratorium before, not after, six-party talks begin. Still, Mr. Kim's reported comment offered another sign that his government wanted to return to the nuclear disbarment talks.
The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported early Thursday that Mr. Kim and Mr. Medvedev had agreed that the talks should be reconvened ''without preconditions'' and strive to achieve the ''denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula,'' based on the principle of ''simultaneous actions,'' according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. There was no mention of a moratorium.
North Korea has often said that talks should proceed without preconditions, while the United States and South Korea have demanded that the North first show its sincerity by meeting past nuclear commitments that have gone unfulfilled.
In Washington, the State Department reacted cautiously and skeptically. ''If in fact they are now willing to refrain from nuclear test and missile launches, this would be welcome, but it would be insufficient,'' a spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said, citing previous violations of agreements and statements. ''Their disclosure last November of uranium enrichment facilities remains a matter of serious concern to us, and these activities are a clear violation of their obligations'' under United Nations resolutions.
Talks on the nuclear issue, involving a promise of aid in return for an end to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, have been stalled for more than two years. The talks include South Korea, China, Japan and the United States as well as Russia and North Korea.
''Russia has consistently advocated a peaceful, political and diplomatic solution to this problem, for the restoration of dialogue and cooperation between North and South Korea,'' the Kremlin said in a statement.
Mr. Medvedev said on television that progress had also been made on a Russian proposal to build a natural gas pipeline to South Korea that would pass though North Korean territory.
''As regards the gas cooperation, there are results,'' he said. ''We have directed our ministries to set up an ad hoc commission to determine the specific parameters of bilateral cooperation on gas transit via North Korea and, therefore, to get the Republic of Korea to join this project,'' Mr. Medvedev said.
After raising tensions with armed provocations against South Korea, Mr. Kim has recently begun reaching out again, visiting China in May and sending his diplomats to meet with South Korean and American diplomats in July to discuss a resumption of six-nation talks.
But hostilities continue, with an exchange of artillery fire between the North and South this month, and a threat from the North to auction off South Korean-owned hotels, restaurants and other remnants of a mountain resort that used to be a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation.
The six-party talks began in 2003 with an aim of persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program for economic and diplomatic benefits. They ended abruptly in 2008. Since then, North Korea has detonated a nuclear device, tested a long-range rocket that may one day be able to carry nuclear warheads and revealed an industrial-scale uranium enrichment plant.
For Washington and Seoul, the revelation of the North's uranium enrichment program added urgency to resume the talks. It showed North Korea was pursuing a second route to build and perhaps proliferate nuclear weapons in addition to its existing plutonium-based weapons. In recent meetings with the North Korean diplomats, American and South Korean officials tried to gauge whether North Korea was serious about living up to past commitments to nuclear disarmament agreements.
''Pre-steps'' that Washington and Seoul want North Korea to take before the resumption of talks have included freezing all its nuclear activities and allowing United Nations nuclear inspectors to verify it. The stance reflects a deep suspicion that North Korea has sought talks simply to extract badly needed economic aid and to buy time to build a nuclear arsenal. North Korea resisted the demands, most recently in separate meetings in July with South Korea's chief nuclear negotiator and with the special American envoy on North Korean affairs.

HEADLINE: Unsavory Culinary Elitism

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.; Gail Collins is on book leave.

 BODY:
Anthony Bourdain, the part-time chef and full-time celebrity, has a tongue on him. It's the sharpest knife in his set. He has used it to carve up vegans, whom he called the ''Hezbollah-like splinter faction'' of vegetarians, and the culinary moralist Alice Waters, whose rigidity is ''very Khmer Rouge.''
The latest to be slashed: Paula Deen. For the uninitiated, she's the deep-fried doyenne of a fatty, buttery subgenre of putatively Southern cooking. And Bourdain, in an interview with TV Guide published last week, branded her an outright menace to America, scolding her for ''telling an already obese nation that it's O.K. to eat food that is killing us.'' 
To this he added a gratuitous schoolyard-crass putdown of Deen cuisine.
Which certainly isn't my cup of lard. But it bothers me no more than his ill-timed elitism, which Deen nailed in her response.
''Not everybody can afford to pay $58 for prime rib or $650 for a bottle of wine,'' she told The New York Post. ''My friends and I cook for regular families who worry about feeding their kids and paying the bills.''
Put aside her one-with-the-masses pose, ludicrous in light of the millions she has made from television shows, cookbooks, cookware, mattresses and more. She's otherwise 100 percent justified in assailing the culinary aristocracy, to which even a self-styled bad boy like Bourdain belongs, for an often selective, judgmental and unforgiving worldview.
And her retort exposes class tensions in the food world that sadly mirror those in society at large. You can almost imagine Bourdain and Deen as political candidates, a blue-state paternalist squaring off against a red-state populist over correct living versus liberty in all its artery-clogging, self-destructive glory.
To give him his due: we are too fat and must address that. But getting Deen to unplug the waffle iron doesn't strike to the core of the problem any more than posting fast-food calorie counts or taxing soft drinks do. A great deal of American obesity is attributable to the dearth of healthy food that's affordable and convenient in low- and even middle-income neighborhoods, and changing that requires a magnitude of public intervention and private munificence that are unlikely in such pinched times.
On some level, Bourdain gets this, or used to. When he denigrated Waters, he did so -- rightly -- because of what he deemed her fantasy that recession-era Americans would ''start buying expensive organic food and running to the green market.''
Some of Deen's fans have the means for mesclun. They're not consigned to overloads of animal fat; they elect it. But then so do plenty of New York gourmands who favor pate and duck confit, both on the menu at Bourdain's Brasserie Les Halles restaurant in Manhattan.
When Deen fries a chicken, many of us balk. When the Manhattan chefs David Chang or Andrew Carmellini do, we grovel for reservations and swoon over the homey exhilaration of it all. Her strips of bacon, skirting pancakes, represent heedless gluttony. Chang's dominoes of pork belly, swaddled in an Asian bun, signify high art.
There's some class-inflected hypocrisy in the food world, where the center seems to be ceding territory to two wings: the self-appointed sophisticates and the supposed rubes. And the latter -- represented by Deen and other objects of Bourdain's ire, including Rachael Ray and Sandra Lee -- have come on strong over the last few years.
They're champions of downscale cooking that's usually more affordable and easier to master, and they're the most luminous stars of the expanding Food Network, whose 3-year-old publishing offshoot, the Food Network Magazine, recently announced a projected circulation increase to 1.4 million copies. That would put it just 100,000 copies behind the more establishment-approved Bon Appetit.
The establishment's former darling, Gourmet, died in 2009. What just recently sprouted in its place is an even more rarefied journal, Lucky Peach, a literary quarterly that costs $10 an issue. Its first one showcased an interview with Bourdain about culinary mediocrity.
I prefer it to Food Network Magazine. And I prefer his TV show, ''No Reservations,'' a summons to eat adventurously around the world, to any of Deen's.
But these preferences reflect privileges and don't entitle me, Bourdain or anyone else who trots the globe and visits ambitious restaurants -- the most casual of which can cost $50 a person and entail hourlong waits -- to look down on food lovers without the resources, opportunity or inclination for that.
Besides, treating Deen, Lee & Co. with anything that smacks of moralizing and snobbery isn't likely to move them or their audience toward healthier eating. It's apt to cook up resentment. And we've got enough ill will and polarization in our politics. Let's not set a place for them at the table.

HEADLINE: Making Every Raindrop Count

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
WITH 70 days of 100-plus temperatures so far and no rain in sight, Austin is in the grip of its worst one-year drought on record. And gardeners are quickly finding out which plants can survive brutal heat and drought.
Native trees like cedar elms and hackberries are dropping their leaves. Ash junipers in the Hill Country are dying. Shallow-rooted azaleas and crape myrtles are toast, and most lawns are brown, except for those watered by private wells.
Animals are suffering, too. Coyotes and rabbits are showing up in city gardens in search of water and food. Hummingbirds can't find nectar because many plants aren't flowering.
The first week of August, when daily temperatures climbed to 107 or so, a bison escaped from a ranch in Manchaca, on the southwest side of the city, and wandered into the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center seven miles away, where it spent several days grazing in the savanna grasslands. 
Gardeners are embracing those prairie grasses with equal enthusiasm because of their heat and drought tolerance. These natives can be found in many of the city's lawns, ornamental gardens and even green roofs. Remarkably, these deep-rooted plants can adjust to shallow soils, helping to cool houses and absorb rain -- when there is some.
''If we get a rain, these grasses will all turn green,'' said Lars Stanley, 59, an architect and metal artist, standing on a roof planted with natives that covers the studio he built in East Austin with his wife, Lauren Woodward Stanley, 45, an architect. ''It reduces our cooling level immensely.''
The grasses (blue grama, curly mesquite, little bluestem and sideoats grama) go dormant in a drought, a survival strategy that keeps their roots alive. But the prickly pear and Texas sedum the Stanleys planted, succulents that store water in their fleshy pads, looked remarkably fine.
A plain black-tar roof can heat up to 170 to 200 degrees, Mr. Stanley noted.
The plants on this roof, rooted in five inches of a stony mix that includes crushed decomposed granite, perlite, lava rock, rice hulls and a dash of compost teeming with micro-organisms, ''should knock that temperature down 100 degrees,'' he said.
''But they have to be green and evapo-transpiring to do that,'' Ms. Stanley added. ''We're not going to water them in the midst of a drought.''
With its reservoirs half-empty and tributaries down to a trickle, the city is rationing water. And the Austin Water Utility is offering rebates of up to $5,000 for installing residential rainwater collection systems.
When it does rain here, it tends to pour, sheeting across hard surfaces and dry lawns to storm sewers. So the more rain that is channeled into tanks or slowed by porous driveways and terraced gardens, the better for the land, as well as the water table, because plants will filter pollutants before sending water on to underground springs and tributaries to the Colorado River.
On the roof over the Stanleys' studio, rainwater is channeled down a wide gutter that feeds into one of four 1,500-gallon tanks on the two-acre property. ''We use the condensate from our air-conditioning also,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''It fills up a five-gallon bucket every two days, which adds to the tank.''
Other designers, like Christine Ten Eyck, a landscape architect, are replacing asphalt driveways and other hard surfaces with permeable ones, like gravel or crushed granite, and replacing lawn with terraced beds filled with plants that not only can take heat and drought but also absorb and hold water.
''I've done it passively, instead of actively with a cistern,'' said Ms. Ten Eyck, 52, standing by the live oaks in front of the 1950s bungalow in West Austin that she shares with her husband, Gary Deaver, 65. ''The whole idea was to slow the rainwater down, because we're about eight feet higher than the street.''
In place of her old driveway and flagstone paving, crushed decomposed granite planted with small blue-green agaves now surrounds the oaks, allowing air and water to reach tree roots. Ms. Ten Eyck also replaced the lawn with natives, including groves of Texas persimmon trees and drifts of Mexican feather grass billowing over Berkeley sedge, mounds of tall joe-pye weed and clumps of Mexican orchid tree, all stepped down the slope.
Giant blue agaves (Agave franzosinii) as big as economy cars greet visitors walking through the front gate. These Mexican natives love the heat, and they don't need any water.
ON the east side of the city, the same native plants that fill the Stanleys' green roof are sending down much deeper roots in the Mueller Prairie, a restored 30-acre fragment of the Texas Blackland Prairie, which once sprawled across 15 million acres.
Mark Simmons, a restoration ecologist who orchestrated the seed mix and plantings here, calls it ''one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America,'' because ''there are a few thousand acres, or one-tenth of 1 percent left.''
Mr. Simmons, 50, is the director of the Ecosystem Design Group at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at the University of Texas and is working with RVi, a design and landscape architecture firm here, to bring part of this prairie back to life.
The native grasses, he said, can sequester more carbon than trees: ''As the roots die, that organic carbon gets locked up in the soil and can stay tens of thousand of years -- a lot longer than the lifetime of a tree trunk, which falls down and rots, releasing carbon into the air.''
Once buried under the Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, the land is now one of the public parks in a huge 700-acre mixed-use project being built downtown by the Catellus Development Corporation.
Other projects Mr. Simmons is working on include advising people like the Stanleys on how to use native plants on a green roof, and developing a native turf grass that doesn't have to be watered or mowed, thus saving energy and reducing the production of greenhouse gases.
''You can have a nice green lawn if you water every two weeks,'' he said. ''But if you don't water, it goes dormant and turns brown. It's not the end of the world.''
Mr. Simmons, who grew up in Cornwall with a lush English lawn, recalls all the time he spent playing behind the verdant hedge. ''Why would you want to take that away?'' he said. Particularly when there are already ''40 million acres of lawn in this country.''
Instead of trying to persuade Americans to rip up their lawns and grow vegetables, Mr. Simmons is proposing a radically different kind of ground cover: a mix of seven native species, including buffalo grass, blue grama, Texas grama and curly mesquite.
Because each grass has different needs and habits, it fills a particular ecological niche, and the right matrix of plants keeps diseases from spreading and shuts out weeds, so pesticides are rarely necessary. Native grass also has roots that go down 30 feet, finding water when there is none to be had aboveground.
He isn't content with just revolutionizing turf grass, though. He's out to change our very perceptions of what makes an appealing landscape.
''We have this expectation, left over from the Victorian era, that everything has to be green,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''But we have savannas here, dark evergreen trees and grass like Africa that turns brown in the dry season. That's the nature of plants.''
The Mueller prairie was brown -- even crispy -- that August morning, as Mr. Simmons recalled its rebirth from a parking lot at the old airport.
''When we lifted up the hardscaping in 2008, the rich Blackland clay soil was still there,'' he said. ''So we stockpiled it while we sculpted the land.''
The compacted soil had to be ripped up, tilled 20 inches down and graded so that the land sloped away from the new houses built across the street to a catchment pond in the middle of the greenway, where storm water is cleansed by native cattails, mallows and other wetland species. The stockpiled prairie soil was then spread over the graded land, with a layer of low-nutrient compost (these plants don't need extra nitrogen) to encourage germination. Finally, dozens of species of native grasses and wildflowers were hydro-seeded across the plain.
Early pioneer species, like sideoats grama and green sprangletop, began sprouting, enriching the soil and providing a bit of shade for later species, like Indiangrass and big bluestem. But it was a slow, scruffy process, and residents in the new community began to complain.
''People were asking: 'What are all these weeds? Why aren't we mowing?' '' Mr. Simmons said. So he started giving talks to the community, and his team gave tours and handed out educational material.
''Six months later, when we decided to mow, to make the wildflowers show up better in the spring, we got all these calls saying, 'Why are you mowing down our prairie?' '' he said.
Bird populations have increased, as grasses and trees provide food and shelter.
''We have a lot of ducks on the pond,'' said Janelle Dozier, 58, who moved here with her husband, Don, 64, in 2008. ''In the evening, purple martins like to fly over it and catch the bugs.''
Ms. Dozier helped start the Friends of the Prairie, a group of about 70 volunteers who help weed and maintain the area. Such interaction of people and prairie is crucial, Mr. Simmons said.
''Restoring a prairie isn't just 'Design a landscape and presto, you've got it,' '' he said. ''It's a long trajectory, and you need people to help guide it along, which isn't a bad thing, because then they value it.''
Earlier this week, as days with triple-digit temperatures added up to Austin's hottest summer on record, Mr. Simmons took a measured but optimistic view.
''It's likely that this is going to happen again. Hot summers aren't ever going to leave us,'' he said. ''But if we just search in our local flora for the right plants, we can create drought-resistant, regenerative landscapes.''
Regenerative seems to have replaced sustainable as the new buzzword.
''It means landscapes that give back,'' he said. ''Which is what green roofs and prairies do.''

HEADLINE: FoodCorps Service Members Speak

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Members of the first class of FoodCorps write down a few of their thoughts to mark the beginning of their new enterprise.

 BODY:
I asked some members of the first class of FoodCorps to write down a few of their thoughts in the beginning of their new enterprise. (Here's the column I wrote about FoodCorps.) Pretty inspiring.
Jessica Polledri
Home State: Oregon
Serving In: Portland, Ore.
Age: 25
The best part about orientation? Hanging out with an entire army of people who get excited about eggplants--and teaching kids how to grow them.
Kirsten Gerbatsch
Home State: New Jersey
Serving In: Traverse City, Mich.
Age: 22
The national FoodCorps orientation in Milwaukee was unlike anything I had ever experienced. As the first day and the rest of the week unfolded, I came to realize that I was among a very powerful, impassioned and selfless group of men and women.
Sarah Rubin
Home State: Arizona
Serving In: Gloucester, Mass.
Age: 24
I found myself wondering whether someday the young people we work with will be sharing a meal and discussing how their own interest in good food was ignited by the FoodCorps members who urged them to "get their hands dirty."
Sebastian Naskaris
Home State: New York
Serving In: Moore County, N.C.
Age: 27
The hours were long, we were scared as hell about the challenge that faced us, and as the week passed we realized something awe-inspiring--we'd found each other.
Corbin Lichtinger
Home State: Ohio
Serving In: Lewiston, Me.
Age: 22
I'm moving from a rusted city to a rusted city. Childhood obesity is very visible in these rusted economies, and so I began to accept it as commonplace. FoodCorps, however, is making me realize that this isn't how it has to be.
Daniel Schultz
Home State: Wisconsin
Serving In: Des Moines, Iowa
Age: 23
I would like to use my time with FoodCorps to help spare children from going through the dilemma of obesity that I personally had to overcome. I would like to help shift the eating habits of the local Des Moines area school district one garden and bite at a time.
Stephanie Lip
Home State: New York
Serving In: Sells, Ariz.
Age: 21
The three pillars of FoodCorps--education about nutrition and food, engagement through building and tending school gardens and access to local ingredients for school lunch--were exactly the fields I hoped to work in when I (a culinary arts and nutrition graduate) thought about making the switch from foodservice to public health.
Marlene Yanez
Home State: Texas
Serving In: Anthony, N.M.
Age: 25
I know the year ahead will bring great challenges, but I expect to be able to make a tangible difference through the school garden in the lives of the people I will serve. If nothing less, I expect to create a lot of healthy, happy people!
Kathleen Yetman
Home State: Arizona
Serving In: Whiteriver, Ariz.
Age: 26
What struck me was the caliber of everyone at the FoodCorps Orientation. We were there because we all share a love and passion for social justice, education and healthy food, but what really inspired me was the energy carrying us all. I have never been in a room with so many wholehearted, graceful people who are willing to make themselves vulnerable.
Graham Downey
Home State: Virginia
Serving In: Flowood, Miss.
Age: 22
These FoodCorps people are kind, goofy, intelligent, practical and determined; their wonderfulness made training one of the most inspiring and energizing weeks ever. I am so looking forward to this year because I think their kindness, determination, and goofiness provides a powerful base for intelligent and practical change.
Joshua Kanter
Home State: California
Serving In: Gallup, N.M.
Age: 23
The fifty of us on FoodCorps's maiden voyage made fast friends. There was that same eagerness to find friends when I first arrived at university, though the common denominator this time was not nervousness but a love of health. In a few days' time I set off for Gallup, New Mexico, to serve my year of FoodCorps with incredible optimism.
Emily Ritchie
Home State: Oregon
Serving In: Tillamook, Ore.
Age: 22
I am excited, pumped, thrilled, to begin my year as a FoodCorps member. I expect this year will be immensely difficult, but I hope to personally grow in multiple ways this year, learning about myself, about my community, about children and their eating habits, and learning about things I can't even imagine. Here goes!
Rachel Spencer
Home State: Georgia
Serving In: Marshall, Ariz.
Age: 21
Listening to my peers and leaders speak at orientation was nothing short of inspiring. Our trainers emphasized the value of building relationships. The camaraderie we developed over the week leaves me resolutely hopeful that together we, along with so many other grassroots efforts across the nation, can repair the relationships we have with food, land and each other.
Dana Stevens
Home State: Massachusetts
Serving In: Machias, Me.
Age: 26
FoodCorps is the future! We are gathering in ten states now with amazing support from organizations, individuals and existing projects. Our job this year is to make the connections between these entities, materials, energy and social capital to help create environmentally, economically and physically sustainable food systems for our nation's children.
Leah Chapman
Home State: Florida
Serving In: Decorah, Iowa
Age: 21
I am indescribably grateful that I have been given an opportunity to turn my passions into a reality. FoodCorps will hopefully solidify and spur the creation of hundreds of existing and new organizations and programs that address issues of food security, food sustainability and nutrition in the United States.

HEADLINE: The Bush Tax Cuts and the Deficit

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at how much extending current tax cuts, repealing a Medicare payment cut and other policies would expand the deficit over the next decade, from the Congressional Budget Office.

 BODY:
How much do the Bush tax cuts and the alternative minimum tax patch widen the deficit? Take a look at the lightest blue bars below:
That chart comes from the Congressional Budget Office's latest report, released Wednesday, on the budget and the economic outlook.
The office is legally required to provide estimates for the budget under current law; this is known as the forecast "baseline." Every year, though, Congress reliably makes changes to current law -- changes that increase the deficit -- just in the nick of time. This bar chart is intended to illustrate exactly how big those last-minute changes are, lest onlookers be tempted to ignore them.
The lightest blue bars, labeled "Extend Tax Policies," represent an estimate of how the deficit will grow if Congress extends the Bush tax cuts and indexes the alternative minimum tax for inflation, as legislators are expected to do once again. As you can see, these moves alone more than double the size of the deficit for most of the years shown.
Just above this are much darker blue bars, labeled "Maintain Medicare's Payment Rates for Physicians." These represent the expectation that Congress will continue to nullify their own requirements to cut Medicare payments for doctors. The law says that Medicare's payment rates for physicians' services will fall by 30 percent at the end of 2011, but given Washington's record on this "doc fix," few expect that cut to be allowed to happen.
"Additional Debt Service" -- the aqua strips at the top -- refers to the interest payments the government will have to pay because it will need to borrow more money to account for the greater budget shortfall caused by continuing these tax and Medicare policies.

HEADLINE: Agencies Get Ready for Some (Fantasy) Football

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The National Football League will capitalize again on the interest in professional football among the employees of leading media agencies by hosting a fantasy draft event on Thursday night.

 BODY:
Fantasy football is an increasingly popular pursuit among Americans who seem, as the song goes, "ready for some football" practically all the time.
For the last several years, the National Football League has been capitalizing on that interest among the employees of leading media agencies by hosting a fantasy draft event before the start of the N.F.L. season.
The sixth annual fantasy draft is to take place on Thursday night at the ballroom of the Edison Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. More than 250 media buyers and planners, along with other guests, are expected.
The attendees work at 16 media agencies, among them Carat, Horizon Media, Initiative, MediaVest, Mindshare, MPG, OMD, PHD, TargetCast TCM, Universal McCann and Zenith. The agencies work for almost all of the 22 national sponsors of the National Football League's season.
The performance of each agency's dream team on the fantasy section of nfl.com is tracked throughout the season and a winner is selected by the league from among those agencies taking part. The winning agency earns an invitation to play in a flag football game in Central Park with the N.F.L. media sales team and former league players.
There is a purpose to the annual event apart from fun with games.
The evening gives the N.F.L. a chance to forge closer ties with the people facing the league across the negotiating table as the N.F.L. sells commercial time and ad space on and in its media properties like the NFL Network and nfl.com.
In fact, the league bills the event as the final upfront of the year, a reference to the elaborate upfront presentations that broadcast networks and cable channels put on each year for media agencies and advertisers.
The event is also meant as a curtain-raiser for the process of buying commercial time during the important fourth quarter of the year. Buying spots when the season is under way, rather than ahead of time in the upfront market, is called the scatter market.
"It's a great opportunity to get in front of these buyers and planners" so "we're top of mind when that money's being spent," said David Pattillo, vice president for media sales at the N.F.L. in New York.
Although the recent lockout of players by owners had raised some concerns about how interested advertisers would be in the 2011-12 professional football season, the league's results in the upfront market "did not miss a beat," Mr. Pattillo said.
(It also helped that the settlement of the lockout came early enough that the season will start on time.)
As for any possible qualms among advertisers and agencies generated by the recent hiccups in the economy and the stock market, "time will tell," Mr. Pattillo said, but so far "I haven't heard any reluctancy."
To the contrary, the league is seeing one category, movie advertising, "really pick up," he added.

HEADLINE: Charles Schwab Sues Banks Over Rate Manipulation

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The brokerage Charles Schwab has sued 11 major banks, claiming they conspired to manipulate a borrowing benchmark used to set interest rates.

 BODY:
Charles Schwab, the brokerage and investment manager, has sued 11 major banks, claiming they conspired to manipulate a borrowing benchmark used to set interest rates.
In a pair of lawsuits filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the firm accused the banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup, of colluding to depress the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. That conspiracy, the suits allege, allowed the banks to artificially deflate the numbers used to calculate the benchmark, thereby throwing off interest rates for Libor-based securities and depriving investors of the returns they would have earned had the numbers been accurate.
In one suit, Charles Schwab alleges that the banks "reaped hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in ill-gotten gains." The firm also alleges that by falsely depressing their borrowing costs, the banks "provided a false or misleading impression of their financial strength to investors" during the financial crisis of 2008.
Charles Schwab is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from the banks. Other defendants include foreign banks such as Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Lloyds, WestLB, and UBS. 
Regulators reportedly began looking into the Libor manipulation issue after questions arose over whether the banks had provided correct numbers to the British Bankers Association, the authority that sets the benchmark in conjunction with Thomson Reuters. Those reported numbers, which are based on the rates at which banks can borrow from each other, are in turn used to calculate interest rates on many types of investments. In the suit, Charles Schwab alleges that the Libor rates tended to cluster around the fourth-largest reported borrowing rate, which it says showed that the banks were acting in concert.
Earlier this year, a West Virginia pension fund sued three banks for Libor manipulation. That suit followed several by European asset-management firms over the same issue. UBS, the Swiss bank that first disclosed the probe in its annual statement, has since said it has been granted partial immunity in the investigation.
JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the Schwab suit. A Bank of America representative was not immediately available. A Citigroup spokeswoman, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, said the bank believed the suits were "without merit."
Charles Schwab is being represented in the suits by the law firm of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein.

HEADLINE: Ex-Lehman Officials to Pay $90 Million to Settle Suit

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Lehman executives and directors are accused a shareholder lawsuit of misleading investors about the investment bank's health in the months leading up to its collapse.

 BODY:
Former officials of Lehman Brothers, including Richard S. Fuld Jr., its former chief executive, have agreed to pay $90 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit that accused them of misleading investors about the investment bank's health in the months leading up to its collapse.
In a court filing on Thursday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, 13 Lehman executives and directors asked a judge to release insurance proceeds that would pay for the settlement.
The potential settlement, which would be the largest to date of a lawsuit against Lehman's top officials, would not affect the status of any outstanding government investigations of the company and its management.
Three years ago next month, Lehman Brothers filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy in history, an event that helped set off the global financial crisis. The company has been protected from litigation since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
But investors filed several lawsuits against former Lehman officials, including one filed by a group of pension funds that asked for billions of dollars in damages, accusing the bank's senior executives and directors of lying about its financial state.
The pension fund lawsuit contends that Mr. Fuld; Erin Callan, the bank's former chief financial officer, and others "concealed the true extent of the company's exposure to subprime-related assets and financial positions, and materially misled the investing public."
If the bankruptcy judge agrees with the Lehman officials' request and releases the insurance proceeds to settle this lawsuit, Mr. Fuld and his former colleagues will not have to bear any personal expense in resolving the case. They would also neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
Lawyers say it is common for insurance proceeds to cover corporate directors and officers in shareholders' lawsuits.
"It is unusual for individual executives to pay out of their own pockets," said Kevin Lacroix, a lawyer and author of the D&O Diary blog. "Companies buy insurance for exactly a situation like this where it is insolvent and cannot indemnify their directors and officers."
Only in rare instances do directors and officers have to make out-of-pocket payments in shareholders' suits. In 2005, former Worldcom directors paid about $25 million of their own money to resolve a lawsuit with the company's investors. Enron directors also paid roughly $13 million to settle shareholders' claims.
In those cases, the companies' insurance policies did not cover the cost of the settlement. In the case of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank's policies are valued at a total of $250 million, according to the court filing.
Other litigants are scrambling to settle cases with Lehman before the company's insurance coffers are empty.
The former Lehman officers have has also asked the bankruptcy court to release $8.25 million in insurance proceeds to settle a separate claim by the state of New Jersey against Mr. Fuld and his former colleagues.

HEADLINE: More Transparent Bank Stress Tests Are Needed

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Tests to date have gone too easy on banks and leave major risks in the financial system, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Europe and the United States both need to conduct another round of stress tests on their banks, with a model similar to what was done in the United States in 2009, but with a more negative downside scenario -- in particular, assessing the effects of a major sovereign debt problem in the euro zone.
The point of such a scenario is to determine how much equity financing banks need to have if the world economy turns ugly. If the big banks raise more capital in advance, we are less likely to see economic downturn again become financial catastrophe.
The prevailing wisdom about Europe is that it faces primarily liquidity problems. In this view, a few of the larger countries have had trouble rolling over their debts, and some leading banks need help with short-term financing. The European Central Bank can assist with both by buying government bonds and lending to banks and, in the most optimistic interpretation, the consequent political discussions will help strengthen European Union integration.
There are two problems with this positive spin on recent events. The first is that sovereign debt problems can easily become solvency issues -- that is, more about whether countries can afford to service their debts rather than whether they can raise enough cash at reasonable rates in any given week. The key issue is growth -- if Italy, Spain and others can show they will grow reasonably quickly, then debt relative to gross domestic product will decline, and rosy projections will be back in fashion.

But if signs of growth do not return soon, perhaps over three to six months, the next downward revision to forecasts will spread deeper debt pessimism. And any markdown for global growth prospects, including for reasons outside Europe's control (such as overheating in China's residential property market), would also not be helpful over the coming year. My Peterson Institute policy paper with Peter Boone in July suggested some potential escape routes, but the summer so far has produced only further attempts to muddle through. 
The more immediate Achilles heel is banking. The virtues of big European banks were extolled by some Congressional representatives during the Dodd-Frank legislation in spring 2010. What a difference a year makes; not many members of Congress would today endorse anything about European banking, given all the problems that have emerged.
The main immediate problem for Europe is that we still don't know exactly the condition of its major financial institutions. The Europeans have run bank stress tests twice recently, in mid-2010 and again earlier this year. But in both cases the tests were far too lenient and banks were not required to raise enough capital. 
They should have been compelled to increase their equity funding relative to their debt, in order to create a greater buffer against future losses.
The 2009 banking stress tests in the United States can also be criticized for not including a scenario that was sufficiently negative. In recent weeks the market has expressed great skepticism about Bank of America, its inherited liabilities, future business model and, most of all, the adequacy of its capital. 
Most likely, Bank of America needs to be broken up, with the continuing businesses funded with equity to a level that could withstand adverse legal outcomes and a deep recession. Warren Buffett's investment in the bank, announced this morning, may be in a step in the right direction. (For more background on how to think about bank equity, see the recent testimony of Paul Pfleiderer to the financial institutions subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee; anyone working on banking policy in Europe or the United States should read this.)
Dodd-Frank created pre-emptive intervention powers, at the behest of Treasury and the Federal Reserve, with part of the rationale being that these could be used to prevent a megabank's slow death spiral from becoming a market panic. 
In "13 Bankers," James Kwak and I expressed considerable skepticism that this could work -- it just does not fit with the history and politics of regulation in the United States, within which even the Treasury secretary defers to what Bloomberg News calls the "Wall Street Aristocracy."
The American 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, known as SCap (pronounced ESS-cap), was designed to reveal potential stressed capital levels and, as a result, the 19 companies covered by SCap have since increased their common equity by more than $300 billion. 
Unfortunately, weakness at Bank of America generates systemic risk, undermines overall market confidence and magnifies the risk of another recession; this is exactly what SCap is supposed to have avoided -- but failed to do because it was not sufficiently tough.
The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress tests, known as CCar (pronounced SEE-car), concluded in April 2011, were even less helpful. These were much less transparent, focused more on companies' internal capital planning processes. The Fed did sensitivity analysis of the companies' own stress tests; this is not exactly reassuring, given how badly the industry's own models have failed in the recent past -- including in the events that led up to the Fed's $1.2 trillion of emergency loans in 2008. 
Yet the European stress tests to date must be rated a notch or three below even the CCar in terms of transparency and communication of information that allows market participants to make informed decisions. The latest round, conducted by the European Banking Authority through July 15, did not even examine what would happen if a sovereign borrower had to restructure its debts -- exactly what Greece was working on during the same time frame. (To be precise, there was some "sovereign stress" in the tests but very little compared with what we have seen and could see.)
This is worse than embarrassing. It creates exactly the wrong kind of uncertainty around European megabanks, including their operations in the United States and potential spillover effects.
In part this happened because the European Banking Authority is new -- it came into existence on Jan. 1 -- and not sufficiently powerful relative to national bank supervisors, many of whom are stuck in an old mindset where transparency is bad and full disclosure of banks' balance sheets is scary. (The low capital levels of European banks was described more fully this week in a Bloomberg article.) 
But partial facts and distorted information flow are exactly what creates fear and instability, not just in Europe but much more broadly.
If euro-zone leaders want to make any progress on governance reform, they should immediately strengthen the banking authority and call for a new round of stress tests. These tests should include a deep recession scenario in Europe, as well as disruptions to sovereign debt financing. At the same time, the Federal Reserve should acknowledge that the CCar was not enough; it's time for a new round of tough stress tests here, as well.
The notion that bank equity is socially expensive and should be minimized is an idea whose time has passed -- as Anat Admati, Peter DeMarzo, Martin Hellwig and Professor Pfleiderer have argued. It is time to find ways to strengthen the equity funding of major financial institutions around the world, quickly, fairly and effectively -- a point that was made clear in the recent hearings held by Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.
Any further delay risks worsening the global slowdown.

HEADLINE: An Insurance Maze for U.S. Doctors

BYLINE: PAULINE W. CHEN, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: American doctors spent more than $80,000 per year per physician dealing with insurance and payment issues, or roughly four times as much as their counterparts in Canada, according to a recent report. 

 BODY:
A former colleague from Canada who practiced medicine with me here in the States never hesitated to make one thing clear to me: He couldn't wait to get back.
It wasn't the cultural life that he missed, nor was it the ex-girlfriend I always suspected he pined for. It was the medicine.
"It's different," he would say wistfully, without elaborating. "Practicing medicine is just different over there."
A study published this month in the journal Health Affairs made me think of my colleague again and offered one likely possibility for his return to Canada: There, he had more time to focus on his patients.
Researchers asked hundreds of physicians and administrators in private practices across the United States and Canada how much time they spent each day with insurers and other third-party payers, tracking down information for claims that were denied or incorrectly paid, resolving questions about insurance coverage for prescription drugs or diagnostic tests, and filing the different forms required by each and every insurance company.
Physicians in Canada, where health care is administered mainly by the government, did spend a good deal of time and money communicating with their payers. But American doctors in the study spent far more dealing with multiple health plans: more than $80,000 per year per physician, or roughly four times as much as their northern counterparts. And their offices spent as many as 21 hours per week with payers, nearly 10 times as much as the Canadian offices.
"The amount of time we spend on this is just crazy," said Dr. Sara L. Star, a partner in a three-physician pediatrics practice in suburban Chicago. "But each insurance company has its own language, its own set of rules and specific contracts with certain laboratories, hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies."
And when those companies offer multiple "insurance products," the convoluted coverage grid acquires yet another level of complexity. Each "product" comes with its own unique permutation and combination of authorization requirements, rules for claims and list of approved prescription drugs.
Large practices often choose to outsource the job to firms that specialize in wading through the labyrinthine rules and regulations. Some hire several nurses or administrators to work exclusively with insurers, with each specializing in the arcane rules of a single insurer. But most primary care providers in this country -- clinicians who are part of practices with five or fewer physicians -- cannot afford to pay for additional help. Instead, they must make their way through the thicket of insurers and rules by themselves.
The complicated task inevitably gets in the way of patient care.
A young patient complaining of extreme fatigue, for example, might benefit from a $40 blood test that could confirm infectious mononucleosis in 10 minutes. But a doctor cannot order the simple test without first checking with the insurance company to see if it is covered and if there are any constraints on where the patient's blood can be drawn and the test run.
Tracking down answers often means phone calls with long periods on hold, digging up old patient information and even recruiting office workers to act as specimen couriers to other labs and hospitals in order to expedite results or save frail patients or harried family members the hassle of traveling to an "approved site" for a test or procedure. "If someone comes in with a sick infant who needs a test, we often eat the costs and draw the blood ourselves," Dr. Star said. "We aren't going to tell them to put that kid in a car seat, drive a mile to an approved lab, park, register, then wait in line."
Even more confusing are frequent changes in health care plans, particularly regarding prescription drugs. Every week, payers send physicians' offices notifications of changes in their list of approved medications, lists that run to hundreds of different drugs. The sheer volume of new information makes it impossible for doctors to keep up. "Physicians get into medical school because we can follow rules," said Dr. Marian Bouchard, a family doctor who practices with two other physicians and a nurse practitioner in Bristol, Vt. "But none of us can or want to follow the minutiae of a hundred rules at once, especially when we are trying to be present for our patients."
The authors of the study offer several recommendations to reduce the confusion and inefficiency of interactions between physician practices and payers. Not surprisingly, they propose simplifying the forms and procedures that add to costs without improving quality. "There are rules that really save money or improve patient care that health plans won't want to change," said Sean Nicholson, one of the study authors and an economist in the department of policy analysis and management at Cornell University. "But there are also a lot of things that don't matter that they could and should standardize."
The insurance industry, for example, could embrace a single set of universal standards to measure quality rather than the dozens that are currently used. They could adopt a uniform process of obtaining authorization for tests, procedures or consultations. And while widespread adoption of electronic medical records and changes in how doctors are reimbursed may eventually decrease some administrative burdens, the results of the study leave little doubt as to the costs now and in the foreseeable future for doctors and patients.
"We aren't saying that we should go to a single-payer system," Dr. Nicholson added. "But it's important to know exactly what all the benefits of the current costs are."

HEADLINE: Buffett Adds Another Bank to His Portfolio

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: While he is investing $5 billion into Bank of America, Warren E. Buffett is no stranger to taking up positions in the nation's biggest lenders.

 BODY:
With his $5 billion investment in Bank of America, Warren E. Buffett is adding yet another American financial giant to his stock portfolio.
His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, has long been an investor in the nation's banks, and counts five firms in which it has a major stake. 
Here were Berkshire's top holdings in financial companies as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing:

FIRMMARKET VALUE OF STAKEAMOUNT OF SHARESCHANGE FROM 1ST QUARTER	American Express$7.84 billion151,610,700No change	Wells Fargo$9.89 billion352,327,608+ 9,703,683 shares	US Bancorp$1.76 billion69,039,426No change	Berkshire also owns smaller stakes in the Bank of New York Mellon and the M&T Bank Corporation. 
Of course, Mr. Buffett's most notable bets on the finance sector of late came from his big capital injections into Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis. Those two deals closely resemble his new investment in Bank of America; he bought $5 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares in Goldman and $3 billion in G.E. 
Those purchases were highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a 10 percent annual dividend, as well as requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett's holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. 
Still, not all of Mr. Buffett's Wall Street moves have turned out well. While Berkshire earned a profit from its Goldman and G.E. investments, warrants that it received along with the preferred shares remain underwater. (The 700 million warrants that Berkshire received from Bank of America, on the other hand, are currently in the money: They carry a strike price of $7.142857, while the firm's stock price is at $7.89 as of late Thursday morning.)
Going further back, just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of Salomon Brothers preferred shares.
To protect his holdings, Mr. Buffett undertook a highly unusual move. He stepped in as Salomon's chairman in 1991 after John Gutfreund was forced to resign following a Treasury securities bidding scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving the firm from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. 
(He famously delivered the following lines in his testimony before Congress on the scandal: "Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.")
Mr. Buffett stepped down as Salomon's chairman after roughly 10 months. Berkshire sold its shares in the firm in 1997, after Salomon was sold to what is now Citigroup.
Outside of banks, Mr. Buffett declined to invest in the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1993. After LTCM faced collapse in 1998 amid a global financial crisis, its officials approached Mr. Buffett -- and he again passed.
A previous version of this article misstated the size and value of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in Wells Fargo.

HEADLINE: What Buffett Is Getting From His Bank of America Deal

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America's price for getting Warren E. Buffett's seal of approval may not be as steep as what Goldman Sachs and General Electric have paid. But it will cost the firm $9.51 a second.

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett is among the nation's best deal-makers, and in the $5 billion investment he struck with Bank of America, he's getting a guaranteed profit.
Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will receive 50,000 perpetual preferred shares. That stock carry a 6 percent annual dividend payable quarterly, meaning that Bank of America will be sending about $300 million a year to Berkshire's headquarters in Omaha.
Put another way, Berkshire will be earning $821,917.81 a day, or $9.51 a second. All in all, not a bad way to spend $5 billion, especially when Berkshire had $47.9 billion in cash and equivalents as of the end of the second quarter.
Berkshire will also receive 10-year warrants that can be converted into 700 million common shares in Bank of America, at a strike price of about $7.14. (To be exact, $7.142857.) As of Thursday afternoon, that meant an immediate paper profit of $392 million on the warrants, based on Bank of America's stock price of $7.70.
Want more granular detail? Analysts told Reuters that the actual value of Berkshire's warrants are worth $3.17 billion to $3.84 billion, though the actual value will change over time.
And Dealbreaker has put together a nicely considered analysis of the value of Bank of America implied by Berkshire's investment, replete with a Google Docs spreadsheet. The short answer: $5.28 a share or so. (The stock was trading around $7.70 on Thursday afternoon.)
The deal will provide Berkshire with a tidy profit as long as Mr. Buffett can hold on to the stake. Bank of America can buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium, or an additional $250 million.
Bank of America is undeniably getting a better deal than Goldman Sachs or General Electric did when they secured similar deals with Berkshire. Mr. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants in Goldman and $3 billion for the same in G.E. The preferred shares in both carried a 10 percent annual dividend and a 10 percent premium to be repaid early. 
In Goldman's case, when it finally bought out Berkshire's stake in the spring, it paid out $5.64 billion.
But as Mr. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday morning, those were struck during the financial crisis, and therefore demanded much harsher terms.

HEADLINE: The Huntsman Gambit

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The Utah governor's strategy isn't crazy, but he's picking the wrong fights.

 BODY:
In a long profile of Jon Huntsman in the latest issue of the American Conservative, Michael Brendan Dougherty points out that the former Utah governor's actual record is quite conservative, and bears little resemblance to the Mr. Moderate/"liberal media's favorite candidate" image that Huntsman has lately seemed to ardently embrace. This prompts Jim Antle to ask the obvious question: If Huntsman actually has more right-wing street cred - on abortion, guns, taxes, you name it - than the frontrunning Romney (or the ex-frontrunning, based on the latest polls), then why has he decided to run to Romney's 
The answer probably has something to do with Huntsman's choices in early 2009, when he decided to raise his national profile by critiquing the "just say no" attitude of the G.O.P. Congress and then decided to actually the Obama administration as ambassador to China. First impressions can be changed, but not without time and effort, and by running for president so soon after branding himself as the Obama White House's favorite Republican, Huntsman pretty much took himself out of the running for the Perry-Bachmann-Tea Party vote. This narrowed his options for distinguishing himself from the handsome Mormon ex-governor in the race, and after some halfhearted attempts to get Romney's right, he seems to have decided (no doubt on the advice of John Weaver, his ex-McCainiac chief strategist) that his only chance at breaking out of the pack is to emulate John McCain's impressive moderate-insurgent campaign in 2000, which won an upset in New Hampshire by doing exactly what Huntsman is trying to do now: Wooing the media and moderate Republicans by attacking his own party's interest groups and intellectual blind spots.
For a campaign that doesn't seem to be going anywhere otherwise, this isn't a crazy strategy. As Dan McCarthy points out, it helped Ron Paul make some noise in 2008:
... Confronting Giuliani over foreign policy and terrorism [in the '08 debates] should have been electoral suicide by any conventional measure. But it separated Paul from also-rans like Tom Tancredo and Sam Brownback and galvanized a segment of the base that didn't even exist before that moment. Huntsman is no Paul, but when you're at 2 percent in the polls, what do you have to lose? There's no cost, and as Paul demonstrated, there can be unexpected gains. (And in terms of internal campaign dynamics, there's sometimes a fundraising benefit in playing to the campaign's base rather than the party's base.)
Huntsman was a longshot before and he's a longshot after his "maverick" tweeting - but now he's a longshot with more attention and a brand distinct from the rest of the field. The latter is more than Pawlenty ever managed, and we saw where campaigning as a conventional conservative took him.
I agree, but with this big caveat: When Paul feuded with Giuliani over foreign policy four years ago, he was separating himself from the pack on an issue that actually mattered, both to the Republican electorate and to the country as a whole. Whereas by casting himself as the candidate of capital-S Science, touting his belief in evolution and global warming, Huntsman is staking out maverick-y positions on issues that matter far more to media-intelligentsia types than to most American voters. Given that this is a recession election, not a culture war election, a candidate trying to successfully brand himself as a "different kind of Republican" would be far better off breaking with conservative orthodoxy on an economic issue - by calling for looser money, maybe, or attacking the totally unpersuasive right-wing conceit that we need to raise taxes on the American working class. Instead, Huntsman is toeing the party line on pocketbook matters, and picking fights on boutique issues that are at best tangentially related to the major controversies of the Great Recession. It's a good way to get press for his candidacy, but in this year of all years, I'm doubtful that it will translate into even a Paul-esque surge in the polls.

HEADLINE: Stop Waiting for Superman

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: To salvage his term, the president doesn't need to be superhuman, just a tougher mortal.

 BODY:
Hope and audacity hung in the winter air those early months of the perilous presidency of Barack Obama, a time when street vendors were selling pictures of him as Superman, complete with an "S" across his chest.
I remember picking one up, thinking the collage might be worth something down the road. Of course it was never realistic, despite Obama's gifts of oration and the power of his narrative, for him to be The One, or The Natural, let alone a superhero. We can't help it, though; every inauguration is like the start of a new baseball season, filled with hope for the rookie to hit 60 home runs. 
A year and change from the next election, the politics of the season are mean and raw. A conservative in Eastern Washington State runs for local office on a platform of shooting illegal immigrants on sight. A Republican senate candidate in Nebraska compares poor people to scavenging raccoons. And the leading Republicans who want to take Obama's place deny the existence of basic science, scoffing at everything from evolution to the global consensus on climate change. Is gravity next?
Through the haze of this dystopia, Obama has no skip in his step, no lift in his voice. His poll numbers are the worst of his time in office. His enemies no longer call him Muslim, socialist or Kenyan. They don't have to: they point to 9.1 percent unemployment, and seek to ride the wave pushed by three-fourths of the country that feels the nation is going in the wrong direction.

The president's supporters expect him to emerge from a deserved vacation with a term-saving jobs plan, and maybe the old cape out of the closet. They should forget such delusions. The jobs proposal will go nowhere in a Congress that has made clear from the beginning it cares about only one thing: ensuring that Obama fails.
And the Superman hype - that came with the froth of the 2008 campaign, when his words seemed strong enough to break up a storm, and the idea of a black man becoming leader of a nation born with slavery was so potent.
As president, he's been a sober, cautious, tongue-shackled realist - a moderate Republican of the pre-crazy, pre-Tea Party era. Having failed to come up with a Big Idea to guide his presidency, he will sink or swim now on strengths that don't lend themselves to large rallies or passionate enthusiasm. Sobriety and moderation, by definition, are boring. 
Urban liberals, labor, blacks and Hispanics, environmentalists, the young - the core of Obama's army in 2008 - are disappointed in the president of August, 2011. They're right when they say he caved on the debt talks: the evidence is House Speaker John Boehner's boast that he got 98 percent of what he wanted from the president. 
But instead of waiting for an arm-flapping populist to emerge from the genteel summer redoubt on Martha's Vineyard, the left should focus on the coming ground war, and try to fill Congress with new people who can at least tell fact from fiction.
For Obama the political mortal, two lines of governance present themselves.
One is simply to be the executive whose policies, with a few exceptions, are backed by the majority of the public, and opposed by Republicans in thrall to kooks and corporate absolutists. 
Tax cuts for wage-earners, but not for millionaires and billionaires, has deep, bipartisan support across the land, sensibly articulated by Warren Buffett, who pointed out the absurdity his secretary paying a higher tax rate than he.
If Obama plays this issue right, those Republican presidential candidates who said they would never raise taxes even with 10 spending cuts for every increase will wish they never made such a pledge to extremism. 
He doesn't have to launch a class war - merely to engage one that's already underway. So far, surprisingly, he has not taken a side. He should make Republicans defend the politics of grotesque economic inequality. 
The health care reform law is not radical. The so-called individual mandate - requiring everyone to have some coverage - grew out of Republican think tanks, and of course was institutionalized in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney. 
About 50 million American have no health care. If that's the status quo Republicans want, Obama should make them own the misery, highlighting Rick Perry's Texas, where one in four citizens are without this basic right, which the rest of the industrial world shares. 
The second tack is to run against the lunacy of the opposition. In the same week that scientists announced the discovery of fossils 3.4 billion years old, evidence of explosive growth of early life through evolution, Rick Perry showed he will take his science from the Bible. He called evolution "a theory that's out there." If he thinks it is just a theory, he should get last year's flu shot. 
Sensible business leaders are looking to the Federal Reserve for some help with a sick global economy. Yet one leading Republican candidate, Ron Paul, wants to abolish the central bank. Another, Rick Perry, has threatened physical harm of some vague sort against the chairman. 
On social issues, Perry wants to amend the Constitution to take away rights from gays and pregnant women, and eliminate the power of citizens to directly elect their senators (that's the Seventeenth Amendment, which Perry opposed in his book).
Public opinion, again, is on Obama's side on these issues. But to leverage it, he has to practice a much more muscular brand of politics. He doesn't have to be Superman; Clark Kent with a strong dose of brio would do it.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington .

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The debt plan that lawmakers agreed to this month would sharply reduce budget deficits over the next decade, but the extension of the Bush-era tax rates would more than consume those savings, the Congressional Budget Office warned on Wednesday. Jackie Calmes writes that the report underlines the high stakes for the special bipartisan panel created to devise a plan by December for how to achieve up to $1.5 trillion in savings promised by the deal over 10 years.
Former Vice President Dick Cheney reflects on his years in the Bush administration in a memoir that will hit bookstores next week. Charlie Savage writes that Mr. Cheney takes an "often pugnacious" tone. But he "expresses little regret about many of the most controversial decisions of the Bush administration" and uncharacteristically "divulges a number of conflicts" with other top advisers.
From makeup to reporters' questions, aides to Representative Michele Bachmannexercise tight control over her presidential campaign. Trip Gabriel writes of the great lengths Ms. Bachmann's staff members go to in manicuring her public image on the campaign trail.
Around the Web:
Barely two weeks since starting his presidential campaign, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has rocketed to a double-digit lead over former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts to become the front-runner in the Republican contest for the White House, according to a Gallup poll released on Wednesday. Ms. Bachmann, the winner of the Iowa straw poll, ranked fourth, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas was third, slightly behind Mr. Romney. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah and an ex-ambassador to China under President Obama, ranked eighth and last.
Mr. Romney stepped up his broadside of President Obama's economic policies on Wednesday, telling a business panel that he would repeal the regulatory overhaul created in response to the financial crisis, The Boston Globereports.
Candidates for Congress are raising campaign cash at a record pace, setting a new high of $285 million in the first six months of 2011, according to Roll Call. The previous record for the same period was in 2009, when candidates raised $254 million. The largest share of this year's money has gone to House Republicans, who have raised $113 million.
Political action committees devoted to a single candidate are flourishing, prompting complaints from campaign finance watchdogs about the blurring of lines between official campaigns and outside groups, The Washington Post says. These "candidate superPACs" are often staffed by the candidates' former advisers and are able to hoard money without revealing the donors' names.
Happening in Washington:
 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will speak at an event in honor of the memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Holder will speak at noon at the Washington Convention Center in one of the many events leading up to the memorial's formal dedication on Sunday.
Last week, the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, turned 91. In commemoration, the National Archives will hold a panel discussion on Thursday about how the National Woman's Party used persuasive language and imagery to secure suffrage.

HEADLINE: Obama Vacation Nears End as Hurricane Irene Approaches

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama makes a beach visit amid briefings on Libya and preparations for the arrival of Hurricane Irene.

 BODY:
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Perhaps fearing approaching rains in advance of Hurricane Irene, the Obama family spent nearly five hours at a private beach on Martha's Vineyard on Thursday, under increasingly cloudy skies, as their vacation neared its end.
But first, President Obama spent much of his morning on presidential business, including conference calls on his emerging jobs-and-deficit plan and on the federal government's tracking of Hurricane Irene and preparation for its expected landfall somewhere on the Eastern Seaboard, according to aides.
Though weather could force a change in the schedule, aides say Mr. Obama still plans to return to Washington on Saturday and to speak there on Sunday at thededication of the new Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, between the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. But here and in Washington, doubts were growing that the memorial dedication, which was expected to draw hundreds of thousands of people, would proceed. 
On the call with Mr. Obama about hurricane planning were John Brennan, his counterterrorism adviser, who accompanied Mr. Obama to Martha's Vineyard to brief him daily on Libya and other national security issues; William M. Daley, the White House chief of staff; Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, and W. Craig Fugate, chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The separate conference call on the plan for job creation and long-term deficit reduction that Mr. Obama will unveil after Labor Day followed the president's daily meeting on the plan's development with Brian Deese, another aide who traveled to Martha's Vineyard. Joining Mr. Obama on the phone were Mr. Daley and the three leaders of the president's economic team - Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner; Gene Sperling, director of the White House National Economic Council; and Jacob J. Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget -- all of whom were also on vacation.
By 11:30 a.m., however, the long motorcade bearing Mr. Obama; his wife, Michelle; and their daughters, Malia and Sasha, had made the short trip to the same beach near Edgartown that the family had visited twice before since arriving a week ago - but not for so long a time. By 4:30, they were back at the Blue Heron Farm, as the skies clouded over.

HEADLINE: Romney Continues Charm Offensive With Personal Stories

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican presidential candidate shares a tale about how his father-in-law was able to pay for college, and deflects a question about his vice-presidential preference.

 BODY:
EXETER, N.H. -- Mitt Romney continued his rollout of the warmer, sunnier, more effusive Mitt Romney here on Thursday morning, opening his speech by saying, rather directly, "I thought today I'd tell a couple of personal stories."
In recent weeks, Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, has been telling voters that his father, George Romney, used to take his grandchildren - as well as Mitt when he was a boy - on a cross-country road trip to the national parks, to instill in them an appreciation of America and its values. On Thursday, he added his father-in-law to the mix, talking about how the ancestors of his wife, Ann, immigrated to the United States from Wales, and how all of Ann's aunts and uncles pooled money from their jobs to send Ann's father to college.
A lively Mr. Romney brought the crowd to applause several times, and when the speech was over, the audience jumped up in a standing ovation. He also fielded a question from an 18-year-old who asked who among the current of Republican presidential candidates Mr. Romney thought might make a good vice president.
"So, who would you?" Mr. Romney asked the young man, turning the question back on his inquisitor.
"Um, I don't know," the questioner replied.
"There you go, that's just what I needed!" Mr. Romney said, to applause and laughter, before proceeding to dodge the question.
"I think it's kind of presumptuous for someone running for president to already have in mind their list of who would be their vice presidents," he said. "We've got a lot of terrific Republicans, some governors, some senators, Congresspeople, from around the country - some of whom aren't running for president. I can tell you this: The single most important criteria in selecting a vice president of the United States is someone who can be president."
He added: "Look, there's some I have more confidence in than others in being able to lead the country. There are others I have more confidence in in terms of being able to win the presidency. But one thing's for sure, each one of the people on that stage that I debate with would be a better president for America than the current occupant of the White House." (No word on whom, specifically, he has less confidence in).
But Mr. Romney's more optimistic and jovial demeanor didn't prevent him from continuing to attack President Obama, saying, "I want to make America the strongest nation on earth, and what I've seen instead from this president is not a Triple A presidency, but I'll call it a Triple D presidency."
"It's been a presidency which has been associated with debt and with downgrade, and with delay," he explained. (Garrett Haake of NBC dubbed it the "alphabet soup attacks.")
In fact, at his evening town meeting in Dover, N.H., Mr. Romney unveiled a debt clock that showed the average debt per taxpayer ($131,121 at last count), as well as a real-time running tally of the national debt, which ticked up behind him as he spoke. He made sure to stand in front of it when he held a brief question-and-answer session with reporters after the event.
Earlier this week, Mr. Romney alluded to a jobs plan he said he would unveil in Nevada on Sept. 6. But when pressed by reporters on what, specifically, he's learned about jobs during the months of campaigning, Mr. Romney remained vague.
"I'm not looking to put in place a stimulus; that's like throwing a little gas on the fire, getting a big poof and then it goes away," he said. "I'm not looking to grow government. You know, there's a lot of people who think you don't have a jobs plans unless you make government bigger. I look at this in the opposite way. If you want to get the economy growing, you've got to get the government smaller."
When asked how specific his actual plan would be, Mr. Romney demurred: "More than I've been so far."

HEADLINE: Verizon Strike Raises Claims For Benefits To Jobless

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits in the United States rose more than expected last week, lifted by striking Verizon Communications workers, a government report showed on Thursday.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 417,000, the Labor Department said. Analysts see 400,000 as the level where the economy is creating net new jobs. 
Striking Verizon workers filed 8,500 claims for jobless benefits last week, after submitting 12,500 applications the previous week, which covered the period for the August nonfarm payrolls survey.
That suggests that the strike would reduce the monthly payroll count, which will be reported on Sept. 2. The strike against Verizon ended on Monday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be 405,000 last week. The previous week's claims were revised up to 412,000 from the previously reported 408,000.
The claims showed little sign that companies were laying off workers in droves in response to the recent tumble in share prices. Fears that the economy is on the brink of slipping back into recession have rattled stock markets, helping to lower business and consumer confidence.
While the labor market regained some ground in July, a new wave of layoffs, coupled with the deterioration in business sentiment, could reverse the trend in the months ahead.
Employers added 117,000 jobs in July after increasing payrolls by only 99,000 in May and June combined. The unemployment rate fell to 9.1 percent in July from 9.2 percent in June.
A Labor Department official said there was nothing unusual in the state-level data released Thursday. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, rose 4,000 to 407,500.
The number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell 80,000, to 3.64 million, in the week ended Aug. 13.
The number of Americans on emergency unemployment benefits fell 43,827, to 3.09 million, in the week ended Aug. 6, the latest week for which data is available.
A total of 7.29 million people were claiming unemployment benefits during that period under all programs, down from 45,989 the previous week.

HEADLINE: U.S. Open Dining: Game, Set, Munch

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON

 BODY:
The mailbox this week groaned with queries about where to eat during the United States Open tennis tournament, which kicks off in Queens on Monday and runs until Sept. 11. I did my best to give good counsel. As always, you may direct your questions about what restaurants you should visit in New York City to dinejournal@nytimes.com You can also find me on Twitter: @SamSifton.
Q. I am visiting New York for the U.S. Open and want to eat well during my visit. Are there places to eat near the stadium that I should try? I plan on taking the train to and from the matches, and am staying in Midtown. 
A. Yes, there are. But never forget that one of the best meals to be had while watching the U.S. Open is a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich on good toasted bread with mayonnaise, served with a glass of cold white wine or icy beer and consumed while seated on a rug in front of a large television in the same apartment where you have been watching the matches, on and off, for the better part of your life. (There might be some bread-and-butter pickles, as well. Maybe a pony Coke. Some macaroni salad. Definitely there are sunflowers in a vase by the window, and a dog asleep in the sun.)
It is marvelous that you have come to New York to boost our economy and enjoy the games in person. But always remember: the Open is above all a television event, a late-summer screen ritual for New Yorkers and tennis fans the world over. It calls most often for finger food, for drinks that bead the exterior of glasses with moisture, for friends and for the firm understanding that not all picnics have to be outdoor affairs.
In America, if you are watching tennis in August while eating, you are functionally an aristocrat. What a fantastic feeling!
But those who travel to Queens to see the tennis in person have it pretty good as well, at least if they take the time and effort to look beyond the food offered at the stadium itself, or to send a letter to The New York Times asking me to do so for them. And many did. I am letting your letter stand in for all, in part because in matters of U.S. Open eating, my answer remains the same, regardless of sender, regardless of dietary restriction, regardless of party size.
It is: Take the subway to the Open, stop often along the way and witness northern Queens in all of its leafy, delicious glory.
From Manhattan on the 7 train, the first stop into the borough is Vernon Boulevard and Jackson Avenue, in Long Island City. You could hop off there and have a decent bistro meal at Tournesol, or pizza and red-sauce pasta at tough old Manetta's, almost under the Pulaski Bridge. These are neighborhood gems.
Newer (and therefore of great interest to the food-obsessed) is the John Brown Smokehouse on 37th Avenue, where you can load up on burnt ends and beans, brisket and spare ribs, before returning your body to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for movement east.
But we have time, no? (No need to watch people volley when you can eat.) Sadly, the M. Wells diner near the Hunters Point stop is shuttering at the end of the month. But you might head on to Sunnyside for oxtail terrine, fried chicken or chili shrimp at Daniel Yi's well-regarded neighborhood spot Salt & Fat, near the 40th Street stop, or to Woodside for the crazy flavors and long lines of SriPraPhai Thai on 39th Avenue, near the 69th Street station.
There is also Jackson Heights, where the Jackson Diner, on 74th Street north of the train tracks there, offers an extensive, jolly and relatively low-cost tour through the foods of the Indian subcontinent. It doesn't look like much. But lamb vindaloo can do much to improve your worldview.
Still on the train? Exit at Corona Plaza, particularly if you are traveling in search of lunch. Leo's Latticini is just down 104th Street from the station. A hero at this Queens landmark delivers a doctoral thesis in Italian-American pride and excellence. And you can take it with you if you like. Then visit Tortilleria Nixtamal, a few steps farther south on 47th Avenue, for tacos and Coronas (and in Corona, to boot).
Alternatively, you might follow the lead of the invaluable food sleuth Joe DiStefano, who edits the World's Fare blog for Edible Queens. In an interview he advised continuing past the Open stop at Willets Point to end up at Main Street in Flushing, where nearby Asian riches await. I wrote recently about the Grand Restaurant in the New World Mall there, but Mr. DiStefano advised a trip to the food court below it, with stalls hawking regional Chinese specialties, as well as food from Vietnam and Korea, and a hamburger outfit that has a sideline in Peruvian rotisserie chicken.
As ever, his advice proved solid and fair, down to a terrific Taiwanese shaved-ice-cotton-candy mango dessert from Snopo. (You can find World's Fare at ediblecommunities.com/queens.)
Now return to the train and head to Willets Point: game, set, match, championship.

HEADLINE: A Year of Rising Suicides on Bridge and Tracks

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
On Wednesday, May 25, at 8:05 p.m. Barbara Sue Beaver stood on the Golden Gate Bridge and used her cellphone to e-mail Denis Morella, her Oakland neighbor and best friend.
''Can you come and check on Jondi for me?'' she wrote, referring to her affectionate pit bull.
Then, at 8:07 p.m., Ms. Beaver, 55, jumped off the bridge to her death.
''I'm just too lazy to navigate further,'' said a letter found at her home, which had been left tidy and mostly emptied of belongings. Notes detailed how she had settled her affairs. 
''She didn't want her death to be a burden to anyone,'' Mr. Morella said.
Ms. Beaver's passing is part of a grim trend: suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge this year are on the rise -- a pace approaching records. The economic downturn, some experts say, could be a factor.
At least 24 suicides have occurred since January, compared with 25 in 2010; recent annual rates have averaged about 27. (The record is 40 in 1977, according to a San Francisco Chronicle analysis.)
Caltrain, the commuter rail service between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, has also seen a spike in suicides and also appears to be headed toward a record this year.
There have been 12 deaths on Caltrain tracks so far in 2011. Most remain under investigation, but four have been determined to be suicides. In 2010 there were 11 Caltrain fatalities, all suicides. The record for suicides is 15 in 2009. In recent years, most track deaths were eventually found to be suicides.
Theories abound regarding the cause behind this year's surge, but full explanations perish with victims.
Experts have long debated whether the Werther effect -- the theory that a highly publicized suicide can inspire copycat suicides -- has played a role in past spikes, like the increases in suicides from the bridge in 2007 and on Caltrain tracks in 2009.
But there has been no significant news media coverage so far in 2011, and officials for both the Golden Gate Bridge and Caltrain said it was unlikely that this year's increase was the result of copycats.
Instead, some experts are pointing to economic despair.
''We have noticed many more people mentioning the economy,'' said Eve Meyer, executive director of San Francisco Suicide Prevention, a nonprofit group that operates the city's suicide hot line.
''We constantly hear, 'I'm going to be homeless; I would rather be dead than be homeless,' '' Ms. Meyer said.
Studies have shown that suicide rates tend to increase about 18 months after an economic decline. ''Benefits run out and the crises begin to multiply,'' she said.
In California, roughly 497,000 people have been jobless for so long that they have exhausted 99 weeks of unemployment benefits, according to data released last week.
Suicide rates in the United States tend to be highest among people age 65 and older, but in 2011 only one person who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge has been in that bracket, a 66-year-old architect from Hawaii. Most of the suicides on the bridge this year were men in their 50s or 20s, according to records at the Marin County Coroner's Office, which investigates nearly all bridge suicides.
Susan Baker, a prominent suicide researcher and professor with the Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy, said the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked suicides, but did not release the information until years after the events had occurred, making it difficult to spot new suicide trends quickly.
But Ms. Baker said there had been a link between suicides and the economy in the past. When told of the comments on the San Francisco suicide hot line, she said, ''It's not surprising that some people might decide to take that way out.''
Family members and friends say financial uncertainty may have played a role in Ms. Beaver's death.
A native of Marin County, Ms. Beaver was a fixture of the local literary scene for a decade, working for Chronicle Books and Book Passage. Colleagues described her as ebullient, salty and funny -- for example, she nicknamed friends dollbucket (a word she invented) -- with a penchant for wearing bright red.
''She always said you couldn't have a bad day if you wore red,'' said Calvin Crosby, a longtime friend.
The 2008 recession hit the book business hard, and Ms. Beaver resigned from her jobs and spent nearly two years unemployed.
''She was very conscious of being 55 with no health insurance, no pension and being part of a dying industry,'' said her father, Floyd Beaver, 91. She worried that she would become a burden.
Since the Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937 there have been at least 1,400 suicides -- many cases are not included in the official count because bodies were not found, even when a suicide was witnessed. There were 59 of these unconfirmed suicides from 2000 to 2010, plus 308 confirmed cases during those years. Additionally, an unknown number of people are believed to have jumped at night unobserved.
Few survive the drop, a deadly success rate that, when coupled with its landmark status, has made the bridge a top destination for those contemplating suicide. Few realize that jumping from the bridge causes an exceptionally gruesome death, listed on medical examiners' reports as ''multiple blunt force injuries'' -- broken ribs rip through organs, many times missing the heart, leaving victims to drown.
After years of contentious debate about what to do, if anything, to stop suicides, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, the authority that operates the bridge, has finally approved a plan to install a safety net that will reach out 20 feet and catch jumpers.
The net will be made of marine-grade metal, and ''it's going to hurt a little bit'' when a person lands on it, said Mary Currie, spokeswoman for the agency. The hope is that the pain will startle people into having second thoughts about ending their lives. The cost, however, is daunting: $45 million (original bridge construction cost $35 million) -- and financing has not yet been secured.
Ms. Meyer, the suicide hot line manager, said the government must also act immediately to help those in economic despair.
''Suicide is an attempt to stop pain,'' she said, and is not always caused by mental illness, which she called a common misperception. ''That pain can be emotional, physical or economic.''
Ms. Beaver's jump to end her pain has left friends and family members devastated and bewildered. She was, after all, so much fun -- a side of her that 120 ''dollbuckets'' celebrated at a memorial service in June, most wearing bright red.
''She was a remarkable woman,'' her father said this week. ''I wish you could have known her.''

HEADLINE: An Office for Day Laborers Waiting on the Corner

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN and BRIDGET O'SHEA. 
klydersen@chicagonewscoop.org boshea@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Every morning, rain or shine, Miguel used to head for the corner of Belmont and Milwaukee Avenues and wait at an informal gathering spot of day laborers in hopes he would be hired to set tile, pour concrete or lay sod.
After the job he would sometimes be paid as promised, but often he was not -- a daily risk for the thousands of workers who are hired off street corners by contractors or homeowners who need help with construction or landscaping. 
Today Miguel, 48, still makes a living doing temporary construction work. But instead of braving the cold or stifling heat at a busy intersection, he meets employers at a storefront office of the Albany Park Workers' Center at Bryn Mawr and Kimball Avenues.
He starts each job with a contract specifying his pay and working conditions that a lawyer at the center will help him enforce, if necessary.
''Here we have a roof over our head, we have coffee,'' said Miguel, who moved to Chicago from Mexico 16 years ago. ''And a contract is signed so we know we will get paid.'' (His last name is not used in this article because his immigration status is not known.)
The Albany Park Workers' Center is one of about 40 in the nation set up in an effort to reform the day-labor industry. The center, which opened in 2004, was founded and is run by the Latino Union, a group created in 2000 by immigrant women working at temporary staffing agencies. It has grown into a workers rights and immigrants rights nonprofit organization.
Some local business owners and residents oppose the workers' centers, arguing that they help in the hiring of people who are in the United States illegally, and thus encourage illegal immigration. Laborers gathered on street corners also have caused local controversies, with some neighbors complaining that they block traffic and sometimes make female passers-by uncomfortable.
Illegal immigrant workers are especially vulnerable to unscrupulous employers. A 2006 study by the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of California, Los Angeles, found that two-thirds of day laborers surveyed in the Midwest had not been paid wages due them in the past two months, and 27 percent had been threatened with violence by employers.
Nationally, almost half of the day laborers told researchers that they had been denied breaks for food or water, and the vast majority reported being hurt on the job or left at faraway work sites without transportation home.
The Latino Union set up the storefront office in Albany Park to help combat the abuses and to persuade day laborers at street corners around the city to get jobs through workers' centers.
Eric Rodriguez, the Latino Union's executive director, said most street corners had informal networks and leaders who typically agreed on a base wage. At the corner of Milwaukee and Belmont, for example, Mr. Rodriguez said it was $12 an hour, higher than the Illinois minimum wage of $8.25 an hour.
But he said it was difficult to enforce the agreements when someone drove up looking for workers and was surrounded by men jockeying for a job.
At a workers' center, there is little jostling or bargaining for work, and the center's staff does not ask day laborers about their immigration status. Patricio Ordonez, a former day laborer turned Albany Park job coordinator, uses a lottery system to assign men to jobs and then negotiates their contracts.
''The current broken immigration laws give predatory employers an advantage,'' said Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.
Mr. Newman said that illegal immigrants were reluctant to speak up if employers abused them, but that workers' centers and their lawyers were not.
Mr. Rodriguez often visits other street corners and passes out pamphlets on worker rights and safety. At the Albany Park center, day laborers are offered English language classes and free workshops on construction skills, like plumbing. The center also hosts barbecues and soccer tournaments where workers from different street corners compete and then talk about improving working conditions for day laborers.
The poor economy is hurting day laborers, who face increased competition for jobs, Mr. Rodriguez said. And the anti-immigrant sentiment that often intensifies in hard economic times is evident in legislation being considered in Congress.
Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, has introduced a bill that would force workers' centers to close or greatly alter their practices. It would mandate that all employers, including workers' centers, use the government's E-Verify electronic system to validate employees' Social Security numbers.
Most legislative experts do not expect the bill to pass the Senate, but in assessing its intended impact, Tyler Moran, policy director for the National Immigration Law Center, said she did not think it would accomplish its goal of forcing day laborers to return to their native countries even if it were passed.
''It's just going to move them from on-the-books to off-the-books,'' Ms. Moran said.
In other words, back to a street corner.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 2, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about the Albany Park Workers' Center, which was set up in an effort to reform the day-labor industry, overstated what was known about the immigration status of one of the workers there. His surname was withheld because he might be an illegal immigrant, not because he is indeed here illegally.

HEADLINE: Chinese Maritime Agency Plans to Sue American Oil Company ConocoPhillips Over Two Spills

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Chinese maritime authority is preparing to sue ConocoPhillips, the American oil company, over two oil spills in June that engulfed large swaths of Bohai Bay in north China, according to a report by Xinhua, the state news agency.
The report, which appeared on Wednesday, said the State Oceanic Administration was aiming to set up a team of lawyers by the end of the month to sue for compensation. It cited an agency spokesman as saying that 49 Chinese law firms had applied to provide legal assistance. 
The two spills, involving 3,200 barrels of oil and drilling fluids, occurred in the country's largest offshore oilfield, called Penglai 19-3, and spread over at least 324 square miles in Bohai Bay. The Penglai field was co-developed by China National Offshore Oil Corporation, commonly known as Cnooc, and ConocoPhillips China operates it.
As with a vast spill last year from a PetroChina port facility in the city of Dalian, which lies on the edge of the Bohai Sea, environmental advocates and residents of the affected areas have expressed anger with the government over delays in getting news or accurate reports of the spills. But this time, even more fury is directed at ConocoPhillips. That complicates the response of the Chinese government, because it is in the process of luring American companies to China to drill for oil and gas in shale fields.
The Xinhua report said the oil spills had spread to beaches in the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning and were being blamed for a slowdown in local tourism and for economic damage to aquatic farming industries. The report also said ''nine new oil spill sources'' had been found in the bay as of Aug. 20. John Roper, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, said Thursday in an e-mail message that the company had not received any notice of litigation.
''As far as compensation goes, we will listen to any requests and follow Chinese law, but we have not received any notification of claims,'' he said. ''Cleanup efforts are going very well. We are more than 95 percent finished with the cleanup of mineral oil-based drilling mud, and expect to reach our target of being 100 percent by the end of August.''
Mr. Roper said the nine spill seeps that Xinhua cited were not from new leaks but were residual oil and drilling mud from a June 17 spill that were now migrating to the surface. ''Divers were only able to see them once the drilling mud was cleared away from the sea floor,'' he said. The oil seeps are small, are clustered together and are releasing a total volume of fluids of one to two liters per day ''that is being immediately contained and cleaned up.''
Mr. Roper added that there was no more oil sheen on the surface of the water.
In Hong Kong, the chairman of Cnooc, Wang Yilin, addressed the compensation issue on Wednesday.
''If Cnooc is ruled to pay any form of compensation, we will certainly fulfill our commitment and do the right thing,'' Mr. Wang said at a briefing for reporters after the company announced its first-half earnings, according to Bloomberg News. ''Cnooc is a responsible company and we honor our long-term commitment to the country, people and the environment.''
Georg Storaker, president of ConocoPhillips China, said Wednesday at a news conference in Beijing that the spill in Bohai Bay should not be compared with the disastrous BP spill in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. On Thursday, Mr. Storaker's comments drew derision from some Chinese news organizations and commentators. The English-language edition of Global Times, a populist newspaper, published an unsigned editorial lambasting ConocoPhillips.
''ConocoPhillips is like certain Westerners who live in China,'' the editorial said. ''They can be quite law-abiding back home, but break the law in China. Some global corporations can even outsmart their Chinese counterparts in under-the-table deals, bribing officials and cutting employee benefits. ConocoPhillips is digging not only a hole in Bohai Bay but also a hole in China's legal system.''
United States energy analysts say that China is following a delicate political strategy after internal debate among the Chinese authorities about how to punish the American oil company. The Chinese seem to want to show environmental concern, the analysts say, but they will not push hard enough to scare away foreign investment in energy or to embarrass Cnooc.
''China needs all the help it can get to achieve energy efficiency, so they can't afford to play hardball,'' said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''China will push, but not to the breaking point and be like Hugo Chavez. They need the capital, the technology and market know-how.''
Michal Meidan, an Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, a consultancy, noted that it took a long time for the Chinese authorities to decide on a legal strategy but that they needed to respond to public opinion, especially bloggers who expressed outrage that ConocoPhillips did not publicly reveal the leak immediately. ''There is a need for the Chinese to signal caution and concern about environmental protection, but this is very much for a domestic audience,'' she said.
She noted that Cnooc, which owns a 51 percent stake in the operation although the American company is the operator, might also be required to pay a fine. ''It may only have a symbolic fine or a slap on the wrist officially, but it's a pretty big deal internally.''

HEADLINE: The Art Institute of Chicago Appoints Its New Director

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The Art Institute of Chicago has named Douglas Druick, a curator there for 26 years and the chairman of two departments, as its new director, the institute announced Wednesday. Mr. Druick, 66, has been the acting director since June 30, when the former director, James Cuno, departed to become the president and chief executive of the J. Paul Getty Trust in Los Angeles. 
Reached in the director's office on Wednesday morning, Mr. Druick, who previously led the prints and drawings and European painting and sculpture departments, said that he felt his intimate knowledge of the museum gave him ''a very good perspective of the ways we can grow.'' He said that his goals included changing gallery installations, hiring a new education director, pursuing the production of online catalogs and expanding the ways that technology is used to provide both on-site and remote access to the collection.
Mr. Druick described the institute's financial position as sound, saying that its endowment was up almost 24 percent over the last fiscal year and individual contributions had also increased since the recession. He said it was too early to say whether the institute, which opened a new Renzo Piano-designed wing in 2009, would take on any new expansion projects, but added that ''museums have to continue to think about the future, and we're no exception.''
Asked about his own future and how long he planned to be in the job, given his age, he said he planned to stay ''a very long time.'' He added, ''I wake up every morning anxious to be in the office and totally energized by this new position, and I have lots and lots of plans.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Security Council Frees Libyan Assets for Rebels

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The Security Council committee that monitors sanctions against Libya agreed on Thursday to unfreeze $1.5 billion in Libyan assets for emergency aid to the country, where rebel forces that have ousted Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi are confronting a humanitarian crisis as they attempt to establish security and form a new government. 
The committee's decision came after South Africa, a committee member that has enjoyed close ties with Colonel Qaddafi and expressed doubts about the credibility of the rebel forces , dropped its opposition to releasing the assets. Unanimous consent by committee members was required.
Western diplomats said South Africa agreed to go along with the move after language in the decision was revised to state that the assets will be disbursed to the ''relevant authorities'' instead of the Transitional National Council, the opposition group in Libya that has been leading the struggle against Colonel Qaddafi. South Africa has not recognized the Transitional National Council as the legitimate government of Libya.
Earlier Thursday the United States, which had been pushing the committee to release the assets, had threatened to bypass the committee and submit a resolution to the full 15-member Security Council to achieve the same result. American diplomats had said they were confident they would have secured the nine votes needed for passage.
The Security Council voted in February and March to freeze billions of dollars in assets belonging to Colonel Qaddafi, members of his family, his inner circle of advisors, Libyan investment organizations, the Libyan central bank and the National Oil Corporation. The Security Council also imposed an arms embargo on Libya and an international travel ban on 16 Libyan leaders.
But Western diplomats said Thursday that while the initial aim of the asset freeze was to punish the Qaddafi regime and undermine its repression of protesters, the transition underway in Libya made it imperative to unfreeze the assets to avert a humanitarian crisis and help buttress the opposition Transitional National Council.
Diplomats said the total in frozen Libyan assets in the United States exceeded $30 billion. Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations, said the $1.5 billion in funds the Americans had sought to unfreeze were needed to help rebuild the Libyan economy, restore vital services like electricity.
On Thursday Russia and China, which were both initially reticent about Western intervention in Libya, called on the United Nations to play the leading role in rebuilding Libya.
''We proceed from the position that work in the post-conflict development of Libya must be carried out exclusively under the aegis of the U.N. Security Council,'' said Russia's foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich.
In a phone call with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi of China also emphasized that his government wanted the United Nations to coordinate international involvement in Libya, diplomats said.
Western diplomats said Thursday that the apparent crumbling of the Qaddafi regime represented a moral victory for the United Nations because its initial decision to authorize military action in Libya was viewed by some as a risky foreign intervention that could undermine the organization's credibility.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Dec. 31) This location is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. American Folk Art Museum Lincoln Square Branch, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Asia Society and Museum: 'The Buddhist Heritage of Pakistan: Art of Gandhara' (through Oct. 30) After a seemingly endless run of geopolitical roadblocks, this exhibition of ancient far northern Indian art, most of it from the collections of two museums in Pakistan, finally arrived, six months late, at Asia Society. Is the show worth all the diplomatic headaches it caused? With its images of bruiser bodhisattvas and polycultural goddesses, and some notable flights into the stratosphere of sculptural splendor, it is. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) 
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Bronx Calling: The First AIM Biennial' (through Sept. 5) Some of the 72 participants in the Bronx Museum's Artist in the Marketplace program from 2010 and 2011, all included in this two-site exhibition, will warrant keeping an eye on. One for sure is Jessica Stoller, who creates exquisite, tabletop-scale, glazed porcelain figurative sculptures with a spooky, feminist edge. Other standouts: Matthew Conradt's large, vaguely nightmarish collages picturing faceless figures in Cubist-Surrealist compositions; Romy Scheroder's assemblages made of disparate pieces of wooden furniture; and Karla Wozniak's thick and crusty paintings of landscapes blighted by road signs. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org; also showing at Wave Hill, West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200, wavehill.org. (Ken Johnson)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Vishnu: Hinduism's Blue-Skinned Savior' (through Oct. 2) Hindu sculptures are no ordinary things. Concentrations of spiritual energy so dense as to turn physics inside out, they funnel light from other universes into our mundane world. The light takes a little time to penetrate this show, dauntingly crowded with objects, ideas and information. But it shines through in the end as we trace the many earthly forms taken by one of Hinduism's greatest gods and arrive at the spiritual matinee idol named Krishna. With his sapphire skin and sweet flute songs, he radiates devotional love, and everyone falls for him, including us. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity' (through Sept. 28) This five-decade retrospective fills the museum with about 90 works in a Zen-Minimalist, be-here-now vein by a Korean artist who lives in Paris and Japan. Sculptures consist of ordinary, pumpkin-size boulders juxtaposed with sheets and slabs of dark, glossy steel. Paintings made of wide brush strokes executed in gridded order on raw canvas exemplify tension between action and restraint. In its always near-perfect composure, Mr. Lee's art teeters perilously between art and decor. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) This exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Oct. 16) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Frans Hals in the Metropolitan Museum' (through Oct. 10) This small but potent show gathers the Met's 11 confirmed works by the great 17th-century Dutch painter, appending them with two outstanding loans and a selection of contextualizing works. It gives a remarkably full account of his talent and the painterly realisms -- vivacious to relatively restrained -- that he formulated. It also reveals an artist who viewed his subjects with a nonjudgmental equanimity, whether he depicted them singly or in groups, in dignified repose or unbridled revelry. As a result, a strange kind of gravity and sympathy for the human condition emanates from these works, raw as they can sometimes seem. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother India: The Goddess in Indian Painting' (through Nov. 27) Sculptures, paintings and drawings from the Met's collection represent manifestations of Devi, the Great Mother goddess who is thought to be the most popular of all Indian deities. Among works dating from the first millennium B.C. to 1990 are pieces of exceptional beauty, including a small, 12th-century argillite sculpture depicting the 16-armed Durga slaying her most fearsome opponent, Mahishasura, after he emerges from the lopped neck of his buffalo disguise. Carved in extraordinarily refined detail, it is a marvel of formal and metaphorical concentration. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- MoMA PS1: Ryan Trecartin: 'Any Ever' (through Sept. 5) This game-changing show of seven related videos, viewed amid eccentric seating arrangements procured mostly from Ikea, reflects the combined imagination of a supertalented young artist and his band of merry, cross-dressing pranksters. The results teeter giddily at the intersection of art, reality television and social networking; forge an integration of video and installation art, not to mention a blend of actual life and animation undreamt of by Walt Disney; and evince an aspirational faith in the potential of uninhibited self-expression, both individual and collective, to counter the mounting materialism of everyday life. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011' (through Jan. 8) Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last biannual survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far, including work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself. The ''S'' this year is for ''Street,'' which covers everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility to at least think about other subjects, like money for artists, and the lack of it. Another segment of the show is on display at the Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx; a Brooklyn show is scheduled to start in November. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Otherworldly: Optical Delusions and Small Realities' (through Sept. 18) In the age of the flat screen, a show about the diorama sounds charmingly naive. Yet ''Otherworldly'' circles back to the two-dimensional image in ways that feel very sophisticated. A good number of the show's more than 40 artists build model homes, cities and landscapes mainly to photograph them. At times the exhibition feels like a Hollywood film-studio tour in miniature. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Project 95: Runa Islam' (through Sept. 19) Part of MoMA's ''Projects'' series, this exhibition showcases a newly commissioned film (''Emergence,'' 2011) based on a cracked glass negative from the Smithsonian's archives. Also on view are three recent works of comparable poetry and rigor: two lyrical looks at the Italian landscape and a hypnotic structural exploration of a Japanese folding screen. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Talk to Me: Design and the Communication Between People and Objects' (through Nov. 7) This broad, ambitious survey of interactive design is made for the texting, tweeting, social-networking, app-downloading, smartphone-wielding museumgoer. Its nearly 200 projects include not only crowd-pleasing video games, robots and chattering objects but also some surprisingly seductive interfaces, charts and information systems -- each with its own hash tag. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
- New Museum: 'Ostalgia' (through Sept. 25) This tough, absorbing exhibition fills all five floors of the museum with contemporary art from, or about, Russia and former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. A fair number of the artists are unfamiliar to New York; some have difficult, even harrowing histories. But a show that could have been a surveyish introduction to them is something more. It's an extended essay about what happens when art and life meet not because it's a cool idea, but because they have no choice: they either join forces or lose everything. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lyonel Feininger: At The Edge of the World' (through Oct. 16) This overdue survey is an eye-opener, especially for the rapturous storybook street scenes that Feininger (1871-1956) painted from 1907 to 1911 -- fresh off his triumph as a comic-strip artist and with a big assist from Fauvism's heated palette -- and for the hand-carved and painted toylike figures and buildings that may be his most original response to Cubism. But the show diligently emphasizes the stiltedly mystical Cubified landscapes into which Feininger's painting style hardened after 1918. There's too little evidence of the photographs, woodcuts and pencil sketches that, with the carved sculptures, kept his natural, urbane lightness alive. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'More Than That: Films by Kevin Jerome Everson' (through Sept. 18) These 17 brief films about ordinary African-American life are completely unordinary (and here, not always about African-Americans; one stars a hive of bees). Some seem to be purely archival and topical, others simply and casually anecdotal, though as one quickly learns, ''pure,'' ''simple'' and ''casual'' are not words in Mr. Everson's aesthetic vocabulary. He is an astoundingly prolific artist; the time is not far off when he'll need an entire museum. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: Uptown
- Lyonel Feininger: 'Drawings and Watercolors from the Julie Feininger Estate' (through Oct. 15) On the occasion of the Feininger retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a gallery long involved with his career presents a parallel survey of works on paper from his widow's estate. It compensates for some of the museum show's shortcomings, most impressively with a gratifying profusion of small, lively woodcut prints from 1918-23 that will be unfamiliar to most viewers. Moeller Fine Art New York, 36 East 64th Street, (212) 644-2133, moellerfineart.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
- 'La Carte d'Apres Nature' (through Oct. 8) Using the Belgian painter Rene Magritte as a kind of divining rod, this show, organized by artist Thomas Demand (a version of one seen last year at the Nouveau Musee National de Monaco), finds surrealism in some unlikely places. Among the objects on view are three paintings by Magritte; 19th-century landscape photographs by the German artist August Kotzsch; 1970s shots of parkgoing tourists by the Italian artist Luigi Ghirri; and an architectural model from the 1967 Montreal Expo. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
Jay Critchley: 'Deep Bones' / Chad Person: 'A Hero Never Fails' (through Sept. 10) Two Cassandras in separate but complementary shows decry our addictions to oil, drugs and competition. Mr. Critchley has mummified, Egyptian-style, a whole '70s-era sports car using plastic bags instead of fabric as wrapping. Mr. Person offers faux folk signs that say things like ''Resign'' and ''Accept Less,'' as well as a depressed-looking inflatable representing the cartoon character Underdog. Freight + Volume, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 691-7700, freightandvolume.com. (Johnson)
'Heads With Tails' (through Sept. 9) This diverting late-summer show, organized by West Street Gallery, inserts early video works by William Wegman into a mix of contemporary paintings, drawings and sculptures. Silliness and sobriety trade off in these mostly small works, which can't really match Mr. Wegman's eager yet deadpan humor. Harris Lieberman, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com. (Rosenberg)
- 'Sigmar Polke: Photoworks, 1964-2000' (through Sept. 10) If this genius of postwar German art, who died last summer at 69, had made no paintings, his wide-ranging photographic work would have assured him a prominent place in history. That's proven by this generous survey -- the first in New York devoted to Polke's photography, the medium perfectly suited his mercurial sensibility. He exploited its ease, immateriality and darkroom processes; spiked it with his works in other mediums (as well as himself); and used it to make his every activity an occasion for making art. His talent for making something from nothing is never more magical. Leo Koenig Inc., 545 West 23rd Street, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com. (Smith)
Galleries: SoHo
'The Atomic Explosion: A Collection of Vintage Photographs' (through Sept. 2) This show gathers 66 images of American nuclear tests and detonations, most of them conducted at the Nevada Test Site and on the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and '50s. The massing mushroom clouds in these images, photographed from miles away, are made to seem benignly organic. A giant portobello rises over Bikini Atoll; slender enokis sprout in Nevada. The news-service captions on many of the prints feel just as innocuous; one compares a double-capped cloud to ''a giant dumbbell.'' Peter Blum SoHo, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Other
- Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych and Selected Works at the German Consulate General' (through Sept. 15) The shining star of this exhibition is ''The Fulbright Triptych,'' a little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Andra Ursuta: 'Vandal Lust' (through Sept. 4) For her much-improved second solo show, this young, Romanian-born artist pays tribute to Ilya Kabakov's dream of Eastern bloc escape, the 1984 installation ''The Man Who Flew Into Space From His Apartment,'' by imagining a similar attempt using a medieval catapult. The plan's failure is evident in a dented wall and a life-size mannequin of the artist crumpled on the floor. Looming over her, the catapult itself is a bizarre, cobbled-together assemblage of materials, scales and odd intimations. For all its brutishness, it conjures delicate architectural miniaturization, a network of tiny hallways clogged with stuff and redolent of stymied lives. Ramiken Crucible, 389 Grand Street, near Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (917) 434-4245, ramikencrucible.com. (Smith)
Public Art
'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center -- the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley -- is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island, govisland.com. (Rosenberg)
Out Of Town
'Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964-1977' (through Oct. 31) Already influential at the time of his unexpected death, at 33, in 1977, the German artist Blinky Palermo (born Peter Schwarze) has come to seem essential to an art world obsessed with painting by means other than paint. Much, therefore, is expected of his first full-dress survey in North America. Split between two institutions and further subdivided by medium (cloth pictures and wall drawings at Bard, metal paintings at Dia), the show feels choppy but true to Palermo's geographic and artistic schisms. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diaart.org; Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Rosenberg)
- Portland Museum of Art: 'John Marin: Modernism at Midcentury' (through Oct. 10) This excellent show focuses on the last two decades of Marin, a painter whom many at the time -- the '30s and '40s -- considered the greatest living American artist. It presents 50 watercolors and oil paintings picturing views around his Cape Split, Me., summer home; his Cliffiside, N.J., winter residence; and Manhattan. Some of the works update Winslow Homer's naturalism, but most teeter on the brink of Cubist-Expressionist abstraction. All are impetuously energetic. 7 Congress Square, Portland, Me., (207) 775-6148, portlandmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute: 'Pissarro's People' (through Oct. 2) The Impressionist Camille Pissarro was, by temperament and belief, a welcomer of people and ideals, and there's an embracing feel to this modest, open-hearted exhibition of paintings and works on paper that demonstrates how central a role the human presence was in the work of an artist usually associated with landscapes. Pissarro's idealism was insistent, sometimes to the point of making his art look bland. But his ethical generosity shines through like good karma and makes him an artist to love. 225 South Street, Williamstown, Mass., (413) 458-2303, clarkart.edu. (Cotter)
Last Chance
- 'Beautiful Vagabonds: Birds in Contemporary Photography, Sound and Video' (closes on Friday) For some tweeting that has absolutely nothing to do with microblogs, here's a summer group show that alternates nature and artifice in images of some of the most beautiful beings on earth. The best work is the most straightforward and includes Barbara Bosworth's almost impossibly tender shot of an indigo bunting, a tiny concentration of cerulean nestled in a woman's hand. Yancey Richardson Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646) 230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Cotter)
'Dara Birnbaum: Arabesque' (closes on Friday) This veteran media artist's latest show at the gallery explores the intertwined careers and divergent legacies of the husband-and-wife Romantic composers Robert and Clara Schumann. The title piece is a large, multichannel video installation that samples clips of piano performances from YouTube and stills from the maudlin 1947 biopic about the Schumanns, ''Song of Love''; it offers both weepy melodrama and clear-eyed commentary on the reception of artistic genius. Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, mariangoodman.com. (Rosenberg)
'Circle of Friends: Paintings, Drawings, and Sculptures by Robert Arneson, Joan Brown, Roy DeForest, Peter Saul, and William T. Wiley' (closes on Friday) Bringing a frequently overlooked portion of postwar American art into view, this lively group show zeroes in on five artists who started out together in the San Francisco Bay area in the 1950s and '60s and were most famously affiliated with the free-style, irreverent California Funk tendency. From a common ground that included a taste for popular culture, figuration and a certain tactility, as well a sly alertness to Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism, they developed robustly distinct sensibilities that are represented here mostly by excellent, little-seen examples.

- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (closes on Sunday) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'Hiroshima: Ground Zero 1945' (closes on Sunday) The contact prints and photographs in this show were made in connection with the 1947 United States Strategic Bombing Survey of Hiroshima and depict the cataclysmic devastation in unflinching detail. The survey texts that accompany the images may appear shockingly clinical. The caption on a picture of a library, or what remains of it, reads: ''Interior first story showing contents damage and spalling of cement plaster by fire. Note all books reduced to ashes.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Rosenberg)
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (closes on Friday) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)
'Magic for Beginners' (closes on Saturday) When the future is unclear, it helps to look back -- or sideways. A corner piece by Scott Hug, in which a silhouetted figure reaches out to touch his own dark reflection in a black mirror, evokes Modernist self-reflexivity. Jennifer Cohen's Constructivist-style sculptures have toes and a finger added. Brent Stewart riffs on John Baldessari's photo-collages. Jesse McLean's psychedelic video revolves around childhood obsessions with the video game Tron and Leonardo DiCaprio. PPOW, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1044, ppowgallery.com. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (closes on Sunday) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (closes on Sunday) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'Charles Atlas: Joints Array' (closes on Sunday) From 1970 to 1983, the filmmaker Charles Atlas and the choreographer Merce Cunningham produced 10 examples of ''media dance'' -- filmed snippets of Cunningham's wrist, elbow, ankle and knee in motion. After Cunningham's death in 2009, Mr. Atlas created this work from those experiments, and it's now showing on almost two dozen monitors in the museum's lobby. Bringing abstraction to a performance medium once dominated by narrative was one of Mr. Cunningham's goals, and Mr. Atlas honors it. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (closes on Sunday) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' is a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)
'Soft Machines' (closes on Friday) This intermittently interesting show includes a video by the young Chinese artist Ma Qiusha, in which she tells how her parents pressured her to succeed as an artist; it ends with her removing a bloody razor blade from her mouth. A painting by Holton Rower resembles a giant tree slice with psychedelically colorized rings. And Sterling Ruby's pair of pointy-toothed mouths made of stuffed, stars-and-stripes-patterned fabric is like a Bread and Puppet theater prop. Pace, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Johnson)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: 'SIGMAR POLKE: PHOTOWORKS, 1964-2000': (through Sept. 10) If this genius of postwar German art, who died last summer at 69, had made no paintings, his wide-ranging photographic work would have assured him a prominent place in history. That's proved by this generous survey, the first in New York devoted to Polke's photography, the medium perfectly suited his mercurial sensibility. He exploited its ease, immateriality and darkroom processes
spiked it with his works in other mediums
 and used it to make his every activity an occasion for making art. His talent for making something from nothing is never more magical. (Above, an untitled work from 1964-68.)

HEADLINE: In Korea, The Game Of Trading Has Rules

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Is finance a game, or is it much more important than that?
It should be something else entirely. Finance ought to provide an economy with an efficient means of allocating capital. It should provide a means of price discovery of assets, whether real or financial. It should provide a safe and reliable payments system. Financial innovations are worthwhile if, and only if, they help in those areas.
All too often, players see financial innovations as providing ways to manipulate the system and make money off less savvy traders. If the players are caught, the scheme is usually deemed too complicated and wrongdoing too hard to prove to justify any more than a civil case. That ends in a fine -- sometimes a large one -- but perhaps one that may be seen as a cost of doing business.
In South Korea, they seem to be adopting a different attitude. 
This week prosecutors in Seoul announced indictments on market manipulation charges of a Korean affiliate of Deutsche Bank and of four Deutsche Bank employees who were blamed for intentionally causing a sudden collapse in Korean stock prices last November.
In a separate case in June, two former Credit Suisse employees were indicted by Korean prosecutors on charges of manipulating stock prices. The bank itself was not charged with a crime.
People could go to prison for playing market games.
The Deutsche Bank case sounds like a classic example of people knowing how to profit from a game and having no appreciation at all of the larger dimension of what they planned to do. The game caused the Korean stock market to tumble in the last few minutes of trading last Nov. 11. That happened to be the same day the leaders of the Group of 20 nations were meeting -- in Seoul.
Having its market crumble for no apparent reason with world leaders and world press in town was more than a little embarrassing to the Koreans, and they began immediate investigations.
The names of the Deutsche Bank employees involved have not been publicly disclosed. But only one of them is based in Korea, with three in Hong Kong. The Koreans sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission about another Deutsche employee, who is based in New York, but he was not indicted.
The traders probably paid little attention to the plans for the Group of 20 meeting. They chose Nov. 11 because it was a day when stock index options and futures expired. They had a way to make a lot of money with little if any financial risk.
The strategy did not involve taking positions based on expectations of corporate performance, or the path of the Korean economy, or interest rates, or anything that matters to the real economy. In other words, it had nothing to do with the legitimate functions of finance.
Here's what prosecutors claim took place. The Deutsche Bank traders established a huge index-arbitrage position, and placed a huge side bet on prices falling. Then they closed out the arbitrage position in a way designed to cause prices to collapse. They cleaned up.
In the more formal language that Korean market regulators used in their report, the traders ''constructed speculative derivatives positions in advance through the combination of short synthetic futures and long put options.'' Then in the final 10 minutes of trading on Nov. 11, they sold $2.2 billion worth of stocks, selling every stock in the Kospi 200 index, which includes all major Korean stocks.
That selling had a huge impact. The Kospi 200 index fell 2.8 percent in those 10 minutes, providing $40.5 million in what the Koreans called ''illegal profits'' on the derivatives position, which settled based on the closing prices.
Ten minutes before the close, the Korean stock market was down only a very small amount from the previous day. At the close, it was the worst day in nine months.
Index arbitrage is supposed to be a neutral strategy. A trader buys stocks and sells the equivalent amount of stock index futures, taking advantage of small discrepancies in prices in the two markets. Or he sells the stocks and buys the future. Either way, at expiration, the two positions will be worth the same, and a small profit will be realized. The strategy used by Deutsche appears to have amounted to index arbitrage done in a way that local regulators might not see coming. A synthetic future uses options or forward contracts to replicate the financial position of normal futures contracts. Going synthetic can cost more, but it may also avoid margin requirements and regulatory disclosure rules on large positions.
Deutsche owned stock, and was short index futures -- or a synthetic equivalent. At the end of trading on Nov. 11, the price of the futures would be determined by closing prices of the shares. So if it sold the stock at closing prices, it would get the small profit it presumably locked in when it established the arbitrage positions.
But Deutsche then went ahead and also bought more index put options. Those puts would soar in value as prices plunged. That is where it presumably made most if not all of the $40.5 million.
If you were around American markets in the 1980s, this may have a familiar ring. It was called ''triple witching'' in those days, and prices sometimes gyrated wildly at the close. Markets learned how to deal with that, in part by paying close attention to how many futures and options contracts were expiring. They also set up ways to assure that large sale or purchase orders at the close would be unlikely to rattle markets.
It may be that the Deutsche traders chose to go synthetic to make it harder for local regulators and other traders to see what was coming. The market was clearly overwhelmed by the volume of sale orders at the end of the day.
It is worth noting how skinny the profits were -- 1.8 percent of the money involved. For anyone who had to put up margins and borrow money at normal rates, the profits would have been smaller, if there were any at all. But financial firms can borrow cheap and largely avoid margins because their positions are offsetting.
Deutsche Bank has not disputed Korea's claims of what happened, but it has tried to distance itself from the actions of its employees. It says all are now suspended or on leave, and may face disciplinary action.
''It is regrettable,'' the firm said in a statement, that prosecutors ''decided to charge the bank's local Korean brokerage unit, Deutsche Securities Korea. D.S.K. denies the charges, which will be defended. D.S.K. did not authorize or condone any breach of market regulation.''
Korean market regulators say they found evidence that the plan was hatched in Hong Kong, and carried out in part by the Korean operation. It says it did not find evidence the German headquarters knew of the plan. Deutsche says it is ''re-emphasizing its existing internal control systems,'' but stops short of admitting they failed in this case.
In the case against the former Credit Suisse traders, the charges claim that in 2005 and 2006 they purchased convertible bonds in small Korean companies on behalf of the bank. Publicity that such a prestigious bank was investing in the companies drove up the stock prices, and the traders then shorted the stocks, using shares borrowed from the companies themselves. The stocks fell back -- some were later delisted -- and the bank made profits. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the indictments.
Countries around the world felt called upon to bail out banks during the financial crisis. That made sense because a functioning financial system is necessary. But these kind of games are not necessary, whether or not they are criminal.
These charges provide an endorsement of the Volcker Rule, named for Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and included in the Dodd-Frank law in the United States, which sought to restrict proprietary trading by banks whose deposits are insured. If such games are to be played, let them be played by others.
It will be interesting to see what happens to those who were indicted in Korea -- and whether there even are trials. Only one of the Deutsche traders, and neither of the Credit Suisse traders, are in Korea, and they may not choose to attend trials.
A fine for Deutsche Securities Korea would be unlikely to have much of a deterrent effect, and you can't send a company to prison. Prison terms for the traders might have a real effect, especially if other countries were willing to extradite them. These cases should bring home to bosses of major financial firms that the great benefits they receive are there because of the real value a financial system can provide. Taking advantage of that favored position risks positioning markets not as efficient ways to allocate capital but as institutions that insiders can use to take advantage of others.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about a South Korean case involving market manipulations through trading in convertible bonds, referred imprecisely to the target of the accusations. While two former traders for Credit Suisse have been indicted, no charges have been filed against the bank. And a front-page capsule summary also misstated the targets. The accusations involved a Korean affiilate of Deutsche Bank and employees of both Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse; no charges have been filed against either bank.

HEADLINE: Doubts Still Harbored About Europe's Banks

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- European banks have become nervous about each other's creditworthiness, evoking memories of the mistrust that prevailed during the dark days of 2008.
European institutions are better armored for a crisis than they were in 2008, analysts say. But some still have doubts whether that armor is thick enough to withstand another big shock.
Despite progress in rehabilitating the financial system since then, analysts say, some gaps remain, among them the continued lack of any mechanism to deal with the failure of a large bank. 
And while regulators have pushed banks to reduce risk, bolster their reserves and become less dependent on fickle short-term financing, the measures were designed to be phased in over a decade. As a result, they still fall short of what some experts, particularly in the academic world, consider adequate.
''We should have solved these problems of the banking sector well before the last few months,'' said Harald A. Benink, a professor of banking and finance at Tilburg University in the Netherlands.
Numerous anxiety indicators, like emergency borrowing from the European Central Bank and the interest rates on short-term lending, have pointed to tension in the interbank lending market. In particular, there have been signs that some European institutions have had to pay more to borrow dollars.
''Without a doubt unsecured U.S. dollar funding markets have tightened somewhat recently,'' Andreas Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, acknowledged Wednesday. Money market funds in the United States ''have become more selective when providing funding to nondomestic banks,'' Mr. Dombret said.
But, like others who argue that fears of another crisis are overblown, Mr. Dombret says that banks are much better off than they were three years ago.
German banks, he said, have increased the capital they hold in reserve by about three percentage points since 2008, to an average of 12.6 percent of assets. That means they are better able to absorb losses if there is a surge in bad loans or the value of their government bonds declines.
''We are very far away from the situation we witnessed in 2008,'' Mr. Dombret said during an appearance at a Bundesbank office in New York, according to a text of his remarks. ''European banks, in general, have considerably improved their capital base, making them less vulnerable to financial strains.''
But some critics say that level of capital is still inadequate if there is another major crisis, especially for very large or interconnected banks that would spread destruction throughout the system if they failed.
Central bankers and regulators have made assiduous efforts to make the system less vulnerable to problems at these banks, known in regulatory jargon as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs. For example, the too-big-to-fail banks will be required to hold more capital in reserve than other banks. But in Europe few if any measures are in place.
''What we are doing is right, but it is taking too long,'' said Renato Maino, a former executive in the risk management department of the Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo, who is now a lecturer at the University of Torino. ''We didn't remove the main sources of our financial instability.''
Fear that another big bank failure is imminent may help explain why markets reacted so nervously when a single bank last week took advantage of a European Central Bank program aimed at preventing institutions from running short of dollars, as many did during the 2008 crisis. The unidentified bank borrowed $500 million for one week, the first time a bank tapped the central bank's credit line since February.
The sum was big enough to suggest the borrower was a large bank with a substantial business in the United States -- a SIFI, in other words.
That was one theory. Another, somewhat less alarming explanation was that the dollar-hungry bank was one of the German lenders notorious for buying American subprime assets before the real estate market crashed. These holdings are still on bank books and may need to be refinanced, creating a need for lots of dollars.
The uncertainty has contributed to sharp drops by shares of large European banks and may reflect investor fears that governments, already awash in debt, will not be able to finance another round of bank rescues.
The central bank is lending banks as much as they want for up to six months, provided the banks supply collateral. But the central bank is not set up to rescue a bank that is bankrupt.
''All the banks can borrow as much as they need, but at some point if it is a solvency problem, it is an issue for governments,'' said Dirk Schoenmaker, dean of the Duisenberg School of Finance in Amsterdam.
The financing problems that banks are experiencing are the result of the sovereign debt crisis, and growing fear that Italy and Spain may join the countries unable to pay their debts.
Several of the banks most badly battered by stock markets in recent weeks, like Societe Generale in France and Commerzbank in Germany, also have large holdings of Italian bonds, according to European regulators.
Government bond holdings have an insidious effect on the way banks are perceived by markets. Investors worry that the bonds will sustain losses. The bonds become less valuable as collateral in interbank lending transactions, forcing banks to use more costly forms of credit.
In addition, banks' credit ratings are closely tied to the credit rating of their home country, according to a study by the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse for the world's major central banks that is based in Basel, Switzerland.
So when rumors proliferated in early August that France might face a downgrade, French bank shares were punished.
The negative effects are amplified when banks look for financing in the United States, the Bank of International Settlements study said. This may reflect greater skepticism in the United States that the euro will survive.
Because so much interbank lending takes place in secret between institutions, even banking industry insiders have trouble telling which of their peers are short of cash.
''My guess is that the markets are overly nervous,'' Mr. Schoenmaker said. ''But,'' he added, ''markets are normally right.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as Hopes Fade for New Action by Fed and Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julia Werdigier and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Traders have been overwhelmed by the prospects of a global economic slowdown, a euro zone debt problem and other issues. On Thursday, there were new developments to contend with: the resignation of Steven P. Jobs as chief executive of Apple and the investment by Berkshire Hathaway, which is run by Warren E. Buffett, in Bank of America.
The two surprises also came as investors were trying to align their expectations for Friday's address by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, at a symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. 
In the first three trading days of this week, stocks have gained as many investors bet there would be some message, at the least, on possible stimulus measures. But by Thursday, hopes of some new action seemed to wane, and the broader market fell more than 1.5 percent by the end of the day.
Michael A. Mullaney, vice president at the Fiduciary Trust Company, said word was circulating that such an announcement was ''not going to be in the cards tomorrow.''
''That's what I think is really driving it right now,'' he said.
The news that Mr. Buffett had made the investment in Bank of America preferred stock took place before the opening bell on Wall Street, sending futures higher. The stock rose as high as $8.80, a 27 percent gain, but then retreated. Bank of America closed at $7.65, up just over 9 percent, and the financial sector in general lost 0.4 percent.
The injection from Mr. Buffett ''should dampen the heightened volatility'' in recent trading of the stock, said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura. He said it was a ''clear vote of confidence for the stability of Bank of America's franchise.''
But markets fell sharply soon after the opening. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 18.33 points, or 1.56 percent, at 1,159.27, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 170.89 points, or 1.5 percent, at 11,149.82. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell nearly 2 percent to 2,419.63.
Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, said there did not appear to be any specific event that had set the afternoon's sharp decline in motion.
''I suppose it is the effect, maybe, of second thoughts about extending positions in the event that there is a disappointment,'' Mr. Hembre said, referring to Mr. Bernanke's speech on Friday.
Apple stock fell 0.7 percent to close at $373.72. Late Wednesday, Mr. Jobs, who had been on a medical leave, announced his resignation as chief executive.
''Based on the share reaction, we believe that investors had been bracing for this,'' said William Kreher, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones. ''In a strange way, this does create some certainty,'' he said, adding that the stock had a buy rating.
Gold, usually a safe haven asset, continued to fall, partly because of a rise in margin requirements. But it firmed late in the day, and settled at $1,759.80 an ounce. Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy at Glenmede, said the metal had been overpriced recently.
Mr. Pride said that there was enough risk of slow growth that the chances for recession were ''higher than normal.''
''I think there is a lot of volatility right now because of all these uncertain factors we have,'' he said.
The 10-year Treasury price rose 17/32 to 99 1/32 and the yield fell to 2.23 percent, from 2.29 percent late Wednesday.
The outlook for the economy soured somewhat on Thursday when a government report showed that new claims for unemployment benefits in the United States rose more than expected last week, lifted mostly by striking Verizon Communications workers.
In Europe, markets lost ground through the afternoon, while Asia-Pacific indexes closed up more than 1 percent.
''People are becoming a little more cautious that maybe we don't get that big move'' from the Fed, said Edmund Shing, head of European equity strategy at Barclays Capital. The Euro Stoxx 50 index was 1 percent lower on Thursday, and France's CAC 40 index was down 0.7 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain closed off 1.4 percent and the DAX in Germany slid 1.7 percent.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed up 1.5 percent at 8,772.36 points, while the main indexes in Australia and South Korea added 1.1 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.
The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 1.5 percent, while the Shanghai composite index closed 2.9 percent higher.

Not long after doctors had determined in 1994 that Ronald Reagan was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, his wife, Nancy, found an unexpected ally. Casey Ribicoff was coping with the same mental decline in her husband, Abraham A. Ribicoff, the resolutely liberal former senator from Connecticut.
Despite the political gulf separating them, the two women formed a friendship through adversity. 
''We nourish each other,'' Mrs. Ribicoff told The Los Angeles Times in 1997, when she first spoke publicly about her husband's condition. ''We speak the same language. You can't begin to understand what living with this is like unless you do live with it, day in, day out. I don't know what I would do without Nancy.''
Mrs. Ribicoff, who died on Monday, was invariably described as elegant. She maintained dozens of such friendships as she moved through the upper circles of New York society and put her considerable influence at the service of nonprofit organizations like the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and WNET, the New York public television station.
She straddled the worlds of politics, fashion and culture, presiding over a fluid salon whose highly diverse membership she shaped with a general's sense of tactics and discipline, and an imposing sense of style.
Dressed in black, with bright red lipstick, red nails and heavy black glasses in the Diana Vreeland style, she held sway with a martini glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other.
She was a prescient supporter of American designers like James Galanos, Geoffrey Beene, Bill Blass and, more recently, Ralph Rucci, and, after years of being named to annual best-dressed lists, she was inducted into the International Best-Dressed Hall of Fame in 1988.
''She was just a great dame,'' Tom Brokaw, a friend, said. ''She knew everything that was going on in New York. She knew the social gossip, and she had real insights about Manhattan's politics, economics and culture.''
Mrs. Ribicoff died at her home in Manhattan at 88. The cause was lung cancer, her son, Peter Mathes, said.
Mrs. Ribicoff met her husband in 1962 when he was the secretary of health, education and welfare in the Kennedy administration and gearing up for his first senatorial campaign.
''I had followed Abe's career for many years,'' she told The Boston Globe in 1976. ''I knew he was a nut on auto safety, an initial supporter of Ralph Nader's consumerism and an early listener to Rachel Carson's environmental theories. There was definitely no lag in the conversation.''
The two hit it off, kept in touch and, after the death of Mr. Ribicoff's first wife, Ruth, who had been seriously ill for 15 years, began a romantic relationship. To keep the press in the dark, Lois, as she was then known, used the code name ''Dr. Casey'' -- suggested by the television series ''Ben Casey'' -- when leaving messages at Mr. Ribicoff's office.
Mr. Ribicoff began using it, and it stuck. The two married in 1972.
When Mr. Ribicoff, who died in 1998, decided not to run again for the Senate after three terms, he and his wife moved to Manhattan. Good-looking and socially adept, they became highly sought-after dinner guests, and Mrs. Ribicoff emerged as a social leader, with a high-powered coterie of intimates that included Nancy Kissinger, Barbara Walters, Annette de la Renta, Dominick Dunne and Mr. Blass.
Lois Ruth Mell was born on Dec. 5, 1922, in Chicago, where her father was a prosperous businessman. She studied psychology at the University of Chicago. An early marriage to a Chicago lawyer ended in divorce.
After moving to Miami, where her father had retired, she met and married A. Herbert Mathes, a noted architect, and became active in civic affairs. She was president of the ladies' auxiliary of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach and in 1963 became the first woman to be elected to its board of trustees.
In addition to her son, Peter, of Los Angeles, she is survived by a sister, June Herbert of Indianapolis, and three grandchildren.
Mrs. Ribicoff epitomized the blend of night-life glamour and civic duty that keeps New York's elite in constant motion and charitable causes afloat. Jimmy Carter named her to the board of the Kennedy Center, a position she held for 20 years. She also served on the board of WNET for more than 20 years. With Bill Blass, Judy Peabody and Glenn Bernbaum, she founded the AIDS Care Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.
As a principal executor of Mr. Blass's estate, she helped organize sales of his collections that raised millions for the AIDS Care Center and the department of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
''She was up on everything,'' said the biographer A. Scott Berg. ''Not just the news but every play or film or book, which she'd either seen or read or knew the director or the author. You didn't hold the attention of people like Henry Kissinger, Felix Rohatyn and Henry Grunwald just because you were decorative.''

HEADLINE: Leaving Regrets To Others, Cheney Speaks

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
IN MY TIME
A Personal and Political Memoir
By Dick Cheney with Liz Cheney
Illustrated. 565 pages. Threshold Editions. $35.
In an interview on NBC's ''Dateline,'' former Vice President Dick Cheneysays that his new book, ''In My Time,'' will have ''heads exploding all over Washington.'' Whatever readers think of Mr. Cheney's politics, their heads are more likely to explode from frustration than from any sense of revelation. Indeed, the memoir -- delivered in dry, often truculent prose -- turns out to be mostly a predictable mix of spin, stonewalling, score settling and highly selective reminiscences. 
The book, written with his daughter Liz, reiterates Mr. Cheney's aggressive approach to foreign policy and his hard-line views on national security, while sidestepping questions about many of the Bush administration's more controversial decisions, either by cherry-picking information (much the way critics say the White House cherry-picked intelligence in making the case to go to war against Iraq) or by hopping and skipping over awkward subjects with loudly voiced assertions. It's ironic that Mr. Cheney -- who succeeded in promulgating so many of his policy ideas through his sheer mastery of bureaucratic detail -- should have written a book that is often so lacking in detail that it feels like a blurred photograph.
Mr. Cheney writes that ''the liberation of Iraq'' was ''one of the most significant accomplishments of George Bush's presidency'' -- never mind the failure to find the weapons of mass destruction that were cited as a chief reason for the invasion, or a botched occupation that allowed an insurgency to metastasize for years. He describes Guantanamo as ''a model facility -- safe, secure, and humane'' and writes that the C.I.A.'s program of ''enhanced interrogation techniques'' was ''safe, legal, and effective.'' As for Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Cheney praises President Bush for ''personally'' dedicating ''hundreds of hours not only to ensuring an effective federal response but to reaching out to people who needed to know that their government cared about them.''
The famously tight-lipped Mr. Cheney does serve up some interesting tidbits in these pages. We learn that the ''undisclosed locations'' at which he spent so much time were often Camp David or the vice president's residence; that he wrote a letter of resignation dated March 28, 2001, and told an aide to give it to the president were he ever to suffer a heart attack or stroke that left him incapacitated; and that he spent several weeks unconscious in 2010 after heart surgery.
In addition to genuinely moving accounts of his health difficulties, there are some affectionate portraits of family members in these pages, and an apology of sorts to his friend Harry Whittington, whom he shot in the face while quail hunting: ''I, of course, was deeply sorry for what Harry and his family had gone through. The day of the hunting accident was one of the saddest of my life.''
On substantive matters of policy, however, this volume tends to rehash well-known debates even as it circumvents important questions. Mr. Cheney offers no real explanation for why the Bush administration did not do more to try to prevent the 9/11 attacks, given the warnings from the counterterrorism czar, Richard A. Clarke, and an Aug. 6, 2001, intelligence brief titled ''Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.''
He does not explain why he said in 1994 that the United States was right not to go all the way to Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War because that would have resulted in ''a quagmire,'' but foresaw no such complications in 2003. And while Mr. Cheney discusses how his views on the importance of executive power developed during the Iran-Contra scandal, he sheds little light on how he and his legal adviser and chief of staff, David S. Addington, would set about realizing this doctrine after 9/11.
George W. Bush, Mr. Cheney writes, ''had a strong sense of his own strengths and weaknesses,'' and in a vice president was looking ''for someone who could help him govern, a person with experience in the kind of national security and foreign policy issues he knew every president must face.''
One of the few insights he delivers here about his own role as Oval Office gatekeeper -- as the one who framed policy choices for ''the decider'' -- concerns the President's Daily Brief, or P.D.B., ''which contains reports on the most critical intelligence issues of the day.''
Mr. Cheney recalls that he was usually briefed around 6:30 a.m., before joining the president for his briefing; in addition to the material the president got, Mr. Cheney received extra material, including ''responses to questions I'd asked or items my briefers knew I was interested in''; on at least one occasion, he says, he would have the briefer add some of this bonus material to what the president saw.
In the last years of the Bush administration, the power of the most powerful vice president in history waned, as his predictions about Iraq turned sour, as the Supreme Court repudiated the White House on executive power and detainee rights, and as Mr. Cheney's own approval ratings slid to 13 percent. The man whom Karl Rove nicknamed ''Management'' (as in ''better check with Management'') and whom the C.I.A. referred to as Edgar (as in Edgar Bergen, puppet master of Charlie McCarthy) began to take a back seat to more moderate voices in the administration, like Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, whom Mr. Cheney depicts in these pages as naive and inexperienced in her efforts to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with North Korea.
In fact, the tartest sections of this book reflect Mr. Cheney's frustration when things did not go his way. Although he is, for the most part, complimentary about President Bush (hailing him as ''a visceral and forthright commander'' who ''strengthened all of us with his conviction''), he assumes a faintly patronizing tone in talking about cases in which Mr. Bush failed to take his advice: rejecting, say, his recommendation in June 2007 that the United States bomb a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site to send ''an important message not only to the Syrians and North Koreans, but also to the Iranians.''
In addition, Mr. Cheney gripes that the president's siding with Ms. Rice on questions relating to North Korea seemed ''out of keeping with the clearheaded way I'd seen him make decisions in the past,'' and notes that Mr. Bush did not consult him in late 2006 about naming Robert M. Gates to replace Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, whom he'd previously described to the president as ''doing a tremendous job.''
Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld had been friends and operational allies since their days together in the Ford administration (where the two honed their skills at bureaucratic maneuvering), and in these pages Mr. Cheney remains firmly in denial about the Pentagon's mishandling of the Iraq war, from Mr. Rumsfeld's determination to conduct it on the cheap with a light, fast force, which proved insufficient to restore law and order, to his reluctance to correct course later on.
The former vice president tries to focus blame on the State Department for the lack of postwar planning, even though it has been widely reported that its Future of Iraq blueprints were sidelined by the Pentagon, and he insists that he thought the insurgents were ''in the last throes'' in 2005, even though there had been myriad warnings from both military and civilian sources that things were spiraling out of control.
Just as reporters and former administration insiders have noted that dissenting opinions tended to be unwelcome in the Bush White House, so Mr. Cheney demonstrates here a distinct antipathy toward people who opposed him on matters of policy. Colin L. Powell -- who clashed with Mr. Cheney over Iraq and who was characterized in one of Bob Woodward's books as thinking that ''Cheney took intelligence and converted uncertainty and ambiguity into fact'' -- is repeatedly dissed in this volume. Mr. Cheney says he ''thought it was for the best'' that President Bush had accepted Mr. Powell's resignation as secretary of state in 2004; he says that Mr. Powell handled policy differences not by voicing objections in meetings, but ''by criticizing administration policy to people outside the government.''
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who opposed the big tax cuts favored by Mr. Cheney, is treated similarly brusquely -- much the way he was dismissed from his job in December 2002. Mr. Cheney does not discuss Mr. O'Neill's concern that such tax cuts might lead to a dangerous deficit; rather, he makes the following odd argument, which ratifies other administration insiders' views that the policy-making process in the Bush administration was both dysfunctional and ad hoc:
''Economic policy was being run out of the White House, and meetings to make big decisions often did not include the Treasury secretary. O'Neill should have demanded -- as Hank Paulson would later demand -- to be included in any White House meeting about economic policy. On the other hand, either the president or I could have said: 'Where's O'Neill? We should not be having this meeting without the treasury secretary.' ''
During Mr. Cheney's tenure as vice president, there was considerable discussion among journalists and his former colleagues about whether the man who'd once worked for Gerald Ford and George Herbert Walker Bush had changed over the years -- becoming more hawkish, more ideological or more given to doomsday scenarios -- because of his multiple heart attacks, because he'd made common cause with neo-conservatives, or simply because his political views had evolved.
Mr. Cheney maintains in this book that he hasn't changed at all, that it's the world that has changed since 9/11. He also says he told Mr. Bush, then governor, during discussions about his joining the ticket that ''he needed to understand how deeply conservative I was: He said, 'Dick, we know that.' And I said, 'No, I mean really conservative.' ''

HEADLINE: Buffett to Invest $5 Billion In Shaky Bank of America

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, the legendary investor, is sinking $5 billion into Bank of America in a bold show of faith in the country's biggest, and most beleaguered, financial institution. It comes amid deepening worries about the long-term health of the company, which has already had to set aside roughly $20 billion to atone for its mortgage misdeeds at the height of the housing bubble.
Bank of America's problems are emblematic of the economic woes facing the country in general and the housing market in particular. Its fortunes have been waning as the outlook for growth has darkened and the financial markets have gyrated.
More than some other large banks, Bank of America's fate is also heavily intertwined with that of consumers. It services one in five home loans, and with 5,700 branches assembled through decades of mergers, it counts 58 million customers. 
The losses suffered by the bank -- $9 billion over the last 18 months -- have spurred worries about just how solid its foundations are and raised fears that it will need tens of billions of dollars in fresh capital. Bank executives insist that that is not the case, and they were quick to trumpet Mr. Buffett's move as a crucial show of support for a management team, especially the chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan.
''In the shaky couple of weeks that we've gone through in the financial markets, it's a good time for this vote of confidence by a savvy investor,'' said Charles O. Holliday Jr., the bank's chairman. ''We didn't need the capital, but it doesn't hurt to have more in a volatile time.''
Even as investors cheered Mr. Buffett's investment, lifting the bank's shares more than 9 percent, analysts cautioned that it did not address more fundamental problems that will take years to correct. Moreover, it does little to lift the uncertainty over how much the company will ultimately have to pay to angry investors holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of soured mortgage securities. Also hanging over the company is the prospect of a multibillion-dollar mortgage settlement with the government.
''This is a good endorsement but it's no silver bullet,'' said Michael Mayo, a bank analyst with Credit Agricole in New York. ''Bank of America got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval and Buffett got a sweetheart deal, but the company hasn't been able to get its arms around the magnitude of the losses.''
The bulk of those losses stem from the company's disastrous acquisition of Countrywide Financial in 2008, the subprime lender whose reckless lending policies have made it a symbol of the housing bubble. Mr. Moynihan's predecessor, Kenneth D. Lewis, paid $4 billion for Countrywide. It has already cost the company more than $30 billion.
To offset that red ink and strengthen the bank's capital position, Mr. Moynihan has sold more than $30 billion worth of assets since the start of 2010, most recently unloading its Canadian credit card business and a portfolio of commercial real estate.
Bank of America shares have been pounded in recent weeks amid deepening worries about just how much the mortgage mess will eventually cost the bank, how the downshift in the economy will crimp earnings and whether it can absorb losses without having to raise more capital.
Earlier this week, the stock dropped to its lowest point since the aftermath of the financial crisis, and nearly 30 percent below where it began the month.
Other banks' stocks have dropped, too, but the speed of the descent and the surge in the cost of insuring the company's debt awakened memories of the financial crisis, when companies like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers found themselves short of capital.
Bank of America's capital position is much stronger than it was going into the financial crisis -- it held $218 billion at the end of the second quarter by one key measure, but was still behind peers like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.
Still, some investors do not trust the bank's numbers. The bank has already had to rapidly add to its reserves to pay out claims from investors in its mortgage securities -- jumping to $18 billion by the end of the second quarter in June from $4 billion at the beginning of 2010.
The company has said it could face another $5 billion in claims from private investors and insurance companies that guaranteed the mortgage securities.
''They're the poster child for the unknown,'' said Brian Wenzinger, a principal at Aronson Johnson Ortiz, a Philadelphia money management firm. ''Nobody knows where it ends.''
Nor have Mr. Moynihan or his team had much luck persuading investors that the bank's problems were in the rearview mirror.
In addition to the asset sales, Mr. Moynihan disclosed last week that the company planned to cut at least 3,500 jobs in the coming months. He also held an unusual conference call with investors earlier this month, in an effort to convince skeptics that the bank was on track. In June, he offered $8.5 billion to settle claims from investors who held soured mortgages.
But rather than limit liability, that proposed settlement has only spurred fears of more litigation and multibillion-dollar payouts. A $10 billion lawsuit by the insurance giant American International Group filed earlier this month to recover losses on mortgage-backed securities intensified fears that angry litigants were turning Bank of America into a money pit.
''I am surprised that plaintiffs' hyperbolic allegations and inflated damage claims are given any credence,'' said the bank's top lawyer, Gary Lynch. ''Sophisticated investors who bring securities actions have huge burdens to overcome, and courts rightfully have been limiting many of their claims.''
It is not only the holders of bad mortgage securities that are seeking tens of billions in compensation for the housing mess. All 50 state attorneys general, as well as the federal government, are in the final stages of negotiating a settlement with the nation's biggest mortgage servicers that could ultimately total $20 billion to $30 billion. As the nation's largest servicer, Bank of America is expected to take the biggest hit.
More than any of the legal entanglements, the arc of the overall economy will determine Bank of America's fortunes and those of Mr. Buffett. Bank of America holds nearly $300 billion worth of mortgages and home equity loans on its books, and a further decline in the housing market or rising unemployment that feeds more delinquencies could keep the red ink flowing for years.
Given Bank of America's size and its overall capital position, ''five billion isn't that huge a number,'' said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. ''But Mr. Buffett can afford to take the long view and collect a 6 percent coupon in the meantime.''
Thursday's deal came together with extraordinary speed and secrecy. Mr. Buffett has a reputation as a savior for companies in trouble, like a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs after the collapse of Lehman in 2008. Less than 24 hours after Mr. Buffett's call to Mr. Moynihan to propose the investment at 11 a.m. Wednesday, the bank's board met by phone at 7 a.m. Thursday to approve it.
Mr. Buffett's investment entitles him to $300 million a year in interest and the right to buy 700 million shares of the company at $7.14 each -- already a bargain with the stock closing at $7.65 on Thursday.
Bank of America does have some highly profitable businesses, like the former Merrill Lynch, which is now at the heart of its investment banking unit. But even that business has slowed down recently with the volatility on Wall Street and lower trading volumes earlier in the year. Other good news, like better results in its mammoth credit card business, has also been drowned out by all the speculation over future losses.
The speculation on Wall Street grew so intense that the company sent a memo to employees on Tuesday assuring them that a capital increase was not necessary, while specifically shooting down rumors that a merger with JPMorgan Chase was under consideration. It called the talk baseless and said it didn't ''even make practical sense.''
Mr. Holliday, the chairman, acknowledged the challenges facing the bank, notwithstanding Mr. Buffett's investment.
''This could be a momentum changer for us,'' he said. ''But I'm not suggesting there's a quick fix. There's no magic wand.''

HEADLINE: A Lifeline for Homeowners: There will be pushback, but the White House should embrace a refinancing plan

 BODY:
Help may finally be on the way for borrowers stuck in high-interest-rate mortgages. Shaila Dewan and Louise Story reported in The Times that the White House is considering a proposal that would ease refinancings for millions of underwater homeowners whose loans are owned or backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage companies. 
It's a good idea, and, properly executed, the benefits would exceed any risks. The biggest question is President Obama's willingness to battle the inevitable opposition.
Fannie, Freddie and investors in the agencies' securities don't want to see their interest income fall. Republican leaders are determined to block anything that Mr. Obama proposes -- even if millions of Americans, and the overall economy, would benefit. It is not even clear if the president's entire economic team is on board; when the idea was floated last year, the administration balked.
The basic notion is to ease refinancing rules for borrowers who are current in their payments but can't qualify for new lower-rate loans because their home values have declined. The looser loan standards would not increase the risk of default. By lowering the borrowers' monthly payments, refinancing would make default less likely. It would also free up potentially tens of billions of dollars for consumer spending, helping to ensure that today's low interest rates stimulate the economy as intended. It could even help underwater borrowers restore equity in their homes if borrowers used some of their savings to pay down their loan principal.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, may well object that such refinancings would cost the companies money. It is true that they would collect less interest income on refinanced loans. But some or all of the lost income would be offset by lower default rates. The public benefit from fewer defaults and foreclosures -- along with the impact of more consumer spending -- should trump any benefit derived from squeezing every last penny of interest from homeowners.
Investors in mortgage-backed securities would also collect less on refinanced loans. So be it. Those securities pay a higher rate than many other bonds precisely because of the refinancing risk. The investor losses would also be dispersed over a large, global market.
Refinancings are not a magic bullet. Homeowners facing foreclosure, often because of unemployment, need help as well in order for the housing market, and broader economy, to recover. But timely refinancings could help -- if Mr. Obama is willing to push for them.

HEADLINE: Bernanke's Perry Problem

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As I write this, investors around the world are anxiously awaiting Ben Bernanke's speech at the annual Fed gathering at Jackson Hole, Wyo. They want to know whether Mr. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will unveil new policies that might lift the U.S. economy out of what is looking more and more like a quasi-permanent state of depressed demand and high unemployment.
But I'll be shocked if Mr. Bernanke proposes anything significant -- that is, anything likely to make any serious dent in unemployment or offer any serious boost to growth. 
Why don't I expect much from Mr. Bernanke? In two words: Rick Perry.
O.K., I don't mean that Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, is personally standing in the way of effective monetary policy. Not yet, anyway. Instead, I'm using Mr. Perry -- who has famously threatened Mr. Bernanke with dire personal consequences if he pursues expansionary monetary policy before the 2012 election -- as a symbol of the political intimidation that is killing our last remaining hope for economic recovery.
To see what I'm talking about, let's ask what policies the Fed actually should be pursuing right now.
Obviously, the U.S. economy remains deeply depressed, and under normal conditions we would expect the Fed to pump it up by cutting interest rates. But the interest rates the Fed normally targets -- basically rates on short-term U.S. government debt -- are already near zero. So what can the Fed do?
Well, in 2000 an economist named Ben Bernanke offered a number of proposals for policy at the ''zero lower bound.'' True, the paper was focused on policy in Japan, not the United States. But America is now very much in a Japan-type economic trap, only more acute. So we learn a lot by asking why Ben Bernanke 2011 isn't taking the advice of Ben Bernanke 2000.
Back then, Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Bank of Japan could get Japan's economy moving with a variety of unconventional policies. These could include: purchases of long-term government debt (to push interest rates, and hence private borrowing costs, down); an announcement that short-term interest rates would stay near zero for an extended period, to further reduce long-term rates; an announcement that the bank was seeking moderate inflation, ''setting a target in the 3-4% range for inflation, to be maintained for a number of years,'' which would encourage borrowing and discourage people from hoarding cash; and ''an attempt to achieve substantial depreciation of the yen,'' that is, to reduce the yen's value in terms of other currencies.
Was Mr. Bernanke on the right track? I think so -- as well I should, since his paper was partly based on my own earlier work. So why isn't the Fed pursuing the agenda its own chairman once recommended for Japan?
Part of the answer is internal dissension. Two weeks ago, the committee that sets monetary policy declared that conditions ''are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013'' -- that is, it didn't even promise to keep rates low, it just offered an observation about what the state of the economy is likely to be. Yet, even so, the statement faced serious internal opposition, with three inflation hawks on the committee voting against it and calling it a mistake.
The larger answer, however, is outside political pressure. Last year, the Fed actually did institute a policy of buying long-term debt, generally known as ''quantitative easing'' (don't ask). But it faced a political backlash out of all proportion to its modest effect on the economy, culminating in Mr. Perry's declaration that any further monetary easing before the 2012 election would be ''almost treasonous,'' and that if Mr. Bernanke went ahead and did it, ''we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas.''
Now just imagine the reaction if the Fed were to act on the other and arguably more important parts of that Bernanke 2000 agenda, targeting a higher rate of inflation and welcoming a weaker dollar. With prominent Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan already denouncing policies that allegedly ''debase the dollar,'' a political firestorm would be guaranteed.
So now you see why I don't expect any substantive policy announcements at Jackson Hole. Back in 2000, Mr. Bernanke accused the Bank of Japan of suffering from ''self-induced paralysis''; well, now the Fed is suffering from externally induced paralysis. In effect, it has been politically intimidated into standing by while the economy stagnates. And that's a very, very bad thing.
Political opposition has already crippled fiscal policy; instead of helping to create jobs, the federal government is pulling back, acting as a drag on output and employment.
With the Fed also intimidated into inaction, it's hard to see any end to the ongoing economic disaster.

HEADLINE: Dr. King Weeps From His Grave

BYLINE: By CORNEL WEST. 
Cornel West, a philosopher, is a professor at Princeton.

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
THE Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial was to be dedicated on the National Mall on Sunday -- exactly 56 years after the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi and 48 years after the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. (Because of Hurricane Irene, the ceremony has been postponed.)
These events constitute major milestones in the turbulent history of race and democracy in America, and the undeniable success of the civil rights movement -- culminating in the election of Barack Obama in 2008 -- warrants our attention and elation. Yet the prophetic words of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel still haunt us: ''The whole future of America depends on the impact and influence of Dr. King.'' 
Rabbi Heschel spoke those words during the last years of King's life, when 72 percent of whites and 55 percent of blacks disapproved of King's opposition to the Vietnam War and his efforts to eradicate poverty in America. King's dream of a more democratic America had become, in his words, ''a nightmare,'' owing to the persistence of ''racism, poverty, militarism and materialism.'' He called America a ''sick society.'' On the Sunday after his assassination, in 1968, he was to have preached a sermon titled ''Why America May Go to Hell.''
King did not think that America ought to go to hell, but rather that it might go to hell owing to its economic injustice, cultural decay and political paralysis. He was not an American Gibbon, chronicling the decline and fall of the American empire, but a courageous and visionary Christian blues man, fighting with style and love in the face of the four catastrophes he identified.
Militarism is an imperial catastrophe that has produced a military-industrial complex and national security state and warped the country's priorities and stature (as with the immoral drones, dropping bombs on innocent civilians). Materialism is a spiritual catastrophe, promoted by a corporate media multiplex and a culture industry that have hardened the hearts of hard-core consumers and coarsened the consciences of would-be citizens. Clever gimmicks of mass distraction yield a cheap soulcraft of addicted and self-medicated narcissists.
Racism is a moral catastrophe, most graphically seen in the prison industrial complex and targeted police surveillance in black and brown ghettos rendered invisible in public discourse. Arbitrary uses of the law -- in the name of the ''war'' on drugs -- have produced, in the legal scholar Michelle Alexander's apt phrase, a new Jim Crow of mass incarceration. And poverty is an economic catastrophe, inseparable from the power of greedy oligarchs and avaricious plutocrats indifferent to the misery of poor children, elderly citizens and working people.
The age of Obama has fallen tragically short of fulfilling King's prophetic legacy. Instead of articulating a radical democratic vision and fighting for homeowners, workers and poor people in the form of mortgage relief, jobs and investment in education, infrastructure and housing, the administration gave us bailouts for banks, record profits for Wall Street and giant budget cuts on the backs of the vulnerable.
As the talk show host Tavis Smiley and I have said in our national tour against poverty, the recent budget deal is only the latest phase of a 30-year, top-down, one-sided war against the poor and working people in the name of a morally bankrupt policy of deregulating markets, lowering taxes and cutting spending for those already socially neglected and economically abandoned. Our two main political parties, each beholden to big money, offer merely alternative versions of oligarchic rule.
The absence of a King-worthy narrative to reinvigorate poor and working people has enabled right-wing populists to seize the moment with credible claims about government corruption and ridiculous claims about tax cuts' stimulating growth. This right-wing threat is a catastrophic response to King's four catastrophes; its agenda would lead to hellish conditions for most Americans.
King weeps from his grave. He never confused substance with symbolism. He never conflated a flesh and blood sacrifice with a stone and mortar edifice. We rightly celebrate his substance and sacrifice because he loved us all so deeply. Let us not remain satisfied with symbolism because we too often fear the challenge he embraced. Our greatest writer, Herman Melville, who spent his life in love with America even as he was our most fierce critic of the myth of American exceptionalism, noted, ''Truth uncompromisingly told will always have its ragged edges; hence the conclusion of such a narration is apt to be less finished than an architectural finial.''
King's response to our crisis can be put in one word: revolution. A revolution in our priorities, a re-evaluation of our values, a reinvigoration of our public life and a fundamental transformation of our way of thinking and living that promotes a transfer of power from oligarchs and plutocrats to everyday people and ordinary citizens.
In concrete terms, this means support for progressive politicians like Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor; extensive community and media organizing; civil disobedience; and life and death confrontations with the powers that be. Like King, we need to put on our cemetery clothes and be coffin-ready for the next great democratic battle.

HEADLINE: Do They Want to Know Less?

 BODY:
Understanding what is happening in the economy is essential in hard times. Yet House Republicans have proposed budget cuts that could cripple or end government surveys. The surveys are used to generate timely and accurate data and answer such basic questions as: Is the economy descending into another recession? 
Without such data, business leaders, investors and policy makers would be flying blind.
Every five years, the Census Bureau conducts an Economic Census -- a detailed survey of nearly five million businesses that serves as the benchmark for measuring economic growth and other important indicators, like inflation, productivity and consumer spending. The next Economic Census begins in 2012. House Republicans propose cutting the bureau's budget to $855 million (President Obama requested $1.02 billion).
The Republicans have not said what the bureau should cut. But the Economic Census, which costs $124 million, would almost certainly be hit. Otherwise, the bureau would have to stop core functions already under way, like the resolution program for the 2010 decennial census, by which local governments challenge undercounts.
Representative Hal Rogers of Kentucky, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, has said that given the budget deficit, the bill containing the cuts to the census and other programs is necessary ''to move our country in the right direction.'' He has it backward.
The Census Bureau cuts would increase uncertainty about the state of the economy, the drivers and drags on growth and the effectiveness of business and government policy. Precisely because the data are vital, the United States Chamber of Commerce has called for full financing of the Census Bureau.
The House is expected to take up the bill next month. Other business leaders and groups should join the chamber's call. The Obama administration should raise the alarm, and the Senate must be prepared to provide full financing. Less data on the economy won't do any good.

HEADLINE: Research Institute in Hong Kong to Analyze Economics From Asian Perspective

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The leader of one of the most influential business families in Hong Kong announced Thursday that the family's foundation was setting up a nonprofit research group here to analyze economic and corporate issues from an Asian perspective. 
The research group, the Fung Global Institute, is the latest in a series of efforts by Asian tycoons, universities and governments to set up institutions to match the kind of analysis produced in the United States by groups like the Brookings Institution.
But research groups in Asia have struggled so far to attract prominent international scholars or to establish reputations for independence in a region where democracy and freedom of speech are still limited in many countries.
The first president of the Fung Global Institute will be Andrew L.T. Sheng, the former chairman of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. A. Michael Spence, the winner in 2001 of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and the former dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business in California, will be the chairman of the academic board.
The Victor and William Fung Foundation, named for the brothers who built Li & Fung into the largest trading company providing Asian consumer goods to the American market, is providing an initial $15 million for the endowment, and seeking to raise $85 million from other business leaders in Asia, said Victor Fung, who will be the founding chairman.
Mr. Fung and Mr. Spence said that the institute would not have fixed positions on issues but would allow its fellows to hold and articulate a range of views. Mr. Fung said that Hong Kong's protections for free speech had helped make it the clear choice for the headquarters of the institute, although many of the top experts will be allowed to live elsewhere.
The initial four areas of research for the institute are less controversial than political themes would be. The areas are global supply chains, global financial governance, China's economic growth model and sustainability of global economic growth.

HEADLINE: Former Lehman Officials to Pay $90 Million to Settle Suit

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Former officials of Lehman Brothers, including Richard S. Fuld Jr., its former chief executive, have agreed to pay $90 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit that accused them of misleading investors about the investment bank's health in the months leading up to its collapse. 
In a court filing on Thursday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, 13 Lehman executives and directors asked a judge to release insurance proceeds that would pay for the settlement.
The potential settlement, which would be the largest to date of a lawsuit against Lehman's top officials, would not affect the status of any outstanding government investigations of the company and its management.
Three years ago next month, Lehman Brothers filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy in history, an event that helped set off the global financial crisis. The company has been protected from litigation since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
But investors filed several lawsuits against former Lehman officials, including one filed by a group of pension funds that asked for billions of dollars in damages, accusing the bank's senior executives and directors of lying about its financial state.
The pension fund lawsuit contends that Mr. Fuld; Erin Callan, the bank's former chief financial officer, and others ''concealed the true extent of the company's exposure to subprime-related assets and financial positions, and materially misled the investing public.''
If the bankruptcy judge agrees with the Lehman officials' request and releases the insurance proceeds to settle this lawsuit, Mr. Fuld and his former colleagues will not have to bear any personal expense in resolving the case. They would also neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
Lawyers say it is common for insurance proceeds to cover corporate directors and officers in shareholders' lawsuits.
''It is unusual for individual executives to pay out of their own pockets,'' said Kevin Lacroix, a lawyer and author of the D&O Diary blog. ''Companies buy insurance for exactly a situation like this where it is insolvent and cannot indemnify their directors and officers.''
Only in rare instances do directors and officers have to make out-of-pocket payments in shareholders' suits. In 2005, former Worldcom directors paid about $25 million of their own money to resolve a lawsuit with the company's investors. Enron directors also paid roughly $13 million to settle shareholders' claims.
In those cases, the companies' insurance policies did not cover the cost of the settlement. In the case of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank's policies are valued at a total of $250 million, according to the court filing.
Other litigants are scrambling to settle cases with Lehman before the company's insurance coffers are empty.
The former Lehman officers have has also asked the bankruptcy court to release $8.25 million in insurance proceeds to settle a separate claim by the state of New Jersey against Mr. Fuld and his former colleagues.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Despite His Current Vehemence on Taxes, Perry Has a More Nuanced Record

BYLINE: By JAY ROOT. 
jroot@texastribune.org

 BODY:
To hear him tell it on the presidential campaign trail, Gov. Rick Perry has never met a tax increase he liked.
But at home, over a political career that reaches back to the oil price shocks of the 1980s, Mr. Perry has embraced billions of dollars worth of them -- including a $528 million tax increase approved in 1990, after he defected to the Republican Party.
The biggest tax increases came early in his career, before anyone used the phrase ''Tea Party'' to describe a potent political movement. But a few weeks ago, Mr. Perry also signed into law an online sales tax measure that the state says will raise $60 million over the next five years.
Grover Norquist's influential organization, Americans for Tax Reform, calls the measure a dreaded ''new tax.'' Mr. Perry opposed it as a stand-alone measure, but this summer it was tucked into a must-pass bill during a legislative session that otherwise saw deep budget cuts. 
The past votes and more recent tax legislation are sure to get a new look from opponents as Mr. Perry, now a Republican front-runner, promotes his tax-cuttin', budget-slashin' ways as an antidote to the ailing economy and a president he attacks as recklessly profligate.
''To the extent that he tries to oversell this in a campaign, people are going to pick at it,'' said Jim Henson, a political scientist at the University of Texas. ''The question is, will his opponents be able to outmaneuver him to create a high level of dissonance between his record and what he says.''
Mr. Perry's views on taxes and spending put him firmly in the conservative camp, both during his time as a young Democratic legislator and as a seasoned Republican governor. Despite a 2011 budget shortfall estimated as high as $27 billion, Mr. Perry steadfastly opposed tax increases to close the gap. He took a similar approach in 2003, also a lean budget year.
Mr. Perry has also supported tax breaks for small business and, as part of a giant tax swap in 2006, claims credit for reducing property taxes by more than $16 billion.
''Look at the overall picture,'' said Mark Miner, Mr. Perry's spokesman. ''The governor has a record of cutting taxes and fiscal responsibility. He's the only governor since World War II to sign a budget that appropriates less general revenue than was spent in previous terms.''
But throughout his career, Mr. Perry has shown a willingness to compromise on an issue that today tends to produce only sharp partisan divisions and, in Washington, outright gridlock.
In particular, his record as a member of the Texas House -- including a key vote taken after he became a Republican in 1989 -- would today make him an easy target of the Tea Party conservatives who have helped fuel Mr. Perry's rise in the 2012 presidential race.
Mr. Perry consistently voted to prohibit a state income tax. But during his six years in the Legislature, he voted more than a dozen times to allow higher taxes or to raise them. He repeatedly joined the Democratic House majority in voting to raise the sales tax, which went up to 6.25 percent from 4.125 percent while he was in the House, records show. Taxes on motorists, corporations and liquor also rose during those years, with Mr. Perry's blessing.
In 1987, facing what was then the worst budget shortfall in state history, Mr. Perry voted for what is still the largest tax increase in state history -- sweeping legislation that raised the sales tax to 6 percent, increased corporate tax rates, pushed up the cigarette tax by more than a nickel per pack and slapped a 7 percent tax on insurance premiums.
The bill raised more than $5 billion. Two years later, Mr. Perry became a Republican and voted against a half-cent increase in the sales tax during one of four special sessions called to reform the state's shaky school finance system. Then-Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, later vetoed the bill, but he signed on to a compromise quarter-cent increase in the sales tax -- and Mr. Perry fell in line behind him.
Dale Craymer, head of the pro-business Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, said it is hard to compare the Legislature that Mr. Perry entered in 1985 with the one he interacts with today as governor. Back then, compromise was not an epithet.
''It was quite a different environment, and, frankly, he's a much different person,'' Mr. Craymer said. ''There were much freer negotiations between Democrats and Republicans. Both sides would give a little. Nowadays nobody gives.''
Mr. Craymer said Mr. Perry's no-new-taxes pledge in spite of huge budget shortfalls in 2003 and 2011 are a better indication of where the governor stands on taxes today.
Mr. Perry's most ambitious tax reform came in 2006. He appointed a bipartisan blue-ribbon panel, similar to committees in Congress that have suggested tax changes, to help cobble together a new business tax. Ultimately, the reforms adopted by the Legislature raised cigarette taxes by $1 a pack and vastly increased the number of businesses subject to the state franchise tax, all in exchange for billions of dollars in property tax reductions.
Mr. Perry was strongly criticized at the time by antitax conservatives, who said the business tax overhaul, called the margins tax, was an income tax in disguise. Critics also say big refineries and other property-intensive businesses got huge breaks while medium-sized businesses were stuck with higher bills.
Chuck Toudouze, the former owner of the now-closed Toudouze Market in San Antonio, he saw his taxes shoot up over 700 percent (to over $17,000) by 2010, when he closed the grocery warehouse.
Mr. Toudouze said Mr. Perry's motivation was sincere, and he applauded him for steadfastly opposing a state income tax. But he said the paltry property tax relief that he saw did not make up for Mr. Perry's business tax increases.
''For it just to continue to go up and to constantly have to fight it, it's just beleaguering,'' Mr. Toudouze said. ''Was this a tax increase? Yeah, it was an increase. The margins tax was an increase in tax for us. The property tax cut was just a sick joke.''
The governor has also faced muted criticism about the most recent tax to hit the books in Texas -- designed to scoop up millions in revenue that officials say is lost in online sales by retailers like Amazon. Mr. Miner, the governor's spokesman, said Mr. Perry was ''adamantly opposed'' to the measure and vetoed a stand-alone version of the bill in the 2011 session.
Over his objections, lawmakers put it back into a kitchen-sink bill that included multiple items, from new driver's license requirements to a complicated rewriting of school finance formulas.
Mr. Perry signed the bill on July 19.
''It is certainly an attempt to tax the Internet, even though it is broader than that,'' said Kelly Cobb, the governmental affairs manager for Americans for Tax Reform. ''It is a new tax, and we disagree with it on policy grounds for sure.''

HEADLINE: Washington Impasse Traps Trade Deals

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even with almost zero common ground between them, President Obama and Republicans in Congress generally concur on the need for free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But they disagree on whose fault it is that those agreements -- years in the making -- have still not been approved.
For weeks, President Obama has derided Congress for failing to pass the agreements, as well as a measure that would provide money to assist workers displaced by foreign competition. ''The only thing preventing us from passing these bills is the refusal by some in Congress to put country ahead of party,'' he said at a recent news conference. 
Senior Republicans in Congress have howled in protest, pointing out that the agreements have not left the president's desk to journey to the Hill for a vote.
''We have made abundantly clear publicly and privately that the House is prepared to vote on all three trade agreements,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, adding that the same goes for the bill to provide money to assist workers. ''The only thing holding us up is the fact those trade bills are still sitting on the president's desk.''
That Congressional Republicans and the president cannot even agree on the status of these critical trade agreements reflects just how toxic and divisive their relationship is, anchored largely in fiscal policy disagreements. The two sides have fought endlessly over the last year about the complexion of the bills and how and when they will be brought to the floors of each chamber.
The three free-trade agreements, which originated with the Bush administration, would eliminate tariffs on cross-border transactions, expanding exports of American goods by about $12 billion a year, according to estimates by the United States International Trade Commission. Under the agreements, American service providers would be able to compete in the three countries, ostensibly adding new jobs to the American economy. Because of this, they are widely supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business trade groups.
When the Democrats controlled Congress, they resisted the trade agreements because they feared they would harm American workers. Then came the Obama administration, which insisted, as part of any trade deal, on renewing a program to assist people adversely affected and adding $964 million to the effort. That linkage has met resistance from Republicans.
In July, Senator Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, said that program was a deal breaker for his party. ''We made it clear time and time and time again that we would not stomach attaching a big government spending program onto these agreements,'' Mr. Hatch said at the time.
Since then, enough Senate Republicans have said they would sign off on a slimmed-down version of the assistance money, but Republicans in the House have been less committal. Though Mr. Boehner has agreed to bring the trade bills to the House floor, as well as a bill that would provide the assistance money, he has not explicitly said that the aid-money bill, like the trade bills, would not be tinkered with, or that it enjoys enough support from his members for passage.
Bottom line: Mr. Obama is not technically correct when he says that Congress is fully able to vote on the bills, as his administration has not sent them there in the first place. But the reason it has not done so is because it does not feel confident that House Republicans will allow their key request -- the bill for worker assistance -- to come to the floor unadorned with watering-down amendments, or that it would pass at all. Indeed, Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, opposes the program.
''Our goal could not be more clear,'' said Matthew Vogel, a White House spokesman. ''We want to get the three trade agreements and trade adjustment assistance signed into law. The next step is to nail down the specifics on a bipartisan, bicameral path forward to complete it all in a timely fashion. We hope to see the same progress in the House that we saw in the Senate before recess. We're not there yet, but we're making headway.''
However, the worker assistance program has the support of the Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, whose constituents would benefit greatly from it. His support strongly increases its likelihood of passage in the House. However, it does not guarantee that the House would not attempt to amend the bill. The fear may strike Republicans as irrational, but it goes to the heart of the mistrust between the two sides, which has only increased since the debt ceiling debacle of earlier this summer.

HEADLINE: President Rick Perry?

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
A few weeks ago it was possible to believe that Mitt Romney would win the New Hampshire primary and cruise easily to the Republican nomination. It's harder to see that now.
There have been a slew of polls showing Gov. Rick Perry of Texas surging to double-digit national leads. He leads across demographic groups -- among educated Republicans and less-educated ones, among upscale and downscale. Most impressive, he's winning over the Republican activists who pay the closest attention and wield disproportionate influence with primary voters.
A poll by the conservative political Web sites, The Daily Caller/ConservativeHome, surveys these activists. When asked this week which candidate was most electable, 46 percent named Perry, while only 20 percent named Romney. When asked who would do the best job on the economy, 27 percent said Perry and 14 percent said Romney. When asked who would do the best job controlling Washington spending, 20 percent chose Perry, 17 percent said Representative Paul Ryan (who isn't running) and only 8 percent chose Romney. 
The evidence suggests that Perry's appeal will not be just a summer fad. He's benefiting from several of the trends that have fundamentally altered the Republican electorate. If the 2008 electorate were going to vote in the 2012 primaries, then Romney could handle Perry. But that electorate no longer exists.
The events of 2009 and 2010 -- bailouts, health care reform, the stimulus package -- substantially shifted voter attitudes and nothing that has happened in 2011 has altered that shift.
Nationally, the events of 2009 and 2010 moved voters to the right. In 2008, Democrats had a 12-point party identification advantage among families earning between $30,000 and $75,000. That advantage is gone, according to a July Pew Research poll. In 2008, Democrats had a 7 percent advantage among white voters under 30. The Republicans now have an 11-point advantage with those young voters, according to the poll.
Within the Republican Party, the rightward shift has been even more vehement. In 2008, roughly 63 percent of primary voters called themselves conservative, according to Public Policy Polling. Now it's roughly 73 percent. The number of moderate Republicans has withered.
The events of 2009 and 2010 also concentrated the Republican mind. It used to be that there were many themes in the Republican hymnal. Now there is only one: Government is too big, and it needs to be brought under control. It used to be there were many threats on the horizon. Now there is only one: the interlocking oligarchy of politicians, academics, journalists, consultants and financiers who live along the Acela corridor want to rip America from its traditional moorings.
Perry is benefiting from these shifts. He does best among the most conservative voters. He has a simple and fashionable message: I will bring government under control. His persona is perfectly tuned to offend people along the Acela corridor and to rally those who oppose those people. He does very well with the alternative-reality right -- those who don't believe in global warming, evolution or that Obama was born in the U.S.
So, yes, it is time to take Perry seriously as a Republican nominee and even as a potential president. Until a few weeks ago, Perry trailed Obama in general election matchups. But as Perry's name recognition has increased, that has changed. He and Obama are neck and neck in a recent Gallup poll.
The question is, what are his rivals going to do about him? Right now, the Romney camp is passively hoping he implodes. That seems unlikely. The gaffes that create media frenzies are unlikely to bother Republican primary voters. Perry's campaign message is so simple it doesn't take Einstein to keep repeating it from now until Election Day.
It's more likely that sooner or later Romney is going to have to prove his own toughness by taking Perry on directly. Two lines of attack are pretty obvious.
First, Romney could accuse Perry of being the latest iteration of Tom DeLay Republicanism. On the one hand, he is ideologically slippery. The man who sounds so right wing today was the Texas chairman of the Al Gore for President campaign in 1988. The man who now vows to appoint only anti-abortion officials to relevant administration jobs endorsed Rudy Giuliani four short years ago. On the other hand, he is unwavering in his commitment to the government-cash nexus. Even this week -- amid much attention to his pay-to-play proclivities -- Perry named two big donors to powerful state jobs.
The second line of attack is to shift what the campaign is about. If voters think Nancy Pelosi is the biggest threat to their children's prosperity, they will hire Perry. If they think competition from Chinese and Indian workers is the biggest threat, they will hire Romney. He's just more credible as someone who can manage economic problems, build human capital and nurture an innovation-based global economy.
Romney might be able to beat back the Perry surge. In the meantime, it's time to take Perry seriously. He could be our next president.

HEADLINE: Buffett's Bank of America Stake Viewed as a Seal of Approval

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and SUSANNE CRAIG; Michael J. de la Merced, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The financial crisis has been good to Warren E. Buffett.
The billionaire investor snatched up shares of Goldman Sachs and General Electric during some of the darkest days of 2008, injecting life and funds into the companies and turning a handsome profit later. On Goldman alone, Mr. Buffett netted $1.7 billion.
On Thursday, he sought to turn the same trick again, investing $5 billion in an institution that is still struggling to recover from the financial crisis, Bank of America. Like the Goldman deal, the Bank of America infusion comes with a rich plum: a guaranteed dividend payout of about $300 million a year, whether the stock goes up or down. 
The stock shot up on Thursday as the investment allayed concerns about the bank. Its shares rose as much as 27 percent, before ending the day up 9.4 percent, at $7.65.
''He has the golden touch,'' said Mitchel Penn, an analyst with Legg Mason Capital Management, one of Bank of America's largest shareholders. ''It's a wonderful vote of confidence in Bank of America.''
The deal came together quickly. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Buffett's assistant called the office of Brian T. Moynihan, the Bank of America chief executive, and a call was set up, said two people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.
Mr. Moynihan told the investor that the bank did not need capital. Mr. Buffett responded by saying that he was planning to invest for the long term and outlined a proposal. Interested, Mr. Moynihan suggested that the two of them meet to discuss it. No, thanks, Mr. Buffett said, his mind was made up and he didn't need a sit-down. The call was soon over.
In the hours that followed, Mr. Moynihan, Bruce Thompson, the bank's chief financial officer, and Charles Holliday, the chairman, met and briefed directors on Mr. Buffett's proposal. Lawyers for both sides - Munger, Tolles & Olson for Mr. Buffett's company and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which represented Bank of America - hashed out the details, working straight through the night.
Robert E. Denham, a partner at Munger Tolles, said there were no major hurdles to an agreement. ''It's a very boring story,'' he said laughing. ''Just a very, very intense turning of the documents.''
At 7 a.m. on Thursday, the board held a conference call to approve the deal.
The investment comes at a pivotal time for Bank of America. It has set aside more than $20 billion to cover its legal exposure for mortgages made during the housing bubble, and the bank faces a nationwide investigation into its foreclosure practices. Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors.
Mr. Buffett is aware of the bank's mortgage issues, but a person briefed on his thinking said that the investor felt that Bank of America was well positioned to make money over the long term and that the legal woes would diminish.
At the age of 80, Mr. Buffett can claim a global reputation as a savvy investor for his bets on railroads, insurers and famous brands like Coca-Cola. But in recent years, he has also become one of the world's mightiest champions of the banking industry.
With the $5 billion investment by his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett stands to eventually become the largest shareholder in Bank of America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Berkshire is already the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo and American Express. It stands to be a large stakeholder in Goldman when shares he obtained during the financial crisis convert.
''He always likes to buy into industries he understands and he feels comfortable with banking,'' said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar.
That was not always the case. In his 1990 letter to shareholders Mr. Buffett wrote, ''The banking business is no favorite of ours.''
He had good reason to be skeptical.
Just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of preferred shares in Salomon Inc.
To protect his holdings, Mr. Buffett did something unusual, stepping in to become chairman in August 1991 after he forced out Salomon's chairman, John Gutfreund, during a Treasury auction scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving Salomon from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. Mr. Buffett stepped down as chairman of Salomon about 10 months later. It was many years before he would return to Wall Street.
During the financial crisis in September 2008, Mr. Buffett came to the rescue of Goldman, investing $5 billion in the firm. A week later, he bought $3 billion in preferred shares from General Electric, as the conglomerate's shares were plummeting.
Each investment proved to be highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett's holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so.
By some measures, his Bank of America investment closely resembles the earlier deals. Each contained investments of $5 billion or lower and the deals all included warrants with strike prices near the pre-deal share price. During the crisis, however, Mr. Buffett commanded a steeper price.
''It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,'' said Mr. Woodbury of Morningstar.
Under the terms of the Bank of America deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that will pay a 6 percent annual dividend. Mr. Buffett also will receive warrants for 700 million shares that he can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium.
The deal is expected to close on Sept. 1, according to a regulatory filing.
It was the sort of move that many industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James P. Gorman, told reporters at his firm's annual meeting that a big-name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting ''the malaise to lift.''
Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays, on Thursday commended Bank of America for being the one to nab the highly coveted ''Buffett seal of approval.''
In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E. Buffett's decision to invest $5 billion in Bank of America.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Casino Bill Invites Questions About Growth

BYLINE: By KRISTEN McQUEARY. 
Kristen McQueary covers state politics for The Chicago News Cooperative and Chicago Public Media.; kmcqueary@chicago newscoop.org

 BODY:
Questions surrounding a gambling bill that is headed to Gov. Pat Quinn's desk have focused on regulation and on how much new casinos could raise for state coffers.
But casino industry watchers are also asking whether the gambling market will be oversaturated with five new riverboats, minicasinos at the state's five horse racing tracks and slot machines at Chicago's airports. Increased competition from neighboring states, an unpredictable economy and casino bankruptcies are raising distress signals for the industry nationwide.
The bill includes the nation's first city-owned casino in Chicago, which would be overseen by a board chosen by the mayor and approved by the Illinois Gaming Board. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been cranking up the pressure on Mr. Quinn, a fellow Democrat, to sign the bill. The mayor has already released a wish list of infrastructure projects he hopes to pay for with casino profits. 
The Chicago-northwest Indiana market ranks No. 3 in the nation in casino earnings, behind Las Vegas and Atlantic City, according to the American Gaming Association. Every state but Hawaii and Utah has some form of legal gambling, industry observers point out, raising questions about whether further expansion can be profitable.
Supporters say the appetite for gambling remains robust. They point to the July opening of Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, the state's newest casino, as proof. Traffic jammed the Tri-State Tollway, the casino parking lot reached capacity and patrons waited in long lines to get inside.
The State Senate president, John J. Cullerton, Democrat of Chicago, said he was recently approached by a lobbyist hired by a Wisconsin casino who hoped to stifle competition by derailing Illinois's expansion of gambling sites. The fact that neighboring states are worried suggests there is a market for more, Mr. Cullerton said.
Supporters also argue that a casino in tourist-rich Chicago would keep gamblers here instead of sending them across state lines. Dozens of buses depart from Chicago and its suburbs every day for gambling venues elsewhere. Mr. Emanuel has said Illinois should not allow Indiana to get ''$20 million a month while our infrastructure is crumbling.''
Even if Mr. Quinn signs the gambling bill without major changes, finding investors could be difficult. Investors in the Des Plaines Rivers Casino spent $450 million on licenses, fees and infrastructure before the doors even opened. And the state has one of the highest casino tax rates in the country, at 50 percent of adjusted gross receipts for the most profitable casinos.
''It's a difficult economy to find any kind of capital,'' said Ed Feigenbaum, publisher of Indiana Gaming Insight, a nonpartisan newsletter that tracks the industry. ''In the boom days, anybody who had a gaming license could find cheap money. They also thought riverboats were immune to economic downturns. We found out that was not the case.''
Casinos nationwide have suffered from the recession, including those on the Las Vegas Strip. Dozens have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, teetered on bankruptcy, scaled back on property improvements or laid off employees.
In Indiana, five of the state's 13 gambling properties filed for bankruptcy reorganization in recent years. One company, Casino Aztar, emerged from bankruptcy with a new owner, Tropicana Entertainment. But four others remain tangled in court proceedings.
Still, for local and state governments, the lure can be strong. Illinois casinos earned $1.4 billion in adjusted gross receipts in 2010, sending $384 million to the state treasury. An additional $83 million went to host towns. Rivers Casino took in $18 million in adjusted gross receipts during its first two weeks of operation, according to the latest numbers from the Illinois Gaming Board. The totals put the casino on target for its projected $325 million to $400 million in annual revenue.
Tom Swoik, executive director of the Illinois Casino and Gaming Association, which opposed the expansion bill, said adjusted gross receipts -- profits minus winnings paid out to gamblers -- painted a skewed portrait of casinos' profits because the numbers did not include overhead costs.
''The bottom line is that the state makes two to three times more from taxes than the casinos,'' Mr. Swoik said. ''On top of that, they're paying salaries, fringe benefits and the other costs of operating that casino, everything from poker chips to toilet paper to garbage pickup. It's difficult to try to convince some of the larger companies to come to Illinois and open up these properties.''
Illinois casinos reported their highest numbers in 2007, with $2 billion in adjusted gross receipts. Part of the drop-off since then came in 2008 when Illinois banned indoor smoking statewide. Indiana, Michigan and Iowa allow smoking at many of their casinos.
Riverboat casinos first opened in Illinois in 1991. Since then, the state has debated, but not enacted, numerous gambling bills. Lawmakers gradually changed the law to allow the floating vessels to become land based, and that has made them more profitable, with patrons able to come and go more easily.
In 2009, desperate for money to recharge the construction industry and put people to work, lawmakers legalized video poker as a way to pay off construction bonds. The pending casino bill was the next volley.
A longtime gambling researcher, John Kindt, professor of business and legal policy at the University of Illinois, met with Mr. Quinn last week along with other gambling opponents to urge him to veto the bill. Gambling, Mr. Kindt said, is not the pot of gold supporters often suggest it is. For example, he said, money pumped into slot machines and other forms of gambling is lost to the overall economy.
''There are thousands of pages of research showing market saturation and how the gambling economy is cannibalizing the consumer economy,'' he said. ''As Governor Quinn has said himself, you can't gamble your way to prosperity.''
As consolidation and bankruptcy weigh on the industry, major casino players are looking overseas. The Chinese city of Macau now surpasses Las Vegas as the world's top gambling destination. Las Vegas gambling giants are turning there for expansion, not necessarily to cities like Rockford or Danville, which would receive casinos under the Illinois bill.
As Mr. Quinn considers his options, Senator Cullerton is working on a follow-up bill to address the governor's concern that the original measure lacks proper regulation. The two men have also discussed revising the 2009 video gambling law as part of a compromise package.
Mr. Quinn said Thursday that he would like communities to approve video gambling changes before machines could be installed. He has said he will act promptly when the gambling expansion bill arrives on his desk. But he has not said what that action will be.

HEADLINE: For Some in G.O.P., a Tax Cut Not Worth Embracing

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Michael D. Shear and Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It is hard to find a tax cut that Congressional Republicans dislike. Unless it is a tax cut pushed by President Obama.
In a turning of the tax policy tables, Democrats are increasingly hammering on Republicans who oppose the president's proposal to extend for a year a payroll tax cut passed last year with bipartisan support.
That tax cut -- which reduces workers' contributions to Social Security this year to 4.2 percent of wages, from 6.2 percent -- expires in December. The White House would like to extend it for another year. But Republicans in Congress are balking, arguing that such a cut adds needlessly to the nation's budget deficit, and should be replaced with an overhaul of tax policy instead. 
''All tax relief is not created equal,'' said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. ''If the goal is job creation, Leader Cantor has long believed that there are better ways to grow the economy and create jobs than temporary payroll tax relief.''
After battles over the debt ceiling and tax policy, in which Republicans asserted that they would abide no tax increase, Democrats are equal parts incensed by this nuanced policy position and pleased with the opportunity to bang the other party over the head with it.
''One way or another, there will be a vote on extending these tax cuts,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, ''and Republicans will have to stand up to the fact if they oppose it they are for tax cuts for the rich but not for the middle class.''
Lower- and middle-income workers are the greatest beneficiaries of the tax cut. The cut resulted in $67.2 billion of lost revenue for Social Security in 2011 and a total cost of $111.7 billion spread over 10 years. The rate will return to previous levels on Jan. 1 if Congress does not extend the cut.
Mr. Obama, whose administration is also mulling a similar tax cut for employers, has repeatedly cited the payroll tax as a cornerstone of his economic agenda ''We can cut payroll taxes again,'' he said last weekend in his weekly public address, ''so families have an extra $1,000 to spend.''
The Republican candidates for president, all of whom have taken strong antitax positions, are eager not to be jammed on the issue. ''I think the payroll tax cut is a good thing,'' Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, said in an interview with PBS on Thursday morning. ''It helps a whole lot of people,'' he added, saying he ''would consider extending it.''
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, last year wrote in an opinion article for USA Today that the payroll tax cut ''will add to the deficit.'' But in a recent interview with Fox TV, he softened that, saying, ''I'm all in favor of keeping taxes down and keeping burdens down on American businesses and employers.''
While the tax cut is almost certain to become a bargaining chip this year among the members of a special Congressional committee charged with reducing the deficit by up to $1.5 trillion, Mr. Schumer said the Senate might vote on the matter, forcing Republicans to choose whether to vote against lower taxes.
A spokesman for Grover Norquist, who as leader of Americans for Tax Reform is the author of a no-tax-increase pledge that scores of Congressional Republicans have signed, expressed ambivalence about the cut.
''One could argue that therefore allowing it to lapse was not a tax hike,'' said John Kartch, a spokesman for the group. ''But safer to either continue the lower rate or cut some other tax rate by the same total amount so that any change was revenue neutral.''
Democrats note that Republicans had no problem extending the so-called Bush tax cuts of 2001, even though those cuts were also originally designated as temporary.
''This seems to be one of those situations where, since Obama says yes, we say no,'' Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland who is a member of the special committee, said of Republicans. ''It doesn't make sense in any other context.''
Economists are divided about the payroll tax cut extension. Some liberals fear that using general fund money to cover the lost revenue for Social Security puts the program at risk of turning into a welfare-like program rather than an entitlement program supported by payroll taxes.
Others believe, however, that the tax is simply regressive.
Republicans argue that the tax cut robs Social Security of money without providing job growth or other benefits of a broader tax policy overhaul.
''Clearly it puts money in people's pockets, and that's good,'' said Sage Eastman, a spokesman for Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, a Republican member of the special committee. ''But it doesn't have impact on growing the economy and creating jobs, and that's what our tax policy reform ought to be focused on.''

HEADLINE: Lewis Hine: Photographer, Activist, Character

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Alison Nordstrom, the curator of a retrospective of the work of the early 20th-century photographer Lewis Hine, has come to know him as the Walt Whitman of picture-taking.

 BODY:
Q.
Tell me about your interest in Lewis Hine.
A.
I am fascinated by the role of the photograph in affecting social change. Hine was one of the first to do that in a systematic, politically informed way. I also just personally respond to the work. The more I looked at Hine, it became clear that while everyone knows two or three or five of his pictures, they have been taken out of context. They run the risk of being seen with a degree of sentimentality that Hine never intended.
There has been a lot of work done on Hine, but it has mainly been subject-orientated. It hasn't dealt with his career as a whole, which is really very interesting. So there was a lot to sink my teeth into. I feel good when I see pictures by Lewis Hine and I feel good when I am working with that material. I genuinely think he was one of the good guys.
He became a photographer in order to further his political and social ends. It was only very, very late in his career that he began to understand himself as an artist and it was only very late in his career that the arts establishments paid any attention to him at all. Hine was not discovered truly until the 1930s. He was famous in the teens and '20s, but not in art circles.
Eastman House has the contents of his house at the time of his death - negatives, prints, publications and correspondence. Because we have so much of the material, not just the greatest hits or just one element of the career, it seemed possible to do something comprehensive.
Q.
You came to Eastman House attracted by the Lewis Hine collection. What did you discover when you delved into his work?
A.
There was a much greater variety of work than most of us know. In his child labor work, most of us are familiar with the kids in the coal mine and the wan little girl standing in the mill. When he was working on child labor for the National Child Labor Committee, he covered 50,000 miles a year. He went as far west as Chicago and to Florida. It was fascinating to see how comprehensive he was.
Since our material is vintage material, there are sometimes these amazing annotations on the backs of these prints. I often say the back of a photo can tell you more than the front. In that period, he is really gathering evidence, and so the notations have the name of the child and the height of the child. He measured the height of his buttons on his vest. He always wore a suit and tie to the ground so that he could ascertain the heights of these little children by measuring them against the buttons on his jacket.
Obviously the employers of these children were not too pleased with a muckraking journalist visiting these factories. In many cases, he would sneak his way in. He was a skilled amateur actor and he would often pretend to be something other than he what he was.
There were photographs that surprised me. But what came to me from looking hard at him was a sense of a real personality, the sense of a real human being - almost a Horatio Alger character himself.
Q.
How so?
A.
He was from the Midwest. He was poor and hard-working. His father died when he was a teenager and he ended up being the sole support for his mother before he got an education. He had a lot of different jobs. He sold things door-to-door. He actually worked in a factory briefly, a furniture factory in Wisconsin.
He fell under the influence of a strong mentor, Frank Manny, who recognized him as a bright, promising boy and encouraged him to get an education. When Manny was hired as the head of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York, he brought the young Lewis Hine with him to teach. He asked him to take up photography so that the activities of the school could be documented.
There is evidence that it was Frank Manny who said, "Let's go to Ellis Island and photograph immigrants." I find it fascinating that the rhetoric around immigration in 1900 is so familiar to us today. It was: "These people aren't like us. They don't speak English, they have different customs and religions, and they're going to destroy the fabric of America."
Hine was a genuine progressive. His letters are full of puns and wordplay and clever jokes. You get a sense of a clever guy who comes to the big city and feels his way. He put a human face on these people in a way that really made a difference. I think in doing that, he realized that photography would let him further his efforts for social change. He became a freelance photographer in 1910 but always considered himself an educator - someone who used photography and wasn't in a classroom.
Q.
What did you find out that you didn't expect?
A.
Hine went to Europe at the very end of the First World War for the American Red Cross. He was there to document the efforts of Red Cross workers with refugees across Europe, but especially in Croatia, Bosnia, northern Greece, Macedonia and France.
You get this sense of a still-youngish man who is delighted by these new places. He is taking a lot of photographs that don't tell you anything about the Red Cross. They tell you about an old lady with a great face holding a baby pig []. There is this sense of delight and wonder about being in a new culture. I see that as a real turning point for him.
Before his experience in Europe, his work mostly focuses on the negative: it's child labor, it's slum housing. He said, "I had to show the things that needed to be changed and I had to show the things that needed to be celebrated." But until this trip to Europe, he focused on the things that needed to be changed.
When he comes back, he is definitely a changed person. The work becomes much more focused on positive aspects of labor. He is not opposed to labor. He thinks labor is enriching and the thing that connects us to the planet. He is opposed to child labor because he thinks it strips them of their natural childish gifts and enthusiasm and turns them into oxen too early.
The work he does after his World War I experience is really a celebration of labor, the powerhouse mechanic, the building of the Empire State Building , candy makers, wig makers, linotype operators. In a way, he reminds me of Walt Whitman. Hine was interested in everything and his work is enthusiastically encyclopedic in the way that Whitman's poetry is. And very American.
Q.
And Hine started thinking of himself as more as an artist?
A.
There are photographs that are very romantic and pictorialist. He was certainly aware of painting and he talked about the influence of a Raphael Madonna on some of his "Madonna of the Tenement" pictures. It's later, with "Men at Work," that it seems quite clear - both from his writing and the work itself - that he is beginning to think of himself as a modernist artist.
One of the things that made him quite different from photographers of the time is that he insisted on a byline. He referred to his own photographs as "Hineographs" and expressed that they were different from other kinds of photographs. He insisted on keeping his negatives and he was basically attempting to use them as stock. He is a really interesting character.
He always had to make a living and he wasn't very good at it. He died in poverty with his house foreclosed on and taking food from welfare. It's really a very sad story.
Q.
Toward the end of his life, many of his concerns had been addressed. He was successful in bringing attention to a lot of these problems - and, as you said, the world had changed. There was less child labor.
A.
I would argue that what we have done in America is we've moved our child labor to Vietnam. But that's another story entirely.
The world did change. Some of his photographs were used to persuade legislators to pass new laws. The milieu that Hine comes out of was called "social work" at the time but it was morphing into what we would now call "sociology." In the 19th century, philanthropy had this kind of Lady Bountiful aspect to it - reaching a hand down to the poor; the worthy poor. Widows and orphans.
What changed around the time of the last century was the idea that social ills could be scientifically studied and that if you document these social ills, if you shone a light on them, they would go away. Now it can seem like a sad, pathetic belief.
One of the characteristics of Hine's work is that he's not seeing his subjects as victims. I just think he cared about people. We are taught you have to be very cautious about trying to infer the feelings of either the photographer or the subject by looking at an image. They can mislead. But I have looked at a lot of Lewis Hine photographs and I think he cares deeply and respectfully for the people he photographs. He says that at the end of the day, it's about the people. He doesn't mean people, in a Marxist class sense; he means individual humans. And that's something we can respond to.
Q.
What did you want to do with this exhibit?
A.
I wanted to do justice to the man. I'm pretty sure it's the biggest exhibition of Lewis Hine photographs that's ever been held. 213 objects and 179 photographs, and I think that's necessary to show the breadth and depth of this image maker. The other thing we do is show a lot of ancillary material, trying to give context so people can recognize that the act of looking at a photograph in 1910 is different from looking at a photograph now.
One of my objectives has been to link us more directly with the international photographic community. This show is done by Eastman House in collaboration with the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation in Paris; the Mapfre Foundation and its exhibition space in Madrid; and Nederlands Fotomuseum, which is the National Museum of Photography in Rotterdam.

HEADLINE: 2011 Cincinnati Bengals Season Preview

BYLINE: ANDY BENOIT


HIGHLIGHT: It's unlikely that a mildly skilled rookie quarterback can fix the mess that a veteran like Carson Palmer deemed unfixable.

 BODY:
Carson Palmer told us everything there is to know about the state of the Bengal organization. Given a choice between making over $45 million to play a game he loves in front of tens of thousands of adoring fans each week as a member of the Bengals or making $0 to do nothing, Palmer chose nothing. No need to delve deep into the reasons - we all know about stingy owner Mike Brown, who spends peanuts on staff and amenities, who cares as much about team chemistry and players' character as your local D.M.V. cares about customer service and who regularly makes the kind of business decisions that would cause even M.C. Hammer to cringe. As ESPN's Rick Reilly so cleverly put it, the son of the legendary Paul Brown has had a career in football that "peaked upon birth." The Bengals are quite simply the most dysfunctional franchise in the N.F.L. (and that's with the Raiders as competition).
It'd be interesting to find out if Palmer would have still drawn a line in the sand if he'd known that Chad Ochocinco would be shipped to New England. Ochocinco was the symbol of the chaos in Cincinnati - not because of his touchdown celebrations or off-field shenanigans, but because of his constant whining. That he went so many years without a teammate bloodying his nose speaks to the distinct lack of leadership within this organization.
That leadership onus fell on Palmer, though obviously, he didn't feel as if he had a fighter's chance to answer it. Marvin Lewis can probably relate. Multiple reports said he was also ready to walk away after his contract expired at the end of the 2010 season. Only because Brown reportedly agreed to improve some of the facilities and make alterations to the way personnel decisions are handled did Lewis sign a two-year, $13 million extension.

It's more than a little odd that a coach with an 0-2 playoff record over eight years would be the one negotiating from the high ground, but few blame Lewis for this team's woes. Whether there indeed were changes to the handling of personnel decisions is unknown to all but perhaps Lewis and Brown. What is known is the Bengals had no qualms about replacing the two long-term faces of their franchise. They used their first-round pick (No. 4 over all) on a new wide receiver (Georgia's A.J. Green) and their second-rounder on a new quarterback (T.C.U.'s Andy Dalton).
Both rookies will start in Week 1. As rebounds go, it doesn't get much quicker than this. Still, the rebound's success is TBD, and the effort wasn't without a cost. Because top draft picks were spent on replacing Palmer and Ochocinco, Cincy was not able to address its feeble pass-rush or mediocre offensive line.
But neither of those weaknesses is a deal-breaker in 2011 (though as we'll cover eventually, the pass-rush might be close). And it's not as if the Bengals have absolutely no shot at competing. Downtrodden as this franchise may be, it was just two years ago that it won the A.F.C. North.
Offense
Of course, two years ago, the Bengals had a strong-armed veteran quarterback operating in a bruising run-first system. Now, they have (according to most draft experts) a meager-armed rookie quarterback working in first-time offensive coordinator Jay Gruden's unfamiliar West Coast system. That meager-armed rookie ran a fairly simplistic spread in college and, because of the lockout, has not had much time to practice from his new pro playbook.
The fact that Andy Dalton was "a winner" in college has little to nothing to do with his outlook as a pro. Quarterbacks who become "winners" in the big leagues don't do so solely by having "moxie" or "heart" or "wanting it more" - they do so by being smart enough to exploit a defense's weaknesses and skilled enough to maximize the resources around them. For Dalton, this means developing laser accuracy (since he doesn't have a cannon) and working through his progressions with better quickness and decisiveness than he did at T.C.U. He must learn to be an anticipation passer. Otherwise, the Bengals might as well take their chances with Bruce Gradkowski (a k a The Poor Man's Jeff Garcia).
Most of Dalton's progressions will begin with A.J. Green, whom some feel is the most explosive and complete receiver to enter the league since Calvin Johnson. Green could be looking at regular double coverage right out of the gate given the Bengals' modest receiving corps. Presumed No. 2 wideout Jerome Simpson was on the brink of unemployment before his two-game eruption to end last season. In three years, the former second-round pick has played just 13 games and caught 21 passes (18 of them came coming in that eruption).
Second-year slot receiver Jordan Shipley shows the courage to go over the middle and is effective sitting down in the holes of zones. In Gruden's West Coast system, he'll be asked to snag more balls on the move; he has the swiftness to pull it off, though he's not technically proven in this realm. Before disappearing in 2010, Andre Caldwell was effective working between the numbers from the slot. He should easily beat out sixth-round rookie Ryan Whalen for the No. 4 job and may even challenge Simpson and Shipley for reps.
Gruden has the personnel to diversify his formations (to a certain extent), as second-year tight end Jermaine Gresham is soft-handed and athletic enough to split out as a receiver. There's a certain measured approach to Gresham's game that should continue to get ironed out as he becomes more comfortable reading N.F.L. coverages. In the meantime, he also needs to develop more of a mean streak as a blocker. New backup Bo Scaife is a better option in this sense, though like fellow backup Chase Coffman (a non-contributor through two seasons) Scaife's best asset is his receiving.
The bright side of Dalton's inexperience is it will spawn more carries for Cedric Benson. This offense is built to be run-first anyway. Benson has the sturdiness and downhill style to get stronger throughout the game. He also has vastly underrated initial quickness and the ability to change tempo based on the action around him. On passing downs he'll be replaced by Brian Leonard, a solid blocker and screen pass receiver, though if the Bengals were wise, they'd give more touches to the speedy, space-creating Bernard Scott.
Benson's not actually the main reason this offense is better suited for the ground than air - the front five is. It's an unathletic but good-sized group that drives in run-blocking but plods in pass protection. This is partly why Cincinnati ran so many six-man fronts last season. In these scenarios, Andrew Whitworth, who overachieved as a stellar left tackle, moved to the right tight end position. If he's asked to do this again, the Bengals pray that he'll find himself next to massive former first-rounder Andre Smith and not slapdash try-hard guy Dennis Roland. Smith has once-in-a-generation-type natural ability (light feet, incredible get-off), but poor habits, bad endurance and recurring foot injuries that have left him on the brink of being a bust.
There's been some talk of moving Smith to guard, which wouldn't be all bad. The Bengals' interior line consists of three adequate individuals who, collectively, are inadequate. Right guard Bobbie Williams is an emotional hard worker but slowing down. Left guard Nate Livings tends to thrive only when he can be the aggressor; in reaction situations, his only-average athleticism shows. The Bengals passively addressed their iffy guard situation by signing oversized free agent Max Jean-Gilles and drafting Clint Boling in the fourth round; neither figures to push for serious playing time in 2011. At center, Kyle Cook is more like Nate Livings than even Nate Livings. This is to say he's decent as the aggressor but too limited to thrive as a reactor.
Defense
There's a lot riding on ex-49er Nate Clements. He's replacing Johnathan Joseph, a star cornerback whom the Bengals did not want to lose. After Joseph signed for a guaranteed $23.5 million in Houston, Cincinnati signed Clements for $6 million and presumably told him that defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme hinges on his ability to handle receivers man-to-man. Zimmer has never been shy about playing man-free coverage (man-to-man with just one free-ranging safety over the top) or even Cover 0 (as you might guess, man-to-man with zero safeties over the top) in order to create more aggressive attacks up front.
No. 1 corner Leon Hall has the well-honed technique to meet these high demands. He's not a burner but still has minimal trouble against top-notch receivers. As for Clements, he was cut by San Francisco, but given his contract, that was a business decision as much as a football decision. At 31, he still has the athleticism to shadow receivers outside or in the slot. If not for some displays of inconsistent ball skills in recent years, no one would have uttered a negative peep about him.
The Bengals are counting on Pacman Jones to be a playmaker in nickel. He's missed all of training camp dealing with the neck injury that truncated his '10 season. He went under the knife in early July but is expected to be ready for the opener. If he's not, Morgan Trent showed very good cover skills in the slot before his season-ending knee injury last November. Another option could be Jonathan Wade, a bust in St. Louis and Detroit but an impressive-looking outside corner in limited action here last year.
Life will be much easier if free safety Reggie Nelson exhibits the kind of range that inspired the Jaguars to draft him 21st overall in 2007. But that's a big . Zimmer is counting on it, as he'd presumably like strong safety Chris Crocker to be an added run defender in the box. Crocker has superb closing quickness. He's also an inconsistent but nevertheless capable cover artist, both in centerfield and against the slot. This is noteworthy because it gives Zimmer disguise options that he didn't have when pass defending dud Roy Williams was in this spot. Of course, Zimmer may simply prefer big hitters regardless of coverage ability. Why else would the Bengals trade for talented but unrefined safety Taylor Mays late in August?
Crocker is considered the elder statesman of this defense, but those with close ties to the organization whisper that the ninth-year veteran is one of an unsettling large number of players who were viewed as lazy last season. Another one of those players is Rey Maualuga, who is moving from outside linebacker to middle linebacker in 2011. This move is a result of attrition, as the Bengals afforded themselves no options when they chose not to re-sign Dhani Jones. Maualuga is a fervid hitter, but he doesn't have the key-and-diagnose ability to spearhead the front seven's run-defending efforts.
His limitations could prove costly given that neither of the new outside linebackers, Manny Lawson or Thomas Howard, has the physicality to stick his nose in pile against the run. Both are space-oriented players operating in a scheme that's built around attacking blockers. Perhaps Howard will be demoted to more fitting nickel linebacker duties once Keith Rivers recovers from his wrist injury. But that won't spark this group; Rivers, a 2008 first-round pick, has turned out to be nothing special. The Bengals basically admitted this by drafting Dontay Moch in the third-round. Moch plays with a burst but is said to have stiff hips and will need time to get acclimated to this system.
The Bengals once had an outside linebacker like Moch in Michael Johnson. He showed unusual athleticism playing downhill. But recently the Bengals decided these traits translated better to Johnson's original defensive end position. He is now a starter there, though a raw one who often plays too tall and without deliberate technique. Don't be surprised if run-defending specialist Jonathan Fanene or perpetually "developing" Frostee Rucker rotate with Johnson on the right side.
Robert Geathers remains the starting left end, which is problematic because he's built like a pass-rushing specialist but has just 10.5 sacks over the last four years. Second-year ex-Gator Carlos Dunlap is clearly Cincy's most talented defensive end. Whether that talent can be corralled on a down-by-down basis remains to be seen. But even if it can't, Dunlap is still valuable as a splash playmaker. He led the team with 9.5 sacks in limited action last season.
Inside, Domata Peko has the power and lateral strength to draw double teams and plug the run. He'll play the nose, with Pat Sims and Geno Atkins sharing time at the under tackle spot. Sims has good size and gets off blocks with quickness; Atkins, a fourth-round pick a year ago, must learn to avoid getting caught in the wash.
Special Teams
Mike Nugent has been a fringe kicker for most of his six-year career. Hard to believe considering the Jets drafted him in the second round. Statistically speaking, Kevin Huber is a middle of the road punter. Quan Crosby lacks explosiveness as a punt returner and could be challenged by a number of players (the depth chart says Jordan Shipley, but you have to think Pacman Jones will get a look). Bernard Scott is a fairly consistent kick returner.
Bottom Line
It's unlikely that a mildly skilled rookie quarterback can fix the mess that a veteran like Palmer deemed unfixable. Equally as troubling as the locker room are the issues with the defensive front seven.

HEADLINE: Pet Chauffeur Tries to Adapt to Tough Economy

BYLINE: TED TRAUTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Focusing on wealthy dog owners -- "I got vans running up and down Fifth Avenue all day long" -- is one strategy.

 BODY:
The recession has not been kind to the pet industry. While their finances are in flux, pet owners are less likely to splurge on toys or grooming, and fewer vacations spell empty kennels at the boarding house. In fact, prospective owners are less likely to take on the financial burden of a new dog or cat to begin with.
As you can see in the video above, David Lang, owner of a Manhattan business called Pet Chauffeur, is keenly aware of these challenges. Fifteen years ago, Mr. Lang noticed that the subway system's vast ridership included few dogs. Passengers can bring small pets on board in carrying cases, but owners of larger dogs cannot travel with their pets by subway, bus or taxi. Sensing he could fill a void, he founded Pet Chauffeur, a taxi service for animals, in 1996.
From his home office on East 36th Street, Mr. Lang coordinates a fleet of four orange-and-blue minivans and a staff of 12 dispatchers and drivers. Customers have the option of riding along with their pets, but many choose not to, leaving the drivers to learn their dogs' idiosyncrasies first-hand. And dogs are not the only animals getting a lift: Pet Chauffeur has transported everything from leopards to bulk shipments of lab rats. But dogs are the most frequent riders, and Mr. Lang says the most popular destinations are veterinary clinics, grooming salons and boarding kennels.
The bulk of Pet Chauffeur's $1 million annual revenue comes from its business in New York City, but its vans have traveled as far as Florida, and the company also coordinates the shipping of animals by air. Because many of his customers live in Manhattan's tonier neighborhoods, Mr. Lang hopes to sell ad space on his vans to luxury retailers. "I got vans running up and down Fifth Avenue all day long," he said. "Who wouldn't want their perfume on top of a Pet Chauffeur?"
Despite these plans, Mr. Lang is wary of expansion. He used to run a boarding service and a pet supply retail Web site, both of which failed to weather the recent recession. He now concentrates all of his effort on transportation and has adapted his company to the new economic context in two ways: first, he targets high-end customers. In 2008, he came to the conclusion, "now's the time to get rid of the people who don't want to pay for our service anyway, and up the price, and go with the high-end people that want our service."
Pet Chauffeur's other post-recession adaptation is to collaborate with competitors. If Mr. Lang is unable to arrange a pick-up for a customer, he will refer that person to companies like Tim's Pet Minivan or Tony's Canine Cab. Because the pet taxi industry represents such a niche service, Mr. Lang said, he'd "rather see someone go with the other guy than not go at all." Mr. Lang added: "Anyway, we've got the best service, so they'll come back to us in the end."

HEADLINE: A New York Hurricane Could Be a Multibillion-Dollar Catastrophe

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If a major hurricane were to pass close to New York City, history suggests that the economic damage could run into the tens of billions of dollars.

 BODY:
Time to think about the unthinkable. What if a major hurricane were to pass close to New York City, as several forecasting models now suggest that Hurricane Irene might?
Apart from the inevitable loss of life in the most densely populated part of the country, history suggests that the economic damage could run into the tens of billions of dollars, depending on the severity of the storm and how close it comes to the city. Unlikely but theoretically plausible scenarios could have the damage entering the realm of the costliest natural disasters of all time, and perhaps being large enough to have a materially negative effect on the nation's gross domestic product.
Tropical cyclones in and around New York City and the Northeastern United States are fairly rare but not unprecedented. Using a relatively conservative set of criteria, I have identified 20 storms since 1900 that have made landfall north of the Mason-Dixon line with tropical-storm force winds (at least 39 miles per hour) or higher, 12 of which made direct hits on either Long Island or New Jersey.
The table below provides several key pieces of data for each storm. First, how close the eye of the storm was to New York City (specifically, Midtown Manhattan) at its closest approach. Second, what the storm's maximum sustained wind speed was at that time. And third, how much economic damage it was estimated to have caused.
Some further detail is in order. Storm tracks and wind speeds are estimated from the excellent Web site Stormpulse.com. The only case where my estimates differ meaningfully from Stormpulse are for the 1938 New England Hurricane, for which the last recorded estimate of wind speed, when the hurricane was about 100 miles south of Long Island, was 100 miles per hour, but which forensic evidence suggests was producing winds closer to 120 miles per hour when it actually made landfall. (More on that 1938 storm in a moment.)
Most of the economic estimates are taken from a 2008 paper by Roger A. Pielke, et. al., which adjusts nominal estimates of storm damage not only for inflation, but also for the growth in wealth, population and property values, allowing for the comparisons to be more apples-to-apples. Some of the storms, particularly those that occurred prior to the 1930s or after the paper was written, were not included in Mr. Pielke's data set; in these cases, I have tried to reproduce his methodology. Three of the storms are described in news accounts as having produced "minimal" economic losses; I assign these a nominal cost of $1,000,000. Mr. Pielke's estimates are in 2005 dollars; I adjust each of them upward to 2011 figures using standard estimates of inflation.
The criteria for inclusion in the table are as follows:
1) The storm made landfall in the United States north of the Mason-Dixon line.
2) The storm produced at least tropical-storm strength winds when it made landfall.
3) The storm made landfall as a tropical (rather than extratropical) cyclone.
The first qualification is the fuzziest. There have been several storms that initially made landfall in the Carolinas or in other parts of the South, and retained enough power to be classified as tropical storms while passing through the Northeast, but which never again reached the open ocean. Such storms are included in the study as their behavior is fairly different from storms that come in directly from the coast. They may be considerably less well organized, acting more like a very severe thunderstorm and less like a hurricane.
However, storms that hit the South, re-emerge over the open ocean and reorganize themselves and then make a second and distinct landfall in the Northeast are included in the study, a pattern that has occurred on at least six occasions. Some cases are debatable: I do not classify a storm as having made a second landfall if it passed over a small body of water like Delaware Bay, but I do include it if it passed through the Atlantic Ocean proper, even briefly, as Hurricane Floyd did in 1999.
There are several storms that should pique your curiosity. First was the 1938 New England Hurricane, which is often cited as a reasonable worst-case scenario for what might happen to New York. That storm approached within about 40 miles of Central Park while producing wind speeds of 120 miles per hour, making it a Category 3 hurricane. The direct and indirect economic loss, according to Mr. Pielke's estimates, was the equivalent of about $45 billion in today's dollars, or roughly half as much as the impact caused by Hurricane Katrina.
Another dangerous precedent is Hurricane Agnes in 1972, which came closer than any other to producing a direct hit on Manhattan, with the storm's eye approaching just a handful of miles from the city. That storm followed an unusual trajectory, initially hitting the Florida panhandle through the Gulf of Mexico and traveling almost as far north as Atlanta, but then reorganizing after passing through the Carolinas, and hitting New York at about a 45 degree angle from the southeast.
Hurricane Agnes is not an especially good comparison for Hurricane Irene, which never came close to the Gulf of Mexico. But what is scary is that it produced the equivalent of $21 billion in economic losses, despite having wind speeds of only about 65 miles per hour -- tropical-storm strength rather than hurricane strength -- when passing through New York City and the Hudson Valley. Some of those losses were incurred in the South rather than in New York, but it is nevertheless a warning sign that proximity to the city matters.
The so-called Vagabond Hurricane of 1903, by some definitions the only modern hurricane ever to have made its initial landfall in New Jersey, produced about $13 billion in losses, despite the storm's eye never having come within more than about 60 miles of Manhattan.
But other storms have been much more benign than might be expected. In particular, Hurricane Gloria in 1985, despite having made landfall relatively far west on Long Island and having hurricane-strength winds at the time, resulted in only about $3 billion in economic damage. Hurricane Belle in 1976, although just teetering on the brink of hurricane strength when it made landfall, caused just one fatality and less than $1 billion in economic damage. 
Factors like the diameter of the storm, the speed with which it passes though the region (faster is better) and whether it strikes at high or low tide can have a profound effect on damage to life and property. These will not be well accounted for by maximum wind speed. Unfortunately, those factors will not necessarily work in favor of New York in the case of Hurricane Irene, a stubbornly large and slow-moving storm that, according to some projections, may be more likely to hit at high tide, producing a large storm surge.
Nevertheless, we have enough data to produce some ballpark estimates -- sort of an over-under line -- on how much economic damage a storm might produce based on its distance from New York City and the strength of its winds. The results of this exercise are not heartening.
The procedure I have used to estimate economic damage -- this is going to get a tiny bit technical -- is to regress the logarithm of economic damage on three independent variables. The first two variables are the storm's wind speed, and the distance of the storm from New York City, at its closest approach to Manhattan. The third variable is how many fatalities the storm caused in the Southern United States (these were significant in the cases of Hurricane Donna in 1960, Hurricane Agnes in 1972, and Hurricane Floyd in 1999), which is used as a proxy to segregate out damages caused in the South from those in the Northeast in the case of storms that made multiple distinct landfalls. The figures I am going to show you, therefore, reflect estimates of the economic damage to the Northeast from various types of hurricanes, including but not limited to the New York City metro region.
The numbers do not paint a pretty picture. According the model, a hurricane with wind speeds of about 100 miles per hour -- making it a "weak" Category 2 storm -- might cause on the order of $35 billion in damage if it were to pass directly over Manhattan. Such a storm would probably flood New York's subway system as well as acres upon acres of prime real estate in neighborhoods like the East Village, the Financial District, TriBeCa, Coney Island, Red Hook, Dumbo, as well as parts of Staten Island and most of the Rockaways. 
Although far from the most likely scenario, this may represent a reasonable-worst-case estimate of what could happen if Hurricane Irene took exactly the wrong turn at exactly the wrong time. National Weather Service models, as of this writing, estimate that there is a 5 to 10 percent chance that Manhattan could experience hurricane-strength winds. Local readers should stop what they are doing and check to see whether they are in one of New York City's hurricane evacuation zones.
A $35 billion loss is equivalent to roughly half of New York City's annual budget, so the city would require significant assistance from state and federal authorities. It is also equivalent to about 1 percent of the United States' quarterly gross domestic product, so such a storm could tangibly increase the chance of a recession.
The good news is that such a storm would have to make something of a bank shot, as Hurricane Agnes did in 1972, in order to pass directly over New York City. It is intrinsically fairly hard for a storm to make landfall upon New York City itself rather than somewhere else along the Atlantic.
A considerably more likely scenario is that a hurricane-strength storm would come ashore on central Long Island. That would still be extremely bad: a weak Category 2 storm with an eye that passed about 50 miles from Manhattan would result in about $10 billion in damage, according to the model.
Although highly unlikely to be experienced in the case of Hurricane Irene, it is theoretically possible that an even stronger storm might hit the city at some point in the future. A Category 3 hurricane, one with wind speeds of 111 miles per hour or higher, could plausibly produce an economic impact in excess of $100 billion if its eye were to pass directly over Manhattan, according to the model. A stronger Category 3 storm, passing immediately over Manhattan, could rival or exceed the roughly $235 billion in economic damage estimated to have been caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.
What happens beyond that gets into highly speculative territory: in recorded history, no storm has made landfall in the Northeastern United States while stronger than a Category 3. Meteorologists debate whether a Category 4 storm hitting New York is literally physically impossible, so unlikely as to be practically impossible, or a plausible occurrence but one that will happen less than once in a generation. One of the nastier potential consequences of global warming is that tropical cyclones could retain more momentum as they travel through the Eastern Seaboard, broadening the range of potential worst-case scenarios.
If such a storm were to occur, it would be exceptionally devastating to New York City, and its economic effects would plausibly run into the trillions of dollars, tantamount to the estimates that some scholars have provided of a Tohoku-strength earthquake striking directly under Tokyo (something that almost certainly is physically possible). Keep in mind that New York's annual gross domestic product is estimated to be about $1.4 trillion -- about one-tenth of the nation's gross domestic product -- so if much of the city were to become dysfunctional for months or more, the damage to the global and domestic economies would be almost incalculable. The property value of New York City real estate, meanwhile, is estimated to be about $800 billion, and property damage represents only a portion of the overall economic loss that might be incurred from a catastrophic hurricane.
These scenarios are exceptionally unlikely to be visited in the case of Hurricane Irene, an extraordinarily dangerous but not apocalyptic storm. But New York may be put to the test. Stay safe.

HEADLINE: The Week in Food

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The week in food links.

 BODY:
Thank you, Anna Lappe, for writing what so many of us non-GMO-Kool-Aid-drinkers have been thinking about Nina Fedoroff's Times Op-Ed.
When it comes to food safety, the F.D.A. has more than ever to do - but not a lot of resources with which to operate.
The U.S. is becoming a food stamp nation. But we're still a soda nation, and we'll stay that way for a little while longer at least: the U.S.D.A. rejected New York's proposal to ban the use of food stamps for sugar-sweetened beverages. The U.S.D.A. prefers healthy incentives to outright restrictions, but I have to think the U.S.D.A. could be a little more forceful in attempting to reduce soda consumption among food benefit recipients, and everyone else.
More on the most sensible basic way to change our eating habits: A Vienna University of Technology study says if you want to help the environment switching to organic is a lot less productive than just eating less meat. Different story, same ending: Tufts food economist explains why not all food price increases are bad (spoiler alert: they can lead to drastic forms of moderation like. . .gulp. . .eating a little less meat.)
I guess I can't talk about eating less meat without including this shout out to Bill Clinton, now America's most famous vegan. (You gotta think he cheats, though, no? Not that there's anything wrong with that.)
Here's an interesting piece by James McWilliams on the way that factory farming eliminates a farmer's emotional connection with his animals, making it easier to kill them. McWilliams doubts that we, a nation of meat eaters knowing what we now know about the minds of animals, could go back to a pre-industrial system of farming in which we nurture animals, look them in the eye, and kill them.
The Corn Refiners Association disputes the link between added sugars and heart risk. Of course they do. In slightly more unexpected corn news, the corn lobby is comparing corn ethanol to fairies and unicorns.
Cool infographic: how to live off the land. Speaking of living off the land, are farmers markets too popular for their own good
A study found that sea lice from farmed salmon can threaten wild salmon stocks.
Sandra Lee behind the scenes: Semi-****ing homemade.
Could saffron help prevent liver cancer? It may be more expensive than prescription drugs, but much tastier. Slightly less sexy: the use of coriander oilin foods could help kill off E. coli, salmonella, and MRSA.
This isn't how we normally hear about "blue chips" in the news (usually high-performing stocks, not low-performing meat.) Speaking of dirty little secrets: this piece by Greenpeace's Casson Trenor has been floating around for a little while, but it's an important read if you want to know what goes into your can of tuna.
To end with a story from the "what's really important" category: a few weeks ago the husband of popular food blogger Jennifer Perillo suddenly died. Her community of food bloggers founded a nonprofit, Bloggers Without Borders, to help support her financially. Please look.

HEADLINE: Recovering From a Balance-Sheet Recession

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: The nation's economic problems cannot be fixed without resolving the jobs crisis, and that can't be addressed until it's properly diagnosed, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Unprecedented volatility on global capital markets and a sharp correction in global equity prices are warning signs that the United States, Europe and Japan are teetering on the brink of a double-dip recession. 
In the United States, growth in the first half of the year was far slower than predicted, and forecasts for the full year have been marked down. Even if the economy does not slip back into recession, the jobs crisis will persist, because growth will be barely enough to absorb the flow of new entrants into the labor force and certainly not enough to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate. 
To develop cures to ease the jobs crisis, its causes must be diagnosed correctly. The fundamental cause is the drastic breakdown in private-sector demand brought on by the 2008 financial crisis that burst the debt-financed housing and spending boom preceding it.
This boom displayed all of the features of a major financial crisis in the making -- asset price inflation, rising leverage, a large current account deficit and slowing growth. And the recession that followed had all of the features of what Richard Koo called a "balance-sheet" recession -- a sharp decline in output and employment caused by a collapse of demand resulting from vast wealth destruction and painful de-leveraging by the private sector. 
The economy is now mired in an anemic balance-sheet recovery in which many consumers and businesses continue to curtail their spending relative to their income, increase their saving and reduce their debt even though interest rates are near zero. And the process of de-leveraging is only beginning.

Real per-capita net worth in the United States is back at its 1999 level. The real per-capita value of housing equity has fallen to its 1978 level, and housing prices are still slipping in many parts of the country. 
Household debt has come down to about 115 percent of disposable income, largely as a result of foreclosures, 15 percentage points below its peak of 130 percent in 2007 but significantly higher than its 1970-2000 average of 75 percent. Household saving has risen to about 5 percent of disposable income, far above the 2005 low of 1.2 percent but far short of the 1970-2000 average of 8 percent. 
Consumption is the major driver of aggregate demand in the United States economy, and since early 2008 it has grown at an average rate of 0.5 percent in real terms. Not since before World War II has consumption growth been this weak for such an extended period. 
Despite misleading claims by Republican members of Congress and by Republican candidates on the presidential campaign trail that the size of government, regulation and excessive taxation have caused the jobs problem, business surveys repeatedly have identified weak demand as the primary constraint on job creation. 
As one small-business owner told The Los Angeles Times, "If you don't have the demand, you don't hire the people." And the majority of economists agree on this diagnosis. They also agree that the recovery from a balance-sheet recession can be agonizingly long, with significantly slower growth and a significantly higher unemployment rate for at least a decade. 
Recent data indicate that the United States is on such a course, and many economists are now drawing comparisons between it and Japan during the two "lost decades" following Japan's 1989-90 financial crisis and ensuing balance-sheet recession. 
A recent study by the economist Robert Gordon confirmed that the shortfall in private-sector demand, especially the demand for consumer services, residential and commercial construction, and consumer durables, is the primary cause of shortfalls in production and jobs. 
He also found that strong net exports, in response to growing aggregate demand abroad, has reduced the jobs gap by about one million jobs, but these gains have been offset by cutbacks in domestic spending, including spending by state and local governments. 
In other recoveries during the last 50 years, public-sector employment increased. This time it is falling: during the last year the private sector added 1.8 million jobs while the public sector cut 550,000.
What should policy makers do to combat the large and lingering job losses that result from a financial crisis and balance-sheet recession? Mr. Koo, whose book on Japan's experience should be required reading for members of Congress, showed that when the private sector is curtailing spending, fiscal stimulus to increase growth and reduce unemployment is the most effective way to reduce the private-sector debt overhang choking private spending. 
When the Japanese government tried fiscal consolidation to slow the growth of government debt in response to International Monetary Fund advice in 1997, the results were economic contraction and an increase in the government deficit. In contrast, when the Japanese government increased government spending, the pace of recovery strengthened and the deficit as a share of gross domestic product declined. 
The credit rating agencies gave Japan a lower credit rating than Botswana, but this had no impact on the yield on Japanese government bonds. Contrary to the rating "experts," investors were worried about a prolonged stagnation, not about the ability of Japan's government to roll over its debt -- and they were willing to buy this debt with their growing savings surplus. (Richard Koo, "," Nomura Equity Research Report, Aug. 9, 2011)
Investors have had a similar response to the downgrade of United States government debt by Standard & Poor's. To investors, the downgrade signaled the possibility of premature austerity and heightened the risk of a double-dip recession, and this drove the yield on 10-year government debt to levels not seen since the 1950s. 
The market understands that the most important driver of the fiscal deficit in the short to medium run is weak tax revenues, reflecting slow growth and high unemployment, and that additional fiscal measures to put people back to work are the most effective way to reduce the deficit. 
Every one percentage point of growth adds about $2.5 trillion in government revenue. An extra percentage point of growth over the next five years would do more to reduce the deficit during that period than any of the spending cuts currently under discussion. And faster growth would make it easier for the private sector to reduce its debt burden. 
But what about the growth of public-sector debt that would result from more fiscal stimulus? Some economists worry that the growing government debt will itself become a constraint on growth. But that certainly is not the case now -- with weak private-sector demand and a huge output gap, spending and borrowing by the government are not crowding out spending and borrowing by the private sector. 
What about the fact that by some estimates the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is approaching the 90 percent threshold identified by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff as likely to reduce growth by a percentage point a year? As Robert Shiller has pointed out, the causality between this ratio and growth runs in reverse when the economy has lots of slack as it has now. 
Under these conditions, slow growth leads to a higher debt ratio, not vice versa.
The United States government can currently borrow funds and repay less than it borrows in constant dollars. Surely there are many job-creating investment projects in education, research and infrastructure that would earn a higher rate of return. I argued in favor of more government spending on such projects and the introduction of a capital budget in my previous Economix post. 
Even Professor Rogoff acknowledged in a recent interview that he would support more government spending on infrastructure, and there is widespread bipartisan support for infrastructure investment in the Congress and in the business and labor communities. 
Unfortunately, the current extension of the highway trust fund and surface transportation bill expires on Sept. 30, as does the authorization of the federal gasoline tax and highway user fees to finance them. Now there are signs that Republicans in Congress, egged on by Tea Party attacks on the size of government, may block both measures, precipitating more than 100,000 job losses a month. 
In a balance-sheet recession caused by too much private-sector debt, the government should also use its resources to catalyze debt workouts and debt reductions. 
In the United States, where mortgages account for most of the private debt overhang, the federal government should enact stronger measures to reduce principal balances on troubled mortgages and to make refinancing easier. These measures would help stabilize the housing market, would prevent future defaults and would free money for borrowers to use to pay down their debt or increase their spending. 
This would translate into stronger private-sector demand and more jobs. Many economists, including me, warned in 2008 that the economy would not recover until the housing market recovered, and the housing market won't recover until the debt overhang from the housing bubble is reduced through programs that shift some of the burden to creditors from debtors. 
Increases in public spending along with housing relief and expansionary monetary policy helped the economy recover from the Great Depression in the 1930s. The same combination of policies can help the United States recover from the Great Recession now. 
At the end of World War II, the federal debt-to-G.D.P. ratio was 109 percent, one and a half times what it is today. Yet after the war the economy thrived, and no one questioned the government's ability to pay its debt over time. 
We should now be fighting a war against unemployment and the waste of resources, poverty, inequality and the hopelessness it causes. 
Government debt may rise as a result of this war effort, but no one will question the government's ability to pay its debt provided Congress and the president commit now to a balanced multiyear plan to reduce the long-run deficit once the war against unemployment has been won and Americans are back at work.

HEADLINE: Latest Updates on Hurricane Irene

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY and SARAH MASLIN NIR


HIGHLIGHT: On Friday, The Lede is tracking preparations for the expected landfall of Hurricane Irene, a powerful storm heading for the Notheastern United States.

 BODY:
1:17 A.M. | Amtrak Service Cut and Plane Arrivals Canceled
All New York City-area airports will be closed to incoming flights after noon on Saturday, and Amtrak has canceled all Northeast Corridor trains that would have run on Sunday.
Amtrak will also reduce service on Saturday on its Northeast Corridor, Keystone Corridor, Springfield Line, Empire Service, Vermonter, Piedmont Service and Northeast Regional routes and for many of its long-distance trains, according to a statement posted on Amtrak's Web site.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced at 9:30 p.m. that it would close all five of its airports - Kennedy and La Guardia in New York City, Newark Liberty, Stewart in Orange County, N.Y., and Teterboro in New Jersey - to arriving flights.
From the Port Authority's Web site:
Due to Hurricane Irene, all Port Authority Airports will close to arriving domestic and international flights at noon tomorrow. The five airports will remain open for departing flights pending further updates. Please check with your carrier before coming to JFK. There will be limited mass transit access to the airport. The MTA will begin to shut down all train, bus, and subway services throughout the city and on Long Island starting at 12:00 p.m. At the same time, NJ Transit will suspend all rail operations and at 6:00 p.m., all bus operations will be suspended. Visit the transit agencies websites for more up to date news on their operations. You can also visit www.panynj.com for updated info and weather for all Port Authority facilities.
Refunds are available for Amtrak riders whose trains were canceled. Passengers who want updated information should call 800-USA-RAIL or go to Amtrak.com.
1:16 A.M. | Live From Nags Head, N.C.
Bands of severe thunderstorms are now whipping eastern North Carolina, announcing the arrival of Hurricane Irene. As expected, flooding is becoming a serious concern.
While the center of the storm is still well offshore and is not expected to reach the coast until Saturday morning, these outer storm bands are dangerous because they contain torrential rains and can spawn tornadoes. About two hours after night fell, much of the coast was placed under a flood warning.
Local forecasters said that the eastern part of the state had already received two to three inches of rain, with at least that much or more on the way before dawn.
A drive through Nags Head on Friday night showed that no stores were open, and the last gas station was closed at 8 p.m. A sign there read, "Be safe." There were few cars on the main roads, indicating that people were respecting the authorities' requests to evacuate or, barring that, to stay home.
12:36 A.M. | Photographs From Your Hometown as the Storm Moves In
Readers of The New York Times have been sending in their photographsas Hurricane Irene moved closer to shore. Submit your own.
11:41 P.M. | Follow the Hurricane in Real Time
The New York Times has developed an interactive hurricane tracking map that allows you to follow the storm's progress in real time. 
11:39 P.M. | New York Evacuation Now Estimated at 370,000 People
The Office of Emergency Management has raised the city's estimate of the number of people required to evacuate to 370,000. Previous estimates has put the figure at 250,000.
10:31 | How Hurricanes Get Their Names
In theory, a butterfly flapping its wings halfway across the world could have caused the eddies that gave birth to Hurricane Irene, but the origin of the storm's name is not nearly so fanciful.
Hurricanes are named by the World Meteorological Organization, an agency of the United Nations. The group was established in 1950, right around the time that, in the Southern Hemisphere at least, such storms began to be given both men's and women's names.
Storms have long been given names for simplicity's sake - rather than using numbers or descriptions - in messages of warning, but there were often arbitrary: a hurricane could be named after a ship it wrecked, for example, according to information on the meteorological group's Web site.
Starting in the 1900s, proper names were used in alphabetical order. For North Atlantic storms, all of them were female, but they were randomly chosen, not, the organization stresses, selected to name the storm after a real person.
Now a multinational committee keeps lists of names for North Atlantic storms that it has maintained since 1953 (male names were added in 1979). The six lists are used in a rotation, except when a storm has been "so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity." Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which caused such devastation in New Orleans, and Hurricane Mitch, which struck Honduras in 1998, are among the names that have been retired.
8:45 P.M. | Hurricane Center Says Storm Is Staying on Track
In its 8 p.m. update, the National Hurricane Center reported that Hurricane Irene continued to barrel up the East Coastat 14 miles per hour. It continued:
 The core of the hurricane will approach the coast of North Carolina tonight and pass near or over the North Carolina coast on Saturday. The hurricane is forecast to move near or over the mid-Atlantic coast Saturday night and move over southern New England on Sunday.
 Maximum sustained winds remain near 100 miles per hour with higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast before Irene reaches the coast of North Carolina. Some weakening is expected after that, but Irene is forecast to remain a hurricane as it moves along the mid-Atlantic coast on Sunday.
 Irene is a large tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles from the center and tropical-force winds extend outward of up to 290 miles. During the past hour, a sustained wind of 52 miles per hour and a gust to 62 miles per hour were reported at the Johnny Mercer Pier in Wrightsville Beach North Carolina.
In addition, tropical storm conditions are expected to reach southern New England on Saturday night, with hurricane conditions predicted for Sunday, according to the report.
Water levels could rise by 6 to 11 feet above ground level in parts of North Carolina, the hurricane center said. Isolated tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina.
As the storm moves north, New England will experience tropical storm conditions on Saturday and feel the force of a full-blown hurricane on Sunday. Farther south, water levels may rise by four and six feet in the southern portion of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.
A maximum of 15 inches of rainfall could accumulate in some places, the hurricane center said, causing flash floods, swells and rip currents that could be life-threatening.
8:30 P.M. | Obama Declares State of Emergency for New York
President Obama declared a state of emergency for New York State about 5 p.m. on Friday in anticipation of Hurricane Irene, a Category 2 storm, making landfall on the East Coast, The Times's Sarah Maslin Nir reports.
7:00 P.M. | Now Reporting on Twitter From North Carolina
Our colleague Brian Stelter, who is reporting on the storm in North Carolina - and posting a steady stream of updates on his @BrianStelter Twitter feed - reports:
For some store owners on the Outer Banks, Irene is a "hurri-cation." That's what Jerry Slayton, the manager of the Cavalier Surf Shop, called it on Friday, right after the last sandbag was put in place at the front door.
Mr. Slayton and his parents, Ken and Marty, said the summer tourism season had been busy - noticeably busier than last year - so the economic impact of Irene is less severe than it otherwise would have been. "We've worked a lot of hours all summer so this is kind of like a little day off," Mrs. Slayton said. 
What does a "hurri-cation" consist of? "We go home, play games and wait the storm out," Ken Slayton said.
While most tourists have headed home by now, many of the people who call Nags Head home are staying, the Slaytons said. "They know how to prepare," Mrs. Slayton said. Evidently she is prepared: she then offered this reporter a beer.
Kim Severson, the Atlanta bureau chief for The New York Times, is also filing updates on the storm on on her @kimseverson Twitter feed.
6:17 P.M. | Chart Explains Possible Damage From Hurricane Winds
Predictions that the storm could weaken to a Category 1 hurricane by the time it reaches population centers might spark some relief, but it is important to keep in mind what kind of damage hurricane-force winds can cause. This useful chart from the National Hurricane Center explains in great detail exactly what sort of damage hurricanes of various categories are likely to cause.
Here is a summary of what to expect from a Category 1 storm, which comes with "very dangerous winds" of 74-95 m.p.h that "will produce some damage."
People, livestock, and pets struck by flying or falling debris could be injured or killed.
Older (mainly pre-1994 construction) mobile homes could be destroyed, especially if they are not anchored properly as they tend to shift or roll off their foundations. Newer mobile homes that are anchored properly can sustain damage involving the removal of shingle or metal roof coverings, and loss of vinyl siding, as well as damage to carports, sunrooms, or lanais. 
Some poorly constructed frame homes can experience major damage, involving loss of the roof covering and damage to gable ends as well as the removal of porch coverings and awnings. Unprotected windows may break if struck by flying debris. Masonry chimneys can be toppled. Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof shingles, vinyl siding, soffit panels, and gutters. Failure of aluminum, screened-in, swimming pool enclosures can occur. 
Some apartment building and shopping center roof coverings could be partially removed. Industrial buildings can lose roofing and siding especially from windward corners, rakes, and eaves. Failures to overhead doors and unprotected windows will be common. 
Windows in high-rise buildings can be broken by flying debris. Falling and broken glass will pose a significant danger even after the storm. There will be occasional damage to commercial signage, fences, and canopies. 
Large branches of trees will snap and shallow rooted trees can be toppled. 
Extensive damage to power lines and poles will likely result in power outages that could last a few to several days.
Here is the latest interactive map from the Google Crisis Response team charting Hurricane Irene's predicted path, based on data from the National Hurricane Center.
5:46 P.M. | Even if Storm Weakens, Flooding Could Be a Problem
 Jeff Masters, a founder of the Weather Underground Web site who studied storms from the air for four years with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Hunters, is tracking Irene's progress in great detail on his WunderBlog.
In his most recent post, Dr. Masters reports: "Satellite data and measurements from the Hurricane Hunters show that Irene is weakening." He explains that an Air Force flight over the storm this morning "found that Irene's eyewall had collapsed," this morning. He adds: "The winds measured in Irene near the surface support classifying it as a strong Category 1 hurricane or weak Category 2."
Based on the latest data, Dr. Masters produced a good news/bad news forecast: predicting that the storm could cause dramatic flooding even if it weakens to a Category 1 hurricane as it moves north. He explains:
With its eyewall collapsed and just 18 more hours over water before landfall, Irene does not have time to build a new eyewall and intensify. The storm is too large to weaken quickly, and the best forecast is that Irene will be a strong Category 1 hurricane at landfall in North Carolina on Saturday. 
Based on the latest wind analysis from NOAA's Hurricane Research Division and Irene's continued weakening trend, I predict that the 80-mile section of North Carolina coast to the right of where Irene makes landfall will receive sustained hurricane-force winds of 75-85 m.p.h. on Saturday at landfall; the 80-mile section of coast to the left will receive 55-75 m.p.h. winds. High wind shear of 30 knots will begin ripping into Irene Sunday morning when it is near Southern New Jersey, and more rapid weakening will occur. 
By the time Irene arrives on Long Island Sunday afternoon, it will probably have top sustained winds in the 65-75 m.p.h. range. However, since Irene is such a huge storm - tropical storm force winds extend out up to 290 miles from the center - it has set a massive amount of the ocean's surface in motion, which will cause a much larger storm surge than the winds would suggest. At 3:30 pm EDT this afternoon, a wind analysis from NOAA's Hurricane Research Division indicated that the potential storm surge damage from Irene still rated a 5.0 on a scale of 0 to 6. This is equivalent to the storm surge a typical Category 4 hurricane would have. 
While this damage potential should steadily decline as Irene moves northwards and weakens, we can still expect a storm surge one full Saffir-Simpson Category higher than Irene's winds when it impacts the coast. Since tides are at their highest levels of the month this weekend due to the new moon, storm surge flooding will be at a maximum during the high tidal cycles that will occur at 8 p.m. Saturday night and 8 a.m. Sunday morning. Wherever Irene happens to be at those times, the storm surge damage potential will be maximized. I continue to give a 20 percent chance that a 3-4 foot storm surge high enough to over-top the Manhattan flood walls and swamp the New York City subway system will occur on Sunday. The latest 11 a.m. probabilistic storm surge map from the National Hurricane Center shows a 20-30 percent chance of a storm surge in excess of 3 feet in New York Harbor. Keep in mind that these maps are calculated for normal tide level, and this weekend's high tides will be nearly 1 foot above normal.
5:18 P.M. | Looking at Simulations of the Possible Storm Surge
In a new post on his Dot Earth blog, "New York Surge From Irene Looks Bad, But Not Off Charts," my colleague Andrew Revkin reports:
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology focused on coastal impacts from hurricanes have run fresh simulations of the possible storm surge as Hurricane Irene hits the New York metropolitan region. Simulations using two surge models (known by their acronyms, SLOSH and ADCIRC) found 1.22 and 1.05 meters of surge (4 and 3.44 feet) of surge at the Battery, at the southern tip of Manhattan.
This would pose serious risks to low installations and the subways but is nowhere near a worst case (think 13 feet, as in 1821)....
The surge model also does not include waves* and the extra tide expected because it's a new moon. They're in the process of running a simulation with that factor included.
In an update to the post, he adds:
The Storm Surge Research Group at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, has a great online tool that provides an advance estimate of storm surge at important spots around New York City and Long Island Sound. Click on a buoy to see the current state of sea level and what's anticipated over the next 24 hours (the models are run twice a day). The group emphasizes that this is a work in progress and should not be used to make evacuation decisions or the like. 
4:51 P.M. | NASA Image Shows Scale of Hurricane Off East Coast
The latest in a series of remarkable NASA satellite images of Hurricane Irene tracking up the East Coast shows it heading for land about three and a half hours ago, at 17:02 UTC, or 1:02 p.m. EDT.
3:08 P.M. | Updated Forecast From National Hurricane Center
The National Hurricane Center's latest advisory notes that Irene has "weakened slightly," but still packs winds of 100 miles per hour. 
The Google Crisis Response team has produced an interactive map that charts the storm's predicted path.
2:13 P.M. | New York Orders Mandatory Evacuation of Some Areas
At a news conference minutes ago, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he is ordering a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, along with Battery Park City and the financial district in Lower Manhattan and Governor's Island. Residents of what the city calls Zone A must be out of their homes by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Zone A is clearly outlined in this interactive map posted online by WNYC. A searchable version of the map is embedded in our 1:17 p.m. update.
Earlier, the city decided to shut down the city's entire subway and bus system at noon on Saturday.
1:50 P.M. | New York Plans to Shut Transit System on Saturday
My colleague James Barron reports:
With Hurricane Irene pushing relentlessly toward the East Coast, officials made plans to shut down New York City's sprawling subway and bus system beginning at noon on Saturday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said. 
The commuter rail lines that serve Long Island, Westchester County and Connecticut will also be shut down. 
New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, plans to decide by Saturday morning whether to order a general evacuation of the low-lying areas. 
Outside New York City, local governments announced some less dramatic changes:
Some Atlantic City casinos made plans to stop rolling the dice and turn off the slot machines by 8 p.m. Friday. The naval submarine base in Groton, Conn., sent four submarines out to ride out the storm deep in the Atlantic Ocean. And Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said that all lanes of 28-mile stretch of a major highway in Ocean County would go in only one direction - westward - beginning at 6 p.m. on Friday to help speed the trip away from Long Beach Island. 
1:40 P.M. | Image of Irene From Space Shows Huge Storm
Based on this image of the earth, taken from a NASA satellite on Friday at 10:45 a.m. ET, the space agency estimates that Hurricane Irene now has a diameter of about 510 miles, which is almost one-third the length of the U.S. Atlantic coastline:
1:31 P.M. | Obama Warns Americans to 'Take This Seriously'
As my colleague Jackie Calmes reports:
President Obama will cut short his Martha's Vineyard vacation because of Hurricane Irene and return Friday night, as he urged Americans along the Eastern Seaboard to take precautions against the potentially "historic hurricane" making its way toward the coast this weekend.
Mr. Obama, his wife and two daughters were to leave Martha's Vineyard, just off Massachusetts, on Saturday but he decided "it would be more prudent" for him to get back to the White House to monitor events by returning Friday, said spokesman Josh Earnest. Island authorities had begun their own preparations for the storm, including canceling some ferries to the mainland.
Immediately before directing his aides to prepare to depart, Mr. Obama appeared before cameras at his rental farm property to warn that Hurricane Irene, which on Friday was barreling toward North Carolina on a path that threatened all the way through New England, is "likely to be an extremely dangerous and costly storm."
"All indications point to this being a historic hurricane," he added.
"I cannot stress this highly enough: If you are in the projected path of this hurricane, you have to take precautions now. Don't wait. Don't delay. We all hope for the best, but we have to be prepared for the worst. All of us have to take this storm seriously. You need to listen to your state and local officials, and if you are given an evacuation order, please follow it," Mr. Obama said.
1:17 P.M. | A Searchable Map of New York's Evacuation Zones
As my colleague James Barron reports, "New York City began evacuating hospitals and nursing homes in low-lying areas on Friday morning, and the National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the city, Long Island and Connecticut and a hurricane warning for much of New Jersey." 
Readers in New York City who want to get an idea of how they might be affected by a direct hit from Hurricane Irene can download a map prepared by the city's Office of Emergency Management, which shows exactly which neighborhoods might need to be evacuated. The map divides low-lying areas of the city into three zones from which residents might need to be evacuated. As the office explains:
Residents in Zone A face the highest risk of flooding from a hurricane's storm surge. Zone A includes all low-lying coastal areas and other areas that could experience storm surge from ANY hurricane making landfall close to New York City.
Residents in Zone B may experience storm surge flooding from a MODERATE (Category 2 and higher) hurricane.
Residents in Zone C may experience storm surge flooding from a MAJOR (Category 3 & 4) hurricane making landfall just south of New York City. A major hurricane is unlikely in New York City, but not impossible.
WNYC, a public radio station, has taken the city's data and created this interactive version of the map, which allows users to search by address to find out if they are in one of the potential evacuation zones.
12:57 P.M. | Latest Forecast for Path of Hurricane Irene
Here, from the Web site of WNYC, the New York public radio station, is a map showing the latest forecast for the path of Hurricane Irene, which was issued by the National Weather Service at 11 a.m.
12:20 P.M. | Predicted Track of Storm Recalls Hurricane Floyd
On Thursday, my colleague John Schwartz explained the difficulty of evacuating even flood-prone areas, like the North Carolina coastal region:
When it is time to go, it is probably too late.
Evacuations of coastal areas, and especially island communities like those on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, present problems that are geographical, logistical and emotional: many of the vacationers and residents do not want to leave until they are certain they have to. But the longer they wait, the harder it is to get out. 
North Carolina has studied its roadways and evacuation routes and developed exquisitely detailed plans that include the placement of checkpoints and the staffing levels at each one. But no one is under any illusion that things will necessarily go smoothly.
"No matter what plan you have in effect, if everybody decides to leave at the last minute, you're going to have a traffic jam," said Sgt. Jeff Gordon of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. "The thing about storms is, they are so unpredictable you don't want to stay until the last minute to see if the storm is going to turn."
Today, John, like many people in and around New York, has been thinking more about the possible impact of the storm here. He writes:
It's hard to say what damage a hurricane will do, but some of us watching Irene think back on a hurricane called Floyd, which followed a track in 1999 that was not too different. Its winds, by the time it got to the Northeast, were not a terrible issue, but it pushed a damaging storm surge in front of it and dropped tremendous amounts of rain on the region.
If Floyd is any guide, expect flooding, and lots of it: Rockland and Westchester Counties saw flooding in Floyd, as well as northern and central New Jersey. Downtown Bound Brook, NJ was under more than 15 feet of water as the Raritan crested some 20 feet above flood levels; two people there died.
More than $100 million has been spent to shore up flood control for Bound Brook since then, as Peter Applebome wrote last year, but the town continues to experience flooding in heavy rains.
The flood damage around the region remains a fresh memory. A Mongolian BBQ restaurant in Millburn, NJ, now closed, had a photo by the door from Floyd. It was a picture of the front of the restaurant, which sat by a park with a gentle stream running through it. Floyd turned the stream into a torrent, and several feet of water flowed through the front door of the restaurant. It was not the sort of image, for homeowners in town, that aids the digestion.
New Jersey's Star-Ledger has a report on the lessons residents and officials in Bound Brook say they learned from Floyd.
Here, from Wikipedia, is a 1999 National Weather Service graphic on the impact of Hurricane Floyd:
11:49 A.M. | Hurricane Center Expects Storm to Strike I-95 Corridor
My colleague Eric Lipton reports from Washington:
Even with the modest weakening overnight of Hurricane Irene, the nation's top emergency response officials and weather watchers warned Friday morning that the storm had the capacity to cause major, life-threatening damage along the Eastern seaboard and that those in low-lying coastal areas should heed any warnings to evaluate.
"A lot of trees down, a lot of power lines down, heavy rain," said Craig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, describing the likely impact of the storm, even in in-land areas.
Bill Read, director of the National Hurricane Center, said that he is highly confident now of the storm's track, meaning it will be a rare hurricane that travels right along the densely populated Interstate 95 corridor. "This is not just a coastal event" he said, echoing the warnings from Mr. Fugate.
Mr. Fugate, a former Florida emergency response official, said the key factor that federal officials can now influence - by urging residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate - is the number of deaths or injuries the storm causes. "The one thing we can change the outcome on is loss of life," he said. "People need to leave early, travel a safe distance."
11:41 A.M. | North Carolina Braces for Impact
As my colleagues Katharine Seelye and Eric Lipton report, Hurricane Irene is "lumbering toward North Carolina on Friday morning, heading for a destructive march up the East Coast in an unusually broad path that could affect 55 million people."
Hurricane watches have been issued for North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and New England, putting residents on notice to prepare for the worst and in some cases begin evacuations.... 
The storm was circling off the coast of Georgia in the late morning, slowly moving north and east, with an expected landfall of its most intense core in North Carolina on Saturday afternoon.
Brian Stelter, who is reporting for The Times from North Carolina, writes:
Standing on the beach at dawn, Dave Wessel, the mayor of the town of Duck, North Carolina said he anticipated a calm evacuation on Friday. A "good rush of people" left town on Thursday, he said, adding that most stores had either closed or would do so by mid-day Friday.
Mr. Wessel and his wife had reserved a hotel room two hours inland, but the storm is so wide that they are now planning on driving three hours inland, to Rocky Mount - a testament to just how wide the hurricane is. "It just refreshes to wobble back east" out to sea, he said.
Here is an Associated Press video report from Kill Devil Hills, N.C.

HEADLINE: Fed to Hold Hearings on Capital One's Deal for ING Direct USA

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve plans to hold three public hearings on whether the benefits of Capital One's purchase of ING Direct USA outweigh the risks of letting a too-big-to-fail bank get bigger.

 BODY:
6:27 p.m. | Updated with Capital One statement
The Federal Reserveannounced on Friday afternoon that it planned to hold hearings on Capital One Financial's proposed $9 billion takeover of the ING Group's online banking operations in America.
The move follows concerns that the deal would create a new too-big-to-fail giant. By buying ING Direct USA, Capital One would become the nation's fifth-biggest lender, with more than $200 billion in deposits.
Earlier this month, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked the Fed to hold public hearings to gauge the deal's potential effects on consumers and the public.
"Care should be taken to thoroughly examine the impact of this purchase with respect to the consolidation of banking assets, the provision of credit by the resulting bank and compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act," Mr. Frank wrote in a letter to the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
The Fed said that it planned to hold hearings in Washington, Chicago and San Francisco beginning Sept. 20. It will also extend the time that it will accept public comments on the deal until Oct. 12.
Several consumer groups, including the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, have already opposed the deal. Their argument is that Capital One -- already considered a systemically important financial institution because it oversees more than $50 billion in deposits -- would become an even bigger risk to taxpayers if it needed a bailout.
Capital One has argued that unlike such institutions as Goldman Sachs, it does not engage in risky trading. Its core business is credit card lending, an operation that would benefit greatly from the deposits it would gain from ING Direct.
The bank also contends that the ING deal would make it more stable, by reducing its reliance on short-term borrowing that could seize up in a financial crisis.
"We will remain a traditional bank with only 1.5 percent of deposits nationwide and none of the complexity that the Dodd-Frank reform bill addressed in ending 'too big to fail,'" Capital One said in a statement late on Friday. 
The firm added, "In each of our prior bank acquisitions, we have substantially increased our investments that serve lower-income communities, providing $2.2 billion over and above those predecessor banks in their footprints."
Capital One has said that it expects the deal to close by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: BMW Awards Major U.S. Ad Work to One of Its Agencies

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: After a closely-watched review, BMW of North America has awarded a plum assignment to an agency that already works for the company.

 BODY:
BMW of North America completed a closely-watched review of its creative advertising work by awarding a plum assignment to an agency that already works for the company.
BMW of North America said on Friday afternoon that it had selected Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners, as its lead agency in the United States for national brand creative work as well as creative work for ads from regional and local BMW dealers.
The combined spending for the national, regional and local ads is estimated at $160 million. Until now, BMW had one lead agency for national ads and another lead agency for dealer ads.
Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal has already been working for BMW of North America, handling national creative projects since October. And an agency that is a sibling to Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal, Dotglu, is the longtime agency for BMW's digital marketing and customer relationship management in the United States.

Dan Creed, who recently became vice president for marketing at BMW of North America, praised Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal in a statement.
The agency in its final presentation "demonstrated a strong platform of impressive brand insight as well as memorable creative executions," Mr. Creed said.
Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal is being signed to a contract that will run for three years.
The main creative agency for national ads for BMW had been GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, which said last fall that it would not renew its contract when the contract expired at the end of 2010.
The agency for regional and local dealer advertising has been Grey West in San Francisco, part of the Grey unit of the Grey Group, a WPP agency.
At one point, seven agencies were part of the BMW review. That number was narrowed in June to five finalists. Two of them were Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal and Grey West, which was seeking to handle only the dealer advertising if it was going to remain separate from the national advertising.
The other three finalists were Cundari, an agency in Toronto, and two agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, Gotham in New York and the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va.
BMW of North America is continuing a review for another assignment, to create ads aimed at African-American and Hispanic consumers. The company said on Friday afternoon that the agency selection for its multicultural and diversity marketing "will be announced at a later date."
Ads aimed at African-American consumers are currently created by Matlock Advertising and Public Relations. Ads aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers are currently created by Bromley Communications.
The creative reviews have no bearing on the media planning and buying account for BMW of North America, which already combines national and regional duties. The media account remains at Universal McCann, part of the Mediabrands division of Interpublic.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
Rare is the tax cut that Republicans on Capitol Hill oppose but Democrats appear to have found just that. Jennifer Steinhauer writes that G.O.P. lawmakers have balked at President Obama's request to extend for a year a payroll tax cut for workers. While the resistance has frustrated Democrats, it has also given them a wedge issue to exploit in the 2012 election campaign.

        
As trade deals with Columbia, Panama and South Korea languish, President Obama and Congressional Republicans are trading jabs over who's to blame for delaying the bills. Ms. Steinhauer explains that the fact that the two camps can't agree on the status of the bills "reflects just how toxic and divisive their relationship is."

        
On the campaign trail Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts display markedly different styles as the two compete in early nominating states for the Republican presidential nomination. Ashley Parker compares and contrasts Mr. Romney's formal cool with Mr. Perry's casual Friday style.

        
Mr. Perry casts himself as a tax slayer on the campaign trail. But as Jay Root reports, as far back in his political career as the 1990s and as recent a a few weeks ago, Mr. Perry has signed on to millions of dollars in tax increases, showing a willingness to compromise on a now-divisive issue.

        
The memoir of a former agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who spent years near the center of war on terror is at the center of what is essentially a fight over who will get to write the history of the Sept. 11 attacks and their aftermath. Scott Shane delves into the agent's fight with the Central Intelligence Agency, which is demanding that certain parts of the book be cut despite the fact that some of the information is already public and widely available.

        
The way Dr. Regina Benjamin, the surgeon general, sees it, hair is a major obstacle to exercise for women. Anahad O'Connor observes her efforts to encourage women who spend lots of time and money maintaining their manes to work up a potentially ruinous sweat.
Edward Rothstein profiles the long-awaited memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the National Mall, discussing the often-tumultuous history of the project and how it finally came together.
Around the Web:

        
The Republican candidates have been keen to hear what entrepreneurs have to say on the campaign trail, the Washington Post notes.

        
The Wall Street Journal lays out how Mr. Perry's nascent candidacy has changed the dynamics of the Republican race for the White House.

        
The Journal also observes a critical dilemma facing Republican governors, who must decide by September whether to apply for federal grants to run health insurance exchanges created by President Obama's health care law.
Happening in Washington:

        
At 8 a.m., the Commerce Department will report second-quarter economic growth, known as gross domestic product, for April to June of this year.

        
The dedication of a memorial to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. scheduled for Sunday has been canceled indefinitely because of the approach of Hurricane Irene, according to The Associated Press and other reports.

HEADLINE: The Unrecovery, Acknowledged

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We're on the road to nowhere, officially.

 BODY:
One positive thing in Bernanke's speech -- I'm trying to look on the bright side -- is that for what seems to me the first time he has more or less acknowledged that we are not, in any real sense, experiencing a recovery:
Notwithstanding these more positive developments, however, it is clear that the recovery from the crisis has been much less robust than we had hoped. From the latest comprehensive revisions to the national accounts as well as the most recent estimates of growth in the first half of this year, we have learned that the recession was even deeper and the recovery even weaker than we had thought; indeed, aggregate output in the United States still has not returned to the level that it attained before the crisis. Importantly, economic growth has for the most part been at rates insufficient to achieve sustained reductions in unemployment, which has recently been fluctuating a bit above 9 percent. 
Indeed. I usually illustrate the unrecovery using the employment-population ratio, but here's an alternative, the ratio of real GDP to the CBO estimate of potential (which is the level consistent with stable inflation, not the absolute maximum the economy can produce):
Does that look like a solid if slow recovery? Of course not.
Ideally, the realization that the economy is not healing would spur the Fed to take the kind of action Bernanke recommended a decade ago when Japan was similarly in a long-term trap.
Not yet, however.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Bernanke, the Budget and Steve Jobs

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
 Ben Bernanke's speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo., was sketchier than it might have been about monetary policy but strikingly detailed about fiscal policy.
As chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke's official purview is in the monetary, not the fiscal realm, of course. But in a conversation in the new Weekend Business podcast, Catherine Rampell says he seemed to be deliberately vague about the central bank's own plans. 
 While he said the Fed's full toolkit is available as needed, he didn't spell out what the bank's actions might entail. On the other hand, he said that short-term fiscal stimulus, combined with longer-term debt reduction, would do much to invigorate the economy. 
In another podcast conversation and in the Economic View column in Sunday Business, Richard Thaler, the University of Chicago economist, says Congress has been much better at spending than at budget-cutting, which is part of what he calls a self-restraint problem.

Like people with a New Year's Day hangover, many members of Congress find it easy to make promises if they needn't fulfill them for months or years to come. In his view, imposing legal constraints on spending, through a balanced budget amendment or other means, is unlikely to compel effective action. Voters need to be willing to elect mature adults, who, in turn, need to exercise willpower to make better choices for the country, he says.
Steven P. Jobs, who is stepping down as chief executive of Apple, has had an enormous impact in many fields. In a podcast conversation and in the Unboxed column in Sunday Business, Steve Lohr discusses the qualities of Mr. Jobs as a role model. Above all else, he says, Mr. Jobs is an innovator, and his entire career may be seen as a relentless effort to improve the odds of bringing forth innovation, both for himself and in the organizations he has managed.
And the problem of illegal products passed off as health supplements is the focus of a conversation with Natasha Singer, who tackles the subject on the cover of Sunday Business. Federal authorities are struggling to stop the distribution of these black-market goods, which may endanger consumers' health. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Catherine Rampell on the Fed (33:53); news headlines (25:04); Steve Lohr on Steve Jobs (22:13); Richard Thaler on Congress (15:49); Natasha Singer on black-market supplements (8:59); the week ahead (2:06).

HEADLINE: Investing in Ports, With an Eye to America's Prosperity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Panama Adding a Wider Shortcut for Shipping'' (front page, Aug. 17): 
American ports are scrambling to secure resources needed to deepen facilities to accommodate the gigantic new ships that will become the norm once the newly expanded Panama Canal opens in 2014.
Our international competitors are ahead of the United States when it comes to such critical infrastructure investments. China has poured $3.3 trillion into its infrastructure and can now boast of having six of the world's top 10 ports while the United States has none. In Brazil, a new $2.7 billion intermodal superport -- the size of the island of Manhattan -- is being built in Acu to accommodate increased trade with China.
Earlier this month, Building America's Future released a report, ''Falling Apart and Falling Behind.'' If the United States continues to defer making smart investments in our future, we will continue to fall further behind our competitors.
We are not proposing another quick round of federal spending; we are advocating a long-term infrastructure policy based on sound economics, not politics.
Nearly 100 years ago, the United States had the foresight to invest in building the Panama Canal, which allowed America to become an economic superpower. Now is the time to show that foresight again by investing in our own future and prosperity by deepening our ports to take advantage of the 21st-century Panama Canal.
EDWARD G. RENDELL Philadelphia, Aug. 23, 2011
The writer, the former governor of Pennsylvania, is co-chairman of Building America's Future.

HEADLINE: Relief for Student Debtors

 BODY:
Since the start of the recession, record numbers of Americans have enrolled in college in search of new skills that would improve their employment prospects. Unfortunately, far too many students enrolled in expensive for-profit schools end up dogged by ruinous debts, with little in the way of skills or credentials to show for their efforts. 
The schools sometimes push these students into high-cost private loans that they can never hope to repay, even when they are eligible for affordable federal loans. Because the private loans have fewer consumer accommodations like hardship deferments, the borrowers often have little choice but to default.
Worse yet, these loans and the bad credit history follow the debtors for the rest of their lives. Even filing for bankruptcy doesn't clean the slate.
Legislation is pending in both houses of Congress that would make private school loans dischargeable through bankruptcy, as most of them were before Congress changed the law in 2005. It had long been the case that federally backed student loans were protected during bankruptcy proceedings. That is reasonable, since those loans were backed by taxpayer dollars and flexibly structured so that borrowers could receive deferment in tough times and resume payments when their finances improved.
The country has a compelling interest in making it as difficult as possible for student borrowers to elude payment for federal loans. There was no reason for extending that protection to private lenders of student loans.
For starters, that gives these lenders, who often turn a huge profit, an undeserved advantage over credit card issuers, gambling casinos and other issuers of unsecured credit whose debts are still subject to discharge in bankruptcy. The change also encouraged reckless underwriting by lenders, who no longer felt compelled to determine the borrower's ability to pay. And it led to financial catastrophe for students who were duped into signing up for pricey private loans.
Bills sponsored by Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, would eliminate the unfair protections for private student lenders and give struggling borrowers a chance at a fresh start.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Grew Slower in Spring Than Previously Reported

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 1 percent this spring, slower than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said Friday. The downward revision is stoking fears that the economy is at risk of another recession.
Fewer exports and weaker growth in business stockpiles led the government to lower its growth estimate for the April-June quarter from the initial 1.3 percent rate. 
The economy expanded only 0.7 percent in the first six months of the year, the agency said.
Nine of the last 11 recessions since World War II have been preceded by a period of growth of 1 percent or less, economists note.
''The economy is teetering on the edge of a renewed recession,'' said James Marple, an economist at TD Securities. ''Any renewed shock could push the economy over the edge.''
Economists said the revision had not changed their growth forecasts. Most expect slightly better growth -- roughly 1.5 to 2 percent -- in the second half of the year.
That level of growth would likely cool recession jitters. But it is not enough to make a noticeable dent in the unemployment rate, which was 9.1 percent in July.
Some economists worry that this summer's sell-off on Wall Street could hamper growth further if consumers and businesses pull back on spending and investment. The stock market has lost 12 percent of its value since July 21.
There were some good signs in the report. Corporate profits rose faster than in the previous quarter. The decline in business stockpiles suggests factories may step up production to fill future orders.
The revision also showed consumers and businesses spent a bit more in the spring than in the government's first estimate. Consumers spent more on health care, insurance and financial services. Businesses bought more equipment and software and invested in more buildings.
Consumer spending was revised up to a 0.4 percent gain, slightly better than the first estimate of 0.1 percent. Still, that is the weakest growth since the final three months of 2009.
People bought fewer long-lasting manufactured goods, such as autos and appliances. Those purchases fell 5.1 percent this spring, the biggest drop since the fall of 2008. That partly reflects a shortage of autos on many dealer lots after the March 11 earthquake in Japan. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of growth.
Government spending contracted for the third straight quarter. And spending by state and local governments declined for the seventh time in eight quarters.
Corporate profits remained healthy, as they have throughout the recovery. They rose 3 percent, up from a 1 percent gain in the first quarter.
Several dismal economic reports have suggested the economy worsened in the July-September quarter, sending the stock market lower. Manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region contracted in August by the most in more than two years, a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found. A Richmond Fed survey released Tuesday and a New York Fed survey last week also pointed to slowdowns in those areas, although not as severe.
Still, other reports offer a more optimistic picture. The economy added 117,000 net jobs in July, twice the number added in each of the previous two months. Consumers spent more on retail goods last month than in any month since March. Automakers rebounded last month to increase factory production by the most since the Japan crisis.
Thursday's report is the second of three estimates the government issues for each quarter's economic growth. The estimates are updated with more recent data that was not available for the first report.

HEADLINE: State Judges Get 27% Raise Over 3 Years

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
A state commission decided on Friday to increase the pay of the more than 1,200 New York State judges by 27 percent over three years, ending a decade of battles in Albany and the courts, and giving judges their first raise in 12 years.
The seven-member commission, appointed by the leaders of all three branches of government, had been expected to grant a raise. Still, the amount it settled on was considered very modest -- and some judges even expressed bitter disappointment. 
The commission voted 4 to 3 to approve the increase, with its members sharply divided in a brief meeting in Lower Manhattan that included accusations of political grandstanding. The dissenters said the raises were too small.
Over years of legislative and legal struggles on the judicial-pay issue, New York's judges, once among the best paid nationally, slipped to being among the lowest paid.
The increase was small compared with some proposed ones that had called for judicial raises across the court system of as much as 60 percent.
The commission was created under a bill passed last year to try to resolve one of the most contentious and long-stalled issues in state government. ''This is a start at correcting the injustice that has been done to New York State's judiciary over more than a decade of neglect,'' said the commission's chairman, William C. Thompson Jr., the former New York City comptroller.
But Mr. Thompson and other members of the commission also said that the fragile state economy required restraint. Under the commission's decision, the highest level of trial judges in the state, the justices of the State Supreme Court, would receive an increase to $174,000 from the current $136,700, phased in over three years. That would match the salary of United States District Court judges. The raises for all the judges would cost the state about $50 million a year when they are fully implemented.
The creation of the commission was an effort to minimize political fallout from what was likely to be an unpopular decision in a time of budget cutbacks.
The three commission members appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo were joined in voting for the proposal by the appointee of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who, like the governor, is a Democrat. The two appointees of the state's chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, opposed it as inadequate, as did the appointee of the leader of the State Senate, Dean G. Skelos, a Republican. The Cuomo administration had expressed concern about a large judicial pay raise, so it was not unexpected that the governor's appointees would limit the increase.
The raises will go into effect next spring unless they are overruled or modified by legislation passed by both houses of the Legislature and signed by the governor. Mr. Thompson said he hoped the size of the increase would dissuade the Legislature and the governor from seeking to overturn the decision, which he said would be ''disastrous'' for the judiciary.
The commission's decision would govern judicial pay for four years, after which time another commission would revisit the issue. The pay increase would apply to judges from low-level courts like New York City Civil Court and Criminal Court to the members of the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
The salary of Supreme Court justices had been viewed as a benchmark, with the commission agreeing to keep in place the relative differences in pay across a complex state court system with many pay levels.
The salary of judges in Criminal Court who earn $125,600, for example, would increase proportionally over the next three years, to $160,100. The salary of the chief judge of the state would go from $156,000 to $198,600.
Judges have argued that the pay stagnation forced some judges to leave the bench. On Friday, some judges said the decision would amplify dissatisfaction in the judiciary. ''I think it's very demoralizing,'' said Judge Margaret Parisi McGowan of Queens Family Court.
Phillip R. Rumsey, president of the state association of Supreme Court justices, said the salary levels in New York ''will continue to reflect the low regard that other branches of state government apparently have for the judiciary.''
Judge Lippman said that he was disappointed that the raise was not larger and that it would be phased in over three years.
Judge Lippman was deeply involved in the plan to create the commission and said at the time that it was the ''holy grail'' to remove negotiations over judicial salaries from the political process. Asked Friday if the decision was a setback, Judge Lippman said the commission had been successful because it ended with a pay increase at a time of economic crisis.
''We live in the real world,'' he said. ''We see what's happening in Washington and in our own state. We see what's happening in the stock market.''
The commission had always appeared divided 3 to 3 over how generous an increase would be, with Mr. Silver's appointee, James Tallon Jr., a former Democratic member of the Assembly, holding the decisive seventh vote. The increase that was approved, Mr. Tallon said Friday, ''balances all of the factors that are out there, including an economy that has tanked.''
But in a switch of usual roles, in which Republicans criticize Democrats for spending, Mark S. Mulholland, Mr. Skelos's appointee, criticized Mr. Tallon.
Mr. Mulholland said the Republican-controlled Senate stood with the judges in seeking higher pay. He said that by bringing the salaries of State Supreme Court justices to $174,000 instead of $190,000 or higher, the state would be continuing what he called its neglect of the judiciary. He said he was ''disappointed'' that Mr. Tallon had ''not seen fit to close ranks with me.'' One of Mr. Cuomo's appointees, Richard B. Cotton, criticized Mr. Mulholland, a Long Island lawyer, saying it was ''highly unfortunate to inject scoring political points into this discussion.''
Asked about the comments, Mr. Silver said he had not spoken to Mr. Tallon about his vote, adding that ''an independent commission was created to take the decision away from the Legislature and away from political finger-pointing.''

8 P.M. (HBO) CONVICTION (2010) In yet another hardscrabble role, Hilary Swank, right, plays Betty Anne Waters, the product of a negligent mother and foster care, who pushes through college and law school while working at a bar and rearing two sons in an effort to defend -- finally --her beloved and mercurial brother, Kenny (Sam Rockwell), for a murder conviction she believes to be unjust. ''For a while 'Conviction,' based on the true story of a New England woman's long struggle to win freedom for her imprisoned brother, feels as if it just might escape the stifling conventions of the crusader-for-justice melodrama,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film from Tony Goldwyn. But soon enough the movie ''goes into lockdown, as the talents of a number of superb actors are stifled by an airless, by-the-numbers story,'' he writes, adding: ''The intriguing question of Kenny's character -- not his guilt or innocence, but the quicksilver temperament that makes both seem plausible -- fades as the story of Betty Anne's hard work and sacrifice gains momentum. And Ms. Swank's performance shrinks in scope as her character's monomaniacal devotion to freeing Kenny takes over the movie.'' Ultimately, '' 'Conviction' tells a great story,'' Mr. Scott added. ''If only it could have been a great movie.''

HEADLINE: Examining a Labor Hero's Death

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
At Woodstock, Joan Baez sang a famous folk ballad celebrating Joe Hill, the itinerant miner, songwriter and union activist who was executed by a Utah firing squad in 1915. ''I never died, said he'' is the song's refrain.
Hill's status as a labor icon and the debate about his conviction certainly never died. And now a new biography makes the strongest case yet that Hill was wrongfully convicted of murdering a local grocer, the charge that led to his execution at age 36.
The book's author, William M. Adler, argues that Hill was a victim of authorities and a jury eager to deal a blow to his radical labor union, as well as his own desire to protect the identity of his sweetheart.
A Salt Lake City jury convicted Hill largely because of one piece of circumstantial evidence: he had suffered a gunshot wound to the chest on the same night -- Jan. 10, 1914 -- that the grocer and his son were killed. At the trial, prosecutors argued that he had been shot by the grocer's son, and Hill refused to offer any alternative explanation. 
Mr. Adler uncovered a long-forgotten letter from Hill's sweetheart that said that he had been shot by a rival for her affections, undermining the prosecution's key assertion. The book, ''The Man Who Never Died,'' also offers extensive evidence suggesting that an early suspect in the case, a violent career criminal, was the murderer.
Hill, who bounced around the West as a miner, longshoreman and union organizer, was the leading songwriter for the Industrial Workers of the World, also known as the Wobblies, a prominent union that was widely feared and deplored for its militant tactics. He penned dozens of songs that excoriated bosses and capitalism and wrote the well-known lyric ''You'll get pie in the sky when you die.''
His conviction was so controversial that President Woodrow Wilson twice wrote to Utah's governor to urge him to spare Hill's life, and unions as far away as Australia protested on his behalf.
After his death, Hill was immortalized in poetry and song, including the 1936 ballad embraced by Ms. Baez, Pete Seeger, Paul Robeson and others: ''I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night.''
In the letter found by Mr. Adler, Hill's sweetheart, Hilda Erickson, wrote that Hill had told her he had been shot by her former fiance, Otto Appelquist -- someone she had broken off with a week earlier and who had asked her ''if I liked Joe better than him.'' In her letter, she added, ''I heard Joe tease Otto once that he was going to take me away from him.''
Historians say the letter is groundbreaking because it is apparently the first time anyone has stepped forward to explain exactly how and why Hill was shot. Neither Hill nor Ms. Erickson testified at his trial, although Hill did tell the doctor who treated his wound that a rival suitor had shot him.
The prosecution maintained that Hill had been shot by the grocer's son, even though the police never found any bullet cartridges or traces of blood, other than the victims', at the murder scene. Prosecutors used Hill's silence to persuade jurors that he must have murdered the grocer.
Ms. Erickson wrote the letter in 1949 to Aubrey Haan, a professor who was researching a book on Hill. The book was never published, and Mr. Adler found the letter in papers stored in the professor's daughter's attic.
''When I first read the letter, it was a 'holy cow' moment because all these years people wondered about what happened that night,'' Mr. Adler said in an interview.
In his book, which Bloomsbury will publish on Tuesday, Mr. Adler also lays out what historians say is highly incriminating new information about the person police originally suspected of the two murders, Frank Z. Wilson.
The police arrested Mr. Wilson the night of the murders after they found him walking without an overcoat near the grocery. They also found a bloody handkerchief on him.
Mr. Adler said Mr. Wilson had lied repeatedly to the authorities after they arrested him, but they soon released him for reasons that remain unclear. Mr. Adler also discovered that Mr. Wilson had used at least 16 aliases during his many arrests and convictions, several for robbing trains. He was later involved in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago in 1929, with a getaway car registered under an alias he often used.
''His research is just incredible -- it expands what we know in really dramatic ways,'' said John R. Sillito, co-author of a new book on radicalism in Utah and a retired archivist at Weber State University in Ogden. ''It builds a strong case that Wilson should have been the prime suspect.''
Hill declined to testify at his trial, standing on the principle that he should not have to prove his innocence, especially when he believed that the prosecution could not possibly prove he was guilty with the limited evidence it had.
Mr. Adler's book suggests that Hill also did not testify partly because he wanted to safeguard Ms. Erickson's privacy. She was in her early 20s at the time, the niece of the two Swedish brothers he was boarding with.
Rolf Hagglund, a grandnephew of Hill's who lives in Stockholm, has read galleys of the new book and welcomed its findings.
''From the start, people knew he was set up,'' Mr. Hagglund said in a telephone interview. ''This book presents the strongest case so far that there was an alternative shooter and how Joe was shot and why he was shot.'' (Hill immigrated to the United States from Sweden in 1902, changing his name from the original, Joel Hagglund.)
But John Arling Morrison, a grandson of the murdered grocer, put little stock in Mr. Adler's findings. ''Joe Hill was the one who murdered our grandfather and destroyed the economy of our family,'' said Mr. Morrison.
Mr. Adler, a Denver resident, decided to write about Hill after reading Bob Dylan's ''Chronicles,'' which argued that the Hill case was a miscarriage of justice.
''Initially I saw the book as a murder mystery, and I saw myself in the role of gumshoe,'' Mr. Adler said. ''I also wanted to explore how Hill went from being an anonymous worker to finding his voice as a songwriter to becoming a working-class hero to becoming, ultimately, a martyr.''
Like many historians, Gibbs M. Smith, author of a Hill biography, said the trial was unfair. ''Under today's laws of evidence, he never would have been convicted and executed,'' Mr. Smith said. Historians have observed that the judge unjustifiably ruled against Hill on evidentiary questions and that the prosecution coached witnesses to say they saw Hill near the grocery that night.
Some students of the case say one reason for Hill's silence may have been a belief that he could do more for labor's cause as a martyr than alive. At the time, the I.W.W. had fewer than 20,000 members, but it was detested by business leaders because it pushed miners, lumberjacks and railway workers to use strikes, slowdowns and sabotage to pressure employers to improve pay and conditions.
Shortly before his execution, Hill wrote supporters an emotional note, saying, ''Don't waste time mourning, organize,'' which later became the union catchphrase, ''Don't Mourn, Organize.''

HEADLINE: A Poll Tax by Another Name

BYLINE: By JOHN LEWIS. 
John Lewis, a Democrat, is a congressman from Georgia.

 BODY:
Washington
AS we celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, we reflect on the life and legacy of this great man. But recent legislation on voting reminds us that there is still work to do. Since January, a majority of state legislatures have passed or considered election-law changes that, taken together, constitute the most concerted effort to restrict the right to vote since before the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Growing up as the son of an Alabama sharecropper, I experienced Jim Crow firsthand. It was enforced by the slander of ''separate but equal,'' willful blindness to acts of racially motivated violence and the threat of economic retaliation. The pernicious effect of those strategies was to institutionalize second-class citizenship and restrict political participation to the majority alone. 
We have come a long way since the 1960s. When the Voting Rights Act was passed, there were only 300 elected African-American officials in the United States; today there are more than 9,000, including 43 members of Congress. The 1993 National Voter Registration Act -- also known as the Motor Voter Act -- made it easier to register to vote, while the 2002 Help America Vote Act responded to the irregularities of the 2000 presidential race with improved election standards.
Despite decades of progress, this year's Republican-backed wave of voting restrictions has demonstrated that the fundamental right to vote is still subject to partisan manipulation. The most common new requirement, that citizens obtain and display unexpired government-issued photo identification before entering the voting booth, was advanced in 35 states and passed by Republican legislatures in Alabama, Minnesota, Missouri and nine other states -- despite the fact that as many as 25 percent of African-Americans lack acceptable identification.
Having fought for voting rights as a student, I am especially troubled that these laws disproportionately affect young voters. Students at state universities in Wisconsin cannot vote using their current IDs (because the new law requires the cards to have signatures, which those do not). South Carolina prohibits the use of student IDs altogether. Texas also rejects student IDs, but allows voting by those who have a license to carry a concealed handgun. These schemes are clearly crafted to affect not just how we vote, but who votes.
Conservative proponents have argued for photo ID mandates by claiming that widespread voter impersonation exists in America, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. While defending its photo ID law before the Supreme Court, Indiana was unable to cite a single instance of actual voter impersonation at any point in its history. Likewise, in Kansas, there were far more reports of U.F.O. sightings than allegations of voter fraud in the past decade. These theories of systematic fraud are really unfounded fears being exploited to threaten the franchise.
In Georgia, Florida, Ohio and other states, legislatures have significantly reduced opportunities to cast ballots before Election Day -- an option that was disproportionately used by African-American voters in 2008. In this case the justification is often fiscal: Republicans in North Carolina attempted to eliminate early voting, claiming it would save money. Fortunately, the effort failed after the State Election Board demonstrated that cuts to early voting would actually be more expensive because new election precincts and additional voting machines would be required to handle the surge of voters on Election Day.
Voters in other states weren't so lucky. Florida has cut its early voting period by half, from 96 mandated hours over 14 days to a minimum of 48 hours over just eight days, and has severely restricted voter registration drives, prompting the venerable League of Women Voters to cease registering voters in the state altogether. Again, this affects very specific types of voters: according to the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, African-Americans and Latinos were more than twice as likely as white voters to register through a voter registration drive.
These restrictions purportedly apply to all citizens equally. In reality, we know that they will disproportionately burden African Americans and other racial minorities, yet again. They are poll taxes by another name.
The King Memorial reminds us that out of a mountain of stone we may hew a stone of hope. Forty-eight years after the March on Washington, we must continue our work with hope that all citizens will have an unfettered right to vote. Second-class citizenship is not citizenship at all.
We've come some distance and have made great progress, but Dr. King's dream has not been realized in full. New restraints on the right to vote do not merely slow us down. They turn us backward, setting us in the wrong direction on a course where we have already traveled too far and sacrificed too much.

HEADLINE: Failing Forward

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Sometimes I push back on my heels, look at this country and wonder aloud: ''What on earth are we doing?''
We have a growing crisis among the nation's children, yet our policies ignore that reality at best and exacerbate it at worst.
According to a report issued this week by the Guttmacher Institute, the unintended pregnancy rate has jumped 50 percent since 1994, yet a July report from the institute points out that politicians are setting records passing laws to restrict abortion. It said: ''The 80 abortion restrictions enacted this year are more than double the previous record of 34 abortion restrictions enacted in 2005 -- and more than triple the 23 enacted in 2010.'' Add to this the assault by conservatives on Planned Parenthood, and what are we saying? 
This is what we're saying: actions have consequences. If you didn't want a child, you shouldn't have had sex. You must be punished by becoming a parent even if you know that you are not willing or able to be one.
This is insane.
Even if you follow a primitive religious concept of punishment for sex, as many on the right seem to do, you must at some point acknowledge that it is the child, not the parent, who will be punished most by our current policies that increasingly advocate for ''unborn children'' but fall silent for those outside the womb.
This is not how a rational society operates.
Aside from the raft of negative outcomes associated with unintended pregnancies, there are a host of other indicators that suggest a perilous world for the nation's children.
A report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation last week found that ''the official child poverty rate, which is a conservative measure of economic hardship, increased 18 percent between 2000 and 2009.''
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the number of children facing food insecurity in 2009 soared to nearly one in four. And ABC News pointed out this week that a breathtaking 49 percent of all children born in this country are born to families who receive food supplements from the federal Women, Infants and Children assistance program.
As the World Bank points out, ''undernutrition'' in young children has been linked to delayed growth and motor development, lower I.Q.'s, behavioral problems and decreased attention, deficient learning and lower educational achievement.
Yet we wonder why our children's educational outcomes are so low when compared with other wealthy nations. We even have the nerve to begrudge teachers for not being able to squeeze success out of children primed for failure.
It should come as no surprise that a C.D.C. report this month found a continued rise in the percentage of children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or that the country has continued its course of mass incarceration. The prison population in the United States has nearly quadrupled over the last 25 years. In fact, we have the highest incarceration rate of any Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development country. This isn't only a moral outrage; it's also budgetary lunacy. As a report released last month by the Children's Defense Fund pointed out, ''the U.S. spends almost two-and-a-half times as much per prisoner as per public school pupil.''
We simply can't keep turning to pills and prisons to solve issues of poverty and poor parenting. This is unhealthy, unsustainable and unwise.
We have to do a better, more focused job of teaching sex education and providing contraceptive options (kudos here to the administration for moving this month to require insurance companies to provide birth control services to women at no extra cost). We have to remove the stigma and judgment around sex. Sex isn't bad or unnatural. It's one of the most natural things that we do. It just needs to be safe and responsible.
We also have to preserve women's birth options should they become pregnant, including the option not to give birth. And, finally, for all the children who are born, we must make a valiant effort to give each and every one of them a fighting chance, which includes food and medicine when their parents can't provide it. We must do this not as a boon or crutch to the parent, but as a selfish investment in the future of this great society.
They need our help now more than ever because the current economic stress may take some time to overcome.
As an updated Budget and Economic Outlook report issued by the Congressional Budget Office this week points out, the unemployment rate is expected to stay above 8 percent until the middle of the decade.
Now is when we need government to step up and be smart.
This is exactly the wrong time to do what the Republicans would have us do. In their 2012 budget, they propose cutting nutrition programs as part of austerity measures so that we don't leave our children saddled with debt. Meanwhile, they completely ignore the fact that those cuts could leave even more children saddled with physical or developmental problems.
They want to hold the line on tax breaks for the wealthy, not paying attention to the fact that our growing income inequality, which could be reversed, continues to foster developmental inequality, which is almost impossible to reverse.
We have to start this conversation from a different point. We must ask: ''What kind of society do we want to build, and what kinds of workers, soldiers and citizens should populate that society?'' If we want that society to be prosperous and safe and filled with healthy, well-educated and well-adjusted people, then the policy directions become clear.
They are almost the exact opposite of what we are doing.

HEADLINE: The Plastic Sandwich Bag Flunks

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Many retailers and schools are advocating waste-free options for back-to-school shoppers this year, especially when it comes to lunch. School lists call for Tupperware instead of Ziplocs, neoprene lunch bags instead of brown paper ones, and aluminum water bottles, not the throwaway plastic versions.
Sales of environmentally friendly back-to-school products are up just about everywhere. At the Container Store, the increase is 30 percent over last year for some items, said Mona Williams, the company's vice president of buying. ''We have seen a huge resurgence,'' she said. 
The trend makes the schools happy (much less garbage). It makes the stores happy (higher back-to-school spending). It even makes the students happy (green feels good).
Who's not happy? The parents (what to do when the Tupperware runs out?).
''Ziplocs are the biggest misstep,'' said Julie Corbett, a mother in Oakland, Calif., whose two girls attend a school with an eco-friendly lunch policy. In school years past, she said, many a morning came unhinged when the girls were sent to school with disposable sandwich bags.
''That's when the kids have meltdowns, because they don't want to be shamed at school,'' Ms. Corbett said. ''It's a big deal.''
Schools have been adopting environmentally friendly policies for ecological and budget reasons, and retailers have been rushing to fill the newfound demand with store-front promotions and aggressive marketing. Staples has rows of eco-friendly lunch containers, like an Extreme flap lunchbox case with a compartment for plastic food boxes, and a Yak Pak lunch tote that looks like a purse.
Many of the schools are pushing waste-free lunches, where everything must be either compostable or reusable, in an effort to reduce garbage and the cost of hauling it away. Others are requiring that students bring reusable gear because even though the upfront cost is higher, it tends to be cheaper over the course of the year.
''We try to be sensitive to keeping costs down for families,'' said Emily Hyde, assistant headmaster of Archway Classical Academy at Veritas, a new charter school in Phoenix that requires a reusable water bottle and lunch box for each student. ''It seemed like the economical choice.''
Either way, parents can be a hard sell. ''Any parent who's trying to get their kid ready and out the door in the morning knows that it's tough'' when there are more items to deal with, said Ms. Williams, the executive at the Container Store.
Brian Greene, the principal of Prairie Crossing Charter School in Grayslake, Ill., has resorted to buying reusable lunchboxes in bulk and selling them at cost to school families to get more of them on board. At the school's new-parent meeting held last week, parents of returning students did a show and tell for the newcomers. One mother brought a Tupperware container that she had used for years; another brought a Rubbermaid container.
In the past, students performed skits about recycling but the parent-to-parent evangelism seemed more effective, Mr. Greene said.
''The kids are all about it,'' Mr. Greene said, but with the parents, ''you have to build habits.''
He added, ''We don't send notes home to parents and say, 'Listen, this is the third time you've brought a Cheeto bag.' But we help them to understand'' why the school has the lunch policy.
Judith Wagner, a professor of education at Whittier College in California who directs its laboratory school for elementary and middle-school children, has also been struggling with how to get parents' support for less wasteful lunches.
''Parents will say things like, 'Well, I want her to have a choice, and if I put in a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich and a ham sandwich, she has a choice,' '' Professor Wagner said. ''And each one comes in its own separate plastic bag.''
What comes next, she said, is a hard call. ''Do you go back to the parents and say, 'Gosh, can you rethink the plastic bags and all this food?' Or do you talk to the children, and you make the children feel guilty because they're throwing this all away?''
Despite the difficulties, the push for eco-friendly products in school lunches seems to be working, at least judging by sales data from retailers.
Sales of paper bags and sandwich bags, which once were school lunch must-haves, are declining. Between August 2010 and August 2011, unit sales of plastic sandwich bags sold declined by 3.17 percent, while paper bags fell by 13.19 percent, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the market research firm SymphonyIRI Group.
At the Container Store, popular items this year include Japanese bento-box-style lunch boxes, Bobble water bottles with built-in filters, reusable cotton sandwich bags called snackTaxis, and PeopleTowels, machine-washable napkins.
Ms. Corbett, the Oakland parent, said the social pressure her children felt regarding recyclable products was palpable.
Still, she says, plasticware can be a pain to clean, and is not cheap. When she thinks it is likely that her daughters will lose the containers -- if, for instance, they're going on a field trip -- she uses waxed-paper sleeves, like the kind bakeries use for cookies, to hold sandwiches instead.
''It's still a no-no because you're still having to throw that away, but it is biodegradable, it does compost, so you're not as guilty,'' she said.
Still, Ms. Corbett said the environmental message had reached her. After she saw how much waste she could reduce by changing her lunch packaging routine, she started an eco-friendly packaging company, Ecologic.
''It created this very big awareness in our family,'' Ms. Corbett said.

HEADLINE: As Trade Volumes Soar, Exchanges Cash In

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
The latest financial market convulsions have been tough for almost everyone, including traders caught on the wrong side of another big swing and pained everyday investors watching their dwindling holdings go down and up -- and down again.
But there is a silver lining to even this latest market horror show, at least for the exchanges where the financial instruments change hands.
Businesses like the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange skim cents off each stock or contract bought or sold over their trading floors or computers. With the daily volumes of financial market contracts sent surging through their systems by nervous traders and investors up by billions, the latest trading rush is directly polishing their bottom line.
The effect, however, may be fleeting. The rising volumes have generally not translated into higher stock prices for the exchanges, and they and some analysts are worried that the volatility and downbeat economic news may frighten away investors in the long term. 
''Volume is positive on a short-term basis but because it is based on negative macroeconomic factors, these volumes are not necessarily sustainable,'' said Joseph M. Mecane, executive vice president for cash trading at NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange.
The latest swings came Friday when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2 percent in the morning, but climbed back up in the afternoon to finish 1.5 percent higher, as investors digested remarks by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that left the door open to further support for the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average swung about 363 points during the day, closing up 1.2 percent, to 11,284.54.
Across United States stock markets -- including the big electronic exchanges like Nasdaq, BATS and Direct Edge -- trading volumes so far in the latest quarter are 17 percent ahead of the same period last year, according to figures from Credit Suisse. Volumes have been hitting levels almost double what they normally are at this usually quiet time of year, Mr. Mecane said.
Markets have been sent wild this summer amid a number of exceptional events, like the showdown over the debt ceiling in Washington, the downgrade by the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's of the United States' long-term debt on Aug. 5, the global fallout from Europe's debt crisis and a raft of data pointing to a stalling United States economy.
On a couple of days earlier in August, stock market volumes touched about 15 billion daily trades, although volumes are now back to about eight billion or nine billion daily.
The stock exchanges on average charge 3.5 cents for every 100 shares traded, according to Credit Suisse. That has declined in recent years with greater competition between the exchanges, so the pop in volumes is not delivering as much to them in increased profits as it would have just a few years ago. The exchanges have also diversified into other business like providing trading technology to banks. That means revenue from stock and derivatives trading accounts for a smaller proportion of overall income. In the case of Nasdaq, for example, it makes up a third of overall sales.
The exchanges, most of which are public companies, generally will not comment on the effect these increased volumes will have on profits.
But analysts like Howard Chen, a financial analyst at Credit Suisse who watches the exchanges, said that because volumes were already tracking 15 to 20 percent above what he had been expecting, earnings should be up a similar amount.
It's not just the stock market that is experiencing a lift.
Traders have been busily betting on interest rates, commodities, currencies and even volatility itself.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange where these and other products like United States Treasury futures are in large part traded has recorded a big pick-up in trading volumes recently.
Aug. 9, for example, was a record day for the Chicago exchange, when nearly 25.7 million contracts were traded, beating the last record, which was during the so-called flash crash on May 6 last year, when 25.3 million contracts were traded, the exchange said.
So far during the third quarter, volumes on the Chicago exchange are up 39 percent compared with the same period a year ago, Credit Suisse said.
Futures in gold, oil and the broad stock market index, the S.& P. E-Mini, are all up.
In an era when volatility has become the new norm, another instrument that has had a surge in volumes is the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The VIX, as it is known, measures the short-term implied volatility of options on the S.& P. 500. Financial instruments based on the VIX are traded both electronically and in the exchange's trading pits in Chicago -- where there is a special VIX pit, and 60 dedicated VIX traders.
It is also called the fear index, and as the S.& P. 500 has spiraled down and up, VIX futures and options have become a popular tool for all sorts of fearful investors to protect themselves against the swings -- and maybe even make a little money.
''Volatility in itself is becoming a more popular and investable asset class for institutions and also for retail investors,'' Mr. Chen said.
Volume in VIX options is up 79 percent and trading in futures on the index soared 290 percent through Aug. 19.
Futures trading this month is already a record, surpassing July, which was the next highest. The single busiest day on record was Friday, Aug. 5, when 1,194,468 options contracts were traded.
''When volumes are up we do well,'' said William J. Brodsky, chairman and chief executive of CBOE Holdings.
Mr. Brodsky said the VIX was created with professional investors in mind but is increasingly being embraced by retail investors to protect against volatility.
The VIX generally moves in a range of 15 to 50, although it reached 80 during the financial crisis in 2008. Investors worried that their stock holdings were vulnerable to a sell-off in the market, for example, might buy the VIX as protection because the VIX would most likely rise.
Mr. Brodsky said a couple of dozen VIX exchange-traded notes are now offered by banks like Barclays. They were linked to the VIX and aimed at providing easier access for ordinary investors.
The strange thing is the heightened market volatility has not been particularly good for the exchanges' own share prices.
Even as their volumes have rocketed, their own stock prices have languished. While CBOE's shares are up 7 percent this year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's stock price is down 22 percent. NYSE Euronext's share price is down 9 percent for the year, and stock in Nasdaq is down 4 percent.
''It's a little odd,'' Mr. Chen said.
One reason might be that even though volumes have been picking up in recent years, the rates the exchanges charge at least for stock trading have come under pressure.
Another reason, according to Mr. Chen, is the possibility -- however distant -- of a financial transaction tax raised by European policy makers, which would depress trading volumes.
But perhaps the biggest reason is that the markets really think this is the ''storm before the calm,'' he said -- that soon all this volatility will go away and trading will be becalmed, perhaps even more so than before. That won't be good news for the exchanges.
Other industry analysts agree. They fear that the big swings will hurt investors' confidence in the markets and keep them away in the future.
The same thing happened last year in the stock market. After the flash crash on May 6 -- another time when Europe's debt crisis was roiling world markets -- May and June were busy months, but then volumes slowed markedly, partly because ordinary investors were frightened away, he said.
Stock market volumes increased for six consecutive years between 2004 and 2009 but then fell 13 percent between 2009 and 2010.
This year, despite the latest bounce, volumes across the entire stock market are 7 percent lower compared with last year.

HEADLINE: There's One On Every Corner, But None Like This

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- The sun is not yet up but the baristas are, a blur of busy hands wiping down counters and smoothing black aprons. Chipper and precise, they work at Starbucks, but it is probably not like the one near where you live. Among the 17,000 Starbucks that caffeinate the planet, this one is special.
This one, in Seattle's lovely Madison Park neighborhood, is where Howard Schultz, the company's passionate chief executive, likes to pop in on his way to another day of brand building. 
This one serves beer and wine. Prosecco? Of course. French presses are for sale next to the gas fireplace and across from the bins of coffee beans. By all means, sift those beans through your fingers. The jazz is textured but digestible. Shel Silverstein is on the shelf in a section for kids. Mr. Schultz's recent book, ''Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul,'' is also on display. (Buy it and you receive a $5 gift certificate.) A painting stretched across a long wall says, ''We live in a beautiful world.''
A customer opens the door. It is still dark outside. Eyes turn discreetly.
Not him.
Things pick up.
Not him. Not him. Not him.
Were the baristas looking for their boss, who lives in a ton of house nearby? Were they anxious? Were they freaking out? Is it true that they undergo special scrutiny before they can work there? Do they sometimes wish they worked in one of those apathy-oozing independent coffee shops in an edgier part of town? Surely they have a tattoo or two beneath those buttoned black sleeves, right?
Good luck finding out.
''It's an honor to work here,'' said one, noting his necktie.
No further comment. Call media relations, they say. Call corporate.
Corporate calls first.
They say ''security concerns'' make them wary of discussing the fact that ''Howard is there a good bit.'' After all, he is a ''high-profile person.''
Mr. Schultz has certainly been a man in the news lately and coffee is not why. In recent weeks he has called for a moratorium on political donations until a long-term debt deal is reached in Congress. He has also prodded other business leaders to take more risks, to do more hiring, to be more assertive in getting the economy going.
No wonder he needs a doppio espresso macchiato each morning.
''He waits in line,'' said Patricia Smith, a regular at the store. ''He wears really good shirts, and usually jeans.''
''He's usually alone,'' said Wayne Smith, her husband. ''You can tell he's looking around.''
Perhaps he will notice the man reading ''Design as Art,'' by Bruno Munari. Hopefully he will not witness the kind of mix-up that caused the Smiths to wait extra long for their ''double tall soy half-caff lattes with no lids.''
''Really, this has happened once in five years,'' Mr. Smith said.
They received coupons for free drinks. ''The baristas here are so friendly,'' Ms. Smith said.
Corporate calls back, warmer this time. They say the employees at the Madison Park Starbucks are hired through normal channels. They note that the store, recently remodeled, is based on ''a palette'' that the company has experimented with in a couple of other locations, and that will be applied at 1,700 stores next year.
Only a handful of Starbucks stores will sell alcohol, said a spokesman for the company, Corey duBrowa. But their baristas had better perfect those doppio espresso macchiatos. Mr. Schultz visits up to 20 Starbucks stores a week in Seattle.
''And he always orders the same thing,'' Mr. duBrowa said.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bernanke's Warning: Washington needs to stop the political antics and focus on housing and jobs

 BODY:
It's what journalists call burying the lead. More than halfway through his speech on Friday to central bankers meeting in Jackson Hole, Ben Bernanke said the recession would not cause lasting damage to the economy ''if -- and I stress if -- our country takes the necessary steps to secure that outcome.''
President Obama? Senator? Congressman? The chairman is talking to you. He is saying that wrong priorities and policy missteps are the biggest threat facing the economy today. 
Mr. Bernanke said that the Federal Reserve would do ''all it can'' to promote the recovery and hinted that it would approve additional stimulus measures at its policy meeting in September, if the economy showed further signs of slowing. The signs are already grim.
On the day of the speech, the government reported that in the second quarter the economy grew at an anemic 1 percent annual rate. That is not nearly enough to lower unemployment or push the recovery forward. In the first quarter, growth was a mere 0.4 percent. Two consecutive quarters below 2 percent usually portend recession.
The problem is that the Fed's options, basically easing credit by various means, cannot by themselves turn things around. Lower interest rates can help homeowners with equity to refinance, or small businesses with strong sales to borrow cheaply. But they do nothing for underwater homeowners or businesses where sales are poor because of paltry consumer demand.
The real value in Mr. Bernanke's speech is that he explained what really ails the economy -- and made the case for a better fiscal response to address those ills. ''Good, proactive housing policies'' would speed recovery, he said, as would ''putting people back to work.''
If Mr. Bernanke advocated specific policies to achieve those aims, he would be violating the etiquette that requires Fed chairmen to leave fiscal details to Congress.
So allow us. The best, proactive way to revive the housing market is to help bankrupt and delinquent borrowers rework their mortgages through principal reductions. It is also important to ease refinancing rules so underwater borrowers who are current in their payments can trade in their high-rate mortgages for lower-rate loans. The Obama administration is considering new refinancing rules, but mortgage investors are sure to resist.
One of the best ways to put people back to work is to fully reauthorize the highway trust fund, a big job creator and vital source of money for improving the nation's infrastructure. Job creation also requires that federal funds are made available to repair and renovate schools, and to rehire teachers, police officers and firefighters who have lost their jobs in budget cutbacks.
Again, President Obama is expected to include such ideas in his jobs program to be unveiled next month. He will have to -- finally -- be ready to fight the Republicans' relentless demands for even deeper spending cuts.
Mr. Bernanke stressed that the best path was to nail down a credible plan for reducing deficits over the longer term, while promoting stronger economic performance through tax and spending measures. It would help, he said, if Congress and the administration could manage all that like professionals.
''The negotiations that took place over the summer,'' he said, referring to the debt ceiling debacle, ''disrupted financial markets and probably the economy as well.'' Mr. Bernanke is right. The weak economy cannot tolerate any more political antics, policy mistakes or inaction.

HEADLINE: Tiffany's Beats Expectations And Offers Positive Outlook

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Tiffany & Company's net income rose 30 percent in the second quarter, propelled by strong growth across all regions as high-income shoppers continued to be drawn to its jewelry and other goods. 
The results handily beat Wall Street's expectations, and the company raised its full-year profit forecast again as a result. Tiffany said it earned $90 million, or 69 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $67.7 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding 16 cents a share in costs tied to relocating its New York headquarters employees, adjusted profit totaled 86 cents a share, topping the 70 cents that analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast.
Revenue in the period, which ended July 31, rose 30 percent to $872.7 million, which was well above the $785.6 million that Wall Street predicted.
Stock in Tiffany rose $5.90, or 9.3 percent, to $69.01 a share.
Mark L. Aaron, vice president for investor relations, said in a conference call that sales across all jewelry categories rose more than 10 percent.
High-end, engagement and gold jewelry all sold well, Mr. Aaron said. Silver jewelry, which sold well during the recession since it is relatively lower priced, posted a ''reasonably good'' sales increase, he added.
Rising diamond and precious metal costs have prompted Tiffany to raise some prices. Mr. Aaron said the price increases had occurred in most regions this year.
The chief operating officer, James N. Fernandez, said rough diamond prices had climbed nearly 40 percent in the last year.
''The outlook for diamonds over the long term certainly looks as though rising global demand will continue to put pressure on supply and therefore price,'' he explained.
Tiffany's best performance in the quarter came in the Asia-Pacific region, where sales surged 55 percent to $173.2 million on strong performances in China and Korea. Sales in Europe rose 32 percent. Foreign tourists, particularly those from China and Russia, contributed to the increase in Europe, the company said.
Sales in the Americas, which comprises the United States, Canada and Latin America, gained 25 percent.
Sales at the company's flagship New York store, a favorite of foreign tourists, rose 41 percent, Mr. Aaron said.
Even Japan, which is still regaining its footing after an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear scare earlier this year, posted a 21 percent sales increase.
''We are extremely pleased by these results, which confirm the growing global appeal of Tiffany's product offerings,'' the chief executive, Michael J. Kowalski, said in a statement.
Revenue at stores open at least a year increased 22 percent. Mr. Kowalski said the retailer's first-half performance raised confidence about the rest of the year, even though economic uncertainty remained.
Tiffany is now predicting that its full-year earnings will be $3.65 to $3.75 a share, compared with a previous forecast of $3.45 to $3.55 a share.
Analysts foresee earnings of $3.55 a share.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Says Politics Hurt Markets and Nation

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Vineyard Haven, Mass., and Carl Hulse from Washington.

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Friday that the political battle this summer over the federal government's borrowing and spending had disrupted financial markets ''and probably the economy as well.''
In remarks that went well beyond his previous calls for Congress and the White House to address the nation's long-term fiscal challenges, Mr. Bernanke suggested the process itself was broken.
''The country would be well served by a better process for making fiscal decisions,'' he said.
Mr. Bernanke said he remained optimistic about future growth -- he gave no indication that the Fed would increase its economic aid programs, though he said the central bank's policy-making board would revisit the issue at a scheduled meeting in September -- but he warned that the government had emerged as perhaps the greatest threat to recovery. 
''The quality of economic policy-making in the United States will heavily influence the nation's long-term prospects,'' Mr. Bernanke said in the much-anticipated speech, delivered at a policy conference held each August here at a resort in Grand Teton National Park.
The turn toward stronger language was welcomed by some lawmakers and observers of the partisan battle that has pitted Republicans seeking to reduce the federal debt through spending cuts against Democrats arguing for a mix of cuts and increases in revenue.
Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, described Mr. Bernanke's remarks as ''an emergency intervention.''
''It was great to hear him weigh in so strongly,'' said Ms. MacGuineas. ''He's saying what needs to be said, and hopefully people will listen because of the messenger.''
But the Fed chairman has no authority over fiscal policy. While he has advised Congress and the administration to make hard choices to bring down spending and deficits, his comments have held little sway in the deliberations.
A deal reached earlier this month to raise the amount the government can borrow, in exchange for spending cuts of at least $2.1 trillion, would not reduce the debt to a level most economists consider sustainable, and the political brinksmanship preceding the deal led Standard & Poor's to remove long-term Treasury securities from its list of risk-free investments.
The battle now is shifting to a special Congressional committee that will negotiate the details of those cuts. President Obama plans to deliver a speech after Labor Day detailing proposals for job creation and spending cuts intended to influence the work of that committee.
On Capitol Hill, Democrats seized on the Fed chairman's remarks to criticize Republicans for what they described as intransigence during the debt ceiling negotiations.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, said in a statement, ''I believe that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke was correct today when he observed that partisan brinksmanship over the debt limit damaged financial markets and the American economy.''
The White House, while declining to address Mr. Bernanke's remarks specifically, chimed in. ''The president has repeatedly expressed in his own right his frustration with the dysfunction and the partisan rancor that we've seen on Capitol Hill that has interfered with the government's ability to address these challenges,'' said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman.
Republicans, however, offered little response. And market reaction was muted. Stocks fell in early trading, then gradually recovered. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.5 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2 percent to close at 11,284.54. Friday's speech was eagerly anticipated because Mr. Bernanke and his predecessors have made a habit of coming to this conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to clarify their views on the economy and monetary policy.
The Fed announced earlier this month that it intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero until at least the middle of 2013, a reflection of its forecast that growth will not be fast enough during that period to drive up wages and prices. Many investors had viewed that announcement as a potential prelude to further steps. More than 25 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs, and the government said Friday that the economy expanded at an annual pace of 0.7 percent during the first half of the year, down from an earlier estimate of 0.8 percent.
But Mr. Bernanke, while noting those economic challenges, returned to the language of speeches he gave earlier this year, arguing that the Fed had largely exhausted the power of its monetary policy. ''Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank,'' he said.
While offering his standard disclaimer that the Fed would take any steps necessary, he notably omitted his usual description of those possible measures. He did say, however, that a scheduled meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in late September would be extended to two days from one day ''to allow a fuller discussion.''
Instead, Mr. Bernanke focused on fiscal policy, reiterating his frequent call for fiscal measures that focus on long-term reductions in the federal debt, while avoiding short-term cuts or tax increases that might impede recovery. He also said the government could help to speed recovery through steps that include ''good, proactive housing policy.''
''Notwithstanding the severe difficulties we currently face, I do not expect the long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy to be materially affected by the crisis and the recession if -- and I stress if -- our country takes the necessary steps to secure that outcome,'' he said.
Mr. Bernanke did not lay blame for the debt ceiling battle on either political party. But his recommendations for future fiscal policy-- particularly the emphasis on the need for continued investment and reducing unemployment -- generally hews closer to Mr. Obama's position than to the views of Congressional Republicans.
Mr. Bernanke elaborated only briefly on his suggestion for a different process to address these issues, suggesting that politicians should consider the establishment of ''clear and transparent budget goals, together with budget mechanisms to establish the credibility of these goals.''
Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues remain more optimistic about the health of the American economy than forecasters like the International Monetary Fund, one important reason the Fed is reluctant to consider additional measures.
The central bank also maintains an overriding focus on inflation, aiming to keep wages and prices rising no more than about 2 percent a year. The Fed expects inflation to exceed that pace in 2011, then to settle around that level. Additional stimulus could increase the pace above its comfort level.
A growing chorus of economists argues that the Fed should allow higher inflation. Some say that doing so would help to reduce unemployment. Others say that the inflation itself would be beneficial by easing the burden of household debt. Borrowers benefit from inflation because their loans can be repaid with cheaper dollars. But the Fed's leaders so far have not given any indication that they find these arguments compelling.
Concern about inflation contributed to the decisions by three members of the policy-making committee to dissent from the August announcement that rates would likely remain low for at least two more years. The central bank also has become a popular punching bag in the early stages of the Republican presidential primary. Mr. Bernanke opened the conference Thursday night with a brief speech, during which he mentioned that he had attended a rodeo with his wife earlier this week. The announcer, he said, asked the crowd to sing the national anthem even though many were angry about decisions made in Washington.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Presidential Bid Never Got Going

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
1:51 p.m. Updated The latest possible presidential bid by former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York has gone the way of his previous possible bids: it ended before it began. 
Mr. Pataki, whose flirtations with running for president stretch back more than a decade, canceled a planned trip to Iowa this weekend and announced on Friday that he will not pursue the Republican nomination ''at this time.''
Mr. Pataki, 66, who served three terms as governor, from 1995 through 2006, prompted considerable head-scratching this week after signaling that he might declare his candidacy at a Republican picnic in Des Moines on Saturday. On Wednesday, what appeared to be a draft of a campaign Web site was uncovered by The New York Observer, raising expectations further.
Mr. Pataki notched several trips this year to Iowa and New Hampshire, another early voting state, in his capacity as honorary chairman of No American Debt, a group that favors reducing the federal debt and is critical of President Obama.
In a statement, Mr. Pataki reiterated his criticism of Mr. Obama's fiscal stewardship and said the president must be defeated in his bid for re-election. But Mr. Pataki said he had decided not to seek the Republican nomination himself.
''I remain committed to the advancement of real, politically viable reforms to entitlements and rolling back the size and cost of the federal government,'' he said. ''At this time, I will continue to do this as the leader of No American Debt and not as a candidate for president.''
Mr. Pataki faced long odds at winning the Republican nomination, in part because his moderate stances on some social issues would not likely sit well with many primary voters. Lacking significant fund-raising or campaign infrastructure, Mr. Pataki was roundly mocked by political analysts in recent days for his consideration of a run.
The former governor did not offer any explanation for why he had decided not to pursue a presidential bid. He said only that he would remain active in the discussion about the federal debt and planned to support a presidential candidate ''who offers the vision, the ideas and the leadership to bring an end to America's debt crisis.''
Mr. Pataki's decision to not seek the nomination was first reported on Friday by CNN.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Backs Canadian Pipeline

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The State Department gave a crucial green light on Friday to a proposed 1,711-mile pipeline that would carry heavy oil from oil sands in Canada across the Great Plains to terminals in Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast.
The project, which would be the longest oil pipeline outside of Russia and China, has become a potent symbol in a growing fight that pits energy security against environmental risk, a struggle highlighted by last year's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
By concluding that the $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline would have minimal effect on the environment, President Obama would risk alienating environmental activists, who gave him important support in the 2008 election and were already upset by his recent decisions to expand domestic oil drilling and delay clean air rules. Pipeline opponents have protested in front of the White House for a week, resulting in nearly 400 arrests.
At the same time, rising concerns about the weak economy and high gas prices have made it difficult for the administration to oppose a project that would greatly expand the nation's access to oil from a friendly neighbor and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
The project still must clear several hurdles, including endorsement by other federal agencies, additional studies, public hearings and consultation with the states through which the pipeline will pass. But all signs point to the Obama administration approving the project by the end of the year, perhaps with modifications.
Environmental advocates say that the messy process of extracting and processing tarry oil from the Alberta wilderness would significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions and devastate bird habitats. And they warn that a leak in the 36-inch-diameter pipeline could wreak severe environmental damage.
The State Department said in its environmental impact statement Friday that the pipeline's owner, TransCanada, had agreed to take steps required by the Transportation Department to reduce the risks of a spill.
The impact statement did not fully resolve concerns raised by other federal agencies, particularly the Environmental Protection Agency, which harshly criticized earlier drafts. An E.P.A. spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said that the agency would carefully review the latest statement to determine whether it adequately dealt with questions about the pipeline's impacts on air quality, drinking water, endangered species and minority and Native American communities.
The pipeline is expected to open in 2013 unless delayed by lawsuits or other challenges.
For many in the environmental movement, the administration's apparent acceptance of the pipeline was yet another disappointment, after recent decisions to tentatively approve drilling in the Arctic Ocean, open 20 million more acres of the Gulf of Mexico for oil leasing and delay several major air quality regulations. Environmentalists are still smarting from the administration's failure to push climate change legislation through Congress.
Analysts and environmental advocates said these decisions had opened a wide and perhaps unbridgeable breach between the Democratic president and environmentally minded voters. It is far from certain, however, that these activists will withhold their support from Mr. Obama in November 2012, particularly if he is running against a Republican who denies the existence of climate change and is more supportive of the oil industry than he is.
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, urged President Obama to veto the project, despite the State Department's willingness to see it proceed.
''It will be increasingly difficult to mobilize the environmental base and to mobilize in particular young people to volunteer, to knock on thousands of doors, to put in 16-hour days, to donate money if they don't think the president is showing the courage to stand up to big polluters,'' he said.
Julian E. Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said that the 2012 election was shaping up to be close and the president could not afford to take these activists for granted. ''I think a year ago President Obama felt he could do things that might alienate his base and organizations important to the Democratic Party and get away with it because in the end most Democrats wouldn't go for a Republican,'' Mr. Zelizer said. ''Now he might pay a price for it.''
With the campaign heating up, the president appears reluctant to pursue environmental policies that could be characterized as suppressing job creation or keeping energy prices high.
The proposed Keystone XL pipeline extension would connect Canada's oil sands to several vital refineries around Houston and the Gulf of Mexico that are designed to handle heavy crude. It would also link to a vast pipeline network that snakes out from the gulf to several large metropolitan areas in the East.
Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, said in a telephone briefing that the environmental impact statement was not the last word on the project. The secretary of state must make a final determination that it is in the nation's economic, political, energy security and environmental interest, she noted.
But the report does conclude, she said, that ''there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the pipeline's corridor'' if the project's operator follows all relevant laws. Some American Indian cultural resources and plant and wildlife habitats could be adversely affected, the report states, although it says those concerns will be addressed.
TransCanada has refused to change its application despite critics who have contended that the half-inch-thick wall of the pipeline is not sturdy enough for maximum flow pressures, a claim the company denies.
But the company agreed to 57 conditions set by the Department of Transportation last spring, including burying the pipeline four feet below the surface, committing to frequent aerial and ground monitoring and setting the maximum distance between shut-off valves at 20 miles.
''We believe we are building the safest pipeline in North America,'' said Terry Cunha, a TransCanada spokesman.
The Canadian government has lobbied hard for the pipeline extension, joining forces with oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil that have large investments in oil sands production. Under current plans, oil sands production could overwhelm existing pipeline capacity in less than five years.
Gary Doer, the Canadian ambassador to the United States, said building the pipeline would produce 20,000 construction jobs and 100,000 additional indirect jobs in services and supplies. ''It's good for the U.S. economy, U.S. jobs and U.S. energy security,'' he said. ''If you ask Americans, would you choose Canada over the Middle East, they'd say yes.''
Mr. Doer said the carbon emissions from oil sands production and refining had declined by roughly 40 percent a barrel since 1990, and further improvements were under way. ''We have to continue working on the sustainability of development,'' he said. ''We believe in clean water and air, too.''
Canada, already the No. 1 source of imported oil to the United States, produced 1.5 million barrels a day of synthetic crude from oil sands in 2010 and hopes to expand that to 2.2 million barrels a day in 2015 and 3.7 million barrels a day by 2025. That level of expansion will require not only the Keystone project, but probably also pipelines to the west coast of Canada, where the crude could be exported to China and other Asian markets.
Keystone XL would increase Canada's pipeline capacity by 700,000 barrels a day, roughly the amount of oil Malaysia produces. Oil sands alone already provide more imported oil to the United States than Saudi Arabia, Nigeria or Venezuela, countries that are potentially unstable or hostile.
Executives in the oil industry said they were satisfied that the administration recognized the importance of the pipeline project. ''It's more about jobs and energy self-sufficiency than anything else, but what's wrong with that?'' said Chip Johnson, chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas.

HEADLINE: For Seamless Transitions, Don't Look To Hewlett

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
How much does a chief executive really matter at a multibillion-dollar technology company? Apple's employees, customers, shareholders, board and Steve Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, must hope the answer turns out to be a lot different than at the world's largest computer company, neighboring Hewlett-Packard.
Just a year ago, Mark Hurd, H.P.'s chief executive, was forced to resign in the midst of allegations of sexual harassment and expense account irregularities, many details of which remain shrouded in secrecy. (The board concluded the sexual harassment claim was unfounded, but that Mr. Hurd's lack of candor had cost him its confidence.) The vote to demand his resignation was unanimous, although the board was sharply divided, especially over how to handle his departure and seek a new C.E.O. But H.P. was so big, so dominant in most of its markets, and so profitable that Mr. Hurd was dispensable, according to people familiar with the board's reasoning. ''We don't need you,'' one board member bluntly told Mr. Hurd, or words to that effect.
So how has Hewlett-Packard fared under new leadership? 
On Aug. 18, H.P. announced simultaneously that it was exploring ''strategic alternatives'' and might sell its dominant personal computer business, which accounts for roughly a third of the company's revenue; that it was scrapping its new, much ballyhooed TouchPad tablet computer; and that it was acquiring a British software concern, Autonomy, for $10.3 billion, a steep 11 times revenue. The stock plunged 20 percent to $23.60 a share. When Mr. Hurd resigned, it was just under $46, so the one-year decline amounted to 49 percent. (The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained about 3 percent over the same period.)
''I didn't know there was such a thing as corporate suicide, but now we know that there is,'' a former H.P. director, the venture capitalist Tom Perkins, told me this week. ''It's just astonishing.''
''H.P. was the epicenter of Silicon Valley, geographically, culturally and historically,'' an executive at another technology concern said. ''Is there any analogy for an institution so respected that has fallen so far so fast? I can't think of one.''
No one claims that Mr. Hurd, now president of Oracle, is another Steve Jobs. His critics have portrayed him as a glorified chief operating officer who ruthlessly cut costs and starved innovation. Still, there's no denying the results during the six years he led H.P.: pro forma earnings leaped 242 percent on a 57 percent gain in revenue (to $120.4 billion); H.P.'s stock price rose 130 percent, to over $45 a share; free cash flow surged 138 percent and operating margins doubled. Forbes magazine put him on its cover in April 2010 with the headline: ''He Wants It All.''
To replace Mr. Hurd, H.P.'s board hired Leo Apotheker, the former chief executive of the German software giant SAP, even though SAP had declined to renew Mr. Apotheker's contract after just seven months in the top position and he was linked to a software theft scandal that cost SAP a $1.3 billion damages award (he has denied any direct involvement). Nor, as a software executive, did he have much experience with hardware, especially the printers and servers at the core of H.P.'s franchise.
On Jan. 20 this year, H.P. announced the resignations of four directors, two of whom had initially supported Mr. Hurd during board deliberations and resisted his immediate ouster, according to people with knowledge of the decision. Mr. Apotheker served on a committee that proposed the five new directors to replace them, prompting sharp criticism from the shareholder watchdog Institutional Shareholder Services, which said H.P. had violated its own rules in allowing its chief executive to play a role in choosing board members who are supposed to be independent. (H.P.'s chairman, Ray Lane, denied any violation of rules, and told Bloomberg News that the new board members ''aren't buddies of Apotheker,'' adding that ''because Leo and I know the industry, it would be hard to pick any name we don't know.'' An H.P. spokeswoman said that the company drew praise from many corporate governance experts for shaking up the board.)
After taking time to study H.P.'s operations, Mr. Apotheker hosted a three-day conference, ''HP Summit 2011,'' beginning March 14 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, a venue long associated with dazzling new product announcements from Apple. His presentation emphasized cloud computing and software, including WebOS, the highly regarded operating system H.P. gained when it acquired Palm Inc. under Mr. Hurd. Mr. Apotheker revealed that WebOS would be the future operating system in all the company's computers and said that H.P. would be shipping 100 million devices using it. He said curiously little about H.P.'s vaunted printer or server divisions, which accounted for the bulk of the company's profits.
Under Mr. Hurd, H.P. had been developing a tablet to compete with Apple's popular iPad, and had at least two prototypes in development, one using Google's Android operating system and the other Microsoft Windows Phone. H.P. didn't want to alienate a big customer like Microsoft by competing on operating systems, but it needed an Android product because of the large number of applications the system supports. (H.P.'s Slate tablet, aimed at business customers, uses Windows.)
Under Mr. Apotheker, H.P. pushed forward with a new consumer tablet, the TouchPad, which would use H.P.'s own WebOS. But WebOS lacked the thousands of apps already developed for competing operating systems like Android. As one software executive put it: ''For 30 years, the economics of software have been the same: your platform is only as successful as the quantity and quality of applications that run on top of it.
''So Leo comes in. He's not a consumer guy. He says, 'we're going to build an integrated device and go head to head with Steve Jobs.' I mean, are you kidding?''
But in press interviews and at The Wall Street Journal's ''All Things D'' conference this past June, Mr. Apotheker vowed that the TouchPad would be ''perfect.''
Meanwhile, H.P. missed earnings estimates in February, then lowered them in May. Last week it beat third-quarter estimates by a penny a share, but again lowered guidance for the next quarter. Even more stunning than the latest earnings was last week's abrupt shift in strategy. The TouchPad made its debut July 1. After only 48 days on the market, Mr. Apotheker announced that H.P. was abandoning it because of poor sales and would no longer support WebOS hardware. So much for the 100 million devices and the WebOS strategy Mr. Apotheker had trumpeted in March.
Even more startling may have been H.P.'s decision to explore ''strategic alternatives'' for its PC division. While it said it might consider a spinoff or sale, it didn't announce a buyer or a firm plan of action, leaving personal computer employees to ponder an uncertain fate and investors scratching their heads as to why the company seemed to be going out of its way to publicize the move to competitors. (The H.P. spokeswoman said the company was simply trying to be transparent and emphasized that it might decide to keep the PC division after all.)
Apart from the many synergies (including cost advantages) that might be lost if H.P. abandoned the PC division, the move would seem to undo years of strategy. The status of the PC division had been under constant review during the Hurd regime. But as one former H.P. executive told me, ''We considered getting rid of PCs -- for about two seconds.'' It's true that the PC business has lower margins -- currently 5.8 percent compared with the rest of the company's average of 11 percent. But given H.P.'s sales and marketing channels, the huge PC division was considered the foundation that supported servers, storage, software and eventually services, enabling H.P. to compete across the $150 billion infrastructure market as the world's largest computer company.
And then there was the company's announcement it was acquiring the British software concern Autonomy, which, along with the other initiatives, would ''fundamentally transform the company,'' as H.P.'s news release put it. ''Autonomy had been shopped everywhere,'' another executive told me, including to H.P. under Mr. Hurd. ''No one would pay 11 times revenue.''
A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., Bernstein Research's senior analyst, said this week: ''It's a fantastically high price. It's a very poor capital allocation decision. From our perspective, it's value-destroying.''
To many, the acquisition suggested that Mr. Apotheker and H.P.'s board were focusing primarily on software, going head-to-head with the giants Oracle and SAP, while ignoring the company's traditional strengths. ''It was as if Alan Mulally left Boeing to join Ford as C.E.O., and announced six months later that Ford would be making airplanes,'' said another software executive. (The H.P. spokeswoman said this was unfair. ''We said in March we were trying to emphasize our strengths in higher-growth, higher-margin businesses, like enterprise servers and software,'' she said.)
With H.P. stock mired at $25 this week, some analysts argue things can only improve. ''I still say it's undervalued,'' Mr. Sacconaghi said. ''It's not rotten at the core. It's in a series of businesses with strong competitive positions albeit in slow-growth markets. It's the single cheapest technology stock in the S.& P. 500. At some point something has to go right: improved performance, successful spinouts or a change in leadership.''
A year ago, in an e-mail to The Times after Mr. Hurd's ouster, Oracle's chief executive, Larry Ellison (and a tennis buddy of Mr. Hurd), wrote, ''The H.P. board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago. That decision nearly destroyed Apple and would have if Steve hadn't come back and saved them.''
Most took this as hyperbole from the famously outspoken Mr. Ellison. Now, many aren't so sure.
In Tim Cook, Apple may have an ideally qualified successor, one who will generate none of the controversy Mr. Apotheker has brought to H.P. But if Apple's board and investors feel that Apple is so strong that Mr. Jobs is easily replaceable, they should call their neighbors in Palo Alto.

HEADLINE: Shares End Unsettled Week With Strong Gains

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting from Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Julia Werdigier contributed from London.

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street surged on Friday, leading to a weekly gain of more than 4 percent after a volatile wait for word on whether there would be new economic stimulus from the Federal Reserve.
The financial markets had pinned their hopes early this week on some new announcement by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, at a symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and rose for three straight days. But expectations began to wane by Thursday, and indexes closed more than 1 percent lower.
By the time Mr. Bernanke spoke Friday morning, offering no additional measures to bolster short-term growth, investors had already priced in the result, and stocks recovered. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.5 percent, or 17.53 points, at 1,176.80. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2 percent, or 134.72 points, at 11,284.54, and the Nasdaq rose 2.5 percent to 2,479.85.
''It was a bit of a nonevent,'' said Schwab's chief investment strategist, Liz Ann Sonders, referring to the impact of the speech.
While Mr. Bernanke ''did not close the door to anything,'' she said, it appeared that the Fed wanted to give itself more time to assess the economy. ''They continue to say they expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year. At least that is a non-negative.'' Friday's five-day gain lifted the markets out of a streak of weekly losses, and the volatility receded slightly on Friday.
The S. & P. and the Dow closed off the week with a gain of more than 4 percent, while the Nasdaq rose nearly 6 percent in the period. But all three indexes are still down in the month to date.
The VIX, an index used to gauge volatility, ended at 35.59, the second-lowest reading on the index this week. Analysts said that while new stimulus or specific measures were not in the cards on Friday, the speech itself ended whatever guesswork still remained in the markets and restored some certainty.
''I think the market is continuing to bounce in a range,'' said Paul Ballew, Nationwide's chief economist. ''I think the market early in the week got a little worked up that he would do something and then came to their senses.''
The Fed chairman made his standard announcement that the Fed would take any steps necessary to help the economy, and he said the issue would be discussed at the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making board, in late September. But he made no mention of the measures the Fed might take, something he has provided on several occasions earlier this year. Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said the initial equity market reaction to the Fed statement was negative since there was no mention of new action, but the market probably turned around in the hope that action would still come in September. ''Unfortunately, the Fed doesn't have any rabbits to pull out of the hat to magically re-ignite economic growth,'' said Mr. Gault.
Mr. Bernanke also said the political battle this summer over the federal government's borrowing and spending had disrupted financial markets ''and probably the economy as well,'' and that the country would be well served by a better process for making fiscal decisions.
Mr. Ballew said that comments on the fiscal policy decision-making were more of a ''wish than a reality'' and so had little apparent impact on the markets.
Still, there were other factors at work on the markets on Friday. Technology shares pulled up the broader market, and on the Nasdaq, Aruba Network rose about 20 percent to $20.55. It reported on Thursday that fiscal fourth-quarter revenue was up 47 percent year over year, and the company said it was confident it would increase market share in the 2012 fiscal year.
Aside from corporate results, there were economic data points to contend with. After taking in disappointing jobs data on Thursday, the markets heard that gross domestic product for the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, a downward revision in the Commerce Department's report, of a previous estimate of 1.3 percent. Economists had expected growth to be revised down to 1.1 percent. In the first quarter, the economy advanced just 0.4 percent.
Clark Yingst, the chief market analyst at Joseph Gunnar, said the markets had already sent out signals before the speech that investors did not appear to be expecting anything new, but he also said they could be reacting to the new G.D.P. number. Stocks and the dollar were lower, and gold firmed slightly.
''The slight weakness in the dollar might be a knee-jerk reaction to that,'' Mr. Yingst said of the new data. Gold, which is typically a safe-haven asset, has been declining in recent days as many analysts said it was overpriced. On Friday Comex futures rose to $1,822 an ounce.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 99 14/32, and the yield fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Readers and Unemployment

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: Readers offer their thoughts on my column about unemployment.

 BODY:
As my Sunday column appears, I'll be in transit to Libya, insha'allah. But this column grew out of my family vacation this summer back in Yamhill, Oregon, where I grew up. Like everyone in journalism, I had been focused on the debt ceiling debates, but what I saw in Yamhill was a different economic scourge: unemployment. It really puzzles me that 25 million Americans could be unemployed or under-employed, and yet the issue has never really gotten much traction. In the last month or two, it has gained more visibility and President Obama says he is pivoting to jobs -- but none of the proposals on the agenda come close to matching the severity of the unemployment picture.
I should say that in Yamhill, I still saw some people able to find jobs. One strong 19-year-old had one job pumping gas, another hauling hay, and a couple of odd jobs besides. But for more marginal people -- those with health issues, criminal records or a bit of gray hair -- it can be just about impossible to find work. Some of them will never end up working again, I fear, and the losers are not just those individuals but our entire economy and country.
Granted, most of the solutions to the unemployment problem will add to the debt problem, in the short run. But jobs programs will also reduce the long-term debt problem, by bringing more people into the labor force and stimulating economic activity. 
So please read the column and post your thoughts below. I'd especially welcome comments from those who have lost their jobs or have friends and relatives looking for work.

HEADLINE: Homeless World Cup: Soccer, Statistics and Social Change

BYLINE: LAWRENCE CANN


HIGHLIGHT: Notes from the Homeless World Cup, Paris 2011

 BODY:
1:10 p.m. | Updated On Sunday, Scotland defeated Mexico, 4-3, to win the men's title and Kenya beat Mexico by the same score to win the women's crown in Paris.
PARIS -- Notes from the 2011 Homeless World Cup. ...
Soccer is alone as a sport usually indecipherable through statistics. Unlike baseball or basketball or football -- where we can look at batting averages and slugging percentages against certain style pitches, quarterback ratings, or where we can see more clearly how a team did on defense by measuring rebounds and shooting percentages -- in soccer there is no pattern and no reliable link between any stat and a predictable result.
Even goal tallies are deceiving. Manchester United's Dimitar Berbatov was the English Premier League's leading scorer, but the coach left him on the bench for the Champions League finals No one complained. Merely because he scored a lot didn't mean he gave them the best chance of scoring -- so soccer and statistics don't jive well. It's possible, however, that the current Homeless World Cup may be filling the statistical void in soccer.
Statistics aside for a moment, it has been an exciting cup. Refugees from the world's most horrific natural disasters and civil wars, victims of domestic violence and economic downturns, have come together from 64 countries this week in the shadow the Eiffel Tower, not to protest or to complain, but in a way to do what the Eiffel Tower does -- to stand for something, for human ambition to build something bigger, better, and more beautiful than what is. And of course, they are doing it through the beautiful game.
What is really exciting though are the numbers. Strip the Ghanaians of their drums, the British of their songs, take the green off the Irish uniforms, melt down all the South African's vuvuzelas, and subtract the smiling faces and stories of redemption and plot it all on an X and Y axis -- then your heart rate really shoots up.
Take the United States, for example. It costs about $30,000 a year to house and to care for homeless people in jails, shelters, emergency rooms, etc. Yet we know that if we transfer street soccer skills to our players, then 75 percent will connect to jobs education or housing within a year of learning those skills.
What are street soccer skills? They are bridging skills that connect sport lessons to real life. It's extremely important we transfer these skills because we know that if at-risk or homeless youth don't hold a job by age 24, they will likely struggle with homelessness the rest of their lives, but if they do hold down a job before that age, they will stay employed for life. Likewise, we know that if they don't pursue further education by age 24, statistically it is not going to happen. That's why the basic skills are important -- because it helps people avoid early decisions in life that can lead to lifelong negative consequences for them and all of us.
For example, Street Soccer USA talks about building triangles. On the soccer field you have to support others and support yourself by building triangles -- finding an option for passing to the right and an option on your left where you can unload the balls if need be. You also have to learn to go and be that support for your teammates. Our players also learn to build triangles of support in everyday life, whether that means maintaining a good relationship with your boss and co-workers , keeping up to speed with schoolwork, or having people you can go to when you are struggling with anger and emotional management.
These street soccer skills are small hurdles, but until our players can clear them, huge barriers remain for them in terms of moving forward in life. When you consider that for a year of training practice and support, it costs about $500 a player, and you note that the amount can cut significantly into the $30,000 cost of homelessness if not eliminate it in many cases, that's when you really ought to get out of your chair and start cheering.
If street soccer can grow , if these skills can be passed along to youth through sport before they become homeless, before they encounter law enforcement and before they become parents, then fans can really get crazy about the kind of stats that could result.
It's not pie in the sky either.
The street soccer framework developed at Street Soccer USA (the U.S. governing body) -- is proving to be an effective tool for improving educational achievement among homeless and impoverished teens. With a program that is based on a train the trainer model, street soccer and sport for development is a model that has tremendous potential, at a reasonable cost. The Homeless World Cup is approaching it's 10th edition, but is only getting warmed up in terms of it's future strength and impact.
If the U.S. wants to see soccer develop, soccer has to become a bigger part of our everyday culture. This starts with an infrastructure of street soccer courts, which can be done inexpensively. Only then will soccer be played everyday, like basketball in the inner city. As we build these courts, wouldn't it be amazing if we took the opportunity to use the sport with a strong social development component. Your best players would be more likely to succeed on and off the field and reach Major League Soccer or the national selection, and even those who aren't elite could unlock their future by applying sports lessons to life. This effort would even yield statistics to which everyone would pay attention.
Paris 2011 Update
The U.S. features two teams in the competition, the women's team known as the Lady Salamanders, thanks to women's sports owner and philanthropist Sheila Johnson, and the men's program, which is still searching for a moniker. You can see a feature created by Nike on two women from the U.S. team who were residents of a New York City Shelter run by HELP USA and the Department of Homeless Services in Brownsville, Brooklyn .
After the preliminary rounds, the U.S. men's team qualified for the top 24 of 48 nations. They are in the quarterfinals of the Dignitary Cup and will battle for 16th place against teams like of Austria, Denmark, South Africa and Italy.
Of the final eight teams remaining for the Homeless World Cup, one Asian nation -- Indonesia -- qualified, and three European countries -- Ukraine, the Netherlands and Scotland -- will meet the favorite -- Brazil -- as well as Mexico, Nigeria and Kenya. On Saturday, Mexico defeated Brazil, 5-1, and Scotland got by Kenya, 5-3, as both advanced to Sunday's final at the Stade de Liberte.
Mexico is backed by the Telmex Foundation, which has enabled the broad expansion of its efforts, has placed contenders for both the men's and women's Homeless World Cup in the finals brackets. The U.S. Lady Salamanders will vie for sixth place over all with Uganda, India and Canada, while Brazil and Mexico seem to be on a collision course for en epic final match.
On Saturday, Julio Martinez of New York scored three goals to lead the U.S. over Italy in the semifinals of the City Cup. The American team will play Denmark in the final for the third-tier trophy. The U.S. women lost in penalty kicks to Canada and play in a consolation match Sunday.
The finals of both Homeless World Cups will be played Sunday afternoon on the Champs du Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower.

HEADLINE: Bachmann Promises Fast Economic Turnaround With Tax Cuts

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: In one of the most detailed speeches she has given about her economic prescriptions, Representative Michele Bachmann said that as president she would turn things around within one economic quarter.

 BODY:
POINCIANA, Fla. -- How hard will it be to spur strong job growth in an economy mired in a seemingly endless funk of high unemployment? 
Representative Michele Bachmann promised that as president she would turn things around within one economic quarter, in part by cutting corporate taxes and eliminating capital gains and inheritance taxes. Painting President Obama as doggedly anti-business, Mrs. Bachmann asked, "Why in the world wouldn't we do what we know works to create jobs in this country?''
It was one of the most detailed speeches she has given about her economic prescriptions, delivered Saturday during her first campaign swing through Florida. 
Before winning the Iowa straw poll on Aug. 13, Mrs. Bachmann's audiences often asked her about social issues -- gun rights, same-sex marriage -- that are core passions of the Republican base in that state. But she now seems increasingly to be hammering on economics and jobs as the Iowa victory failed to translate into strong momentum in other places.
In recent polls, Mrs. Bachmann has been overshadowed by Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, and by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose entry into the race the weekend of the Iowa poll split off some of her Tea Party support.
Mrs. Bachmann, who appeared at a town hall-style event in a manicured retirement community, reminded reporters afterward that the race for the Republican nomination is still in an early stage and polls are unreliable.
"Usually when a candidate first goes in there's a big splash and things settle out after a while,'' she said -- a reference to Mr. Perry, but also, perhaps, to her own splashy entry in mid-June.
Florida, a perennial swing state in the general election, is also important in the Republican nomination. It may hold an early primary next year. Still, Mrs. Bachmann said she will skip the state's Presidency 5 straw poll on Sept. 24 in Orlando because of the need to focus on several national debates next month, including one on Sept. 12 in Tampa.
Sketching her prescriptions for the economy, Mrs. Bachmann often tells voters she was one of only a few House Republicans to oppose the debt ceiling agreement this summer. And she draws applause by promising to close the "job-killing" Environmental Protection Agency.
But Saturday she ventured into less familiar territory, pointing to the example of Ireland: "There are over 600 American companies that have gone to Ireland because of the tax rate,'' she said. "Over 100,000 jobs. I want those 100,000 jobs back in the United States.''
She also warned of "what happened to London'' -- an example, she explained, of "how quickly an empire can fall when you start spending money that you don't have.''
She called for a tax holiday for American companies on profits earned abroad, saying it is "the easiest thing the president could do, and he could do it today.'' 
"American companies have sitting in the bank over a trillion dollars,'' Mrs. Bachmann said. "If we had a zero rate of repatriation, by the afternoon that trillion dollars would be back in the United States. Do you have any idea of how many jobs would be created?''
The idea of a tax holiday, which corporations have been lobbying Congress for, is controversial. A nonpartisan study found that during an earlier tax holiday in 2005, companies spent most of their savings to pay dividends to shareholders and to buy back stock, not for investments or new jobs.
Audience members who heard Mrs. Bachmann, many of them retirees who glide about their gated community in golf carts, agreed that jolting the economy was more important than social issues. "I do not believe the social issues have anything to do with running the country,'' said Judy Swenson, adding that Mrs. Bachmann had won her support.
Susan Ruff, who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and supports abortion rights -- which Mrs. Bachmann strongly opposes -- said: "That's not a deal breaker. Not with everything else going on in the country.''
On Saturday evening, Mrs. Bachmann was scheduled to address the Florida Family Policy Council, which advocates restricted abortion rights and helped pass a state constitutional amendment in 2008 outlawing same-sex marriage. It was unclear whether she would be sticking to economic themes.

HEADLINE: Updates on Hurricane Irene

BYLINE: SARAH MASLIN NIR, ELIZABETH A. HARRIS and ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: Following the track of Hurricane Irene as it moves up the East Coast. 

 BODY:
10:28 P.M. | Gov. Christie Says to Stay Home from Work
Gov. Chris Christie urged people in New Jersey to stay home from work on Monday because of the dangerous flooding conditions on roadways and the rail system across the state, our colleague Jennifer Preston reports. "Traveling around the state is going to be very difficult," Mr. Christie said.
"The hurricane is over but, as I said, we have serous things to deal with," Mr. Christie said during a briefing Sunday night at state police headquarters here near Trenton.
New Jersey Transit would not be providing any commuter rail service on Monday, except for limited service on the Atlantic City line to help people who were evacuated return to their homes, he said. NJ Transit bus and light rail service, including the Bergen-Hudson and the River lines, would operate on a limited schedule. PATH service would resume at 4 a.m. Monday.
More than 300 roads across the state were either partially or fully closed because of flooding conditions. 
State police troopers used boats to rescue 60 people trapped in their residential neighborhood of mostly single-family homes in Kenilworth. Another 16 people were rescued by boat from a four-story apartment building in Cranford, state police said. More rescues by boat were expected in the coming days because of worsening flooding conditions.
While New Jersey escaped major damage to private property and public infrastructure along the coast, Mr. Christie said the heavy rainfall from the storm was causing some of the worst inland flooding that the state had seen in years. 
Many small streams were now at flood level, and some larger rivers - including the Ramapo, Passaic and Delaware - were expected to peak over the next 48 hours, reaching record or near-record flood levels. 
Mr. Christie noted that a flash flood had claimed the life of a 20-year-old Salem County woman early Sunday. The woman, identified as Celena Sylvestri, of Quinton, drowned after she was trapped in her car on Route 40 in Pilesgrove Township. She first called her boyfriend and then police shortly after 1 a.m. to report her car was swept off the road and that the water was up to her neck. But police and rescue workers at the scene could not find any trace of her or the car until more than eight hours later. 
Meanwhile, 10,000 people who spent last night in state operated emergency shelters were expected to be able to return to their homes Sunday night. More than 1 million people evacuated the Jersey Shore starting late last week. 
On Sunday night, more than 700,000 homes were still without power, Mr. Christie said, and it could be five days before power is fully restored across the state. 
Mr. Christie surveyed the damage along the coast by helicopter late Sunday afternoon from Sandy Hook to Cape May. He said that he did not see significant damage to private homes and not nearly as much erosion to beaches as had been feared.
He also met with local and county officials in Cape May who, he said, reported limited damage and told him they believed lives had been spared because of the decision to evacuate residents.
Mr. Christie dismissed criticism of his call for mandatory evacuations along some parts of the Jersey Shore. He said that Hurricane Katrina was very much on his mind as he made decisions and preparations for Hurricane Irene. "Watching those folks not having been evacuated, those school buses sitting unused, we all remember those images," Mr. Christie said, "and I did not want to leave resources on the table and leave people in parts of the southern part of our state where they could end up losing their lives." 
He said that he was glad "we made the decision we did. I think we saved people's lives."
He said "second guessers will not be tolerated."
The southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway, which had been closed for several days, reopened yesterday. But flooding caused closures on the parkway between Exits 91 and Exits 98 in both directions, making it difficult for some people to get home on Sunday. 
Mr. Christie also noted that at 6 a.m. Monday, the state would resume collecting tolls. Casinos will also be open.
The Lede is signing off for the night. We will continue to cover the impact of the storm in the days ahead. In the meantime, please visit the home page of this Web site for more reports from our colleagues. Thanks for your comments and tips. 
9:43 P.M. | Rivers Run Through Main Streets in Upstate New York
At least three people have died in New York State and hundreds have evacuated from their homes as floodwaters rise in the Hudson Valley and neighboring areas amid torrential rains.
More than a foot of rainfall led to the closure of 137 miles of the New York State Thruway, from Westchester County to Albany, as rivers swelled to record levels. The Tappan Zee Bridge was also closed, and officials were unable to predict when the thoroughfares would reopen.
"This is the highest we've seen in years. Our flood stage starts at about 11 feet. We're approximately 23 feet right now," Robert Stanely, the supervisor for the Catskills town of Shandaken, N.Y., told The Associated Press. "Immense areas are underwater. Areas I've never seen flooded are flooded right now. Dikes are breaking behind homes all over the place."
Many customers in Greene County and Ulster County were without a electricity, raising the statewide total of customers without power to 936,000, according to estimates put out by the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. 
Extreme flooding has washed out the entire downtown area of Windham, in Greene County, according to Michael Scarey, the town's fire chief, the Mid-Hudson News Network reported. 
Scott Adams, the creator of the comic strip "Dilbert," who grew up in Windham, posted on his blog on Sunday that his father, who still lives there, is missing and unreachable by phone. "My father lives alone on a hill above where the flooding is, so he wouldn't be in immediate danger from the high water. But my mother passed away a few months ago and he's living alone," he wrote. Mr. Adams requested that people in touch with his father email dilbertcartoonist@gmail.com 
A YouTube User named David France posted astounding video of rescuers using a motorboat to power through the brown river that used to be the Main Street of Margaretville in Delaware County.
At least three deaths in New York were blamed on the weather, according to the A.P.:
 Officials said a good Samaritan in New York City's northern suburbs was electrocuted trying to help a child who had gone into a flooded street that had live wires embedded in it.
In the Albany County town of New Scotland, a woman's body was spotted in a creek Sunday afternoon after her husband reported her missing, state police said. Neither the identity of the woman nor details were immediately released by police.
In Delaware County, deputies said a woman in her seventies died after floodwaters caused the partial collapse of a motel in the western Catskill Mountain community of Fleischmanns.
A video posted on YouTube purported to be of that town showed rivers coursing down the streets, loaded with giant trees propelled by gushing water.
8:24 P.M. | Dramatic Video of Vermont Flooding
Some of the most shocking flood imagery is coming from Vermont, where rivers are gushing over their banks, subsuming cars, pouring into houses and coursing down streets.
"It's not like anything that we've ever seen before," Peter Shumlin, the governor of Vermont said on CNN. "All of our downtowns are in the lowlands. Our population centers are located near rivers and streams. You just can't get away from it in a little state like Vermont."
On a YouTube account named mobilady, a video that seems to be from Bennington, Vt., shows a car hurtling down a river and being dashed on its banks.
The Times's Whitney Boyd spoke on Sunday evening to John Bohannon, 68, a 25-year resident of Saxtons River, Vt., population about 600. 
Mr. Bohannon described a tense scene. The Saxton River has been swelling to the height of the bridges that cross it, forcing their closure. With a steady rain that has not ceased since 10 p.m. Saturday, it threatens to rise higher. 
"Just two days ago when I was driving down the road, you could see stones because the water was so low," Mr. Bohannon said. A trailer home washed away earlier today, he said.
"People in town are amazed, because they looked at this river that we're so used to being peaceful and go fishing in and it is now knocking down trees and running against our bridges," he said. 
Our colleague Brian Stelter draws our attention to this illustration of the "epic flooding" in Vermont we mentioned in our 4:00 p.m. update: video of raging floodwaters threatening the covered bridge across the Ottauquechee River in Quechee, Vt.
Shortly after the video was posted on YouTube by a user named Al Gofberg, another YouTube user suggested in a comment that the bridge had actually been destroyed and the celebrated Simon Pearce restaurant, in a restored mill on the river nearby, had suffered flood damage. Mr. Gofberg posted a note on YouTube about 5 minutes ago reporting that "The bridge is still there, but its in BAD shape. Barely hanging on and\xBB the roadway is gone leading to it."
Calls to the Simon Pearce were not going through at the moment, but as soon as we get more information on the impact of the flooding in Quechee we will add an update.
[Update: A video report from Vermont's WCAX-TV made up of footage shot by viewers showed floodwaters tearing into the bridge and explained: "A majority of the Quechee Bridge was washed away by the Ottauquchee River. Most of downtown Quechee was underwater, including the Simon Pearce Mill."]
This brief clip, posted on YouTube in May, shows how high above the river the bridge normally sits. A photograph of the bridge posted on Google's Panoramio sharing site shows how close it is to the Simon Pearce.
In a post on his Dot Earth blog, our colleague Andrew Revkin posted a link to this archival footage from Vermont, "chronicling the impact of the great flood of 1927 that swept that state after a late-season tropical storm paid a November visit."
7:01 P.M. | Text of Obama's Address on Irene
President Obama addressed the nation about Hurricane Irene at 5 p.m. Sunday as reports of major flooding continued to pour in from places like upstate New York and Vermont.
One of our chief concerns before Irene made landfall was the possibility of significant flooding and widespread power outages. And we've been getting reports of just that from our state and local partners. Many Americans are still at serious risk of power outages and flooding, which could get worse in the coming days as rivers swell past their banks.
So I want people to understand that this is not over. Response and recovery efforts will be an ongoing operation, and I urge Americans in affected areas to continue to listen for the guidance and direction of their state and local officials.
Mr. Obama praised the efforts of rescue crews and volunteers.
Above all, the past few days have been a shining example of how Americans open our homes and our hearts to those in need and pull together in tough times to help our fellow citizens prepare for and respond to, as well as recover from, extraordinary challenges, whether natural disasters or economic difficulties. That's what makes the United States of America a strong and resilient nation, a strong and resilient people. And I want to thank all who have been involved very much.
The president's remarks were followed by updates on the situation by Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, and W. Craig Fugate, the administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Ms. Napolitano described a "three-phase approach: preparation, response and recovery."
"Some states and communities are still currently responding, while others are beginning to assess their damages and plan for recovery," she said.
"I'm pretty sure most of you forgot Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were first impacted," Mr. Fugate said. "Now we repeat that process in North Carolina, Virginia and up the coast as flooding is still ongoing."
Mr. Fugate continued: "When a disaster comes off the news and nobody is paying attention, we still don't go home."
6:02 P.M. | N.J. Volunteer Rescuer Is Critically Injured
A 39-year-old New Jersey volunteer rescue worker was critically injured in Princeton early Sunday, our colleague Jennifer Preston reports, when he and another worker waded into fast-moving water on a road to reach a car they thought might have someone trapped inside, the Princeton Township police said.
A member of Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad, the rescue worker was in critical condition at the University Medical Center in Princeton. His identity was being withheld pending notification of his family.
The rescue workers were responding to a report of a car that was submerged during a flash flood on Rosedale Road from rising waters of a stream known as Stony Brook. The police said that the car's occupant had apparently managed to escape and leave the area before rescue workers arrived on the scene.
Unable to confirm whether the car was occupied, the 39-year-old man and the other rescue worker stepped into the flooded roadway to try to make their way toward the car, but they were swept away, according to Mike Cifelli, a public information officer for the Princeton Township police. One of the workers was able to gain his footing. But not the 39-year-old worker, who was unconscious when he was pulled from the water and taken to the hospital, Mr. Cifelli said.
5:16 P.M. | Skies Clear in Virginia
The skies are cloudless on the Delmarva peninsula Sunday afternoon, 16 hours after the worst of Hurricane Irene brushed the coast here. The parking lots of Wal-mart and Food Lion are filling back up.
But as people drive north on the arterial road here, Route 13, there are striking reminders of Irene's lengthy visit. Several convoys of utility company trucks and construction vehicles were seen heading south toward the Carolinas, where power outages were widespread. Police cars gave an escort to a long line of National Guard trucks near the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, which reopened on Sunday morning.
Along the southern tip of Virginia's rural eastern shore, some shops remained boarded up.
Further to the south in Virginia Beach, Va., there were hundreds of tan-seekers out on the city's beaches by 3 p.m., when the city's emergency operations center officially closed. A handful of pleasure craft were seen bobbing around at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.
5:44 P.M. | Substantial Floods in Garrison, N.Y., and Elsewhere
Our colleague Andrew Revkin has posted about his experience of dramatic flooding in Garrison, N.Y., on his New York Times blog, Dot Earth.
5:09 P.M. | Inland Flood Threat Lingers in New Jersey
Gov. Chris Christie said that New Jersey had escaped major damage along the coast from Hurricane Irene, but residents living in low-lying areas near the state's rivers and streams faced new threats in the coming days from serious inland flooding conditions, particularly along the Delaware, Ramapo and Passaic Rivers, according to our colleague Jennifer Preston, who is reporting from Ewing, N.J. 
 "The real issue that we are going to have to with now is flooding," Governor Christie said. "This storm is transitioning into a flooding event. Some rivers have not crested yet." He said that projections indicated that the Ramapo river would reach record levels, contributing to major flooding in Pompton Plains.
Mr. Christie said New Jersey Transit buses would begin to transport some of the 15,000 people housed in 53 emergency shelters across the state back to their homes in Cape May and Atlantic Counties today. 
Many of those people may face power outages when they return home, though. An estimated 650,000 people across the state were without power due to the storm, state officials said.
Though roads were reopened, including the Garden State Parkway, he urged people to remain inside today so that utility crews could clear roads of downed wires and fallen tree branches across the state. 
"Stay inside. Please stay inside," Mr. Christie said during a briefing at state police headquarters near Trenton. 
Police cited the storm in at least three deaths. They included a 20-year-old Salem County woman whose body was found this morning, eight hours after she called the police saying that she was trapped in her car, submerged in a flash flood on U.S. Route 40. The police identified the woman as Celeste Sylvestri, a graduate of Salem High School. She first called her boyfriend, and then 911, about 1:30 a.m. to report that she was trapped in her car with water up to her neck, but the police were unable to find her car until 9:30 a.m. Sunday.
Police said a man also died of drowning in Kearny and that another man died of a heart attack while tending to a flooded basement in his home in Edison. 
At the briefing, Governor Christie said that light rail systems, including both the Hudson-Bergen and River Lines, would likely resume on Monday on a weekend schedule. Tolls, which were suspended to help ease traffic during the evacuation, would resume at 6 a.m. Monday. The Port Authority announced Sunday afternoon that the Path train service would resume Monday at 4 a.m.
Mr. Christie also said that the casinos in Atlantic City were expected to open again for business tomorrow and that beaches would reopen "as quickly as it is safe to get people back in the water." 
Mr. Christie said that he was confident that the evacuation saved lives. He praised what he described as an "orderly evacuation" of more than 1 million people from the Jersey Shore in the last few days. 
"That is a pretty extraordinary thing for people of New Jersey to do anything in an orderly fashion," he said. 
He said that emergency workers were identifying schools and other facilities to help people who might need access to shelters from the expected inland flooding. In years past, Bound Brook, Wayne and other towns have been adversely affected by flooding from heavy rain.
4:00 P.M. | 'Epic' Flooding in Parts of Vermont
Our colleague Abby Goodnough is in New Bedford, Mass., reporting on Irene's impact on New England. She reports that Vermont is getting hit with some tremendous flooding: 
Capt. Ray Keefe of the Vermont State Police said that "epic" flooding from the pounding rain had put a number of towns in southern Vermont underwater. 
"Many of our roads are impassable at this point," he said, adding that Wilmington, Marlboro, Dover and Brattleboro were especially hard hit. "We are advising people to get up to the highest point of their residence because we just can't get to them right now."
"The flooding is epic right now," he said. "We're doing our best to help the people who need it the most."
There have been no confirmed deaths so far, he said, but the state police are looking into a report of people being swept into a river in Wilmington.
3:32 P.M. | Obama to Make a Statement on Irene at 5 p.m.
White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon that President Obama would make a statement about Irene at 5 p.m. in the White House Rose Garden. 
2:23 P.M. | Piecing Together Reports of Power Failures in 3 States
At least 1.95 million customers have lost power in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, based on the reports that have come in from utilities and state officials.
Connecticut's largest utility company, Connecticut Light & Power, posted a map on its Web site with updated figures on power failures. On the map, a burnt orange indicates areas where between one and ten percent of CL&P customer have been affected, red signifies areas where 31 to 40 percent have experienced power failures, and the colors go all the way up to black for areas where 81 to 100 percent are in the dark. 
Nearly half of the Eastern portion of the state is in the black. 
The Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection said an additional 150,000 customers were without power in the state. 
According to the company's Web site, nearly 600,000 of their 1,237,00 customers have been affected. 
In New York, Gov. Andrew M Cuomo's official Twitter account reported mid-day Sunday that more than 900,000 customers were without power throughout the state. 
And in New Jersey, some 330,000 customers of PSE&G, the state's largest utility, are in the dark. 
That brings the total to at least 1.95 million customers in just three states. 
1:34 P.M. | Surveying Storm Damage in Upstate New York
As The Albany Times-Union reports, about 90,000 people are without power in upstate New York as a result of the storm. The newspaper posted this map showing where power failures have been reported so far.
During a visit to inspect flood damage in Margaretville, N.Y., in the Catskills earlier on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took these two photographs and uploaded them to his Twitter feed.
As Azi Paybarah of The New York Observer noted on Twitter, when was complimented on the quality of his photography later on CNN, Mr. Cuomo said, "some would say I'm just a frustrated journalist."
1:04 P.M. | FEMA Defends Widespread Evacuations
Our colleague Eric Lipton is reporting from Washington today. He has this update from the Federal Emergency Management Agency:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency had urban search and rescue teams on standby. The Department of Defense had 6,500 troops on alert. And the Department of Health and Human Services had its so-called Disaster Medical Assistance Teams ready to go. Each of these resources was tested five years ago during Hurricane Katrina.
But as of noon on Sunday, even as Hurricane Irene (now Tropical Storm Irene) passes New York's Hudson Valley, there has been no request for assistance from these front-line teams, federal officials said.
Craig Fugate, the FEMA director, said that it appears that the worst damage so far is downed trees, flooding and power failures in North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland - a repair job that is the primary responsibility of private utility companies, rather than federal or state governments.
"The thing that is going to be a big factor is the power outages and how quickly they can get the restoration going," Mr. Fugate said on CNN's "State of the Union."
Heavy rains have also caused damage, particularly in Virginia, Mr. Fugate said, and there has been some structural damage to homes right at the shorelines. In total, according to the Associated Press, there have been 14 reported storm-related deaths in six states.
There have been a few relatively isolated requests for federal assistance, Mr. Fugate said at a news conference late Sunday morning at the FEMA headquarters. "Fortunately, we have not to deploy a lot of the urban search and rescue teams we have on standby," Mr. Fugate said.
As second guessing began to swirl late Sunday morning about whether the storm was over-hyped, Mr. Fugate defended the widespread calls for evacuations, saying that the storm had been deadly and caused widespread hardship.
"Yes, there are a lot of times people say, well why did I have to evacuate?" Mr. Fugate said at the FEMA news conference. "It is those 25 percent times when it does happen and people have not evacuated, and there is a tremendous loss of life."
Bill Read, director of the National Hurricane Center, said that Hurricane Irene turned out to be less intense than expected because it had weakened somewhat before it reached North Carolina and then, as it traveled north, it stayed along the coast, and not on the Atlantic Ocean, preventing it from regaining power from the ocean waters.
Mr. Fugate said it could be several days, if not longer, before electricity will be restored across the region.
President Obama, who had returned home a day early from his Martha's Vineyard vacation, checked in frequently with FEMA as the storm progressed, most recently Sunday morning at 10:30, when he participated video teleconference with officials from FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security and key members of his cabinet. He planned another such update Sunday evening.
12:35 P.M. | May Take 5 to 7 Days to Restore New Jersey Power
PSE&G, New Jersey's largest utility, said in a Twitter message on Sunday that it may take 5 to 7 days to restore power to all its customers. The company said that 330,000 customers are without power throughout New Jersey.
12:10 P.M. | Tappan Zee Bridge Closed Due to Flooding
The wind and rain have died down, but flooding is still a problem.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo closed the Tappan Zee Bridge on Sunday because of flooding on the New York State Thruway. North of the Tappan Zee, Hudson River bridges remain open, the governor's office said.
11:49 A.M. | In New Jersey, 1 Dead and 500,000 Without Power
Our colleague Jennifer Preston is reporting from Ewing, N.J., at the state police headquarters near Trenton, N.J., which is serving as the state's emergency command center for the storm. Here is her update on the situation in New Jersey:
A 20-year-old New Jersey woman was found dead in her submerged car at 9:30 this morning on a flooded rural road in Salem County, eight hours after she called police to say she was trapped in her vehicle with water up to her neck, state police said.
The woman, whose identity was being withheld by police pending notification of her family, called her boyfriend at 1:40 a.m. and then 911, but police were unable to locate the woman or her vehicle, which was later found about 150 feet off of U.S. 40 in Pilesgrove Township in southern New Jersey.
When police were responding to the call, they found another person trapped nearby in a vehicle and were able to help him escape. State police officials said that they continued to search for the woman through the predawn darkness, sending state troopers, tethered by ropes into the flooded roadway, but they were unable to locate the woman or the vehicle until later this morning.
The woman is the only known fatality in New Jersey resulting from Hurricane Irene, which made landfall in Little Egg Township at 5:30 a.m. The storm did not appear to cause as much damage as had been feared, state police officials said, based on a preliminary assessment by local officials.
More than 500,000 people across the state were without power due to downed lines and fallen trees, state officials said.
"We were dealing with some pretty good gusts," said the State Police superintendent, Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, during a briefing at state police headquarters near Trenton, N.J., this morning. He said that the storm did not cause as much wind damage as had been feared along the coast. But there remained concern about flooding in parts of Somerset, Morris, Passaic and Bergen and Essex counties and those cities and towns along the Delaware River, which is expected to crest tomorrow.
Colonel Fuentes said that more than 15,000 people spent the night in emergency shelters and the plan is to get them and the more than 1 million people who evacuated the Jersey shore beginning Thursday back into their homes as soon as possible. First, he said, local and county officials needed to complete their assessment of the damage caused by the storm and to make sure roads were cleared of downed power lines and trees. "We want to make sure conditions are good enough on the ground," he said.
Colonel Fuentes urged people to remain home today and not to drive because roadways may be flooded, and so that crews could clear roads of fallen branches. The casinos in Atlantic City remained closed, and there was no estimate when they might remain open. The southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway, below Exit 98, he said, were also still closed.
11:41 A.M. | Eyewitness Video From New Jersey
Users of NJ.com, the Web site of Newark's Star-Ledger, have submitted eyewitness video of the storm's impact on the state. Here is video of a power line exploding in Woodbridge, N.J. 
Another NJ.com user, Scott Davis, submitted this video showing what he described as the flooding of Big Bear Creek in West Windsor.
On YouTube, a user named Boris Lyashkevich shot and uploaded this video, of what he said was flooding from a river in the town of Milburn, N.J. It includes narration with strong language.
11:22 A.M. | Effort to Drain Water From New York Train Tracks Begins
Our colleague Mike Grynbaum reports on Twitter that New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority has defended the decision to shut the entire transit system down, explaining that subway trains and buses were removed from low-lying yards that are now flooded.
As Amy Davidson, an editor at The New Yorker, notes on her Twitter feed, the MTA just posted this photograph on its Flickr account of New York City Transit employees pumping water out of the Lenox Subway Yard at 148th Street in Harlem.
This photograph, also from the MTA Flickr account, shows workers constructing a "sea wall" at the yard in advance of the storm.
Here is an image of that improvised sea wall across the tracks on Sunday morning:
Further north here is an image of floodwaters from Sing Sing Creek covering the tracks - but not the third rail - of Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line at Ossining.
10:53 A.M. | Power Failures in New York State
The official Twitter account of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York just sent out an update on power failures in the state. There are 404,481 Long Island Power Authority customers without power. Con Edison, which serves much of New York City and Westchester County, has 102,783 customers out; National Grid has 71,870 customers out; Central Hudson Gas and Electric has 66,613; and the Orange and Rockland power company has 31,218, the update said.
Long Island Power Authority's own Web site, however, reported higher numbers. As of 10:49 a.m., it said that 441,237 customers were without power.
10:52 A.M. | New Jersey Officials Urge Residents to Stay Inside
In an appearance on NBC on Sunday morning, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey urged residents of his state to remain inside. Mr. Christie stressed his concern about the dangers posed by downed power lines and "record flooding" in parts of the state - including Bound Brook, N.J., which was badly damaged in 1999 by Hurricane Floyd.
The governor posted this video of his interview with Matt Lauer on his YouTube channel about an hour ago:
Writing on his Twitter feed, Newark's mayor, Cory Booker, reported about an hour ago: "We are up to 10 water rescues of motorists (& one dog) stranded on flooded roads. Please stay inside."
In response to a question from another user of the social network who asked if he was really writing the updates himself, Mr. Booker told his followers: "I got bout 2hrs sleep & its really me wet and wired on caffeine."
Replying to another user who posted a message noting that "we never had a hurricane," during the previous mayor's tenure, Mr. Booker wrote: "Lol, well I guess u can blame me then."
10:25 A.M. | Map Shows Latest Predicted Path of Tropical Storm
Here is an updated interactive map from the Google Crisis Response team charting the tropical storm's predicted path, based on the National Hurricane Center's latest forecast.
9:27 A.M. | Irene Downgraded to a Tropical Storm
Irene has been downgraded from a Hurricane to a Tropical Storm, the National Weather Service said at 9 a.m. Sunday. A tropical storm has winds between 39 and 73 miles per hour, and a hurricane has winds of at least 74 miles per hour, according to the weather service. This system now has maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour. But despite the downgrade, the risk of flooding in the New York City area remains for the time being. 
"As the storm continues to move further and further to the north, the coastal flooding issues should subside," said weather service meteorologist David Stark. "But we still have some time before the now tropical storm gets out of the area and the cleanup can begin."
Here is the text of the National Hurricane Center's 9 a.m. update on the storm:
REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT AND NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR INDICATE THAT THE CENTER OF IRENE MOVED OVER NEW YORK CITY AROUND 900 AM EDT...1300 UTC. IRENE HAS WEAKENED TO A TROPICAL STORM AND THE ESTIMATED INTENSITY AT
LANDFALL WAS 65 MPH...100 KM/H.
9:23 A.M. | Some New Yorkers Defy Warnings to Stay Inside
Even as water starts to spill over the banks of the rivers on both sides of Lower Manhattan, photographs posted online in the past hour by Jody Avirgan, a producer for WNYC reporting on Irene's impact, show that a handful of New Yorkers are refusing to let the storm keep them from their self-appointed rounds.
After he posted iPhone photographs of the rivers rising at South Street Seaport, Battery Park City and Pier A, Mr. Avirgan uploaded this photo and observed on Twitter: "Dog walkers are the only non-police, non-TV folks on the street."
Passing through SoHo, Mr. Avirgan posted a photograph of a corner store at 6th Avenue and Charlton and asked, "Is this Lower Manhattan's only #openbodega?"
About an hour ago, Mr. Avirgan even spotted a cyclist out on his bike near the Staten Island Ferry terminal at the the foot of Manhattan.
9:05 A.M. | 350,000 Without Power in Long Island
More than 350,000 customers are without power on Long Island, according to the Long Island Power Authority, which provides electricity to all of the Island and the Rockaways. (LIPA has a map of effected areas on its Web site, here.) A spokesman for the utility said that they serve 1.1 million customers, which means fully a third of them are in the dark. 
"We're in that third," said Gloria Cucinello, who lives in Lake Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County with her husband. The storm knocked out their power around 5 o'clock this morning, and brought down several trees near their house. 
"There's just leaves and debris everywhere, in our front yard we had a tree that was uprooted and completely knocked down," she said. "The wind is pretty steady now, before it was just gusts of wind." 
As the hour crept toward 9 a.m., the count of outages on the LIPA Web site crept higher. 
"Wonder how long it'll be, that's the question," Ms. Cucinello said, wondering how long she would be without power. "It'll probably be a while." 
8:17 A.M. | New York City Rivers Begin to Overflow
CNN is reporting that the East and Hudson rivers have begun to overflow in parts of Lower Manhattan. Dramatic pictures show reporters ankle-deep in river water as they stand on the pavement beside the rivers, and water sliding over the embankment near the South Street Seaport.
Battery Park has reported a total water level near 8.6 feet, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
8:15 A.M. | North Jersey Awakes to Irene

Hurricane Irene made landfall in New Jersey at about 5:35 a.m. Sunday in Little Egg Harbor near Atlantic City. But long before dawn, the state faced a rain-soaked night that at daylight revealed wide swaths of destruction; a host of fallen trees, river and flash flooding and several hundred thousand people without power. 
"We are not having a great morning," Lt. Peter Eakley, the deputy emergency management coordinator in Millburn, N.J., said before daybreak. At dawn, rescue crews were on Main Street, using a front-end loader with a bucket to hoist people out of the waist-high water coursing down the street in which their car had become submerged. The driver had ignored a police barricade, Lt. Eakley said.
At the same time, crews in Buena Vista, N.J., were working to rescue about 35 senior residents of Cranberry Run, a mobile home park for seniors, after flash floods inundated the park with up to three feet of water, said Mary Goepfert, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey's Office of Emergency Management
"What we have going on overnight is many, many road closures and flooded roadways, trees down and more importantly we have downed wires, which are live," Ms. Goepfert said. Close to half a million people were without power, she said, and close to 10,000 people in shelters. "We expect both of those number to increase as the days go on," she said. "You're going to see flash flooding, and people needing to leave their homes."
Several police departments across the state reported that they spent much of the night rescuing people from cars that had become stuck in floodwaters. As of 8 a.m. Sunday morning, no storm-related deaths had been reported for the state.
6:05 A.M. | Irene, Viewed from a Safe Distance
Watch a mesmerizing visualization of Hurricane Irene as it swirls up the East Coast, created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
5:38 A.M. | Power Failures Soar as Irene Arrives in New York Region
Nearly 400,000 customers were without power as of 5 a.m. as Hurricane Irene chugged across the TriState Area, with numbers slated to soar as the storm picks up further and travels north, according to information provided by local power companies.
As of 5 a.m, 57,992 in the metropolitan area and Westchester were without power according to Consolidated Edison and on Long Island, 150,338 customers were without power according to the Long Island Power Authority.
In Connecticut, where the hurricane had barely begun to touch as of 5:30 a.m. over 75,095 customers were without power according to Connecticut Light & Power.
In New Jersey, 166,000 customers lacked electricity according to Public Service Electric and Gas. "The number of outages continues to climb as Hurricane Irene moves north" the company said in a statement on its Web site.
4:34 A.M. | Transportation Options Shut Down in Philadelphia
Philadelphia is buckling down for the storm, which meteorologists said had shifted course to pass the city more closely than expected.
As of 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, the last flight departed from the Philadelphia International Airport, which shut down aviation operations but still had crews combing the premises looking for leaks or storm damage at 2 a.m.
Because of airline cancellations, no planes were scheduled to fly into or out of the airport after late Saturday evening, said Victoria Lupica, an airport spokeswoman. Ms. Lupica said the airport would reopen to air traffic at 4 p.m. Sunday.
At around 2 a.m. Sunday, she said, not a single plane was at the airport, which on an average weekend day has about 1,100 flights from over a dozen carriers.
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority ceased all service at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday. The closure encompasses trolley, bus and rail service to Chester, Delaware, Bucks, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties.
And the Philadelphia Parking Authority said that beginning at 5 p.m. on Saturday, city garages operated by the authority would charge a flat $5 parking rate until Monday morning at 5 a.m.
2:48 A.M. | Hoboken Evacuates Shelter as a Precaution
The only evacuation center in Hoboken, N.J., was itself evacuated on Saturday night when the 52 people who had sought refuge there were taken to another center further inland as a precautionary measure, a spokesman for the mayor's office said.
At about 11:30 p.m. the mayor, Dawn Zimmer, accompanied the people taken in two buses from the shelter at Wallace Elementary School on Willow Avenue to the Izod Center stadium in East Rutherford, which opened to evacuees that weekend.
The evacuation was first reported by Claire Moses, a reporter for Patch.com, a hyperlocal newsblog.
Though some areas in the south and southwestern parts of the city of 50,005 people had begun to flood by late Saturday, the shelter had not yet flooded, though it remained a possibility, Juan Melli, a spokesman for the mayor's office, said.
"Instead of having to deal with the crisis, it made sense to in a really orderly fashion move them out to the Izod Center," he said. "We were looking at the possibility that it could flood."
Flooding is common in Hoboken. It is particularly low-lying in parts, and bounded to the east by the Hudson River. The mayor, Mr. Melli said, had urged people to leave town since Wednesday. "They were like, why is she doing this, why is she instilling panic?" he said. The mayor had gone door to door earlier Saturday, asking people to seek shelter, Mr. Melli said.
The Willow Avenue shelter remained open, according to Mr. Melli, and can accommodate up to 200 people. New shelter seekers have already begun to arrive there, and by 3:30 a.m Sunday, 13 of those new arrivals were also evacuated to the Izod Center.
0:43 A.M. | In Park Slope Brooklyn, Business as (Almost) Usual
Our colleague Melena Ryzik braved the storm in Park Slope, Brooklyn, early Saturday evening as Hurricane Irene closed in and found she was not the only one.
Melena reports:
 As residents weighedwhether to evacuate or stay put on Saturday, life in other parts of the city seemed nearly normal. In Park Slope and other residential neighborhoods in Brooklyn, brunch went on as planned; joggers did their laps; and movie theaters were full. Far from the projected flood zone, families were still taking strolls, bodegas were open, video stores had snaking lines and delivery guys bearing pizzas and Thai food zipped around on bikes and mopeds well into the rainy evening.
(Of course, New Yorkers are always eager for a shortcut: TaskRabbit, an online marketplace for doing chores, one Brooklyn woman offered to pay someone to do her emergency hurricane shopping for her,posting a grocery list that included canned goods - especially chili - batteries, a fire extinguisher and beer. Her request found a taker within a half-hour.)
But though many restaurants along the 7th Avenue commercial strip in Park Slope were open, commerce was slower than normal.
"This weekend's devastating our business," said Stephanie Voulgaris, general manager of Okeanos, a Greek restaurant on 7th Avenue and 8th Street. On an average Saturday night, there might be 110 reservations; on this night, there were just over 20, she said. She planned to close the restaurant on Sunday. Around 9 p.m., as the restaurant was serving its final customers, her employees were covering the doors to the basement with plastic; they had already removed all the dry goods and takeout containers stored there, Ms. Voulgaris said. She'd see that the workers got home safely, she added, dropping them off at their doors in a car service before heading home herself.
Her customers were very appreciative that the restaurant stayed open - "they showed their gratitude when they came in," she said - but she was uneasy. "We don't know how it's going to go," she said of the storm. "We worry about the life of the restaurant, will the windows hold, all kinds of debris flying, who knows." She sighed. Before closing she would check again that everything was battened down, "and pray for the best for tomorrow."
A block up, at the 7th Avenue Donut Shop, a 24-hour diner and neighborhood institution, there was a different story. Asked if he was nervous about the storm, the manager, who gave his name as Tony, shrugged. "Nah," he said. A steady stream of police officers came by for their usual, along with guys eating solo as they read the paper, and young couples ordering coffee and crullers. A medical student from the hospital across the street rushed in, in his scrubs, pausing to read a sign on the door. "Thank god," he said. "They don't close, ever."
True enough. "We will be open all day Saturday & Sunday," the sign announced. Underneath a drawing of a bent umbrella, it offered an even greater promise: "Delivery Available."
12:05 A.M. | In Far Rockaway, Securing the Boats and the Goats
Our colleague Melena Ryzik reported from Far Rockaway, Queens, in the hours before the evacuation order took effect.
As can be imagined, the manager of Marina 59 on Jamaica Bay in Far Rockaway, Queens, had much to do before the city's mandatory evacuation order for the area went into effect on Saturday evening. Batten down the hatches and tie down the boats, and perhaps, if necessary, the goats.
"The goats were the first thing to be secured," said Russ Conrad, 59. "I don't know if you've ever tried to put a life jacket on a goat before. I haven't and I'm not about to start."
Mr. Conrad's only companions at the marina at around 4 p.m. were an artist who lives on a houseboat and a family of goats - Mama, Daddy and Baby, as they're known - who serve as lawnmowers and mascots for the place.
The goats were moved to the highest ground in the marina - a semi-covered spot between the office and the bathroom. "It's got walls around all sides," he said. "Plus they have stuff to jump on." Mr. Conrad also made the rounds, checking on the 150 or so boats there. "They're all tied right, they're all tied so they're not going to rip the docks out," he said. He secured the loose debris in the yard, and tied all the equipment in the parking lot down. "I think we're pretty safe," he said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Conrad, who has spent 30 years working around boats, including several spent as a marine surveyor, evaluating coastal damage claims, will be spending the night at the marina, instead of at his noncoastal home in South Jersey. He'll be staying on and monitoring a houseboat barge belonging to the marina's owner. "I've got it tied in about 16 places," Mr. Conrad said. "But it's a little too tall be hanging out in in really windy times." He planned to keep tabs on the weather in New Jersey and make a move if it seemed like the water would rise past the marina's bulkhead.
"I would love to listen to the evacuation orders," he said. "Don't worry. If it gets bad, I'm evacuating. I've already got an exit strategy," he said - driving up to a friend's house in a nonevacuated town on Long Island.
In the meantime, he has plenty to do. "I gotta keep checking stuff as much as I can," he said. "Obviously once it gets windy, I can't go out on the docks. Then you just gotta sit here and wait."
As for the goats, his wife had suggested that he bring the the mascot family home, but he declined. "The goats will be safe," Mr. Conrad vowed. "My wife would kill my if something happened to those goats."
10:58 P.M. | Bloomberg Says to Stay Put
At a press conference Saturday night, New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the time to evacuate was over. New Yorkers, he said, should stay put and ride out the storm. He urged people not to go outside and suggested precautions like filling the bathtub with water and moving away from the windows. 
"Now the time is to focus on what to do where you are," Mr. Bloomberg said, according to The Associated Press.
9:53 P.M. | 800,000 Virginia Customers Without Power
The Capital Weather Gang blog on the Washington Post Web site is reporting that 800,000 customers of the Dominion Virginia Power company are without power, which is more than the company expected. 
9:40 P.M. | The Storm Rolls Into New York City
Take a look out the window - though perhaps don't get too close. The rain has come to New York City. 
Meteorologists at the National Weather Service say that the winds are expected to pick up in New York City at around 9 p.m. - which is to say, now - and by about midnight, they should be strong enough to take down trees and power lines. Winds are expected to be at their worst between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. The city and nearby counties are under tornado watch until 5 a.m. 
According to the Capital Weather Gang blog on the Washington Post Web site, D.C. is likely in the "worst stretch" of the storm, which was expected to hit between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m.
But do not despair! Our colleague Kim Severson, who is reporting from North Carolina, recently said on Twitter, "Here at the back end of #Irene I see a first glimpse of sunlight. For those of you about to get hit, know it will end."
8:29 P.M. | 24 Hours of Misery in Nags Head, N.C
Our colleague Brian Stelter is in Nags Head, N.C., where the storm is winding down, but fears of flooding remain: 
To the residents of eastern North Carolina, Hurricane Irene must seem like the storm that never knows when to quit. 
It's been pummeling this part of the state for nearly 24 hours now, delivering steady winds and severe rains. It's expected to finally clear the state sometime overnight. 
While it's way too early for a final damage assessment, it can be said that the winds did only minimal damage here in Nags Head along the Outer Banks. At a Comfort Inn where many television crews are staying, cameras were rolling as chunks of a deck railing collapsed into the surf late in the afternoon. Camera crews also saw that part of the facade of the local Food Lion store had fallen apart, and that shingles and pieces of siding had been swept off of some beach houses. But these sightings are the exception, not the rule. 
There remain concerns about flooding along the Albemarle Sound. As darkness fell, pictures and video clips posted by Twitter users showed serious flooding in Manteo, an island in Dare County just west of Nags Head. 
According to a group Twitter account for the Web site OuterBanks.net, citing an eyewitness, water was chest high in the streets of Manteo.
The reports could not be independently confirmed because access to the island was cut off by a downed power line.
A mandatory evacuation remained in effect in the area, and local officials said no entry was permitted onto the Outer Banks.
8:22 P.M. | Tornado Watch for New York City
New York City was put on tornado watch just before 8 p.m. on Saturday, along with Westchester, Suffolk, Nassau and Rockland Counties, the National Weather Service said. 
"It's actually common when we have these tropical systems," said Brian Ceimnecki of the National Weather Service. As Irene has moved up the coast, he added, tornado watches have moved right along with them. 
7:34 P.M. | The Urgent Pursuit of Sandbags in D.C.
Our colleague David E. Sanger is reporting from Washington, D.C., where he has documented the urgent pursuit of sandbags there: 
You wouldn't think it would be difficult to get sandbagged in Washington. Especially in the shadow of the Capitol.
But from the morning through midafternoon on Saturday, the line for sandbags provided by the District of Columbia government - five to a car, please - snaked around RFK Stadium, whose vacant parking lots (the Washington Nationals moved to a spiffy new stadium several years ago) provided a perfect staging area for loading up sandbags. The only problem was that the city officials badly underestimated demand.
On Friday afternoon, having run through 5,000 bags or so, the district turned away commuters stopping by one the way home from work. At 9 a.m. on Saturday, the lines were already beginning to form for what was rumored to be a second wave. But there were only a few hundred bags available. So, while a constantly growing line of cars waited for an hour and a half - first hundreds, then thousands - dump trucks arrived at Parking Lot No. 7 and spilled massive amounts of sand onto the ground. A dozen or so overworked sanitation workers stuffed bags one by one.
"Do these bags do any good?" one asked a District resident - this reporter, hoping to buttress a basement door that is prone to floodwaters. No one really knew. But they wanted their five bags. By noon, as bags started to be loaded in cars again, the rains came.
7:04 P.M. | Boston-Area Transit Suspended Sunday
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority announced that all service would be shut down on Sunday because of the storm.
All MBTA Service will be suspended Sunday due to Hurricane Irene. #mbtaSat Aug 27 22:49:34 via TweetDeckMBTA General Manager

6:30 P.M. | Nearly 900,000 Have Lost Power
The Associated Press is reporting that nearly 900,000 homes and businesses have lost power due to Hurricane Irene, most of them in North Carolina and Virgina. Officials say "it could get much worse as Irene churns north," according to the article.
6:17 P.M. | Low Turnout at New York City Shelters
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has repeatedly warned residents of low-lying areas to evacuate, but as The Times's James Barron reports, the city's evacuation shelters aren't exactly overrun:
But despite the city's efforts, opening 91 emergency centers that could take in 70,000 people, the mayor said that only 1,400 had arrived by 3:30 p.m. Saturday. The only other statistics available pointed to the difficulty of getting people to abide by the mayor's mandatory evacuation order in what the city calls Zone A low-lying areas: He said 80 percent of the residents in some city-run buildings - but only 50 percent in others - had left by Saturday afternoon.
5:47 P.M. | A Reverse Surge in Albemarle Sound
This is Albemarle Sound, on the side of Nags Head opposite the
Atlantic. There should be water here, but there's not. It's been
pushed inland by Hurricane Irene, our colleague Brian Stelter reports.
That water is now causing river flooding on the other side of the
sound, according to the National Weather Service. Residents here are
concerned that the water will be swept back into the sound and onto
this barrier island.
Aubrey Cole, a 22-year-old college student who is riding out the storm
in Kitty Hawk, called it "reverse surge."
"The water has gone north," he said. "When the wind switches
direction, it gonna come back."
Because these barrier islands lie so close to sea level, any such
surge could conceivably overwash the roads here and damage properties.
5:32 P.M. | No Flights at New York-Area Airports on Sunday
There will be no inbound or outbound flights at the three major airports in the New York area on Sunday, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told CNN. All flights are canceled at Kennedy International Airport, La Guardia Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y.
The three major airports had already been closed to arriving flights since noon on Saturday, and most of the departures later in the day had been canceled.
5:23 P.M. | 95 Percent of Cape May County Thought to Be Evacuated
Census figures show that some 97,000 people live in Cape May County, N.J., and according to county officials, 95 percent of them have been evacuated, our colleague Andrew O'Reilly reports. 
"We think we're in good shape because the population has diminished so dramatically, but we're not letting our guard down," Frank McCall, the county emergency management coordinator, said at a press conference this afternoon.
County officials' main concern, he said, is making sure that all the senior citizens are out. Cape May County is also home to the highest percentage of senior citizens in the state. But county officials were also knocking on doors, asking any "die-hards" to leave. 
"We will continue to be very proactive," he said.
Officials said that Hurricane Irene was expected to make landfall in the area between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m.
"Zero hour is approaching," said Sgt. Patrick Gorman of the New Jersey State Police. 
4:47 P.M. | Gov. Christie Says Jersey Shore is Safest Empty
Watch live streaming video from governorchrischristie at livestream.com
Governor Chris Christie said that most people on New Jersey's barrier islands and coastal areas along the Jersey Shore heeded his call to evacuate. However, he remains concerned about the 600 mostly elderly residents who have been reluctant to leave their homes in about five or six high-rise apartment buildings in Atlantic City, our colleague Jennifer Preston reports.
"The best way to preserve human life on the Jersey shore is for there to be no human beings on the Jersey Shore, given what is about to come," Mr. Christie said.
He also cautioned New Jersey residents to not let down their guard because Irene has been downgraded from a Category 2 storm to a Category 1. He anticipates extensive damage to private property and public infrastructure on barrier islands, and other parts of the coast, he said. The governor also warned that the 6 to 12 inches of expected rainfall could result in flooding conditions in towns miles from the coast, like Wayne, N.J. 
People should have enough food and water to last five days, he said, because of the prospect of widespread and long-lasting power outages. 
To help persuade the elderly residents in Atlantic City to leave, Mr. Christie said that state police officers have been sent to talk to residents, one by one, to try and persuade them to evacuate. NJ Transit buses have also been sent to wait out outside of the buildings, in hopes that people will choose to ride out the storm in emergency shelters instead of their apartments, he said. If the resident do stay, they risk injury from shattered glass and other damage from Hurricane Irene.
"I would ask you to please allow us to help you," Mr. Christie said, looking directly into the television cameras during the briefing. "You are correct that I can not make you leave your home. But we really do have your safety first and foremost in our minds. Let us walk you downstairs and put you in one of those buses."
Mr. Christie said that the evacuations from Long Beach Island and other areas along the coast from Sandy Hook to Cape May went smoothly and without major traffic delays. He said between 90 percent to 98 percent of residents in parts of Cape May, Atlantic, Ocean and Monmouth counties have departed. 
More than 5,300 people are now being housed in emergency shelters, including on the campus of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. and at the Mennen Sports Center in Morristown, N.J. Another 1,200 people who were evacuated from Atlantic County on Friday spent last night without cots at the Sun National Bank Center, an arena in Trenton. Many people ended up sleeping in seats, he said. This group has since been moved to the Rutgers campus, which Mr. Christie visited following the press conference. 
Other emergency shelters, if needed, would be set up at the Izod Center at the Meadowlands Sports Complex and at the National Guard armory in Jersey City, he said. To help state officials get the Meadowlands ready as an emergency shelter - and to keep people off the roads as the storm approaches - Mr. Christie said that he spoke yesterday with the owners of the Jets and the Giants about canceling today's football games. They agreed.
For now, the governor said the southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway, which were closed starting at Exit 98 on Friday, would not open anytime soon. He said that it was important to keep the roadway closed for emergency vehicles during and in the aftermath of the storm.
4:40 P.M. | Mayor Bloomberg on Twitter: Zone A, Leave Now
About 20 minutes ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg posted the below on his official Twitter account, urging people in the low-lying evacuation areas designated as "Zone A" to leave immediately.
4:07 P.M. | Irenes Through the Years
This isn't the first time we've met Hurricane Irene. In fact, a hurricane by that name has the potential to visit every six years because of the naming system employed by the World Meteorological Organization, an agency of the United Nations that gives the storms their monikers.
The last Irene was in August 2005, and according to NASA, "meandered aimlessly around the Atlantic Ocean for over two weeks, but even with her longevity, no reports of damages were associated with Irene." Below is a video image posted on YouTube of that storm's movements:
The 1999 version of Hurricane Irene hit the Bahamas, Cuba and Florida. Although it was considered a relatively weak storm, five people were electrocuted near Fort Lauderdale Fla., as as a result of the storm, and more than a million people in the state were left without power. President Bill Clinton declared an emergency at the time,
The Irene in 1981 did not make landfall in the United States, but bumped around the Atlantic in late September before stopping by France on Oct. 3, as a tropical storm.
In 1971 Hurricane Irene became something of a natural anomaly, being one of only a dozen Atlantic storms recorded to ever cross into the Pacific. That year, Atlantic Hurricane Irene sped westward, dipped south and passed over Nicaragua to enter the Pacific and became a tropical storm called Olivia. 
The Irene of 1959 was just a tropical storm disturbing the edge of the Florida Panhandle.
3:54 P.M. | Storm Kills an 11-Year-Old in Virginia
An 11-year-old boy was killed in Newport News, Va., on Saturday when a tree crashed through the roof a second-story apartment shortly after 12 p.m., emergency officials said.
The boy was in the apartment with his mother when the tree came down, pinning him underneath, according to a spokeswoman for the Newport News Emergency Operations Center. Officials had to call in a crane to lift the tree off of him. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
2:58 P.M. | National Weather Service Issues Update on Irene
At 2 p.m. the National Weather Service's National Hurricane Center issued the following update on the status and location of Hurricane Irene, excerpted in part below:
Irene is moving toward the North-Northeast near 13 miles per hour. A North-Northeastward motion at a slightly faster forward speed is expected during the next day or so. On the forecast track the center of Irene will move across Northeastern North Carolina this afternoon. The Hurricane is forecast to move near or over the Mid-Atlantic coast tonight and move over Southern New England on Sunday. Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 miles per hour with higher gusts.
Slight weakening is forecast as Irene crosses Eastern North Carolina but Irene is forecast to remain at or near hurricane strength as it moves near or over the Mid-Atlantic states and approaches New England.
2:09 P.M. | Storm Kills 3 in North Carolina
Hurricane Irene only made landfall just a few hours ago, but the storm has already killed three people in North Carolina, according to the state's Division of Emergency Management.
The first victim died of a heart attack on Friday while boarding up his home in preparation for the storm. The second victim was driving his car in Pitt County Saturday when it hydroplaned, ran off the shoulder and hit a tree. The third victim, a man in Nash County, stepped outside his home and was hit by a tree limb.
1:38 P.M. | Power Could be Shut for Some Areas, But No Plans Yet
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spoke about possible responses that New York City agencies and utilities may have to the storm at a news conference at the New York Police Department's 60th Precinct in Coney Island on Saturday. "It's conceivable that in Downtown Manhattan, for example, there will be no electricity as well as a lot of water in the streets," the mayor said.
On the City Room blog, my colleague Michael Grynbaum reports on the status of the city's power:
Officials at Consolidated Edison said on Saturday they had no current plans for a pre-emptive shutdown of electrical power in parts of Manhattan. But the utility said its most vulnerable substations on the island, most of which are by the waterline in the Financial District, would be monitored for any severe flooding conditions.
If a shutdown of those substations did become necessary, the affected area would be the southeastern tip of Manhattan, bordered by the Brooklyn Bridge on the north, Broadway on the west and the East River on the south and east, said Chris Olert, a spokesman for Con Ed.
The below map shows the approximate area that would be affected. It was created based on the information provided by Mr. Olert.

Mr. Olert said about 6,400 customers, including some large office buildings and multidwelling apartment houses, might potentially lose power in that scenario.
12:52 P.M. | Hurricane Tracking Map by The New York Times
The New York Times has produced a hurricane tracking map that shows Irene's progress in real time.
12:17 P.M. | No Outstanding Requests for FEMA Assistance To Date
As the storm began to move up the East Coast, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said she knew of no outstanding requests to the federal government for assistance from state or local governments, my colleague Eric Lipton reports from a news conference Saturday morning at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington. 
"None of them have reported any unmet needs right now," Ms. Napolitano said. "But we really are at the beginning of this storm response. We are basically at the end of the preparation phase"
Ms. Napolitano urged people along the path of the storm to heed warnings to evacuate, even though the storm continues to lose some of its intensity.
"Irene remains a large and dangerous storm," she said. "People need to take it seriously. People need to be prepared."
W. Craig Fugate, the FEMA director, said that the heavy rains and possible tornadoes that might accompany Hurricane Irene are not reflected in its Category 1 status, so people in its path should not put down their guard.
"Until we actually get the impacts, we are not going to know how bad areas are getting hit," Mr. Fugate said.
Bill Read, the National Hurricane Center director, said that the storm as of Saturday morning was moving north/northeast at about 15 miles per hour and that he expected to see a storm surge along the coasts of five and nine feet - more than enough to cause severe flooding. He said there could also be as much as 15 inches of rain in North Carolina before the storm clears and five to 10 inches of rain across the Mid Atlantic and into New England, which could cause major flooding and tree damage, even inland, as the ground is already saturated, he said, from recent heavy rains.
11:25 A.M. | Videos of the Storm in Progress Emerge
Dramatic home videos are emerging on social media as the hurricane thunders through the Southeast.
At about 11 a.m. a YouTube user named DaleMutro posted a video of the storm whipping the Ocracoke Lighthousein North Carolina.
CNN has produced a compilation of videos of areas in North Carolina.
11:26 A.M. | Google Maps Irene in a Multitude of Ways
Google's Crisis Response division has created fascinating and functional map tools for tracking Hurricane Irene in multiple ways. 
By clicking boxes to the right of the map on the Crisis Landing Web site users can add or subtract layers of information that are placed over a map of the East Coast like a film of tracing paper. 
A particularly arresting image appears when the button "Cloud Imagery" is clicked. The image produced takes information from the United States Naval Research Laboratory and places it over Google's own map. 
It is also possible to produce a map showing the hurricane's "Uncertainty Cone," which is the area that shows the possible paths the eye of the storm could take.
The most functional of Google's maps shows the Federal Emergency Management Agency's coastal evacuation routes. By zooming in or typing an address in the top left corner of the screen, it is even possible to see the FEMA route designated for individual areas.
Other useful map functions include identifying the locations of American Red Cross emergency shelters, and, as perhaps will be necessary after the storm, local power outages.
10:35 A.M. | No Paywall for Hurricane Coverage
As a public service there will be no paywall on hurricane coverage in The New York Times, on the Web site, or on any mobile apps.
10:27 A.M. | Pets May Ride in Taxis and Buses
Taxis and all buses must take pets as passengers it was announced.
Effective today at 9 a.m. "passengers must be allowed to travel with their household pets and service animals," in taxis according to a release put out by the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
Cats, dogs and all other pets are permitted to ride on vehicles run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Animals are generally permitted on mass transit, but with the exception of service animals, must ride in carriers. For the duration of Hurricane Irene, those rules have been relaxed.
Pets will be allowed on board M.T.A. vehicles. Dogs must be leashed and, if possible, should be muzzled. Cats and other pets should be in carriers.
According to the ASPCA, evacuation centers will be pet-friendly. The organization also has tips on disaster preparedness for pets.
10:09 A.M. | Follow @NYTLive on Twitter for Latest on Irene
The New York Times has created the Twitter account @NYTLive to provide updated information on Hurricane Irene. The account is a complement to the paper's main Twitter account, @NYTimes.
8:57 A.M. | Hurricane Irene Comes Ashore
Reporting from North Carolina, Brian Stelter writes that the eye wall of Hurricane Irene came ashore just east of Cape Lookout shortly after 7 a.m., the first stop in the mainland United States for a storm that is expected to scrape up the East Coast and bring flooding rains to a dozen states.
From Nags Head, Brian writes that "radar images showed that the ragged eye of the storm appeared to reach land during the 7 a.m. hour. It is expected to force a storm surge into the bays and sounds here, inundating low-lying areas. An hour after dawn, the wide beach here in Nags Head had become a wide pool of water as waves began to erode the dunes of the Outer Banks."
And that looks somewhat troublesome for New York. "Some weakening is expected after Irene reaches the coast of North Carolina," the hurricane center said in its update, "but Irene is forecast to remain a hurricane as it moves near or over the mid-Atlantic states and New England."
Updates from Brian can befound here.
8:10 | City Changes Location of 4 Evacuation Sites
As the mandatory evacuations of the low-lying areas of New York continued Saturday morning, city emergency management officials made four changes to the locations of evacuations centers.
According the statement from the New York City Office of Emergency Management, the location changes included:

        
The Evacuation Center marked on the NYC hurricane evacuation zone map as Aqueduct Racetrack, Rockaway Blvd. and 108th Street, Queens, is being replaced by John Adams High School, 101-01 Rockaway Blvd., Ozone Park, 11417.
        
The Evacuation Center marked on the NYC hurricane evacuation zone map as Christ the King H.S. has been moved to Grover Cleveland H.S. Check the zone finder or call 311 for updated information.
        
The Evacuation Center at JHS 57, 125 Stuyvesant Avenue, Brooklyn, is being closed. The center will be moved to PS26, 1010 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn.
        
The Evacuation Center marked in the NYC hurricane evacuation zone map as HS of Graphic Communication Arts, 439 West 49 St., Manhattan, is being replaced by Park West High School, 525 West 50 St., Manhattan.
New York residents who live in the low-lying Zone "A" coastal areas across all five boroughs and the Rockaways are asked to be out of these areas by 5 p.m. Saturday. These areas include: Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, Far Rockaway, Beach Channel, South Beach, Midland Beach, and Battery Park City.
Zone A is clearly outlined in this interactive map posted online by WNYC. Earlier, the city decided to shut down the city's entire subway and bus system at noon on Saturday.

HEADLINE: New Mortgage Limit May Set Buyers Back

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
FOR most potential buyers, the impending change in mortgage limits is just another obscure wrinkle in federal policy. But for some New Yorkers, it could mean the difference between buying and not buying a new home.
On Oct. 1, when the limit on federally guaranteed loans drops to $625,500 from the current level of $729,750, hundreds of buyers in the city and nearby suburbs will either have to come up with larger down payments to stay under the new limit or face the prospect of applying for jumbo loans -- anything above $625,500 -- which have higher interest rates.
For some buyers, neither option will be viable, and they have set Sept. 30 contract deadlines in hopes of closing on their new homes before the change kicks in.
''Across the country this is not a big deal,'' said David Maundrell, the president of aptsandlofts.com, ''but in New York, because our prices are where they are, it's going to be an issue.'' 
The lower limit will primarily affect buyers searching for homes that cost $750,000 to $1 million. In Manhattan, that means one-bedrooms and smaller two-bedrooms. In Brooklyn, it will mainly affect two-bedroom properties.
Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, estimated that the new limit would affect about 7 percent of transactions in Manhattan, which had about 10,000 sales in the past year.
''It's not a catastrophic impact,'' he said. ''But it doesn't help, in a market that's already facing many challenges.''
June Phillips, a senior vice president of Halstead Property, said that throughout the summer ''all my buyers who were looking for a place under $1 million had the jumbo limit in mind, because they knew they'd have to put more money down after Sept. 30.''
Since purchases in New York City, especially co-op purchases, can take as long as two months to close, it is already too late for buyers who are not already in contract to calculate their costs using the higher limit, she said.
In 2008, before the housing and mortgage markets imploded, the national limit for government-insured, or conforming, loans was $417,000. But afterward, to help keep markets moving, the limit was raised to $729,750 in areas with high median home prices, like California, New York and Washington D.C. ''But considering the housing market still needs a push,'' Mr. Maundrell said, ''it's bad timing to lower the limit now.''
For Peggy Leung and her husband, Bill Hanff, timing is so crucial that Ms. Leung has been contacting the developers of their nearly completed East Williamsburg building at least once a week to see how close it is to getting a certificate of occupancy.
The couple cannot close their deal, even though they have their financing lined up, until the building receives its final permits. ''I check so much with them that I'm afraid they're going to stop responding,'' Ms. Leung said. ''But if this doesn't happen, we're going to have to keep renting until I don't know when.''
The two, who now rent an apartment in Gramercy Park with their 18-month-old son, Milo, are in contract to buy a one-bedroom duplex with a recreation room and a yard for $749,000. They qualified for a Federal Housing Administration loan, which allows them to put just 3.5 percent down and borrow $722,000. Their carefully drafted contract permits them to duck out of the deal and get their deposit back if the building does not receive its approvals by Sept. 30.
Their mortgage broker, Ross Weinstein, said he had encouraged them to write the deadline into their contract. Even though there remains a chance that the current limit may be extended, he said, it is not a high priority for Congress right now. And he doesn't think Ms. Leung, who has her own interior design firm, and Mr. Hanff, a Web site designer, would qualify for a jumbo mortgage, which they would need under the lower limit. Most jumbo mortgages, also known as nonconforming mortgages, require at least 20 percent down and a credit score of 720 or more.
Mr. Weinstein, who is the managing partner of Exclusive Capital Consultants, said that given how long it can take to close a deal in New York City, Wells Fargo and other banks stopped operating under the $729,750 mortgage limit on Aug. 15. That means that anyone looking to borrow $700,000, for example, would already be given a jumbo mortgage rate, which is typically about half a point higher than the rate for a conforming mortgage and could cost borrowers an additional several hundred dollars a month.
Chris Siciliano, who with his wife, Doreen, is in contract to buy a house in Katonah, N.Y., said they had not found out about the upcoming limit change until they made an offer a few weeks ago. They had always planned on borrowing less than $729,750, because that would keep the mortgage rate at 4.5 percent, instead of 5.2 percent.
''It's not a crazy difference,'' Mr. Siciliano said, ''but money is money, so we wanted to stay away from that jumbo rate.''
The current owners of the house wanted to set the closing for Sept. 30, but when Mr. Siciliano's mortgage broker told him about the new limit, he insisted that they close before Sept. 23. ''If we're going to be that close to the rate deadline,'' he said, ''we wanted a little cushion to protect ourselves.''
The contract releases them if the seller for some reason pushes the closing beyond Sept. 30.
Mr. Siciliano, who is a creative director at World Wrestling Entertainment, said that if necessary, he and his wife could probably find a way to increase their down payment and borrow less than $625,500, ''but that would really be a stretch for us.''
He also said that because they ''did something very untraditional'' with their last purchase, ''this time we really wanted to do everything by the book and as simple as possible.'' They bought a condo at the height of the market with an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage, and he said that when values dipped and the rate adjusted, ''we were very fortunate to not get underwater the way a lot of other people did.''
Mark Logue, the branch manager of Thoroughbred Mortgage in Rye Brook, N.Y., said that the Oct. 1 change seemed to have prompted more applications for refinancings as well as for new mortgages. ''We typically see things slow down in July and August,'' he said, ''but there's been no downtick on the high-balance loans because people knew that deadline was coming.''
Mr. Logue also said many of the brokers with whom he deals in Westchester were concerned that the lower limit would reduce the pool of potential buyers for certain properties and weaken an already struggling market.
With fewer people qualifying to borrow as much as $729,750, he said, the market for homes priced from $850,000 to $1 million ''could start to see some price reductions,'' because buyers who might have been able to offer $950,000 will now be able to offer only $850,000.

BYLINE: By JON GERTNER

 BODY:
You can drive almost anywhere in the state of Michigan -- pick a point at random and start moving -- and you will soon come upon the wreckage of American industry. If you happen to be driving on the outer edge of Midland, you'll also come upon a cavern of steel beams and ductwork, 400,000 square feet in all. When this plant, which is being constructed by Dow Kokam, a new venture partly owned by Dow Chemical, is up and running early next year, it will produce hundreds of thousands of advanced lithium-ion battery cells for hybrid and electric cars. Just as important, it will provide about 350 jobs in a state with one of the nation's highest unemployment rates.
Over the last two years, the federal government has doled out nearly $2.5 billion in stimulus dollars to roughly 30 companies involved in advanced battery technology. Many of these might seem less like viable businesses than scenery for political photo ops -- places President Obama can repeatedly visit (as he did early this month) to demonstrate his efforts at job creation. But in fact, the battery start-ups are more legitimate, and also more controversial, than that. They represent ''the far edge,'' as one White House official put it, of where the president or Congress might go to create jobs. 
For decades, the federal government has generally resisted throwing its weight --and its money -- behind particular industries. If the market was killing manufacturing jobs, it was pointless to fight it. The government wasn't in the business of picking winners. Many economic theorists have long held that countries inevitably pursue their natural or unique advantages. Some advantages might arise from fertile farmland or gifts of vast mineral resources; others might be rooted in the high education rates of their citizenry. As the former White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers put it, America's role is to feed a global economy that's increasingly based on knowledge and services rather than on making stuff. So even as governments in China and Japan offered aid to industries they deemed important, factories in the United States closed or moved abroad. The conviction in Washington was that manufacturing deserved no special dispensation. Even now, as unemployment ravages the country, so-called industrial policy remains politically toxic. Legislators will not debate it; most will not even speak its name.
By almost any account, the White House has fallen woefully short on job creation during the past two and a half years. But galvanized by the potential double payoff of skilled, blue-collar jobs and a dynamic clean-energy industry -- the administration has tried to buck the tide with lithium-ion batteries. It had to start almost from scratch. In 2009, the U.S. made less than 2 percent of the world's lithium-ion batteries. By 2015, the Department of Energy projects that, thanks mostly to the government's recent largess, the United States will have the capacity to produce 40 percent of them. Whichever country figures out how to lead in the production of lithium-ion batteries will be well positioned to capture ''a large piece of the world's future economic prosperity,'' says Arun Majumdar, the head of the Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). The batteries, he stressed, are essential to the future of the global-transportation business and to a variety of clean-energy industries.
We may marvel at the hardware and software of mobile phones and laptops, but batteries don't get the credit they deserve. Without a lithium-ion battery, your iPad would be a kludge. The new Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf rely on big racks of lithium-ion battery cells to hold their electric charges, and a number of new models -- including those from Ford and Toyota, which use similar battery technology -- are on their way to showrooms within the next 18 months.
This flurry of activity comes against a dismal backdrop. In the last decade, the United States lost some five million manufacturing jobs, a contraction of about one-third. Added to the equally brutal decades that preceded it, this decline left large swaths of the country, the Great Lakes region in particular, without a clear economic future. As I drove through the hollowed-out cities and towns of Michigan earlier this year, it was hard to tell how some of these places could survive. Inside the handful of battery companies that I visited, though, the mood was starkly different. Many companies are working on battery-pack designs for dozens of car models. At the Johnson Controls factory in Holland, Mich., Ray Shemanski, who is in charge of the company's lithium-ion operation, said, ''We have orders that would fill this plant right now.'' Every company I visited not only had plans to get their primary factories running full speed by 2012 or 2013 but also to build or expand others. Jennifer Granholm, Michigan's former governor, has predicted that advanced batteries will create 62,000 jobs over the next decade.
It is tempting to see in this the stirrings of an industrial revolution. These days, confidence is itself a rare and precious fuel, and in Michigan's nascent battery belt, there is no shortage of it. As the country's jobless rate hovers above 9 percent, could this manufacturing revival be part of the answer to the jobs crisis? Or is it merely an expensive government bet on a lost cause?
About 30 minutes northwest of Detroit, just off the Interstate, in Livonia, sits the modern, red brick automotive headquarters of A123 Systems, a beneficiary of about $375 million in federal stimulus funds and matching state grants. A123 provides the cells for a new electric car called the Fisker Karma, as well as various electric bus and truck projects around the world. A123 is also the first large-scale lithium-ion manufacturer whose domestic operations are up and running, though its pedigree is international. Its battery technology was developed at M.I.T., and for the last several years, the company had been making its lithium-ion cells in factories in Korea and China. When I asked Jason Forcier, the head of A123's automotive division, why the company went to Asia to make its products, Forcier said he had no choice. ''That's where the supply base was,'' he said. ''That's where the know-how was -- it was nonexistent in the U.S.''
Repatriating a high-tech manufacturing plant to the United States is not simply a matter of hiring the local talent. It requires good-old foreign know-how. ''We call it 'copy exact,' '' Forcier said. ''We bought a company in Korea that had the technology around this type of battery and had developed the manufacturing process there. We basically brought that here, copied it exactly and scaled it up.'' A123 also brought a team of six Korean engineers to help transfer the technology to the U.S. and sent a team of Americans to Korea to learn.
I heard a similar story at LG Chem Power -- a battery start-up and an American subsidiary of LG Chem, a Korean firm. LG Chem is building a factory in Holland, Mich., to make batteries for the Chevy Volt. Production depends on replicating the company's lithium-ion plants abroad, down to the smallest detail. ''In fact, we're making it like a copy -- cut and pasted from Korea to here,'' Prabhakar Patil, the C.E.O. of LG Chem Power, said.
Neither Forcier nor Patil made any apologies. Each told me that the moves to Michigan provided them with a skilled work force and operating expenses that are largely competitive with factories abroad. (Only 5 to 10 percent of the cost of a battery cell, Patil told me, comes from labor; material accounts for the bulk of expenses.) Each also saw his company's strategy of importing manufacturing technology to the United States as imperative. A state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery plant is as different from an automobile plant as a science lab is from a gymnasium. Cell-making -- the automated administration of thin chemical coatings on the batteries' inner components; the mechanized cutting and folding of metal parts; the workers in sanitary ''bunny suits'' overseeing conveyor belts that move pristine cells through sealed assembly chambers -- is painstakingly precise. A stray hair or a drop of sweat can ruin a lithium-ion cell. ''Don't touch anything,'' Forcier advised me as we began to walk through the factory at A123.
Lithium-ion cells like the ones made at A123 probably don't look like any battery you've ever used. They are stiff, rectangular, metallic-colored envelopes, roughly the dimensions of a thin trade paperback, with two small tabs. Individually, the cells aren't much use for a car; they must be stacked with others in modules or packs. The Chevy Volt, for instance, has a pack of 288 cells, wired together and running down the center of the car. The pack is the most expensive and sophisticated element of the car, much in the way the processor is the most important element of a computer. Everything about the cell pack -- its interior chemistry, its unifying electronics, its cooling systems -- is variable and made to order. ''With G.M., we've been working for two years on their exact requirements for the next-generation Volt,'' Michael Sinkula, a founder of a battery-component company called Envia Systems, explained. ''They say: 'We want it to perform this way. Is that possible?' And then we tell them if it's possible.''
The Volt is just one car, of course -- one whose sales are unremarkable. Still, the global automobile market is so large that even modest gains in market share could spark tremendous growth for battery-makers. ''If you look at the year 2016, and you say, 'Only 5 percent of the market is electrified?' Well, that's a $14 billion market for lithium-ion batteries,'' Forcier says. ''To hit 5 percent is a huge number of vehicles. And the business around making lithium-ion batteries for 5 percent of the world's cars is a huge, huge business.''
In the late '80s, Patil, of LG Chem Power, was working at Ford, trying to build a pure electric-battery vehicle called the ETX and getting nowhere. He was using a more primitivelead-acid battery technology. Automotive engineers tend to use two distinct measures -- power and energy -- to evaluate battery chemistries. Power relates to acceleration; energy relates to how far a car can travel before it needs to be recharged. The ETX wasn't good by either yardstick. ''The car went 0 to 60 in 12 seconds,'' Patil recalls. ''Its range was 60 miles on a good day.'' The lead-acid batteries were so heavy that the cars were nicknamed lead sleds. With a performance and range so inferior to a typical gasoline vehicle, how could you expect a consumer to pay a premium -- what was then about $10,000 -- for it?
Eventually, lead-acid batteries yielded to nickel-metal hydride, which was incorporated into the Toyota Prius and, later, a range of hybrid vehicles. At the same time, a more promising battery chemistry based on lithium -- with far greater potential for both power and energy -- was being developed by various scientists, notably John Goodenough at the University of Texas. Sony was the first company to broadly adapt the lithium technology at its factories in the early 1990s; the company consistently improved the product and began incorporating it into consumer-electronic devices. But automakers couldn't figure out how to cost-effectively adapt the technology. Patil recalls a ''chicken-and-egg problem'' as he tried to build a Ford Escape hybrid in the late 1990s. ''I used to get thrown out of C.E.O.'s' battery offices regularly,'' he said. ''They said: 'Show me the market. Otherwise, leave.' '' Patil knew there could be no market in the United States without significant drops in the batteries' price and significant increases in their performance. But it was a Catch-22. Improvements in price and performance were impossible unless companies became serious about manufacturing.
Federal agencies like the Department of Energy have long financed scientific research -- through university grants, for instance -- on technologies like lithium-ion batteries. But a basic feature of government policy is to allow corporations and entrepreneurs to pick through the results of that research, commercialize the promising ideas and let the market sort things out. In other countries, it often works differently. Governments are more willing to help companies pool information about a new industry or technology and (especially in Korea and China) assist with the early-stagecommercialization of products, including the construction of plants. While Patil was getting booted from executive offices at Ford, companies in Asia, in some cases with a boost from their governments, focused on streamlining the manufacturing process. Battery performance steadily improved, and costs dropped. By the mid-2000s, it was clear that if the lithium-ion battery continued to get better at the same rate, the product might soon be suited for automobiles.
In January 2009, two weeks before Barack Obama's inauguration, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan sent a letter to Obama and his advisers -- Rahm Emanuel, David Axelrod and Lawrence Summers -- about the promise of lithium-ion technology. ''The country or region that controls and dominates the production of batteries will also ultimately control green-vehicle production,'' Levin said in a speech he later gave to the Senate. Levin's efforts effectively laid the groundwork for battery grants to be part of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
''It was a calculated risk -- a lot of money, to be sure, but given the stakes, I think it was a pretty thoughtful bet,'' says Ron Bloom, who recently served as an assistant to President Obama for manufacturing policy. ''If vehicle electrification really does take off, as many, many people think it will, and we're not part of it, then we could lose our leadership of the global automobile industry.'' Which would be catastrophic. By some estimates, as much as 20 percent of all manufacturing jobs are directly or indirectly related to the automobile industry. Bloom points out that the United States is not the only country betting on batteries; a number of Asian countries have done so as well.
On both sides of the world, the fundamental appeal of expanding manufacturing is jobs. It is a curiosity of modern life that information companies can create extraordinary social disruptions and vast shareholder wealth but relatively few jobs. Facebook has about 2,000 employees worldwide. Google has about 29,000. Even in its new, slimmed-down state, General Motors, a decidedly less valuable company, has about 200,000 employees. What's more, that number represents only a fraction of the people behind the production of a G.M. car. ''When you're manufacturing anything, even if the work is done by robots and machines, there's an incredible value chain involved,'' Susan Hockfield, the president of M.I.T., says. ''Manufacturing is simply this huge engine of job creation.'' For batteries, that value chain would include scientists researching improved materials to companies mining ores for metals; contractors building machines for factory work; and designers, engineers and machine operators doing the actual plant work. By some estimates, manufacturing employs about 65 percent of America's scientists and engineers.
Hockfield recently assembled a commission at M.I.T. to investigate the state of American manufacturing and to offer a plan for its future. ''It has been estimated that we need to create 17 to 20 million jobs in the coming decade to recover from the current downturn and meet upcoming job needs,'' she said at a conference this past March. ''It's very hard to imagine where those jobs are going to come from unless we seriously get busy reinventing manufacturing.'' This logic has been endorsed by Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric's C.E.O.; Andy Grove, the former chairman of Intel; and Andrew Liveris, Dow Chemical's C.E.O. A widely circulated 2009 Harvard Business Review article -- ''Restoring American Competitiveness,'' by two Harvard professors, Gary Pisano and Willy Shih -- has become one of the touchstones of the manufacturing debate. In the article, Pisano and Shih maintain that U.S. corporations, by offshoring so much manufacturing work over the past few decades, have eroded our ability to raise living standards and curtailed the development of new high-technology industries.
When I spoke with Pisano, he noted that industries like semiconductor chips -- the heart of computers and consumer electronics -- require the establishment of ''an industrial commons,'' the skills shared by a large, interlocking group of workers at universities and corporations and in government. The commons loses its vitality if crucial parts of it, like factories or materials suppliers, move abroad, as they mostly have in the case of semiconductors. At first the factories leave; the researchers and development engineers soon follow.
The most punishing effect, however, may be the one that can't be measured -- the technologies and jobs that aren't created because the industrial ecosystem is degraded. The semiconductor industry, for example, led to the LED-lighting and solar-panel industries, both of which are mostly based in Asia now. ''The battery is another fascinating example,'' Pisano told me. ''The center of gravity is Asia. But why?'' If you go back to the 1960s, he says, the American consumer-electronics companies decided they were better off in Japan, and then Korea, where costs were lower. ''And then you have to ask: Who had the incentives to make batteries smaller or more powerful or last longer? Not the car industry. The consumer-electronics industry did.'' This explains why the U.S. is now playing catch-up with lithium-ion batteries. It also underscores the vulnerability of an economy with a shrinking manufacturing sector. ''When one industry moves,'' Pisano says, ''there can be other industries in the future that follow it that you couldn't even anticipate.''
Even in the battery industry, there are skeptics. Menahem Anderman, a California-based consultant, says that transforming 10 percent of the world's automobiles into either plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles by 2020 is a pipe dream. His projection is for less than 2 percent. U.S.-based factories, he says, are at a disadvantage. The U.S. industry, he told me, ''was not ready to take in $2 billion from the government and spend it wisely. And so now we will build a lot of plants, and we will create overcapacity, and a lot of the companies will fail.'' He has no ideological objection to federal support, he adds, ''but the status of the technology and the market were incompatible with the desire of the government to create manufacturing jobs.'' For pure electric vehicles in particular, which will likely need an expensive battery replacement within 10 years, Anderman still sees the dilemma Patil faced at Ford in the '90s, when he questioned whether consumers would pay $10,000 more for an inferior car. As Anderman puts it: ''Has there ever been, in the modern history of capitalist countries, a new product for which the mainstream customer paid more for less?''
By his math, gas prices have to reach about $7 a gallon to make plug-in electric-hybrid vehicles attractive to consumers. To create demand for fully electric vehicles, gas prices would have to rise even higher. Which means generous government subsidies for purchases of these vehicles. Currently, Chevy Volt owners receive a tax break that brings the cost of the car down to about $33,500, from $41,000. In Washington, several people told me that unless there is consistent and increasing demand, taxpayers will have helped build an industry to nowhere. This fear is what turned so many politicians and policy makers against industrial policy in the first place. When government-backed ventures fail, taxpayers are left on the hook.
For now, battery makers think they can bring down costs quickly enough to be competitive. Improvements in the manufacturing process -- spreading a better chemical coating on the sensitive elements inside the batteries, for instance, or raising the plant's conveyor belt speed ever so slightly -- will increase quality and efficiency. I also heard talk of start-ups in California working on new cost-effective chemistries. ''We see prices over the next five years coming down 50 percent,'' A123's Forcier told me. ''And it's easy to say that, because we're quoting 2014 business, and we know what the prices are.''
Whether this adds up to American jobs is less clear. The hope is that lithium-ion plants will seed a network of new chemical and equipment providers. To some extent, this has already happened. Some Japanese and Korean companies have set up shop in the United States, and local colleges are offering training courses for aspiring lithium-ion-battery factory workers. But it's a fragile ecology. Job numbers are small relative to the huge plants of Detroit's past. As the former labor secretary Robert Reich pointed out, high-tech manufacturing is increasingly automated. At capacity, the lithium-ion factories in Michigan will each employ between 300 and 400 people. Even the most optimistic forecasts -- enough hybrid- and electric-car demand to necessitate several dozen factories -- suggest the battery industry can't significantly offset declines in American manufacturing.
Which doesn't mean that it's a bad investment. If nothing else, the Obama administration's efforts in Michigan reawaken the conversation about industrial policy. To a large extent, this is an old war among Washington politicians. In the 1970s, it was fought over the federal bailouts of Lockheed and Chrysler -- and a few years later during debates over whether the country needed to assist domestic companies in their efforts to gain ground on the Japanese in the semiconductor industry. By the time George H. W. Bush ascended to the presidency, the move away from industrial policy was clear.
''All you had to do in the 1980s was say, 'That's industrial policy,' and it killed anything it was hurled at,'' says Senator Levin, who along with Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio is now among the most vocal advocates of such a policy. ''It was the kiss of death. And it set us back 10 to 20 years in terms of manufacturing in America.'' What is different now, Levin argues, is that ''our companies are not competing with those companies in Korea and Japan. They're competing with those governments that are supporting them. It's naive to believe that we just have to let the markets work and we'll have a strong manufacturing base in America.'' In his view, the lithium-ion investments are tantamount to repairing a kind of market failure.
The battery executives I spoke to viewed the stimulus money as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. None seemed to think a federal windfall would come their way again. None saw their business endeavors as inherently political or ideological. And none seemed to believe they could survive if they didn't drive battery costs down and demonstrate that they could compete with the best lithium-ion factories abroad. ''My own feeling is this will happen just as the government incentives wear off,'' Patil told me. ''By then it has to become a self-sustaining business, and we actually see a line of sight to get there.''
If the battery stimulus ultimately succeeds, does it demonstrate that expanding the United States' economy only through knowledge and services is no longer a viable strategy? ''All of the great new American companies of the past few decades,'' says Suzanne Berger, a chairwoman of M.I.T.'s panel on the future of American manufacturing, ''have focused on research and development and product definition -- Apple, Qualcomm, Cisco.'' These were technology companies that could take full advantage of what she calls the ''modularity'' of the global economy. Their genius resided in the design of their gadgets and information systems; offshoring the industrial work did not leave them at a disadvantage. It did the opposite, greatly reducing costs and raising profits. ''Now I think we're at a really different moment,'' Berger says. ''We're seeing a wave of new technologies, in energy, biotechnology, batteries, where there has to be a closer integration between research, development, design, product definition and production.''
One challenge to moving in this direction may be that our banks, hedge funds and venture capitalists are geared toward investing in financial instruments and software companies. In such endeavors, even modest investments can yield extraordinarily quick and large returns. Financing brick-and-mortar factories, by contrast, is expensive and painstaking and offers far less potential for speedy returns. Berger maintains that for the economy to get ''full value'' from our laboratories' ideas in energy or biotech -- not just new company headquarters but industrial jobs too -- we must aspire to a different business model than the one we have come to admire.
Which is to say, companies that have a passing resemblance to A123 Systems in Livonia, Mich. Or to use a more familiar example, a business that looks less like Google and more like Ford.

HEADLINE: College: Is It Worth The Cost?

 BODY:
Does our society devote too much time and money to education? In a Room for Debate forum, Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, argues that college is a waste for many. Some comments in response follow. The full debate is at nytimes.com/roomfordebate. 
PETER THIEL Talented, motivated, creative people tend to earn more than their peers throughout life. In today's world, they're also more likely to complete college. Colleges, for obvious reasons, claim that they make all the difference. There's a similar difference in earnings between Brooklynites who work in Manhattan and Brooklynites who work in Brooklyn. Anyone who thinks that crossing the Brooklyn Bridge makes people more productive should think about buying it.
For some people in some careers, some colleges may be worth the price they charge. But millions of other people are paying more than quadruple what their parents paid 25 years ago (plus inflation) for a vague credential, not much knowledge or skills, and a crippling amount of debt.
If you question the economic value of college, the defenders' default answer is that it's priceless. Indeed, learning should be done throughout life, and technology creates more ways to learn every year. Before long, spending four years in a lecture hall with a hangover will be revealed as an antiquated, debt-fueled luxury good.
Five years ago, the establishment was saying: ''Everyone should buy a house. Don't worry about the price. You'll earn it all back later. What could go wrong?'' We know how that ended.
Today, the establishment says: ''Everyone should go to college. Don't worry about the price. You'll earn it all back later.'' What could go wrong?
COMMENT from Bob Prentiss, San Francisco:
Anyone who has watched Jay Leno asking simple questions to college graduates who can't answer them wonders: What were these young people doing in their classrooms? Perhaps the lesson to be learned from it is that education needs to begin at an early age so that the product entering college has the intelligence and will to benefit from it.
COMMENT from Richard, Stateline, Nev.:
We know that a large percentage of high school graduates can't read and understand this newspaper. We know that going to college and just getting a degree won't get you a job that pays well unless you know how to do something useful. The list of what we know that doesn't work is endless. What we need is a list of what works and where to go to learn it.
COMMENT from P. L. Capp, Naches, Wash.:
The liberal arts and sciences college was never designed to become a job training program. The goals were becoming a reasonably literate citizen of the world, achieving some insight into the various issues that make up literate society, and living as a person who had some intelligent understanding of the larger-than-local interests. To lose that emphasis and try to push colleges to become trade schools seems to me to be a misplaced value.

HEADLINE: When Income Is Freelance

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
WITH the job market still soft, many people have turned to contract or freelance work to pay the bills, which increases the challenges involved in qualifying for a home mortgage.
For a time during the credit crunch, ''it became a deal-breaker, and freelancers were not getting any loans,'' said Sara Horowitz, the executive director of the Freelancers Union in Brooklyn, which provides members with health insurance and other benefits. And it remains difficult today, Ms. Horowitz said, describing the loan-approval process as one of the biggest issues confronting independent contractors, along with deadbeat clients and insufficient work.
As Christopher J. Mayer, the Milstein professor of real estate at the Columbia Business School, noted, ''People who don't fit into the regular check-all-the-normal-boxes these days are disproportionately challenged.'' 
In the New York area this year, about 2.4 million people worked as independent contractors, up from 2.07 million in 2005, according to Economic Modeling Specialists, which provides work-force data.
If you earn most of your income on 1099s, brace yourself for extra preparation, paperwork and discussion of your financial picture when applying for a mortgage. Dale Robyn Siegel, a mortgage broker in Harrison, N.Y., and the author of ''The New Rules for Mortgages'' (Alpha, 2009), says independent contractors will need to show that their income is stable and increasing. For some people, that may mean declaring all their income on their tax returns, and not, say, carrying anything over to the next year, even if it means paying more taxes.
Those applying for a mortgage this fall or winter should be prepared to provide backing for year-to-date income. As an example Ms. Siegel cited the case of an independent travel agent with whom she recently worked. She had the agent bring in six months' worth of commission sheets, which were presented to the mortgage originator.
''They look for consistency,'' Ms. Siegel said.
So if you've worked for one client for four years, highlight that. If your spouse or partner has worked for a Fortune 500 company for a decade, put him or her on the application.
''It's especially hard when it's two freelancers, freelancer couples,'' Ms. Horowitz said. ''Bankers are concerned that there won't be steady enough income'' to make the monthly payments.
Here's some other advice for home-buying freelancers:
Pay off other debts, including those on credit cards, Ms. Horowitz says, and build a cash reserve, if possible.
Pinpoint the source of the down payment. If it's a gift from Grandma, take along an account statement that shows it's sitting there awaiting your purchase. If you're borrowing from your 401(k), take those statements along, too.
Prepare for a harder look. Gather tax returns over the last three years. If your income jumped last year, expect to answer questions on why -- and whether it will continue, Ms. Siegel said. Lenders may ask for extra documentation and information. If your income declined last year because you started work on, say, a master's degree, or traveled for three months to South America, volunteer that information.
Seek out local banks and credit unions, which are more likely to take the time to qualify you for a mortgage. ''They're a better bet,'' Mr. Mayer said, especially if they steered clear of the whole subprime mortgage mess. And, Ms. Siegel added, use a lender who understands the ins and outs of your finances and can decipher your tax return.
The National Association of Realtors says about 16 percent of its member Realtors reported home purchase cancellations in June, mostly because of tighter lending requirements. To prevent that, clean up any credit blemishes before beginning the hunt.
''Be ahead of the game and be prepared,'' Ms. Siegel said.

HEADLINE: The Changing Face of the Burning Man Festival

BYLINE: By JESSICA BRUDER

 BODY:
TENS of thousands of volunteers are gathering to build a city in a Nevada desert that is notorious for triple-digit temperatures, high winds and blinding plumes of dust.
Their organizer is a for-profit company that has collected millions in revenue over the last decade, largely because of this donated labor. At a distance, it's easy to wonder: why are these people working so hard -- in the blazing heat, no less -- for a company they don't own?
That's one of the paradoxes of Burning Man, the annual arts festival whose attractions include colossal art installations, all-night dance parties, marathon kite-flying sessions, off-kilter fashion shows, and classes where revelers can learn things that range from Hula Hooping to playing the ukulele to making absinthe.
The short answer is simple: the company behind Burning Man doesn't act like a traditional business. Although it derives its revenue from ticket sales, festivalgoers don't see themselves as customers. Rather, they are Burners, part of a cultural movement governed by 10 principles that include communal effort, self-reliance, gift-giving and fostering a social environment that is ''unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions or advertising.'' 
Tickets for this year's festival, from Monday to Sept. 5, have sold out in advance for the first time. In a situation that doesn't seem to mesh with the principles, some participants have been left at the mercy of scalpers. While many community-minded Burners are selling their spare tickets to one another at face value or even giving them away, eBay vendors have hawked them for more than $800. One prankster asked for a cool $20 million.
How much money has the festival made over the years? Its organizers don't disclose revenue figures on a year-by-year basis. Burners know little about the finances behind the event they work so hard to create, and that bothers some of them.
The company has made expenditures of $102 million over the last 10 years, according a list posted annually on the festival's Web site. These annual reports do not include any money retained or invested by the event from year to year, and Burning Man does not take out any loans, according to its organizers. Last year, the company spent $17.5 million.
It's clear that most of the money collected by the company goes back into financing the festival: paying for land-use fees, fuel, artists' grants, medical services, infrastructure, insurance, wages for a full-time staff of 37, along with eight part-time employees and several hundred seasonal workers. Whether cash is left over each year, and how much, has always been a matter of speculation.
That speculation has intensified as Burning Man prepares to become a nonprofit, a transition that includes an unspecified payout to the company's partners.
Burning Man's origins are decidedly noncommercial. In 1986, a handful of passers-by gathered to watch a landscape gardener named Larry Harvey burn an 8-foot stick figure on San Francisco's Baker Beach. The event became a summer ritual. In 1990 it outgrew the beach; the following year it moved to the desert. After a freewheeling and anarchic period in the mid-'90s, Burning Man changed direction: It started selling tickets, giving rise to a small company to manage it all. Mr. Harvey, 63, is now the executive director of that company, Black Rock City L.L.C.
The annual festival now takes place in Black Rock City, the temporary encampment of more than 50,000 people, built by and for its citizens in the Black Rock Desert, about 120 miles north of Reno. Tickets this year -- the ones that weren't scalped, anyway -- sold for $210 to $360, with the least expensive ones available to the earliest buyers. Unlike most commercial festivals, there's no hired entertainment here. Rather, Burners partake in the cultural equivalent of a potluck supper: everyone is expected to create the meal.
(Disclosure: In addition to writing a book on Burning Man, I have helped a group called the Flaming Lotus Girls install their art pieces at the festival on several occasions.)
Many Burners pour thousands of dollars into elaborate artworks they have been building all year. Strolling through the dusty metropolis, you might encounter a 124-foot-long fire-belching dragon on wheels, a field of robotic, solar-powered sunflowers, or an elaborately filigreed wooden temple.
Burners are expected to arrive with everything they need to survive a week of desert camping, including food, water and shelter. Vending and advertising are forbidden. In a limited concession, coffee and ice are available to buy, but that's it.
Rather than using money, Burners rely on a gift economy, which encourages sharing and free exchange. The metropolis lasts for just a week and culminates over Labor Day weekend with the burning of a 50-foot wooden man. Then the city disappears, scraped from the face of the earth by volunteers who aim to ''leave no trace.''
While the festival is flourishing, its financial structure is changing. Mr. Harvey announced several months ago that he and his partners were planning to liquidate their ownership interests in Burning Man. As part of a three-year plan, the company's six owners plan to cash out their stakes, then hand control of the festival to a new nonprofit called the Burning Man Project, where they will constitute the minority on a 17-member board.
That new group will run the festival, encourage Burning Man-style creativity worldwide and develop urban revitalization projects around the Central Market Street corridor of San Francisco, where the company opened new offices in May. It will also work with existing entities such as Burners Without Borders, a disaster relief group.
''We're going to treat Burning Man like what it always should have been: not as a commodity, but as a gift,'' Mr. Harvey said, explaining the festival's multiyear transition strategy during an April 1 speech in San Francisco. Before handing Burning Man over to the new nonprofit, he added, the company's owners will take an undisclosed payout. And this is where things get complicated. For the past decade, Mr. Harvey has stated on the festival's Web site that if any one of the company's owners decides to leave, ''he or she will receive, as sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000. Their share will then revert back to the group.''
''We have annihilated equity,'' the statement adds. ''Millions of dollars may stream into Burning Man each year, and millions may flow out, but Burning Man is not for sale.'' To bolster this claim, the Web site also includes that statement of the company's annual expenses.
(These financial reports are limited in scope, however, and do not include fine-print details, such as one that Mr. Harvey revealed in a recent interview: Burning Man lost a chunk of its nest egg in the market crash of 2008. ''We won't do that again; we're not going to play the stock market,'' he said ruefully.)
The original $20,000 payout figure, Mr. Harvey concedes, was largely symbolic. ''It was just to make a point that we weren't in it for the money,'' he said in an interview this month. And though the $20,000 figure is written into a formal company agreement, it referred to what individual owners could receive for leaving the partnership. In this case -- with everyone leaving at once and dissolving the company, that provision is moot.
THOUGH the new payout is larger, Mr. Harvey said, it won't make him and his partners rich. And certainly, the partners show little sign of courting a lavish lifestyle. Mr. Harvey, for one, lives in a modest rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco.
''Listen, all of us could probably in the future just live the life of millionaires,'' Mr. Harvey said. ''We'd have money pouring in because of our rights of ownership. We will surrender that,'' he said, referring to the nonprofit plan. He would not, however, give the amount of the owners' payout, though he said a figure had been determined. His colleagues say the amount is unremarkable.
Mr. Harvey said recently that ''Burning Man's not anticapitalist.'' Rather than hewing to the corporate imperative of maximum profit, he said, he'd rather aim for ''profit enough.'' But what does this kind of capitalism look like, anyway?
''I feel like transparency is always the best, and when you move from being very open and transparent about something to being vague, it always seems like the intent is nefarious,'' said Brianna Camarda, a Seattle undergraduate student in creative writing and member of a Burning Man camp that for many years built a colossal space-age funhouse in the desert.
''Especially when you see the economy tanking on a worldwide scale, it seems very self-serving,'' she added. ''You say you're a counterculture organization, but then you're funding your retirement on the backs of attendees.''
Some Burners believe their participation entitles them to an active role in governance. ''I think that your ticket buys a little piece of the rock when you go,'' said Bill Keller, 46, of San Francisco, who went to his first festival in 1996. ''I believe your wanting to be there and paying to be there gives you some modicum of ownership, like a credit union.''
Others disagree; they think Mr. Harvey is entitled to run Burning Man's financial matters with a bit of privacy. ''I don't care if he takes a quarter of a million. If it's there, let him take it. There's people who make $2 million a year and work for DuPont and all they do is pollute the planet,'' said Helen O'Neill of Ventura, Calif. On matters of liquidation, she said: ''It's his baby and that's his prerogative.''
Many Burners' opinions fall somewhere in the middle. ''I'm a capitalist at heart,'' said Sven Liden, an entrepreneur from Seattle who started traveling to the festival in 1999. ''I believe in the free-enterprise system. But when you go to Burning Man, it's different from the state fair, where even the juggler has his hat out. The lack of commerce gives it this almost outer-worldly kind of feel.''
''I would applaud Larry Harvey for going to a nonprofit, because it will in the future take the money motivation out of the equation, but I think there probably should be some transparency even on the for-profit side,'' Mr. Liden said. ''Trust is a foundation for any kind of organization, and transparency is a key to trust.''
MARIAN GOODELL, one of the six owners of the company behind Burning Man, and its director of business and communications, addressed Burners' concerns over transparency in an interview this month. ''I'm a big fan of more information. I'm the Mistress of Communications,'' she said, referring to her informal job title.
Asked about the payout, she said, ''When you're in the middle of a storm, if you're going to explain all of how you got there, and how you're going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness.'' (In her analogy, that storm is the transition to nonprofit status.)
As the debates simmer on, Burning Man's owners are negotiating with the federal Bureau of Land Management for a permit that could allow the event to grow to 70,000 people by 2016. As it continues to expand, fresh fault lines will inevitably emerge; Burners are an opinionated lot. Newcomers will arrive to work and revel in the desert for the first time; some old-timers will depart to explore other countercultural pastures.
But even outside of Burning Man's regional network -- a group of local, Burning Man-affiliated groups in cities on five continents -- independent Burners are already taking matters into their own hands. Rather than attend Burning Man this year, Ms. Camarda, the Seattle student, is planning a small, ritualized gathering with Burner friends at a rented cabin on the Oregon coast. In New York City, Burners who missed out on buying tickets are planning a Saturday get-together in Central Park.
And one anonymous fellow, a Bay Area resident calling himself Guy Fawkes, started issuing calls on Facebook and Craigslist this month for ticketless Burners to join a parallel event, the Smoke Creek Gathering, at the Squaw Valley Reservoir, a short drive from Burning Man.
''I would have used the Black Rock Desert, but a massive corporate event is already being held there,'' he said in a phone interview. He declined to be identified, citing fear of harassment. Officials from the Bureau of Land Management, he added, have already e-mailed him a warning against holding a large event without a permit; he replied with a message invoking freedom of assembly.
''We're not a corporation,'' he said. ''Our goal is simply to get people to come out and fend for themselves.''

HEADLINE: Oh, to Be Warm In Summer's Heat

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Elisabeth Rosenthal is an environment reporter for The New York Times.
AS I got off the plane last week at Narita International Airport, bundled in a sweatshirt to fend off the onboard cold, I ran into a jarring wall of warm, moist air.
Tokyo's airport is a bit hotter and dimmer than usual these days, part of Japan's continuing forced experiment in energy conservation. after the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear reactor, Japan lost much of its power supply. As signs around the airport explained, to prevent blackouts, businesses and government offices were asked to decrease electricity consumption by 15 percent.
Airports, we know, are customarily cool, dry and bright. But after shedding my sweatshirt, my spirits were buoyed: Narita Airport seemed, well, climate-appropriate, nice even. It was around 80 degrees, with a touch of humidity. It was August after all. 
Why are airports, shops, offices and homes in the United States and elsewhere chilled to sweater-weather temperatures in summer when the temperature outside rises? ''Everyone asks the question, but no one has a good answer,'' said Fergus Nicol, a cooling expert and professor emeritus of architecture at London Metropolitan University. ''I think it's because air-conditioners are supposed to produce cool, so it has become an expectation.'' Maybe, he said, there's also a bit of ''conspicuous consumption.''
Many energy experts recommend setting thermostats at 78 degrees in summer, to conserve energy and to combat rising greenhouse gas emissions. The exact energy savings depends on numerous factors, including the type of air-conditioning and the temperature outside. But turning up the programmable thermostat of a central air-conditioning system 1 degree can yield a 6 percent savings in energy used for cooling, according to the United States Energy Star program.
Still, few homes or buildings in the developed world seem to follow such impulses. Instead, they set summer thermostats in the low 70s or even the high 60s.
On my recent 10 days in steamy Asia, I shivered more often than not. My Hong Kong hotel -- a budget chain -- set room thermostats to 18 degrees centigrade for new arrivals, or 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Air-conditioners seemed to blast in every small shop -- not just fruit stands (where vendors worry about spoilage) but also jewelry and electronics stores. Their front doors were often wide open, spewing out cold air, as if to advertise their triumph over the 100-plus-degree weather.
In Manhattan, I arrive at the office, movie theaters and stores armed with a sweater. In Denver, public buildings were so chilly that government officials turned up the thermostats when they realized that sales of space heaters were peaking in summer, said Alan Hedge a professor in the Department of Design and Environmental Analysis at Cornell University.
The expectation is January in July. ''In the United States there is a strong marketing emphasis on cold,'' said Professor Hedge. ''When you get a soda it's chock full of ice. We serve beer chilled. We make a virtue of freezing things.''
How did we get here? In the 1970s scientists put volunteers in small cabins called climate chambers for several hours to determine the temperature that maximized ''thermal comfort.'' ''Most of that research was done in a very artificial environment,'' Professor Hedge said. He added that more recent scientific work suggested that ''comfort'' did not derive from a simple constant optimal inside temperature, but depended on many factors, including recent weather (it's easier to tolerate warmer indoor temperatures when it's hot outside), typical clothing worn and personal expectations.
''In summer, you can afford to raise temperatures to 74, 76 or even 80 if you're controlling humidity,'' he said. ''It will be fine. And you're saving a lot of energy.''
Alan Meier, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said there was debate about whether people could acclimate to a new ''comfort regime.'' He noted that, just as in lighting, the attitude was ''the more the better.'' But lighting designers backed off that predilection; he said the same trend might follow in cooling.
Ultra-cold may have been a desirable temperature for movie theaters decades ago when people saw films in part to escape the summer's heat. But is it desirable now, when nearly 90 percent of Americans have cooling at home?
A few countries and companies have tentatively tried to push back against over-cooling. For the last few years, the Italian energy giant Eni has turned up the thermostat ever so slightly in its Rome and Milan offices, calculating that a rise of 1 degree Celsius saves as much energy as that expended by 140 workers commuting by car for a year. In exchange, workers are allowed to wear lighter, casual clothes rather than suits.
Starting in 2005, the Japan's Cool Biz initiative asked government buildings to turn summer thermostats up to just over 80 degrees -- and also allowed cooler casual dress. In 2006 alone, the government calculated that it had saved in carbon emissions the same amount that 2.5 million homes emitted in a typical month. After Fukushima, the Cool Biz concept was vastly expanded and promoted for other types of buildings.
Of course, sometimes letting buildings warm up is not easy. In a building designed for air-conditioning, blowers are sometimes hard to turn down without compromising air quality, and windows often can't be opened to adjust temperature. That is a pity, Dr. Nicol said, because most places have days where the outdoor temperature is fine.
Air-conditioning can also be a lifesaver for the very young and the elderly, and has allowed economic development in the tropics, particularly in cities. You can't get much done in 110-degree heat.
But uncomfortable coolness isn't always productive, either. Professor Hedge found that workers did better at warmer temperatures. At 66 degrees, workers typed 54 percent of the allotted time, with a 25 percent error rate. When the temperature was raised to 77 degrees, workers typed 100 percent of the time with only a 10 percent error rate.
As more people in more countries come to rely on air-conditioning, the idea of thermal comfort may need to be rethought to curb the growth in greenhouse gas emissions. Ten years ago, when I lived in Beijing, air-conditioning was a rare luxury. On a visit there this month, I saw air-conditioners blasting even in rural restaurants. If hundreds of millions people in China and India expect to be cooled to our frigid standard of 71.6 degrees all the time, the environmental impact might be far less comfortable.

HEADLINE: The Fall This Summer

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
DID insects hire a new publicist for the summer of 2011? Or have I scrambled the question, and should I be asking if they lost the publicist who had shielded them until now?
Either way, seemingly everywhere I turned, I was being told to eat them. An article in the New Yorker floated the notion, framed as easy on the budget and good for the overstressed environment. So did a piece in the newspaper you're reading now. Before this odd, disquieting season, cicada banana bread wasn't in my vocabulary. Time magazine put it there with a story dated, fittingly, the very first day of summer.
I begin with bugs partly because some levity is in order, given the gloom to come. But more than that, mealworm pilaf as an answer to our dwindling resources strikes me as a reasonably apt metaphor for these last few months. It suggests a decline in our lots, a reckoning with our limits, a grasping for solutions and a humility in the absence of truly palatable ones. And that's what the summer of 2011 has been all about. 
A ''ceiling'' defined the season, and there was no skylight in this one, no sunshine filtering through. ''Down'' was the dominant syllable, a suffix and prefix both. On the second day of summer President Obama assured us there would be a ''drawdown'' of troops in Afghanistan, because we could no longer afford our onetime degree of intervention and needed to be ''as pragmatic as we are passionate.''
Economists talked ceaselessly of the ''downturn,'' so prolonged that it has come to seem less a dip than the new normal. Then of course there was the ''downgrade,'' courtesy of Standard & Poor's, which rewarded our galling political constipation with an unprecedented demotion to AA+ from AAA. We could mock the inept arithmetic en route to it. We could quibble with the reasoning and motivations behind it. But none of that changed the symbolism -- or the symbol. We were one vowel shy of what we used to be.
And we were under siege, by not just the economy but also the elements. Extraordinary flooding gave way to severe drought. The earth trembled where it wasn't supposed to. And then, to top it all off, a hurricane drew near, screaming toward some of the country's densest population centers and threatening a magnitude of damage we were hard pressed to afford. Nature hammered home the message that the Dow was sending as well. We had only so much control over our fates, and better hunker down.
Some perspective: weather is weather and storms are storms, not the galloping horsemen of the apocalypse, as the half-in-jest hysteria in cyberspace would have us believe. (I tripped across one Twitter message prophesying the revelation of Bear Mountain, just 50 or so miles north of Manhattan, as an active volcano.) And America, for all its troubles, remains by far the wealthiest nation in the world, its G.D.P. more than twice that of China, our nearest competitor. In many of our cities you can look in many directions and not see much evidence of hardship, but rather restaurants and hotels, stadiums and parking lots, airport terminals and movie theaters full to the brim.
Still, this summer crystallized a growing sense that our country's can-do spirit was being replaced by a make-do resignation, and that our best days might well be behind us. I kept finding myself in the same conversation, over and over, and only occasionally was I the one to initiate it. It concerned whether children in America today were likely to enjoy lives as privileged as their parents'.
The usual conclusion -- that they weren't -- represented an unsettling erosion of American confidence and a pivot in the nation's psyche from a swaggering optimism to something more subdued. It wasn't pessimism, not just yet. But it recognized real parameters around our will and wherewithal.
We watched Europe's debt nightmare and waited, somewhat helplessly, to see if it would exacerbate our own. We watched the Syrian insurrection and waited, somewhat meekly, to see if we'd have to weigh in. We lent a hand of sorts in Libya, helping to effect the outcome we wanted, but we were ''leading from behind,'' as one of the president's advisers so memorably put it. Leading from behind? What a concept, and what a perfect expression of America's conflicted, befuddled new role in the world: still wanting to feel exceptional, less and less able to act that way.
The numbers were awful. The numbers are awful. Just last week the Congressional Budget Office predicted that unemployment would stay above 8 percent until at least 2014. It has been almost consistently above 9 percent for more than two years now. The budget office also projected a $1.3 trillion budget deficit for 2011 and a growth in G.D.P. of just 2.3 percent.
That's a pittance in comparison with growth in Brazil, Russia, India or China, known in aggregate as BRIC. I mention the acronym because I heard it constantly this summer. ''The BRIC countries are coming on strong.'' ''You should invest in one of the BRIC indexes.'' There was a fascination with economies that were surging because ours so emphatically wasn't, and they were a rebuke to it. America the sluggish. America the envious.
America the broken. A bipartisan group called Building America's Future released a report this summer, ''Falling Apart and Falling Behind,'' that presented a staggering compendium of our transportation woes. It also noted that between 2005 and 2010, the country plummeted from No. 1 to No. 15 in the world in terms of the economic competitiveness of our infrastructure.
So are we hastening to catch up? Hardly.
''The biggest crime in the stimulus package was that infrastructure money should have been tripled or quadrupled,'' former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, one of the leaders of Building America's Future, told me during a recent telephone conversation. He was reflecting on the two-year period, before the 2010 midterm elections, when the president had both the political capital and Congressional calculus for real action, and he sounded depressed.
''We should be talking about high-speed rail in the Northeast corridor and along the California coastline,'' said Mr. Rendell, a Democrat. ''We should be talking about big things.''
Instead we import big things from China, which this summer shipped the last of the enormous steel modules for the new San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, to be assembled in America, though it wasn't manufactured here.
What do we make? Movies, but this summer the major ones were more bereft of originality than ever, a sadly familiar crop of sorcerers, sequels, Smurfs and superheroes. And the superheroes were foreign or second-rate. Thor? The Green Lantern? Where are Batman, Superman and Spidey when the economy is in free fall, the president needs an emergency gumption infusion (and maybe spinal replacement surgery) and Grover Norquist must be vanquished? Don't say Broadway. Its ''Spider-Man'' couldn't even hold his own against theater critics.
Examples and allegories of diminishment were absurdly, comically pervasive. In the wake of the quake, the Washington Monument was cracked. A cash-strapped school district in Pennsylvania was saving $15,000 a year by entrusting the landscaping to livestock. (''Nothing says '21st century global superpower,' '' wrote Rachel Maddow in a Twitter message, ''like schools turning to sheep'' because they can't afford lawnmowers.)
Restrooms off the Coney Island boardwalk in New York were rationing squares of toilet paper, or so the New York Post insisted. And according to posters in the subways, a former producer of the television series ''Sex and the City,'' a paean to conspicuous consumption, was about to unveil a new show. It's called ''2 Broke Girls.''
Bill Clinton, once the very embodiment of raging appetite and expansive id, was chatting about his restrained, vegan diet. And Steve Jobs, who personified American entrepreneurial genius as well as anyone else in the last quarter century, was saying goodbye. More than a few scribes characterized his surrender of the reins at Apple as the end of an era.
His stewardship of that company and Clinton's of the country overlapped in the late 1990s, when our economy soared and we actually had a budget surplus. Remember that? It wasn't so long ago. But this summer, it seemed like ancient history.

HEADLINE: Why Washington Really Likes Itself

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Catherine Rampell is an economics reporter for The New York Times.
IF it sometimes seems as if Washington exists in a totally different economic universe from the rest of us, rest assured: it does. According to Gallup, the District of Columbia is the most economically optimistic part of the country.
Every day, the polling organization surveys Americans of all income levels about whether they think current economic conditions are good, and whether the economy is getting better. The results of these two questions make up Gallup's Economic Confidence Index. 
The latest index report shows that the District of Columbia is far more confident in the economy than any state, by a long shot. In every state, most residents think the economy is getting worse; in the nation's capital, fully 60 percent think the economy is getting better.
And yet the District of Columbia also has an unemployment rate above the nation's -- 10.8 percent, compared with 9.1 percent -- and persistent ills like crime and poverty.
''If ever there were a place where people not only tend not to face economic facts, but it's almost their purpose not to face economic facts, it's Washington,'' said P. J. O'Rourke, a contributing editor at The Weekly Standard and a political satirist.
What's going on? How can an economy ravaged by double-digit joblessness be so Pollyannaish?
First, note that Gallup's economic confidence poll surveyed only those who are employed, and the employed are going to have a sunnier outlook than the unemployed. Yet that positive bias would be true in every state Gallup surveys, and the capital still has a much rosier outlook.
Maybe that's because Washington is richer, on the whole, than any American state: it has a per-capita income of $71,011, compared with the national average of $40,584, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. And the geysering income streams that support Washingtonians are reliable in good times and bad.
''There are a lot of occupations here that tend to be pretty high-paid that are kind of recession proof,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization in Washington, and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The city's economy is built not only on government employees, but also on defense contractors, nongovernmental organizations and research institutions that get federal money. Unlike just about any other earnings source, federal funds have continued to flow freely through recession and recovery.
What's more, the government is moving ahead with major overhauls of financial regulation and health care, and Congress has its sights on taxes and spending, as illustrated by the debt-ceiling battle. All these targets have attracted major industrial stakeholders, injecting billions into the Washington lobbying industry.
''Let's say you have a whole new department of financial consumer affairs,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''That means a huge growth in the corresponding lobbying industry. If you're a credit card company and you don't have a lobbyist there, you've got to be suicidal.''
In turn, these factors have helped prop up the housing market, unlike elsewhere in the country where foreclosure rates seem as high as pessimism.
According to the government's housing price index, the worth of homes nationwide fell 2 percent last quarter. In Washington, they grew 2 percent. Zillow, a company that tracks real estate data, says three of every thousand homes in Washington are in foreclosure, less than a third the rate for the nation.
There is, of course, a large subset of Washingtonians who are not flush with federal largesse, as indicated by the high jobless rate.
Washington has one of the nation's highest poverty rates, with 18.4 percent of residents living below the poverty line, a rate exceeded by only three states in 2009, the most recent year for which data are available.
Washington also has the highest income inequality in the country, according to the Census Bureau. For decades there has been a sharp divide between the haves and the have-nots in Washington. Northwest Washington is mostly white and wealthy; the other sections are largely black and poor.
''I do think that the views of politicians, specifically, are warped by their social networks and backgrounds,'' said Larry M. Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University and author of ''Unequal Democracy.''
Perhaps this enduring divide explains a complacency among the better-off toward how others live. To the extent that those in Washington who are suffering from economic downturn are the same people who are normally suffering during boom times, the heightened pain may not be that noticeable. ''There are high and deep pockets of poverty in Washington, but they've been here for a while,'' Mr. Bernstein said.
Longtime Washingtonians may also have become inured to the cries that the national economy is teetering on the edge of the abyss. There are, after all, myriad politicians and pundits who have built entire careers on proclamations that the sky is falling.
''There are so many people who have had some connection to government, or been around this process for so long, that they're a little more jaded about whether this is worse than it's ever been,'' said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a longtime policy adviser and operative. ''Although now there are reasons to think it actually is.''
At any rate, with all the talk of deficit reduction in Washington lately, there is reason to think that the local economic outlook may soon fall in line with the rest of the real world.

GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: 61 Square Miles of Optimism: Every day a Gallup poll asks Americans across the country about whether they think current economic conditions are good (or ''excellent,'' ''only fair'' or ''poor''), and whether the economy is getting better or worse. For both questions, Gallup subtracts the percentage of people answering negatively from the percentage of people answering positively. Then the two results are averaged to come up with a value that Gallup calls its Economic Confidence Index. If the index value is above zero -- the result only in the District of Columbia -- that means that people are generally confident about the economy. If the index value is below zero, then people are more pessimistic about the economy. (Source: Gallup)

HEADLINE: Chicano Pioneers

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
LATE one December night in 1972, three members of an art collective here clambered out of a battered green Volkswagen bug and spray-painted their names -- ''Herron, Gamboa, Gronkie'' -- on a footbridge of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, appropriating the entire museum as their own work of art simply by signing it.
The next morning Harry Gamboa Jr. returned with the fourth member of the group, Patssi Valdez, and immortalized the act with a glam shot of her posing in tight pants and a red top near the signatures, looking away coolly and seductively like Anna Karina in a Godard movie. 
The stunt by the collective known as Asco exhibited all the hallmarks of the group's outrageous style: angry, illicit, deftly and economically conceptual, and shot through with the high camp of Hollywood, whose sign they could see in the distance from the streets of East Los Angeles. The act was also pretty much noticed by no one except the four members themselves, who were always their own best audience. The paint was whitewashed before day's end; the Los Angeles art world went on its way, paying little attention to a group of artists whose street performances and other unclassifiable productions were as compelling as practically anything bubbling up out of the urban dereliction of SoHo or other parts of Los Angeles during those years.
Almost four decades later, the same museum the collective defaced because its doors weren't open to artists of their kind -- Mexican-American, working class and poor, highly irreverent and politicized -- is not just finally welcoming them inside but rolling out a red carpet for the occasion. ''Asco: Elite of the Obscure, a Retrospective, 1972-1987,'' the first survey of the group's work, opens Sept. 4 as one of the Los Angeles County Museum's main offerings for the sprawling Pacific Standard Time event, more than 60 collaborative shows opening throughout Southern California in the late summer and fall to tell the story of postwar Los Angeles art.
The Asco exhibition -- organized with the Williams College Museum of Art in Williamstown, Mass. -- has been almost a decade in the making. And its goal is nothing less than to rewrite part of that story and the broader history of urban art in the 1970s to give the collective its rightful place among the pioneers of its era. ''It's a show that's phenomenally overdue,'' said C. Ondine Chavoya, an associate professor of art at Williams College and one of the exhibition's curators. ''I felt it was overdue at the very moment I learned about Asco's work many years ago. And now coming as it does as part of Pacific Standard Time means that it's not going to be isolated or singular. It's going to tie them in, finally, to a much larger history.''
The show is only one of several Pacific Standard Time shows delving into the history of Chicano art in the 1960s and '70s, whose attitude and look seeped into mainstream art in ways only now being recognized. But the story of Asco lies even deeper, one of a subculture within a subculture, a group of artists fueled not just by their marginal existence within their city and country but by their alienation from the Chicano art movement as well.
The members were, as Mr. Gamboa has described it, ''self-imposed exiles'' who felt the best way to exercise artistic freedom and express solidarity with the Mexican-American cause was, paradoxically, to run screaming from most Mexican-American art at the time, or at least from its political strictures and the stereotypes imposed on it by mainstream culture.
Asco's method was a kind of bombastic excess and elegant elusiveness that would have made Tristan Tzara proud, not to mention Cantinflas and Liberace. The Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight wrote that the group ''brought Zurich Dada of the late-1910s to 1970s Los Angeles.'' But it was a distinctly Chicano brand of Dada, by way of David Bowie and Frank Zappa, drag and Pachuco culture, telenovelas and oddball UHF television stations, and New Wave and silent movies.
''Part of the art was just the idea that you would try to draw attention to yourself the way we did at a time when everyone around us was existing in despair,'' Mr. Gamboa said in a recent interview, speaking of the guerrilla escapades of the group, whose members went their separate ways in 1987 and now barely speak to one another as the spotlight has reunited them.
In a 1997 interview with the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art, one of the group's founders, the artist who calls himself Gronk (though at times also Groak and Grunk) described the collective as ''just a rumor to a lot of people for the longest time'' and ''sort of thought of as drug addicts, perverts.''
''All kinds of names were hurled at us by other Chicano artists,'' he said.
The collective's chosen name, Asco, set the outre tone -- it means disgust or nausea in Spanish and also evokes a sinister corporation or a mockery of the acronyms of the social-service organizations then proliferating in poor neighborhoods as a legacy of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. But the foursome's unpredictable street theater and prodigious image-making beginning in the early '70s -- fake publicity shots and film stills, Super-8 movies, mail-art fliers -- made clear that they were not simply trying to express their disgust with racism, police harassment and the Vietnam War but also using revulsion as a raw material and spreading a fair amount of it around.
Their first performance, ''Stations of the Cross,'' staged during the Christmas holidays in 1972 before the group had gelled or chosen its name, involved Mr. Gamboa, Gronk and Willie Herron, another of the group's founders, mocking both Mexican Catholic holiday traditions and the look of classic Mexican murals. The three dressed up as macabre pilgrims and unsettled shoppers along Whittier Boulevard, East Los Angeles's central artery, trudging along with a huge cross made from cardboard, which they eventually dumped in front of a Marine Corps recruiting station; then they ran away.
Several years before Cindy Sherman started photographing herself as the protagonist in nonexistent movies to strip-mine the mechanisms of America's image-making, Asco began an extensive body of work called ''No Movies,'' in which the members dressed up and photographed wildly cinematic scenes -- one of the funniest and most memorable was called ''The Gores,'' a sort of Mansonesque horror movie inspired by pop singer Leslie Gore -- late at night on the Los Angeles streets. The images from these never-to-be movies were then mailed out widely like publicity materials, a project that, as the film scholar David E. James notes in the show's catalog, articulated deeply ''both the affection and the anger, the desire and the hatred'' the collective's members had for the movies, in which people who looked like them were almost never seen.
Asco's founders, now all in their late 50s, met at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, which also produced the members of the band Los Lobos and became known later for the work of the teacher Jaime Escalante, of ''Stand and Deliver'' fame.
While Gronk was Asco's only gay member, an androgynous sensibility pervaded the group -- in its photographs, its performances and particularly its look, with lots of shaved eyebrows and Theda Bara makeup.
In many of their no-budget, experimental antics, the group's chief worry was almost never the conventional one for artists -- Will anyone pay attention to us? -- but whether the attention they got would get them arrested or attacked or worse.
''I always felt like a bullfighter in many ways,'' Mr. Gamboa said in a recent interview over lunch with Mr. Herron at the Los Angeles County Museum, only a hundred yards from the spot where they once spray-painted their names. ''The art was to walk away unscathed but to have touched the danger.''
And the danger was often very real. In one of the group's pieces, ''Decoy Gang War Victim,'' from 1974, Asco members went at night to neighborhoods marred by gang violence and created fake crime scenes, in which Gronk would play a young corpse on the pavement, surrounded by police flares. The scene would be photographed and the pictures would be sent to newspapers and television stations, as a way to sow confusion both in the news media -- which Asco saw as inciting and perpetuating gang violence -- and maybe even among the gangs themselves, to prevent more violence.
The performance recalls one from 1972 by a fellow Angeleno and recent M.F.A. graduate, Chris Burden, ''Deadman,'' in which he placed himself under a tarp surrounded by flares on a busy city street, where cars swerved to avoid him.
Asco's ideas sprang less from the kind of Conceptual explorations of performance and body art then pouring out of graduate art programs and more from their experience on the streets transformed by media-saturated urban savvy, what Gronk called an ''aesthetics of poverty.''
But the methods and results were often strikingly similar to those of more established artists.
''What we've been up against is the idea, I think, that these are just regional artists or that they mattered only within the context of a certain time in L.A.,'' said Rita Gonzalez, the show's curator along with Mr. Chavoya. ''They never achieved the market success of a lot of their peers or the esteem within academia.''
Part of this was by design, of course, growing out of a deep ambivalence about the establishment's embrace. The group's founders have since gone on to individual careers -- Ms. Valdez is a painter; Mr. Gamboa teaches at the California Institute of the Arts and remains an active artist; Mr. Herron is a painter and founder of the punk band Los Illegals; Gronk is a successful artist and stage designer, collaborating most recently with Peter Sellars.
But all, to varying degrees, have sought success only on their own terms. As Mr. Gamboa once told a Smithsonian interviewer, with wonderful Seinfeldian skepticism: ''I look at that carrot and it looks a little spoiled to me. I'm not exactly allergic to carrots, but the way it's dangling -- it just -- it doesn't look right. It should be at least on a plate.''
Even now that the Los Angeles County Museum is delivering the carrot on what is arguably a pretty nice plate -- a show of photographs, films and artworks that will take up half a floor of the Broad Contemporary wing, accompanied by a hefty catalog -- not all are so sure they're happy. ''The big surprise of the show is that we're all going to be in it, too, stuffed,'' said Mr. Herron, who wears a safety-pin earring and a pair of jet-black shades that never leave his face.
Like many struggling young bands that basically grew up together, Asco -- which expanded in the 1980s to include a large number of new members and collaborators -- eventually imploded, the result of longstanding rivalries and grudges among its founders, which linger today.
''We all defied Newton,'' Mr. Gamboa said by way of explanation. ''For every action, there was a completely disproportionate reaction.''
But the end result was not exactly a surprise for a group that usually operated at white-hot intensity, he said, adding that he had no idea whether the retrospective would ultimately result in the recognition he and his former collaborators deserved or whether, true to Asco's nature, the collective would always be more a legend than a fact.
''Who knows?'' he said. ''That's the way L.A. is, too. It's a desert with mirages. A thing happens and then, poof, it's gone.''

HEADLINE: Just the Two of Us, When One Toddles

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAUMGARDNER. 
Jennifer Baumgardner lives in New York. This essay is excerpted from her most recent book.

 BODY:
SEVERAL years ago, when my son Skuli was about 3, the two of us flew back to New York City early from visiting relatives in the Midwest so I could attend a big bash for my friends Jenny and Sara Jane, who were celebrating five years together.
It was a blazing hot July afternoon when we arrived at Kennedy Airport after a long, bumpy flight. I threw our bags in Skuli's Sit 'n' Stroll, which I used like a wheelbarrow when I traveled with him, and slogged out to the long-term parking lot with Skuli on my hip. Our car, a 17-year-old red Honda Civic, shimmered in the heat.
''This isn't good,'' I thought. One of the many quirks of my vehicle was that it wouldn't start when parked in direct sunlight. I fastened Skuli's car seat into the cauldron of the backseat and turned the key, praying it would start. Nothing. I waited two minutes. Still nothing.
''We should call someone to help us,'' Skuli offered. He was good at intuiting our next step. 
I called, and soon a young guy arrived in a tow truck offering to jump our battery. ''It's not the battery,'' I said. ''This car doesn't start in heat. I have to wait until sundown.''
''It's the battery, ma'am,'' he said. After 10 minutes of fruitless jumping, he offered to drive us to the nearest garage. Feeling a familiar financial panic, I mentally calculated the mounting cost of this crisis and wondered if feting Jenny and Sara Jane's relationship was worth the expense. I decided it was. We got home in time for me to shower and change, drop Skuli at his father's (where he spent occasional time) and head to the party.
On a Brooklyn rooftop that night, drinking restoratively, I met Sara Jane's mother. A onetime single mother herself, she asked me why I wasn't dating and prodded me for stories about my life. After each story, she would shake her head and say: ''Be selfish, Jen. You've got to be selfish.''
I was used to unsolicited advice and offers of help. The help I often and gratefully accepted, like an invite for Sunday dinner or the used baby equipment my friends were always finding for me. Often, though, I sensed not so much helpfulness as pity. ''It must be so hard,'' these friends said, flattening me into a stereotype.
And it was hard. I woke up in the night worried about bills, anxious that I'd have someone to look after Skuli while I was working. I took him to parties not because he loved hanging out at adults' houses at 11:30 p.m., but because it was that or I'd never socialize. But I was happy. I'd never felt so much love and independence at once.
Back at the party, I attempted to respond to Sara Jane's mother. As a single mother, I didn't think I was selfish as much as self-full. I had to rely on myself more than ever, and yet my life was rich with friends: Christine dropping by on the way home from work because she knew my door was always open; saying ''yes'' to spontaneous invitations to the Bronx Zoo because Skuli and I didn't have to negotiate anyone else's schedule; sleepovers at Gillian's because we only needed one bed.
It seemed to me that two-parent families often had homes that were more closed because they were less reliant on others, whereas my friends and family showed up for me all of the time. My younger sister, Jessica, a happily married mother, marveled at how much help from friends and family I marshaled.
''I guess I'm not afraid to ask,'' I said. ''And, of course, people assume I need it, which is kind of humiliating.''
''Not as humiliating as needing it even though you have a partner,'' Jessica responded.
Jessica isn't one of the condescending types, but I gravitated toward single-parent friends after Skuli was born. We were the ones who always dropped our children late at school and got stern looks from the teachers. We took our children to cocktail parties and readings because it was either that or we couldn't go. The single mothers I knew had scuffed shoes, and our roots were grown out from too much time between hair appointments.
We were superficially bedraggled but fundamentally sturdy. We were a crew of single mothers (and fathers) who had escaped bad relationships, started businesses, gone back to school, all while taking care of our children mostly by ourselves. And we shared a common currency: a bracing combination of independence and terror.
I felt lonely on occasions like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. But the other days I felt this magical self-reliance combined with an interdependence that wedded me to the world.
Heading into the subway one day, I was struggling with getting Skuli in his stroller, along with my heavy bags, down the stairs, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a thuggish-looking teenager walking toward me with a menacingly blank look on his face and his pants drooped. He leaned over, picked up my stroller and, without a word, carried Skuli down the two flights of stairs to the subway platform. I sputtered a thank you. He looked me in the eye and said in a soft voice, ''I was raised by a single mom, ma'am.''
My friend Amy was raised by a single mother. When she turned 30, her friends made a book for her, each of us taking a page to extol her work ethic, dance ability and generosity.
Her mother's page had a snapshot of the two of them taken when Amy was about 5 and her mother, Karen, was in her early 20s, Karen pointing at a flower in front of them and Amy pointing up and away to something Karen can't even see. In the caption, Karen wrote that it wasn't the most flattering photo of the two of them, but it was a good example of their relationship. She finished with the lines, ''We make a good team -- we've been a good team.''
The fact that her mother repeated the phrase slayed me, but I was most struck by seeing my tough, confident, sunny friend cry as she read the words. Like the rest of us single mothers, and those who have been raised by them, Amy knew the joy, beauty and hard-earned satisfaction of being a good team.
And we also knew its limitations. Days before that awful moment at J.F.K. when my car wouldn't start, Skuli and I had been visiting my cousins at their lake cabin in Minnesota. Their house was crawling with children, and my cousin and her husband appeared to have an attractive, invitingly healthy relationship.
The children swam and hunted for minnows and played with toy cars. And when it was time to leave, Skuli threw himself on the ground and cried: ''No, I won't go! I belong here.''
He had done the same thing a few weeks earlier at Amy's house, which had the same appealing constellation of happy and fun parents, cool toys and siblings. There was something about the joviality and regularity of those homes that he missed in his own life -- or it just felt right in some meaningful way that his 3-year-old self needed to assert.
To me, it hurt, because I knew I belonged with him but I didn't belong there, and I wanted him to believe, as I did, that we were lucky that things had worked out as they did, that our life together was unique and wonderful.
''BE selfish.'' That phrase echoed in my brain. But what did it mean? Was it selfish to stay a unit of two, because Skuli would have to shoulder the burdens of my aging alone? Or was it selfish to have a love life when I had a young child who needed me? I could see it both ways and many more.
It may have been just a coincidence, but after that conversation in which Sara Jane's mother told me to ''Be selfish,'' I began dating again, and before long, I met the man who would become the father of my second child. And, later, he would become my husband.
Skuli has thrived in our nuclear family, which is stricter and more constant than what he knew before. I wonder sometimes if he even remembers our former way of being. Will he know to help a struggling mother with her stroller in 10 years?
''We don't spend as much time together,'' Skuli said to me one day while walking home from school. We were holding hands, and he had been telling me about his life in an alternative universe he calls Boneland. ''You spend a lot of time with Michael now.''
I squeezed his hand.
''Remember when we were just the two of us?'' Skuli asked, ''and we'd sleep together in the same bed?''
''I do remember,'' I said. ''We make a good team, Skuli.''
We've been a good team.

HEADLINE: Seeing Productivity as a Volatile Number

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Sad Statistic That Trumps the Others'' (Economic View, Aug. 21), which described the decline in economic growth: 
Although labor productivity is an important indicator of an economy's long-term health, Tyler Cowen should be more cautious in his analysis of a short-term slowdown.
Quarterly labor productivity statistics are historically highly volatile, and often move in the opposite direction to the rest of the economy.
For example, in the second quarter of 2009, while still in the grip of the Great Recession, nonfarm business labor productivity was 8.0 percent, a five-year high. It was negative for two consecutive quarters in both 1993 and in 1994, which was a period of robust economic growth.
One could take the view of the author that the recent slowdown is an indication of more malaise ahead, or one could argue that it's an indication that economic conditions are starting to improve. Hungry for some silver linings, I'll choose the latter.

HEADLINE: Shortchanging Students

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
Students are heading to class again, and it is not a happy return. By the end of next week, nearly 50 million children will be back in their schools, many of which have been devastated by state fiscal policies that have worsened the effects of the recession. 
A new analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group, shows that nearly half of the states have made significant cuts in support for public education, resulting in fewer teachers, larger classes, shorter school days and program cancellations -- and generally undermining the academic progress that many states have made in recent years.
According to the study, spending has been cut by $542 per pupil in Florida, $530 in Arizona, $400 in Ohio and $347 in Colorado. It also says that Texas eliminated state support for pre-K programs that serve around 100,000 children, most of them at risk. Several states could have cushioned the blow by dipping into their rainy-day funds but refused to do so.
The wise approach would have been to draw down reserves and raise taxes to meet the shortfalls, but only a few states took that route. Incredibly, a dozen states actually compounded revenue problems by reducing taxes. Instead of spurring growth, as tax-cut advocates claimed, this move will produce another round of cuts and layoffs.
This could be dire for schools generally, and especially harmful to initiatives that were meant to improve education for the poorest children. To avert long-term disaster, states need to take a sensible, balanced approach, leavening budget cuts with revenue increases.

HEADLINE: Broad Ripples From a PAC On Tort Reform

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the managing editor at The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.
Texans for Lawsuit Reform is the biggest and richest tort reform group in the state. No surprise there. But as its political action committee has become the dominant financial engine for legislative races, it has helped create a Legislature that's not only more conservative about legal issues, but more conservative, period.
For a good long while, T.L.R.'s money tended to push out Democrats who, when considering civil justice issues, tended to vote with the state's trial lawyers. The battlefields changed over the years, from trucking deregulation to workers' compensation insurance reform, through the political campaigns that swung the Texas Supreme Court from a nine-member Democratic panel beholden to the plaintiffs bar to a nine-member Republican panel beholden to T.L.R. and like-minded people and groups. 
In the mid-1990s, T.L.R. became a powerhouse, overshadowing older business groups and interests. When George W. Bush ran for governor in 1994, one of the four planks in his platform was tort reform. When he took office in 1995, he and the Legislature rewrote some of the state's basic civil laws, changing the economics of suing for civil damages in Texas and putting some serious hurt on the trial lawyers on the other side.
Not all of that was about civil justice. The Texas Trial Lawyers Association and, individually, some of the state's wealthiest trial lawyers, were the dominant financial force on the Democratic side of the political ledger. (The Texas Trial Lawyers Association is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) What tort reform did in the courts was relatively easy to see, with this law limiting liability, and that one changing the rules on who was liable for what, and another one setting new rules on where and when lawsuits could be filed.
The changes in politics weren't as obvious. They weren't written into law. No legislative hearings -- or, for that matter, court hearings -- were held.
But as tort reform became a politically popular issue and T.L.R. rose in power, it started crowding out Democrats backed by the trial lawyers. And the Republicans who replaced them have been more conservative on a variety of issues, including tort reform, immigration and taxation.
Texas Democrats are in the political wilderness now. They haven't won a statewide election since 1994. Republicans dominate the Congressional delegation, and if their new redistricting maps hold up in court, they'll probably increase their dominance as the state gains four new seats in Congress. Republican senators outnumber Democrats 19 to 12, and the red shirts in the House outnumber the blue shirts 101 to 49.
T.L.R. has contributed to Democrats as well as to Republicans, but it has had an easier time finding Republicans who agree with it.
Richard J. Trabulsi Jr., T.L.R.'s president, is a Democrat in a group of leaders dominated by Republicans. He says the group studiously avoids getting into issues -- collateral issues -- that don't center on the legal system. And it tries to ignore party affiliations.
With the Republicans in control of the state government and of state politics, they're having some disagreements among themselves. It's hard to keep everyone in a big tent in politics -- just ask the Texas Democrats who dominated the scene for so long. Joe Straus is only the fourth Republican speaker of the House in state history. David Dewhurst is only the third Republican lieutenant governor. Rick Perry is only the fifth Republican governor.
T.L.R. hasn't made its choices on who will get its financial and political support in the 2012 elections, but there are rumblings. Two Republican senators -- Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio and Chris Harris of Arlington -- could draw opposition from the group if T.L.R.-friendly Republicans choose to run against them. (Representative Rodney E. Anderson, Republican of Grand Prairie, has already said he'll challenge Mr. Harris.) Other Republican senators, like John J. Carona of Dallas and Robert L. Duncan of Lubbock, have periodically walked into the group's line of fire, and they'll both be on the ballot next year.
Changes in any of those seats could change the politics of the Texas Senate, even without partisan changes in any of them. It would make it more conservative, changing the legislative outcomes on issues that range far beyond tort reform, starting with the Senate's vote to replace the lieutenant governor should Mr. Dewhurst leave for higher office.
It might not be civil justice, but it's part of the package.

HEADLINE: Walking On Air

BYLINE: By JEFF GORDINIER

 BODY:
EVER since various dreamers on the West Side of Manhattan began to envision it, the High Line has signified New York's future: a glimpse of where the metropolis might go if people dreamed, and schemed, hard enough.
But few of those forward-thinkers could have predicted what's obvious now to anyone who goes for a stroll along the full length of this model of urban renewal on a weekday summer evening: The High Line is also nudging New York back into the past.
The scene along the elevated and meticulously landscaped walkway that stretches from Gansevoort Street to West 30th Street can feel like some Gotham Festival of the Lost Arts. As the sun slides down beyond the Hudson River and gives Barry Diller's curved white colossus a weirdly holy gleam, you're bound to encounter the lost art of the promenade, unhurried conversation, perhaps even someone using paper and pen to scribble free verse in a journal. 
Grace Wright, a Williams College student who has spent the summer interning at Marvel Comics, could be found doing just that on a breezy Thursday evening in August. ''This is a nice place to just sit and think,'' she said. She lounged on a bench, sketching observations in a notebook. ''It's kind of soothing. Have you seen the theater seating just to watch the traffic below?''
Ms. Wright grew up in Tennessee and said that she found something comforting, up on the High Line, in being surrounded by so much foliage. ''It reminds me of home because of all the tall grass,'' she said.
Were it not for the profusion of flip-flops, ear buds and artisanal ice pops, a walker in the city might wonder whether he had passed through a kind of time portal into, say, the 1880s.
''It's like a 19th-century bucolic stroll,'' said Andre Balazs, the entrepreneur and High Line pioneer whose Standard Hotel stands astride the lower end of the serpentine urban boardwalk like a superhero's lair. ''You can almost imagine people with parasols.''
There might be a picnic in progress, arranged like a scene from a Gilded Age novel.
''People actually do walk and converse,'' said Tom Colicchio, the chef, whose apartment on Horatio Street looks right out on the High Line and who helped put together the low-key cluster of food trucks and beer taps at the Lot, by the intersection of 30th Street and 10th Avenue. ''It brings you back. I don't know if it goes back to Edith Wharton, but at least to a time before cellphones.''
That portal, though, can quickly slam shut.
Were he to amble down a staircase from the High Line to the meatpacking district, the same walker might be inclined to think that he'd accidentally plunged naked into the ''Hot Tub Time Machine.''
What you find on the ground, especially at night, is not a hushed echo of 1880s New York but a garish blast of the 1980s. The pulse of the nightclubs and the pose of the designer boutiques seem to carry such a genetic imprint of the Nancy Reagan era that you half expect Tad Allagash of ''Bright Lights, Big City'' to come stumbling out of a black door, wiping white powder off the collar of his blazer, knocking over a few yards of velvet rope and shouting at the doormen.
''It's always been a nocturnal, bustling place,'' Mr. Balazs said. ''You used to pack the meat, now you pack the clubs. Interestingly enough, the hours of operation are not that dissimilar. And then it has this bucolic street, now, running down the middle of it, which couldn't be more New York or more charming.''
There are mornings when Scott Conant, the chef at Scarpetta, likes to amble from his apartment on 30th Street down to his restaurant on West 14th Street, tapping his BlackBerry. And there are Saturday evenings when, after a busy night at the restaurant, he has been known to grab a few bottles of wine with comrades and sit on a patio watching the roaring, tottering tides of meatpacking partiers until 1 or 2 a.m.
''It's like a carnival without the monkeys and the balloons,'' he said. ''Neither one is good or bad. I'm not in the business of judging people. They're just different. That's what city living is.''
It's all New York, of course, both the manic and the muted; the city thrives on opposition.
In the case of the High Line, though, what's striking is the immediate and intimate way in which two worlds clash, and the radically different ways in which upper and lower High Liners interpret the ethos of urban living.
In fact, that sense of bifurcated sensibilities was present long before anyone imagined that a blighted and abandoned stretch of train tracks might be ripe for transformation.
Dan Wood, who with his wife and partner, Amale Andraos, runs the Work Architecture Company, which conceived Diane Von Furstenberg's honeycomb-topped studio in the meatpacking district, remembers getting an opportunity to climb onto those tracks just as plans for the revitalization project were beginning to build momentum.
''Things got quieter,'' he recalled of that experience. ''The streets kind of disappeared, even though they were right there below you. The thing is, the High Line is not very high. It's like 15 feet high, so it's not going to totally remove you from the city, and yet it did even back then.''
Re-entry, following a few moments in that aerial refuge, could jangle the nerves. ''It was always a little bit of a shock to come down off of it,'' Mr. Wood said. ''Because you had been in this other world.''
Over the last decade or so, the jangling world below, in the streets of the meatpacking district, has evolved into something that feels like a nightly reality-show reunion tour that you're not sure you want to subject your soul to.
It's no oasis of calm. It's a blustering, woof-woofing, high-fiving, tanned, high-heels-on-cobblestones circus where Vin Diesel and Paris Hilton still seem to retain a stubborn sartorial influence.
''We're in the meatpacking,'' one club-hopper in a black dress bluntly instructed her khaki-clad male companion the other night. ''You gotta be cool.''
It's a point that seems open to debate.
''The crowd isn't cool,'' said Nick Quested, the owner of Goldcrest Films, which has an office in the neighborhood. ''Bottle service killed the New York club scene, and now it's just an ostentatious display of wealth. I preferred it when it was just Mars, the ultimate downtown hip-hop club, and Florent.''
Were you tempted to stretch the metaphor of the portal a bit further, you might draw a comparison to the two communities of the future that separately coexist in ''The Time Machine,'' the novel by H. G. Wells that was published in 1895. Above ground frolic the delicate and peaceful creatures known as Eloi; in the subterranean hollows are the industrious, aggressive and light-sensitive Morlocks. (In the novel, the Morlocks eat the Eloi. It hasn't yet come to that on the High Line.)
Removed from the rapid-fire, high-pitched energy that surrounds a packed magnet like, say, the Biergarten at the Standard, the pace on the pedestrian walkway itself, just a few steps away, can feel like a holistic expansion of the ''slow food'' movement: slow walking, slow talking, slow living.
Stand on the walkway near 20th Street and look east. There's a Corona billboard whose slogan -- ''Unplugged. Find your beach.'' -- seems to capture the mood (and sound and scent) when the High Line's dune-grassy vegetation is audibly swishing back and forth. Instead of lying back and staring at the water, visitors here sit in a viewing station above 10th Avenue and watch the cars float by, Ms. Wright said.
The tableau there is captured in exquisite detail by JaegerSloan, a downtown studio that has assembled design, video and photography projects for clients like projects for clients like the New York City Ballet, Samsung and the Ailey School. Approached by the architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro with the assignment of making a three-minute movie that captures a sense of walking along the High Line, the studio's partners, Doug Jaeger and Kristin Sloan, were stumped at first.
You can't walk the entire stretch of the High Line in three minutes. And you can't plow through the crowds with a video camera in your hand. The result would be blurry and jumbled.
Their solution was clever, albeit rudimentary: they mounted a digital camera to a wheelchair. ''It looked like the robot from 'Short Circuit,' '' Ms. Sloan said. They pushed their rolling eye along the High Line very patiently, clicking a slow, long-exposure shutter to capture the blur of people in motion.
''The entire journey from one end to the other took us eight hours,'' Mr. Jaeger said.
They wound up making three wheelchair runs. They saw runners at dawn, children on a scavenger hunt in the morning, Google employees enjoying an alfresco lunch. ''It was a gym,'' Mr. Jaeger said. ''Then it became a school. At nighttime it became a big dating scene, every bench had a couple on it about to make out.''
It's that thriving sense of community that suggests, to Mr. Balazs, that the very words High Line will eventually become international shorthand for a certain mode of urban reinvention. ''It's going to become so iconic that you'll get a pedestrian walkway in Boston or Berlin or Bangalore, and people will say that's the High Line of that city,'' he predicted.
But will each of these heavenly idylls come with a seething cauldron down below? And if not, will they be quite so appreciated?
''Yes, there's a great juxtaposition between the types of people that hang out in meatpacking on, let's say, a Friday night and the kinds of folks who will walk the High Line on a Monday morning, but it's nice that that juxtaposition exists,'' said Soraya Darabi, a founder of Foodspotting, the social networking site, and a frequent High Line perambulator. ''That's New York.'' If you've got a problem with cross-cultural friction, she said, ''then move back to the Midwest.''

HEADLINE: All Together Now

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
HOLD onto your hats and your wallets. Since the end of the cold war, the global system has been held together to a large degree by four critical ruling bargains. Today all four are coming unstuck at once and will need to be rebuilt. Whether and how that rebuilding happens -- beginning in the U.S. -- will determine a lot about what's in your wallet and whether your hat flies off.
Now let me say that in English: the European Union is cracking up. The Arab world is cracking up. China's growth model is under pressure and America's credit-driven capitalist model has suffered a warning heart attack and needs a total rethink. Recasting any one of these alone would be huge. Doing all four at once -- when the world has never been more interconnected -- is mind-boggling. We are again ''present at the creation'' -- but of what? 
Let's start with the Middle East, the world's oil tap. Libyans just joined Tunisians, Egyptians and Yemenis in ousting their dictator, while Syrians and Iranians hope to soon follow suit. In time, virtually every Middle East autocrat will be deposed or forced to share power. The old model can't hold. That model was based on kings and military dictators capturing the oil revenue, ensconcing themselves in power -- protected by well-financed armies and security services -- and buying off key segments of their populations. That lid has been blown off by an Arab youth bulge that today can see just how everyone else is living and is no longer ready to accept being behind, undereducated, unemployed, humiliated and powerless. But while this old Middle East system -- based on an iron fist and a fistful of petro-dollars holding together multiethnic/multireligious societies -- has broken down, it will take time for these societies to write their own social contracts for how to live together without an iron fist from above. Hope for the best, prepare for anything.
Farther north, it was a nice idea, this European Union and euro-zone: Let's have a monetary union and a common currency but let everyone run their own fiscal policy, as long as they swear to work and save like Germans. Alas, it was too good to be true. Large government welfare programs in some European countries, without the revenue to finance them from local production, eventually led to a piling up of sovereign debt -- mostly owed to European banks -- and then a lender revolt. The producer-savers in northern Europe are now drawing up a new deal with the overspenders -- the PIIGS: Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain. It is unlikely that the Germans would just break out of the European Union, since a good chunk of their exports go to those overspending, uncompetitive countries. Instead, the northern Europeans are trying to force stronger, rule-based discipline on the PIIGS. But how much more austerity can these countries absorb, especially if there are further social stresses from deeper recessions? More than Londoners will take to the streets. One way or another, the European Union is going to get smaller or tighter, but in the process it could go through a chaotic, world-shaking transition that is not priced into the market yet.
Going East, China has been relying on a model built on a deliberately undervalued currency and export-led growth, with low domestic consumption and high savings. This has allowed the Communist Party to sustain a unique bargain with its people: We give you jobs and rising standards of living, and you give us power. This bargain is now under threat. Persistent unemployment in China's American and European markets is making Beijing's undervalued-currency/low-consumption/high-export model less sustainable for the world. China also has to get rich before it gets old. It has to move from two parents saving for one kid, to one kid paying for the retirement of two parents. To do that, it has to move from an assembly-copying-manufacturing economy to a knowledge-services-innovation economy. This requires more freedom and rule of law, and you can already see mounting demands for it. Something has to give there.
As for America, we've thrived in recent decades with a credit-consumption-led economy, whereby we maintained a middle class by using more steroids (easy credit, subprime mortgages and construction work) and less muscle-building (education, skill-building and innovation). It's put us in a deep hole, and the only way to dig out now is a new, hybrid politics that mixes spending cuts, tax increases, tax reform and investments in infrastructure, education, research and production. But that mix is not the agenda of either party. Either our two parties find a way to collaborate in the center around this new hybrid politics, or a third party is going to emerge -- or we're stuck and the pain will just get worse.
When the world is experiencing so many wrenching changes at once -- with already high unemployment and weak economies -- the need for America, the most important pillar of all, to be rock solid is greater than ever. If we don't get our act together -- which will require collective action normally reserved for wartime -- we are not going to just be prolonging an American crisis, but feeding a global one.

HEADLINE: For the Cash of the Game: Scandals in big-time college football call for tough and expensive penalties

 BODY:
This month, 50 university presidents gathered in Indianapolis to address the cascading scandals in college football. They emerged with promises of reform and a few suggestions for raising academic standards and improving scholarships that, according to Pete Thamel, who has been covering this mess for The Times, ''will help clean up the polluted culture of college sports as much as throwing pennies in a fountain will stimulate the economy.''
The issue here is money. The game is awash in it: billion-dollar TV contracts for major conferences like the Big Ten, packed stadiums with fancy skyboxes, $5 million incomes for top-drawer coaches, wealthy alumni who demand winning teams. This money machine, in turn, demands a steady supply of talented players, and college boosters are all too ready to make under-the-table payments while officials look the other way. 
There have, of course, been scandals before, accompanied by pious promises of change. But this has been a particularly ugly stretch. Here are a just a few of the lowlights of the last 12 months.
Jim Tressel, Ohio State's wildly successful coach, was forced to resign for lying about whether his players sold team memorabilia. The University of Southern California was stripped of its national title for the 2004 season, and its star player, Reggie Bush, was forced to return the coveted Heisman Trophy because he accepted payments from two marketing agents. The father of last year's Heisman winner, Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, was found to have asked another university for $180,000 for his son's services.
Now comes a potentially epic scandal at the long-troubled football program at the University of Miami. On Aug. 18, Yahoo Sports said it had been told by a Miami booster, Nevin Shapiro, that between 2002 and 2010 he provided 72 athletes, mostly football players, with cash, cars, jewelry, prostitutes and other impermissible gifts.
Mr. Shapiro has been sentenced to 20 years for running a Ponzi scheme, but nobody has challenged his allegations. Donna Shalala, the university president, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association are investigating.
The latest Sports Illustrated urged Ms. Shalala, a cabinet member in the Clinton administration, to voluntarily shut her football program down -- a brave gesture, the magazine feels, that would send a message of resolve nationwide. It would be hugely costly not just for Miami but also for 12 other universities that have Miami on their schedules.
The investigations should be allowed to run their course, but the magazine is on to something -- namely, that the buck stops with presidents like Ms. Shalala, who control the N.C.A.A. and can make rules and penalties as tough as they want them to be. And the best way to fight the money culture is with penalties a money culture can appreciate.
Specifically, this would mean barring teams -- those that break recruiting rules or allow players to accept gifts -- from TV, which would be a huge hit for the universities and the conferences to which they belong. It also would mean denying offending teams bowl appearances for a minimum number of years and holding those $5 million coaches responsible for recruiting violations committed by any member of their staffs.
As long as a university can anticipate little more than a wrist slap -- even one that stings, like titles forfeited, or athletic scholarships reduced -- the rewards of bending the rules to get good athletes who can win games will greatly outweigh the risks of getting caught.

HEADLINE: Dr. King's Dreams: He fought for equality and economic justice for all Americans

 BODY:
The new Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, set between those for Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln in Washington, commemorates Dr. King's quest to fulfill the American dream of equality for all. Jefferson defined it, Lincoln fought for it, and Dr. King acted out of the conviction that ''our nation is challenged to realize'' it. 
Until Hurricane Irene intervened, the memorial was to be dedicated on Sunday on the anniversary of his 1963 ''I Have a Dream'' speech. Before that speech, few would have imagined the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Yet Dr. King, 34 years old at the time, lifted the sights of the 250,000 people in the crowd, predicting America's redemption from its history of racial oppression and moving leaders to face that searing injustice.
The ''Dream'' speech came at the ''March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.'' In the following years, until he was assassinated in 1968, Dr. King focused primarily on the need for economic justice and the grim problem of poverty that remains so significant for all races today.
He moved to a Chicago slum, and in the tradition of Martin Luther, who nailed to a door the views that sparked the Protestant Reformation, he placed demands on the City Hall door: for unions to account for their hiring, for banks to adopt fair mortgage policies, for the city housing authority to increase the supply of low-cost housing, and for other powerful institutions to do their parts.
He later proposed a ''Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged,'' calling on government to spend $100 billion over the course of a decade (the equivalent of $650 billion now) on assistance for housing, employment and education. The Chicago campaign of peaceful protests was met by angry mobs -- hurling rocks and shouting slurs. The effort sputtered.
In a sermon on Christmas Eve in 1967, Dr. King described himself as a victim of ''blasted hopes.'' He declared, ''I still have a dream that one day the idle industries of Appalachia will be revitalized, and the empty stomachs of Mississippi will be filled, and brotherhood will be more than a few words at the end of a prayer, but rather the first order of business on every legislative agenda.'' The abiding chasm between America's haves and have-nots reminds us that Dr. King was a true prophet, and of our responsibility to fight for justice in all its forms.

HEADLINE: Financial News for the Rest of Us

BYLINE: By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE

 BODY:
WILL readers of The New York Times in print get less because The Times must invest to compete for readers and advertisers in the digital medium?
The DealBook business news product may offer an early indication. DealBook, which was greatly expanded last fall, is a prominent presence on NYTimes.com, offering up-to-the-minute news and trivia about Wall Street deals, regulatory issues, venture capital and personalities. In print, meanwhile, it owns a half-page inside Business Day four days a week -- a much lower profile than online.
DealBook was created 10 years ago by Andrew Ross Sorkin as an e-mail newsletter, but as Sorkin's star rose because of his mergers-and-acquisitions scoops, DealBook became a centerpiece of The Times's Wall Street coverage. 
The expansion last November added 11 journalists, swelling the DealBook staff to 15, a large investment for a newspaper company in today's straitened circumstances. To celebrate, The Times had a party at the Four Seasons restaurant that was attended by Wall Street's elite, some of them representing charter advertisers like Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital.
But the new DealBook has a strangely precrash feel to it.
We can all remember what things were like before 2008: Wall Street was king, New York was the center of the financial universe, the titans of finance were gods. DealBook's offerings remain closely aligned with that paradigm, even though the titans have lost their shine, markets have been shifting away from New York, and the postcrash world is determined far more than before by China and the broader global economy.
Despite this shift, DealBook's reporting is about deals, hedge fund news and the doings of people on the Street. We read about George Soros's problems with his girlfriend, elevator conversations overheard at Goldman Sachs, and prospects for a ''Wall Street Wives'' reality TV show.
Leon D. Black, the superrich head of Apollo Global Management, staged an over-the-top 60th birthday party for himself in the Hamptons, and on Aug. 18 DealBook chronicled it microscopically. The article included an element of finger-wagging about the excesses involved but still made sure that no detail-hungry, celebrity-starved reader was left behind.
It's true that, within DealBook's range of targeted topics, it delivers some hard-hitting material. And when big news in the deal world breaks, DealBook serves as a ''real-time SWAT team,'' in Mr. Sorkin's words. Its coverage Aug. 15 of Google's bid to acquire Motorola was wall to wall and, no question, served a broad readership's desire to understand what this might mean for Google and its quest to exploit mobile technology.
A week before that, though, when the world economic system shuddered and stock markets dropped, I was left wondering whether The Times should have spent its money not on expanding DealBook but on enlarging its stable of journalists aimed at the wider subjects of international banks and sovereign debt.
New signs of systemic disease emerged that week, particularly in Europe, where the European Central Bank rushed to shore up Italian sovereign debt. Although DealBook ran a couple of columns calling attention to this threat, the developments made clearer that this subject requires in-depth investigating of a complex ecosystem whose inner workings may be just as opaque as the derivatives-larded American banking network that imploded in 2008.
Dean Starkman, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who runs the blog The Audit for The Columbia Journalism Review, shares my concerns that DealBook, while it helps The Times build a niche audience online, isn't designed to address broader issues like this.
''DealBook is a symptom of, as well as a cause of, narrowing of the frames of business news,'' he said. ''What DealBook does is approach business and finance strictly from an investor's perspective. This is useful, of course, and has deep roots in business press DNA. But it is not public interest journalism.''
Rather, he added, this kind of journalism is good at scoops and incremental news developments. What readers require to understand deep crises like European debt is something else. ''Somebody is going to have to step up and look at things systemically,'' he said. ''If the financial crisis has taught us anything it is that the investor's perspective of looking at finance is too narrow.''
The Times's DealBook expansion is a strategy for capturing digital readers interested in this narrowly defined perspective. Larry Ingrassia, the Business Day editor, told me that while in print The Times can succeed by broadly addressing ''the five or 10 most important things you need to know,'' the Web demands narrower and deeper offerings.
''If we don't provide readers with some specialized content that informs them in an area where they might have a narrower and high interest,'' he said, ''somebody else is going to do it.''
The Times sacrificed no existing resources when it decided to enlarge DealBook, Mr. Ingrassia emphasized. Granting that, I worry that the investment meant forgoing an opportunity to strengthen reporting elsewhere.
One area in need now, in the business news category, is clearly the deepening hole in Europe. In slow motion, the weaker states of the European Union are sliding toward insolvency and the European banks, which hold their debt, are being pulled along.
Mr. Ingrassia said he didn't think The Times's coverage ''has wanted from the lack of people,'' and I would agree that Business Day, with support from foreign desk and International Herald Tribune reporters, has done a creditable job of covering developments in the crisis, especially the political angles relating to Europe's leaders. Yet much remains invisible to interested readers.
Just as the 2008 crisis was largely explained after the fact by The Times and other publications, the current situation feels like a replay in which we may learn only later how the tumbling dominoes were arrayed. Perhaps most important to Times readers, little is being written about the consequences that a catastrophic event in Europe could have on the United States and the world economy.
Perhaps The Times will yet jump in and expose the linkages between Europe's institutions and the American economy and markets -- before the other shoe drops. But the focus of DealBook, tied as it is to The Times's online strategy, isn't pointed in that direction. And I have to wonder whether investing in this kind of journalism, even if it had meant forgoing DealBook's granular devotion to its niche, wouldn't have better served the public.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Curing the Health System

 BODY:
A letter on Wednesday urging a single-payer health plan, rather than individual mandates, set off an outpouring of reaction.
The Letter
To the Editor:
In ''Will Health Care Reform Survive the Courts?'' (State of Play, Sunday Review, Aug. 21), Philip M. Boffey states that ''reforms would work far less well without an individual mandate'' that requires citizens to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.
I disagree. Health care reform could provide better care at less cost by replacing individual mandates with a single-payer national health care plan financed by taxes. Congress's power to mandate purchase of private products sold at a profit is disputable, but Congress's power to tax is not.
Other industrialized countries have national health plans providing care to more citizens at less cost with better outcomes than our system. And they don't use mandates that allow insurers to charge different prices for different people. 
These health care systems have three common properties: public subsidies ensure that everyone has access to care regardless of health, wealth or employment; primary care is encouraged; and publicly accountable, transparent, not-for-profit agencies transfer funds from patient to provider.
There is no need to experiment with mandates. Convert our current health care system into a national health plan.
SAMUEL METZ Portland, Ore., Aug. 21, 2011
The writer, an anesthesiologist, is a founding member of Mad as Hell Doctors, which advocates a single-payer system.
Readers React
Dr. Metz is spot on with his advocacy of a single-payer plan instead of the individual mandate.
Sadly, despite the success of Medicare -- a single-payer system that politicians tamper with at their peril -- the ''just say no'' climate in Washington, fostered by Republicans who place ideology over country, took that option off the table and left us with an alternative that not only raises legal questions but also fails to address the real threat: the escalating costs of health care.
That said, the health care plan that the politicians have given us, which extends protection to millions of uninsured, is better than no plan at all.
After decades of talking about reform, we finally have a plan in place. With luck, a day will come when the political will for a single-payer system exists.
Until then, let's do our best to make the plan we have work.
JAY N. FELDMAN Port Washington, N.Y., Aug. 24, 2011
Dr. Metz is right that a single-payer system would be better than an individual mandate. But he does not mention that Medicare, although it is a single-payer, tax-supported system, still cannot control costs and will soon be bankrupt. A national health plan that controls costs needs to reform the way doctors are paid and are organized in practice.
This is how doctors, if they are really ''mad as hell,'' could help. They should join salaried multispecialty, not-for-profit group practices that can accept capitated prepayment for comprehensive care instead of fee for service, and can provide good, cost-effective care that supports primary-care doctors working in close collaboration with specialists.
ARNOLD S. RELMAN Cambridge, Mass., Aug. 24, 2011
The writer, a physician, is professor emeritus of medicine and of social medicine at Harvard Medical School and a former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine.
Dr. Metz's call for single-payer national health care imposes costs on taxpayers rather than directly on those being served. Patients are not charged more for services they value the most or are more costly to provide. Tax bills simply rise in sync with something else like income, property or sales.
It takes no leap of faith to understand how this will affect demand for health care. Anyone who has dined at a fixed-cost food buffet knows the outcome of not directing price with food portions.
It is tempting to believe that government will fairly and efficiently make these choices for us, but experience suggests otherwise. Dr. Metz appears to anticipate this problem given his suggestion that Congress's power to tax is indisputable and so government will predictably raise taxes to pay for growing demand for health care.
MICHAEL L. MARLOW San Luis Obispo, Calif., Aug. 25, 2011
The writer is a professor of economics at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
Here are my suggestions:
First, impose a three-year moratorium on increases in health care costs.
Second, dissolve Medicare and Medicaid and use that money to provide for universal coverage for the less fortunate.
Third, require every person to participate.
Fourth, every participant would be required to have a yearly physical, major medical catastrophic insurance and a health care savings account to provide for a large deductible.
The yearly physical would start the process of creating a universal electronic patient record. Furthermore, the physical would be an attractive revenue stream for doctors in primary-care practices. The yearly physical and universal coverage would make medicine more prevention-oriented.
EDWARD L. BYRD Atlanta, Aug. 24, 2011
We need Dr. Metz to keep the flame of national health insurance alive until this country is ready to embrace it as the most cost-effective way to provide coverage. But as Winston Churchill said, ''You can always count on Americans to do the right thing -- after they've tried everything else.''
The battle to pass the Affordable Care Act and the challenge to sustain it should make clear that national health insurance will not be given serious consideration by politicians for some time.
Our approach to health reform has desirable features, like elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions. An individual mandate is required to make health reform work.
Dr. Metz simply prefers another way to require all Americans to have coverage. More power to him. In the meantime, let's try the next best thing.
BRUCE KELLEY Minneapolis, Aug. 24, 2011
I am a young professional who is just starting out on my career path.
I have already been juggled among health care systems because of different schools and different jobs, and the experience was not fun. Recently, I was lucky enough to find employment that offers health insurance, but if I should lose my job, I would lose my health insurance. This doesn't make me feel secure. The individual mandate doesn't make me feel secure either. Health insurance does not equal health care.
I don't want to start paying into health insurance that I may lose because of powers beyond my control. With a single-payer system, you simply get enrolled into a public health insurance system. Through my taxes, I would be making an investment in my health future that would be there whether I lost my job or not. Now that would make me feel secure.
MOLLY TAVELLA Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., Aug. 24, 2011
The writer is the education and outreach coordinator for Physicians for a National Health Program California.
Of course Dr. Metz is correct that a single-payer system -- comparable to that used in a number of other countries -- would be both beneficial and less expensive than the privately skewed, hodgepodge system we have now. Unfortunately, the lack of political maturity in this country means that arguing that other societies have better ideas than we do is counterproductive, since the myth of American exceptionalism is more important than actually providing better health care while saving money in the process.
ALAN POSNER East Lansing, Mich., Aug. 24, 2011
Dr. Metz presents a compelling argument in support of a single-payer plan. He cites the experience of other countries to show that such a system provides better health outcomes at lower cost. Our own experience shows that Medicare requires only about 3 percent for administrative costs, as opposed to 29 percent for private health insurance.
Alas, these arguments are fated to fall on deaf ears. Between 2006 and 2009, the health sector spent $1.7 billion lobbying Congress and federal agencies. No wonder our government can't hear the rest of us!
SHERMAN C. STEIN Philadelphia, Aug. 24, 2011
The writer is a clinical professor of neurosurgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
Let me add some data to support Dr. Metz's proposal. The evidence is overwhelming. The cost of health care per person in other industrialized countries is on average less than half of that in the United States. If we spent as much per person as the other countries do, we would save $1.3 trillion every year.
One characteristic of those countries' health care is that there is a single entity that runs the system. This ensures uniform and minimal overhead and compliance costs, and provides guidance and regulation for the medical effectiveness of the various procedures.
We can learn much from other countries. The question is whether we are mature enough to do so.
LEONARD S. CHARLAP Princeton, N.J., Aug. 24, 2011
The Writer Responds
I thank these readers for their thoughtful comments.
Dr. Stein notes that private insurance overhead is many times higher than Medicare's. Most economists agree. Including the cost to providers to collect from insurance companies nearly doubles the difference.
This administrative excess is more than sufficient to finance comprehensive health care for every American. Nearly 25 state and national studies of single-payer plans corroborate this.
Although single payer enables universal care without additional cost, Dr. Relman notes that it will not slow cost increases. He proposes a salaried physician model to replace fee for service. There is much evidence in support.
The salaried physicians in the Department of Veterans Affairs medical system care for America's sickest patients at the lowest cost with the best outcomes and highest patient satisfaction of any system in the country. Clearly, when financial pressures are removed, physicians provide superb care.
Mr. Marlow is only partly correct. In countries with national health plans, patients see their physicians more frequently than we do and spend more days per year in the hospital. Despite this increased access to care, these nations spend half as much as we do, and their populations are healthier. Presumably, unlimited access to inexpensive primary care reduces consumption of more expensive, more complex intensive care.
Ms. Tavella makes two important points. First, an insurance policy is no guarantee of health care. Most personal bankruptcies in America are precipitated by medical crises in families with health insurance when the crisis began.
Second, when the young, healthy and employed make health care payments in excess of what they consume, this is not a loss. It is an investment in future care when they are old, sick and retired.
Messrs. Feldman, Kelley, Posner and Charlap mourn our inability to achieve single-payer health care despite its obvious financial advantages. But our obstacle is not political, but moral. Many Americans believe that it is immoral to pay for other people's care, even if doing so reduces their own costs. Others believe that it is immoral to pay taxes for health care, even if doing so protects their family from illness and financial catastrophe. We cannot argue morality, but we can present the health and financial consequences of allowing these morals to drive health care policy.
American single-payer systems include the Department of Veterans Affairs system; the Indian Health Service; Tri-Care, the military health plan; Taft-Hartley multiemployer plans; and Medicaid and Medicare. Any of these systems could be improved and expanded to cover all Americans.
Single-payer health care is America's health care solution to America's health problem.

HEADLINE: Ugly? You May Have a Case

BYLINE: By DANIEL S. HAMERMESH

 BODY:
Daniel S. Hamermesh, a professor of economics at the University of Texas, Austin, is the author of ''Beauty Pays,'' published this month.
BEING good-looking is useful in so many ways.
In addition to whatever personal pleasure it gives you, being attractive also helps you earn more money, find a higher-earning spouse (and one who looks better, too!) and get better deals on mortgages. Each of these facts has been demonstrated over the past 20 years by many economists and other researchers. The effects are not small: one study showed that an American worker who was among the bottom one-seventh in looks, as assessed by randomly chosen observers, earned 10 to 15 percent less per year than a similar worker whose looks were assessed in the top one-third -- a lifetime difference, in a typical case, of about $230,000.
Beauty is as much an issue for men as for women. While extensive research shows that women's looks have bigger impacts in the market for mates, another large group of studies demonstrates that men's looks have bigger impacts on the job. 
Why this disparate treatment of looks in so many areas of life? It's a matter of simple prejudice. Most of us, regardless of our professed attitudes, prefer as customers to buy from better-looking salespeople, as jurors to listen to better-looking attorneys, as voters to be led by better-looking politicians, as students to learn from better-looking professors. This is not a matter of evil employers' refusing to hire the ugly: in our roles as workers, customers and potential lovers we are all responsible for these effects.
How could we remedy this injustice? With all the gains to being good-looking, you would think that more people would get plastic surgery or makeovers to improve their looks. Many of us do all those things, but as studies have shown, such refinements make only small differences in our beauty. All that spending may make us feel better, but it doesn't help us much in getting a better job or a more desirable mate.
A more radical solution may be needed: why not offer legal protections to the ugly, as we do with racial, ethnic and religious minorities, women and handicapped individuals?
We actually already do offer such protections in a few places, including in some jurisdictions in California, and in the District of Columbia, where discriminatory treatment based on looks in hiring, promotions, housing and other areas is prohibited. Ugliness could be protected generally in the United States by small extensions of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Ugly people could be allowed to seek help from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and other agencies in overcoming the effects of discrimination. We could even have affirmative-action programs for the ugly.
The mechanics of legislating this kind of protection are not as difficult as you might think. You might argue that people can't be classified by their looks -- that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That aphorism is correct in one sense: if asked who is the most beautiful person in a group of beautiful people, you and I might well have different answers. But when it comes to differentiating classes of attractiveness, we all view beauty similarly: someone whom you consider good-looking will be viewed similarly by most others; someone you consider ugly will be viewed as ugly by most others. In one study, more than half of a group of people were assessed identically by each of two observers using a five-point scale; and very few assessments differed by more than one point.
For purposes of administering a law, we surely could agree on who is truly ugly, perhaps the worst-looking 1 or 2 percent of the population. The difficulties in classification are little greater than those faced in deciding who qualifies for protection on grounds of disabilities that limit the activities of daily life, as shown by conflicting decisions in numerous legal cases involving obesity.
There are other possible objections. ''Ugliness'' is not a personal trait that many people choose to embrace; those whom we classify as protected might not be willing to admit that they are ugly. But with the chance of obtaining extra pay and promotions amounting to $230,000 in lost lifetime earnings, there's a large enough incentive to do so. Bringing anti-discrimination lawsuits is also costly, and few potential plaintiffs could afford to do so. But many attorneys would be willing to organize classes of plaintiffs to overcome these costs, just as they now do in racial-discrimination and other lawsuits.
Economic arguments for protecting the ugly are as strong as those for protecting some groups currently covered by legislation. So why not go ahead and expand protection to the looks-challenged? There's one legitimate concern. With increasingly tight limits on government resources, expanding rights to yet another protected group would reduce protection for groups that have commanded our legislative and other attention for over 50 years.
We face a trade-off: ignore a deserving group of citizens, or help them but limit help available for other groups. Even though I myself have demonstrated the disadvantages of ugliness in 20 years of research, I nonetheless would hate to see anything that might reduce assistance to groups now aided by protective legislation.
You might reasonably disagree and argue for protecting all deserving groups. Either way, you shouldn't be surprised to see the United States heading toward this new legal frontier.

HEADLINE: Regulators Focus Eye On the Sale Of KUSF

BYLINE: By REYHAN HARMANCI. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
When KDFC, the popular commercial classical radio station, was sold to the University of Southern California in January and bumped down to 90.3, the nonprofit end of the dial, hundreds of thousands of classical music fans lost the ability to hear the station's offerings, thanks to the downgraded signal strength.
But that was not the only local effect of the sale. For over three decades, 90.3 had been home to the much-loved University of San Francisco radio station KUSF, which was yanked off the airwaves to make room for KDFC when U.S.F. sold its license to U.S.C. for $3.75 million. 
In the days and months after the abrupt sale, fans of KUSF gathered support and started an ad-hoc streaming service called KUSF-in-Exile.
But even with the public interest, most people thought the Federal Communications Commission would approve the sale; that regulatory agency rarely blocks transactions and makes it a point not to weigh in on the content of the programming.
Now, though, more than six months after KUSF went off the air, that easy approval is not such a sure bet.
In late June, the commission sent an unusual ''letter of inquiry'' to U.S.F. and to the Classical Public Radio Network, the nonprofit largely owned by U.S.C. that was set up to manage the now-public KDFC. Media observers speculate that the move may signal that the F.C.C. will use the KUSF situation as an occasion to sharpen regulation of national noncommercial radio.
Brenda Barnes, president of U.S.C. Radio, called the 15-question letter ''unprecedented.'' John Crigler, a communications lawyer in Washington, said, ''Whatever the F.C.C. decides will have some kind of ramification for every noncommercial station going forward.'' The machinations inside the agency are difficult to discern. There is no set time for the commission to make a ruling and no clear understanding about what its members are trying to determine in parsing the details of the KUSF sale.
The agency declined to comment on the pending case.
All that can be ascertained about its position is in the letter, which those from all sides of the issue are scrutinizing with Talmudic zeal.
''The key there is that this letter came out of the media bureau,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''That signals to me that they are looking at a policy issue. What that issue is, we don't know.''
The letter included several requests. It asked for a year's worth of e-mails between the parties related to the sale and for information relating to the operating agreements between the two universities, among other materials.
Friends of KUSF, the group that has raised about $40,000 to legally contest the sale, had previously submitted documents to the commission claiming that U.S.F. had destroyed the station's studios, and could not oversee or originate the broadcast during the transition period before agency approval, as F.C.C. rules dictate.
In early August, the universities replied to the letter of inquiry, dismissing concerns about the state of the KUSF studio and refusing to submit the requested e-mails.
In a strong rebuttal, two lawyers for Friends of KUSF, Alan Korn and Peter Franck, called the answers to the agency's questions ''deceptive.'' The group has called for a hearing. It hopes the F.C.C. will expand its oversight of noncommercial radio transactions, which, thanks to a bad economy and big audiences for public radio, have been a booming market.
Universities like U.S.F., Vanderbilt and Rice are selling their stations, turning their homegrown programming over to National Public Radio or nonprofits like KUSC, which owns a network of stations in California.
''It basically comes down to media consolidation,'' said Tracy Rosenberg, executive director of Media Alliance, a media watchdog based in the Bay Area that drafted a letter in July asking the F.C.C. to hold an inquiry on noncommercial-radio sales. Thirty other media and music organizations also signed the letter.
''It's not only KUSF -- it's an ongoing problem, and it's going to get worse,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''I hope that U.S.F. is a test case for examining these issues.''

HEADLINE: When the Veterinarian Comes to Your Pet

 BODY:
Besides the bleak landscape of boarded-up houses and empty lots, residents of economically struggling Chicago neighborhoods must contend with thousands of stray pets.
The feral dogs and cats roam neighborhoods throughout the city looking for food and shelter. Some lucky ones may be candidates for adoption; others are subject to impoundment or even euthanasia. 
Pet overpopulation is a particular problem in areas where residents have trouble paying for veterinary care.
Last year, the city took in about 17,500 dogs and cats, according to Brad Powers, assistant to the executive director at Chicago's Animal Care and Control. He said most of the stray cats came from the South and Southwest Sides and most of the stray dogs from the West Side.
Now a team of veterinarians has begun to visit those low-income neighborhoods every Sunday to lessen the financial burden on pet owners and combat the proliferation of abandoned animals. The GusMobile, started by PAWS Chicago, a no-kill humane organization, is a veterinary clinic inside a state-of-the-art van. A doctor spays, neuters and administers vaccinations to dogs and cats free of charge to clients who receive Medicaid.
''So when you're loading your car with groceries, someone's having a surgery,'' said Paula Fasseas, founder of PAWS Chicago, a nonprofit in Lincoln Park that also operates a free and low-cost clinic in Little Village.
After surgery, the animals are given time to recover in the van's cages and are monitored for side effects from the anesthesia. The mobile clinic, the only one of its kind in the city, has been in operation since May.
''There's more domestic animals in the city than people to take care of them,'' said Mr. Powers. ''I think it's a wonderful service that PAWS offers.'' He said that thanks to free and low-cost spaying and neutering services, the number of stray pets has dropped steadily in recent years.
On a recent stormy Sunday morning, four patient dog owners were lined up outside the GusMobile in a shopping center parking lot. Currently working in the Roseland neighborhood on the Far South Side, the mobile unit operators intend to visit other areas where residents cannot afford veterinary services.
''There are plenty of stray cats around my neighborhood,'' said Marcella Smith, who was waiting for her cat to have surgery in Roseland. She said she had heard about the GusMobile from her neighbor.
Kathy Krmpotich, a South Side resident who was waiting for her three cats to undergo surgery, said she fed the many feral animals in her neighborhood.
''I'm the crazy nut lady on the block who feeds the stray cats,'' Ms. Krmpotich said.
Leslie Gellatly, a Wauconda veterinarian, regularly staffs the van. ''Everyone loves animals,'' she said as she cleaned off a metal exam table. ''If they know the problem, they'll get involved.''
Jessica Von Waldau, another veterinarian, said she performed surgeries at a much faster pace than was usual in private practice. ''I used to see 10 patients a day; now it feels more like 50,'' she said, but added that the workload was not a problem.
''Actually, we kind of have fun here,'' she said.
